font used: PT serif

first task (logo):

1) one for a twitter dp (an A (with 'rticulyze' being relatively small), featuring red-brown and tea-green mainly )
2) a full logo ("Articulyze"; i would like to feature both tea-green and red-brown in the logo)
3) one for the website navbar / other website parts ~ a more compact version of the logo (PNG - no background)

second task (website background): 

1) the algorithim analyzes winners of the pulitzer prize for international journalism and generates a similairty score for any article we feed it using machine learning. i think it would be cool to have one background be an image of just a bunch of text from these pulitzer winning articles together. in this folder is an image where I attempt to do that, but I am sure it can be done better.
2) a gif of text moving around the logo, with the logo expanding and contracting. (I have included a sketch of what I imagine this will look like in this folder). i want it to fill the about screen (120% page height). it has to be a continuous gif (ie it can loop forever) so it is not annoying to look at.

third task:

http://interactive.unocha.org/publication/globalhumanitarianoverview/ if you go to this link, you will see a list of 21 countries under humanitarian response plans. I need an image (that i will use as a button on the website) for each of them, featuring a map and the country's name (country's name should be prominent). there should be no deatils on the map - just an outline. should be square ideally (width = height)
