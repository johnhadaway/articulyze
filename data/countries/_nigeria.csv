0,nigeria,"High jumper Mike Edwards had committed his future to Nigeria and is in Australia to represent the country before a shock IAAF decision stopping him from doing so. In this interview, he tells Idris Adesina why he snubbed Britain for Nigeria

As the current British high jump champion, why did you honour the Nigerian invite?

I wanted to break the cycle and lead the way for Nigeria’s future high jumpers and athletes in general.

What are your targets competing for Nigeria?

My targets are to keep raising the bar on and off the track.

You are also of Jamaican origin. Why did you not choose Jamaica, a renowned athletic nation, over Nigeria?

Nigeria is my roots. That’s where I’m from, hence the reason to represent Nigeria.

What was the attraction to Nigeria for you?

The love from the community right from the beginning has been incredible and it definitely helped my decision.

How much of Nigeria do you know before you decided to compete for Nigeria?

The only thing I knew was that if I didn’t switch to Nigeria it would be a huge regret.

You have a cigar company. But cigar and sports do not mix. Why did you opt for such business as a popular sportsperson?

I chose cigar due to longevity. I’m not going to be a sportsperson forever and I will have a life after sports.

What was growing up like?

Growing up was adventurous, I was raised in Moss Side an inner city of Manchester before moving to Florida. I learned to adapt quickly.

Did you encounter racism?

Yes of course. I’m a black man in Britain.

Did you always want to become an athlete?

Yes, from as long as I could remember I’ve wanted to become a professional sportsperson. I just didn’t know what sport.

How challenging was it becoming the current British champion? What was the journey like?

The road started in 2014, I finished last place at that year’s British Indoor Championship. I’ve since went on to win bronze and two silvers at the championship, my appetite kept growing hungrier each time I didn’t win. I also switched coaches to join Cliff Rovelto based in Kansas which has been incredible.

Who has been your toughest opponent?

The high jump bar – it’s undefeated never lost.

What are your best and worst moments?

Winning moment at the British Championship was special but making the Nigerian team and being in the village here in Australia is pretty awesome. I don’t keep track of my worst moments so it’s hard to recollect.

Are you hoping to assist young Nigerian athletes?

Yes, I’d love to assist younger athletes first by leading by example

Who has been your role model in athletics?

My fiancé Perri Shake-Drayton, she’s a warrior and true inspiration for anyone facing adversity; she’s a true example of never giving up and still continues to chase her dreams.

What are your favourite Nigerian foods?

Pounded yam.

Have you visited Nigeria? What memories of the country do you have?

Yes I last visited when I was around three.

How do you handle criticisms and your fans?

I’m open, honest and tell it how it is. I don’t like to keep secrets.

1,nigeria,"The kidnapping of 110 schoolgirls from Dapchi last month is the latest event to cast doubt on the Nigerian government’s claims that Boko Haram has been technically defeated. Unfortunately, the attack should have come as no surprise. Since 2015, the jihadist group has lost significant territorial control and no longer holds major cities. But as I saw during my fieldwork in Nigeria in January, the jihadist threat is far from gone, and counterinsurgency policies continue to be troubled and troubling.

Since 2009, Boko Haram has waged a brutal insurgency in northeastern Nigeria and neighboring countries. Both its violent jihad and the Nigerian government’s and militias’ counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts have led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people, the prolonged detention and disappearance of tens of thousands more, and the displacement of over two million. There has also been massive economic devastation in an already exceedingly poor and underdeveloped region. Even in comparison with other Islamist jihadist groups, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan or al Shabab in Somalia, Boko Haram stands out in its predatory behavior and failure to deliver the most rudimentary public services to the communities it controls.

Boko Haram caused 3,329 deaths in 2017, far fewer than the more than 11,500 attributed to the group during the peak of its activities in 2015, but only slightly less than the 3,484 deaths connected to the group in 2016. Moreover, the number of “violent incidents” instigated by the group in 2017 rose to 500 from 417 in 2016. Although Boko Haram no longer appears able to mass militants and dislodge entire battalions of the Nigerian military, the latter has been struggling to establish effective control in the cleared areas, some of which the group has overrun anew. The insurgency remains highly active in the Bama and Gwoza local government areas, where some 80 percent of former residents remain in internally displaced person (IDP) camps. In major cities and towns, including Maiduguri, there is widespread belief that Boko Haram informants are everywhere. This belief is exacerbated by previous incidents of",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/nigeria/2018-03-30/nigerias-troubling-counterinsurgency-strategy-against-boko-haram
2,nigeria,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents arrived in the northeastern Nigerian town of Rann on March 1. Ignoring the camp for 55,000 people displaced by the region’s conflict, they stormed the nearby military base.

Inside, the gunmen executed eight security personnel and three aid staff working for the United Nations, according to security sources and photos seen by Reuters.

It was the first publicly-acknowledged killing of aid staff by Boko Haram insurgents, but for humanitarians struggling to reach millions of people in need of aid it was a realization of a long-held fear and another setback for a crisis response that has been criticized for being too slow.

Given the precarious situation in the region bordering Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the aid workers in many areas use military escorts and stay on or by bases.

For years, some aid workers had objected to such practices, saying they undermined humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and put staff at risk.

“We are caught in a situation where humanitarian aid is part of a larger security and political agenda and that challenges the delivery of aid according to humanitarian principles,” said Hugues Robert, program manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Nigeria.

Zainab Ahmed, the Nigerian minister of state for budget and national planning who is responsible for coordinating the government relief efforts, did not respond to a request for comment about the attack on Rann.

The United Nations, which describes the situation as one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, said in February that 7.7 million people in the three most affected states depended on aid for survival.

Since Boko Haram first launched attacks in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, over 4,000 abducted and 1.6 million were still displaced in Nigeria at the end of 2017, according to the United Nations. (tmsnrt.rs/2CsEQGH)

WAR CRIME

While attacks on aid workers constitute a war crime, the perceived politicization and militarization of aid in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria has led to a growing number of attacks on humanitarian staff in war zones.

In Nigeria, even though the army launched an offensive against Boko Haram in 2015 with the help of forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, much of the northeast outside cities such as Borno state capital Maiduguri remains a no-go zone. (tmsnrt.rs/2DjT88r)

“International humanitarian law is designed to prevent incidents like the Rann attack. By militarizing humanitarian sites - yet failing to protect them - the Nigerian military is putting vulnerable civilians in harm’s way,” said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House’s Africa Programme.

“Worried that the Nigerian government could obstruct their work, international entities have turned a blind eye to the militarization of internally displaced persons’ camps and official corruption in the humanitarian space that puts civilians at even greater risk,” he said.

The Nigerian military did not respond to request for comment.

In the wake of the Rann attack, some humanitarian groups are pushing for a reassessment of relations with the military, particularly the U.N.’s, according to people familiar with the discussions this month.

“There were definitely questions being asked,” said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president at InterAction, an alliance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world.

“There was a feeling, from some NGOs that I spoke with but also some U.N. actors, that we kind of just went along with what the government was proposing,” said McIlreavy, one of the authors of a U.N. report about the crisis response.

Asked whether working in close proximity with the military put aid staff at risk, a U.N. spokeswoman said the international community in Nigeria upheld the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity.

“In the context of northeast Nigeria, military escorts are used as a last resort, in areas where security risks are very high,” she said.

SLOW RESPONSE

Aid agencies have now pulled out of Rann, leaving tens of thousands uprooted by the fighting living again in parlous conditions with little or no international humanitarian support.

Problems with the response to the crisis, including how closely humanitarians were working with the military, had been identified long before the attack.

As early as 2013, there were warnings of a food crisis in the region, from the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and others. In 2015, the United Nations and other NGOs said more than 50,000 people faced famine.

Yet, for many, the crisis response only really began in June 2016 after MSF visited Bama town and discovered 24,000 people, including 4,500 children under five, living in catastrophic conditions which the agency said were “beyond critical”.

Near the camp MSF found a field of evenly-spaced indentations in the earth, marked only by the occasional scrap of metal: 1,233 graves, 480 for children.

When MSF’s news of Bama spread, Nigeria declared a “nutrition emergency” in Borno state and U.N. agencies started to ramp up the humanitarian response.

Disputes within the United Nations and aid groups, tense relations with the government and a slow response both internationally and by Nigerian politicians over the preceding years had all helped make a desperate situation catastrophic, said aid workers, diplomats, politicians and security personnel.

“We all recognize that the international response here was in general very slow at the beginning,” said Peter Lundberg, who was head of the U.N.’s response in the northeast until December.

Many of the people involved with the crisis response interviewed by Reuters said Nigeria had been reluctant to accept food aid over concern it would harm the image of the country, the biggest economy in Africa. They also said some international groups held back from speaking out about the crisis for fear it would damage their relations with Abuja.

“To be fair to the international community, I think that there was also from the government side a reluctance to perhaps fully acknowledge not only that it was a conflict but it was actually turning into a humanitarian crisis. And unfortunately that’s not uncommon,” Lundberg told Reuters in November.

In 2016, MSF said it had been raising the alarm with U.N. agencies for two years but they had failed to respond.

A spokesman for WFP said it could only operate in a country at the request of the government and in Nigeria that didn’t happen until March 2016.

He said WFP’s response was one of its “most significant and swift expansions ever”, adding that it planned to deliver aid to 1.5 million people a month by June, from 1 million now.

‘TOXIC NARRATIVE’

Despite a massive increase in budgets and humanitarian staff working in the region over the past two years, the response was still wracked with problems holding back aid as recently as June, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters.

It described a “toxic narrative” between the Nigerian government and the humanitarian community, an “us and them” divide between the United Nations and other NGOs and a relief effort that failed to adhere to international humanitarian law.

The report also warned that the Nigerian government had failed to grasp the reality of the situation on the ground.

“Arguably the most critical factor in scaling up in a manner commensurate to the massive needs, is to orient the attention of the government of Nigeria to commit more of their own resources to humanitarian and recovery efforts in the northeast,” it said.

A U.N. spokeswoman said the assessment was “quite dated” and a task force including representatives from the United Nations, international NGOs and donor countries was expected to issue an internal report on progress this month.

Even at the start of 2018, issues described in the report still threatened to undermine the response.

In a Jan. 2 letter to the government seen by Reuters, Edward Kallon, the U.N.’s top humanitarian official in Nigeria, said tensions with the government were delaying a fund-raising appeal.

While the disagreements were resolved in time for the February launch of the 2018 humanitarian response plan, letters sent by both sides highlight a fraught relationship.

“Time is not on our side,” Kallon wrote to Ahmed.

In a Jan. 5 reply, also seen by Reuters, Ahmed said Kallon had been “extremely disrespectful ... we are concerned that this situation is becoming untenable and therefore unacceptable to us.”

The U.N. and Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment on the letters.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/killing-of-aid-workers-in-nigeria-a-setback-for-troubled-crisis-response-idUSKBN1GY0LN
3,nigeria,"Stigmatised by the public and badgered by the police, gay people in Nigeria have been driven ever deeper underground

At a private party, held late at night in a small Lagos hotel far from any main road, men find solace in being openly gay. It is one of the few places in Nigeria’s largest city that affords them such licence.

On chairs outside the hall, which is guarded by security, men sit languidly playing with one another’s hair. It is a few hours since the party started, but so far only a dozen people have turned up. Inside, bar tables, music and disco lights fill an otherwise empty space. “People will come later on,” says the organiser. “Many people wait to hear that everything is fine and then, after a while, they show up.”



In July 2017, at club Owode in Lagos, 70 men and boys were arrested by police. The area had been on alert after a spate of violence. According to Daniel Okoye, a paralegal helping LGBTQ people in Nigeria, the police saw the arrests as an easy way of extorting money.

“In the majority of these cases the police extort funds from them, knowing that any court case will out their sexuality,” says Okoye. “For most of them, their single wish is to pay and get out, and the police use it against them.”

After the Owode arrests, similar gatherings went deeper underground. “Many parties cancelled out of fear, but this one continued in the same month,” explains another organiser. “Less people come now but, ultimately, people just want to live their lives.”



The Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which banned gay relationships and entrenched intolerance to sexual minorities in Nigerian society, was signed by President Goodluck Jonathan in January 2014.

Omolara Oriye, a director at the Initiative for Equal Rights, says the nature of crimes has changed in recent years. “We’ve been documenting cases since 2015. Violence is very common … but from 2016-17 we saw a decrease in violent acts,” she said. “What has risen significantly is extortion, blackmail, infringement of rights to assembly, and police malpractice. This is happening through apps like Grindr and social media.”

The initiative launched a helpline in 2015 that has received more than 200 calls to date. “Some of the most troubling come from states that are more conservative and where LGBTQ people are even more alone, where there is even less access to help than in Lagos or Abuja,” says Oriye.

As a gay person, you know that there is no future in Nigeria if you want to live an open life Azeenarh Mohammed

According to Oriye, police regularly arrest people who attend gay meet-ups, or simply for being gay – even though it isn’t illegal. “A huge problem we have is that people don’t know their rights and, even when they do, they are too afraid to challenge the police,” she says.

Gay people in Nigeria mostly socialise in homes, where gatherings take place between friends and networks of friends. But the trust afforded by these closed spaces is increasingly fragile.



For over three years, gay friends of Samson Ndem* stayed at his home in Lagos. “Some of them had lost or left jobs because people had found out about their sexuality, some of them weren’t allowed to be around their own family,” says Ndem.

“I was paying for everything, our food and bills, even giving them money to go to places they needed to, until some of them got jobs again.”

Last March, one of his friends held a party at his home while he was away. One attendee took pictures and threatened to report them to the police.



“I had to kick everyone out, people were blackmailing them and then they would try to blackmail me. It happens frequently when people in the our community are desperate.”

Dr Ade Toyin, a former case worker at the International Centre for the Advocacy of Rights to Health in Abuja, says substance abuse and self harm is common, and there is no help available. “If you’re gay in Nigeria, and you’re rich enough to even afford therapy, can you really tell your therapist and be open? You can’t.”

She pushed for her organisation to begin mental health therapy. “There was this joke in the office of calling me ‘Dr Mad’ because people thought that, because of ideas around mental health, no one would show up to our sessions. Actually, in the three months that I was involved in the programme, we saw about 3,000 people.”

Toyin explains that while there is a blanket need for mental health services, the few that exist in Nigeria are more available to men. “Many NGOs who do work in the LGBTQ community do so under the cover of human rights and many through HIV awareness. But that has meant that their focus is largely on men, because HIV awareness is focused on gay men.”



Azeenarh Mohammed, a 32-year old lawyer, worked with hundreds of gay Nigerian women for the Heinrich Böll Stiftung Foundation in Abuja. She says relationships are rare. “Firstly, people have internalised homophobia, so they say to themselves ‘Oh, this is just a phase for me, I’ll grow out of it, get married and have children.’ It takes some people a while to accept themselves.

“Then you also have this pressure on women to marry by a certain age. Men really experience violent homophobia here, but I’d say a key difference for women is that, because of our patriarchal structures, women are easier to control or dominate. Men still have a greater freedom to be independent and find themselves.”

Mohammed is one of the few gay women now living openly in Nigeria. “You live life here as a gay person, knowing that there is no future in Nigeria if you want to live an open life, but I really wanted to change that.

“For every 10 gay women in Nigeria, seven want to leave eventually and go abroad. But I came back because this was something I want to fight to change.”

In 2011, shortly after the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Bill was passed by Nigeria’s Senate, Mohammed spoke at a hearing in the National Assembly. The legislators and senators were expecting a speech on the environment; Mohammed instead spoke on gay rights. “They were quite shocked, as you can imagine. Afterwards, some said the bill was already passed so we should move on, others were calling for me to be arrested for being gay. But I know my rights, being gay is not yet illegal in Nigeria.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/30/blackmail-prejudice-persecution-gay-rights-nigeria
4,nigeria,"“The crisis continues to displace thousands of vulnerable women, children and men every week. Many have gone through unspeakable hardship and the UN and its partners remain committed to help alleviate their suffering,” said Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria.

Set up through the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF), the assistance includes $2 million in support to the UN Humanitarian Air Service for frontline responders in the country’s north-east.

“This UN fund give us the flexibility to prioritize those who are most in need of aid and act swiftly for the good of the people of north-east Nigeria.”

The region’s humanitarian crisis, sparked mainly by Boko Haram’s years-long insurgency, remains one of the most severe globally.

In the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, at least 7.7 million people are in need this year– with about 80 per cent, or 6.1 million, targeted for humanitarian assistance.

The $9 million allocation will help fund 15 projects supporting humanitarian rapid response in areas affected by large-scale conflict-related displacements, particularly in the northern parts of Borno, along the Maiduguri-Monguno axis.

In just three months, the close to 30,000 people who have fled violence in hard-to-reach areas are in dire need of food, water, shelter, clothes and medical services. Additionally, the funds will help scale up the response near the border with Cameroon in eastern Borno – Gwoza, Bama, Dikwa, Kala/Balge, Monguno, Askira/Uba – and northern Adamawa – Madagali – where approximately another 30,000 have arrived following military operations.

Finally, the funds will also help maintain UN Humanitarian Air Service operations, crucial to reach and deliver aid in remote areas of the north-east, especially where roads are unusable.

Under the leadership of Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, the NHF is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to provide flexible and timely funds for basic life-saving support. To date, it has raised $48 million in contributions and pledges.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1006071
5,nigeria,"John Alechenu, Eniola Akinkuotu and Olaleye Aluko

The Coalition for Nigeria Movement led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo has asked Nigerians to be wary of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government as it has corrupted security agencies ahead of the 2019 general elections.

It said the statement by a former Minister of Defence, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (retd.), that the military was colluding with unscrupulous individuals should not be dismissed.

The spokesman for the CNM, Mr. Akin Osuntokun, said this while responding to allegations by heads of security agencies that there was a plot by some groups to disrupt the 2019 general elections.

The Directors-General of the Department of State Services, Mr. Lawal Daura; and National Intelligence Agency, Mr. Ahmed Rufa’I as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, had raised the alarm over the plans by some groups to disrupt the processes leading to the 2019 elections.

The evil plan, according to them, was for the groups to create a stalemate during the elections.

However, Osuntokun told one of our correspondents that the security heads were acting out the script of the All Progressives Congress.

He said, “It all sounds funny to me. I don’t know any group that meets that description but why would anyone want to disrupt the 2019 elections? The only people that would want to disrupt the elections are the APC which has sensed its imminent defeat.

“If what Gen. Danjuma said is true whereby our protectors have become murderers, then it means they are the ones that should be feared. They are the ones that should be suspected.

“If you can extrapolate from what Gen. Danjuma said, that means Nigerians are at the mercy of the government or the army that is colluding. The people we should fear are (those in ) the government.”

Osuntokun said it was unfortunate that the heads of security agencies were serving a ‘conspiratorial parochial agenda’ as they were protecting the President’s ethnic base.

He added, “Where is the need to reserve the command of the Nigerian military and security services exclusively for the ethno-religious base of the President if it is not to serve a conspiratorial parochial agenda?

“The only group that fits this description of a fictitious fifth columnist agenda is the government itself.”

Security services shouldn’t cause panic –NCP

The National Conscience Party asked Nigeria’s security services to wake up to their responsibilities and should not try to cause panic to achieve pre-arranged objectives.

The National Chairman of the party, Dr. Yunusa Tanko, said this in a telephone interview with Saturday PUNCH, in Abuja, on Friday.

He was reacting to the news that the nation’s security chiefs had raised the alarm over threats by unnamed groups to scuttle the 2019 general elections.

Tanko said, “That is very unfortunate. I wouldn’t want to say unprofessional; I only hope they are not raising a false alarm as part of a gimmick to short-change Nigerians.

“Security people do a lot of things; I don’t think it is fair for them to send panic or create fear among Nigerians. They are in the government; they are trained and paid to protect us.

“They have the capacity to deal with threats if they know these individuals or groups and they have evidence. What is stopping them from apprehending them?

“It is completely unnecessary for our security officials to try to create a situation of panic. As ordinary citizens, we don’t have the information and capacity they have. If they are now throwing it back to us, what do they expect us to do?

“Who do we move to for protection? It is their duty to ensure that the election is free and fair and not to send fear into the hearts of Nigerians.”

Speaking in a similar vein, the National Chairman of the Labour Party, Alhaji Abdukadir Abdulsalam, urged Nigerians to remain vigilant and ensure that nothing untoward was done by any individual or group to scuttle the 2019 elections.

Abdulsalam who also spoke in a telephone interview noted that Nigerians owed it a duty to themselves and the nation to remain vigilant while the institutions of the state live up to their responsibility.

“We expect our security officials to do their jobs by ensuring a peaceful atmosphere before, during and after elections.

“We should not become a nation that each time an election is coming we begin to raise security concerns. It does not portray us as a serious country.”

FG must act fast –CACOL, CD

Two civil societies, the Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership and the Campaign for Democracy have said that the Federal Government must not treat the alarm raised by the security chiefs on the 2019 elections with kid gloves.

The civil societies said the government must reshuffle the military and other security agencies to bring in fresh and efficient hands, devoid of political and economic interests.

The CACOL Director, Debo Adeniran, said, “That alarm by security chiefs is a manifestation of the ominous sign of distrust between the serving and retired military officers.

“These are ominous times and the government must not fold its arms. It is a warning that should be taken seriously and everyone who is investigated to have such plans against the 2019 elections must be arrested and prosecuted, no matter whose ox is gored.

“They should be rounded up and made to sign an undertaking for the 2019 elections.”

Meanwhile, the CD President, Usman Abdul, said, “We will not condone any act of sabotaging our democracy. We call on the President to allow those security chiefs who are due for retirement to go. The President must bring in those who are capable of steering the course of the 2019 elections.

“Given these security alerts, the government must not let the 2019 elections go awry. There must be an action immediately and one of such actions is the removal of whoever is deemed inefficient.”

6,nigeria,"The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says it has imported 9.8 million metric tons of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) worth $5.8 billion to combat the fuel crisis that resurfaced since late last year.

This was disclosed by the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Dr. Maikanti Baru, during a public hearing by the Senate Committee on Public Accounts today at the National Assembly Complex during the week in Abuja.

In a presentation by the GMD who was represented by the Chief Operating Officer, Finance and Accounts, Mr. AbdulrazaqIsiaka, NNPC stated that it carried out the massive importation in fulfilment of its statutory role of supplier of last resort to ensure that Nigerians do not suffer as a result of product unavailability.

According to the GMD, the corporation’s provision of 9.8 million metric tons of petrol so far has helped a great deal in ameliorating the suffering of Nigerians.

He said the corporation’s intervention became necessary following the inability of the major and independent marketers to import the product because of the high landing cost which made cost recovery and profitability difficult owing to the regulated price regime.

While assuring the public of adequate product supply, the GMD, however, pointed out that cross-border smuggling due to price disparity between Nigeria and neighbouring countries where a litre of petrol sells above N350 per litre as well as logistic issues in trucking products to different locations across the country remained serious challenges in the quest for fuel queue-free situation in the country.

The Chairman Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Sen. Matthew Uroghide, noted that the public hearing was a part of the Committee’s duty to find lasting solutions to the problem of fuel scarcity in order to make life easy for all Nigerians.",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/nigeria-imports-5-8bn-worth-petrol-tackle-fuel-crisis-2/
7,nigeria,"Widespread violence has plagued Nigeria over the years, with an epicenter of activity in northeast parts of the country. Much of this violence is related to the Boko Haram insurgency, although other battles between ethnic groups have also intensified, largely over land and partly due to a growing drought. Despite some success by Nigerian security forces in tamping down violence, lives continue to be lost and communities displaced. All of this is ongoing as the country prepares to hold elections next year.

On March 26, the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a discussion on the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. Panelists included Alexandra Lamarche and Mark Yarnell of Refugees International, authors of the recent report “Political Pressure to Return: Putting Northeast Nigeria’s Displaced Citizens at Risk.” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at Brookings, briefed the findings from her January fieldwork in northeastern Nigeria on the state of counterinsurgency, security, and reconstruction efforts. Brookings Senior Fellow Michael O’Hanlon moderated the conversation, while adding his own perspectives.

Following their conversation, panelists took audience questions.",https://www.brookings.edu/events/addressing-the-ongoing-humanitarian-crisis-in-nigeria/
8,nigeria,"A top official with the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR, has bemoaned the deplorable conditions under which Cameroonians fleeing the Anglophone crisis are living in Nigeria.

Antonio Canhandula, a Programme / Operation Manager and UNHCR representative made his reservations via his twitter handle after visiting some of the refugees in Nigeria’s Cross River and Benue States earlier this week. Other refugees are living in the Akwa Ibom and Taraba States.

One tweet disclosed how some women said they had so little food to feed their families that they had to carry bricks to earn money to supplement what relief agencies provided.

Accompanying a photo of young children lined up in a school he wrote: “Beautiful Cameroon refugee students. Children do not deserve the unfortunate situation of a refugee. This is freedom and human growth arrested. Robbing children of a future. An urgent solution is called for. Ikom.”

“Children need to continue with their learning. I teach them outside here to make sure they can learn something” Odi Geraldine, trained teacher #Cameroonian #refugees in Ikom, #CrossRiver state. #CameroonRefugees pic.twitter.com/83ouKfPvM5 — UNHCR Nigeria (@unhcrnigeria) March 27, 2018

Then there was the story of how a expectant mother who fled the crisis back home had delivered a day before the UNHCR visited. Ernestine Etioe, 23, gave birth at a clinic located in Cross River State.

The UNHCR’s records indicate that 20,000 plus Cameroonians have fled the country’s North West and South West regions due to what has become known as the Anglophone crisis.

Canhandula’s reservations are the same as those of the agency he represents. The UNHCR aside pushing that a political solution be found to the crisis holds that it does not have enough funds to cater for the growing number of refugees.

Secessionist elements pushing for independence under the so-called Ambazonia Republic have often clashed with state security agencies. They had earlier used guerilla style attacks to kill over twenty security forces.

The recent leg is armed exchanges and the use of kidnappings. So far, two government officials are in their custody. The Catholic Church’s relief wing in Nigeria has said the refugee influx also hurts Nigerians as it deepens their own poverty situations.

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Livingston/Getty Images David Livingston/Getty Images

After suspected Boko Haram militants launched a brutal attack in the town of Rann in Nigeria's northeastern Borno State Thursday, killing several people including aid workers, Doctors Without Borders has pulled out of the town.

The departure is sure to be a blow to the tens of thousands of displaced people living in a nearby camp.

""Prior to the attack, the roughly 40,000 people living in Rann were relying almost entirely on MSF's services to access health care,"" the group (also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF) said in a statement.

""Leaving our patients, which include 60 children currently enrolled in our nutrition program, without medical assistance, is an extremely painful decision,"" said the group's Emergency Coordinator in Nigeria Kerri Ann Kelly.

Doctors Without Borders says it will return as soon as conditions allow.

On Thursday just after 5 p.m. local time ""a large number of Boko Haram members armed with automatic weapons, rocket propelled grenades and gun trucks attacked the military base in Rann,"" said the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration.

Eleven people were killed, according to IOM staff, including four soldiers, four police officers and three humanitarian workers.

The U.N.'s humanitarian office says two of the aid workers were contractors working with the IOM to help those in the camp. The third was a doctor consulting with UNICEF.

""Aid workers put their lives on the line every single day to provide emergency assistance to vulnerable women, children and men,"" said the U.N.'s Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria Edward Kallon in a statement.

""Boko Haram's recent cowardly attacks have only renewed the determination of our government to bring the insurgency to a decisive end, in the shortest possible time,""said Nigerian President Muhammadi Buhari on Twitter. ""I sympathize with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies working in Rann, Borno State.""

Since 2009, the Boko Haram uprising centered in Nigeria's northeast, has wrought widespread devastation.

The U.N. breaks down the numbers: more than 20,000 people have been killed, some 2 million people have fled their homes and more than 7 million people — mostly children — are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Boko Haram roughly translates to ""Western education is a sin"" and has been designated as a foreign terrorist group by the U.S. Department of State since 2013. But for nearly a decade, the militant Islamist group has carried out brutal attacks in a bid to create an independent state within Nigeria.

The U.N.'s humanitarian office says a female nurse is missing following Thursday's attack and the fear is she has been kidnapped.

Meantime, the more than 100 girls snatched nearly two weeks ago from their school in the town of Dapchi neighboring Yobe State are still missing.

On Friday, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture said ""more urgency"" has been added to the search, which has expanded to neighboring countries.

11,nigeria,"Nigeria's state revenue for February of this year edged up by 19 billion naira ($53 million), it was announced Thursday, though chaotic fiscal management has meant that its budget announcement has been pushed back yet again.

Nigeria earned 557.9 billion naira ($1.8 billion) in gross revenues last month, up from 538.9 billion naira in January. This was thanks to higher crude oil exports and prices, Ahmed Idris, the accountant general, said Thursday as reported by Reuters.

But, earlier this week, it was announced that Nigeria's annual budget announcement was to be pushed back yet again.

Expected for April 24, the announcement will now come on May 31. This is not the first time the budget has been delayed. The Nigerian financial year runs from January to December, though last year's budget was also published in May.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari initially presented the 2018 budget of 8.6 trillion naira to lawmakers in November but still needs approval. The sum is the country's biggest ever.

This comes as Nigeria moves past its recession of 2016, in which the country's economy shrank by 1.58 percent according to its National Bureau of Statistics. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Nigeria — which is Africa's largest economy and easily the continent's most populous nation — will grow 2.1 percent in 2018.

""Rising oil prices, new foreign exchange measures, attractive yields on government securities, and a tighter monetary policy have made foreign exchange more readily available and helped contain inflation. Consequently, investors are returning to Nigeria,"" said the IMF earlier in March.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/oils-rise-gives-nigeria-some-good-news-after-its-budget-gets-delayed.html

The United Nations-managed Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) supports, amomg others, women livelihoods projects like this one, in Mafa, Borno state.

Some 60,000 people displaced by ongoing hostilities in Nigeria's crisis-torn Borno state will receive life-saving aid thanks to an allocation from the United Nations-managed country-based humanitarian assistance fund.

""The crisis continues to displace thousands of vulnerable women, children and men every week. Many have gone through unspeakable hardship and the UN and its partners remain committed to help alleviate their suffering,"" said Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria.

Set up through the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF), the assistance includes $2 million in support to the UN Humanitarian Air Service for frontline responders in the country's north-east.

""This UN fund give us the flexibility to prioritize those who are most in need of aid and act swiftly for the good of the people of north-east Nigeria.""

The region's humanitarian crisis, sparked mainly by Boko Haram's years-long insurgency, remains one of the most severe globally.

In the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, at least 7.7 million people are in need this year- with about 80 per cent, or 6.1 million, targeted for humanitarian assistance.

The $9 million allocation will help fund 15 projects supporting humanitarian rapid response in areas affected by large-scale conflict-related displacements, particularly in the northern parts of Borno, along the Maiduguri-Monguno axis.

In just three months, the close to 30,000 people who have fled violence in hard-to-reach areas are in dire need of food, water, shelter, clothes and medical services. Additionally, the funds will help scale up the response near the border with Cameroon in eastern Borno - Gwoza, Bama, Dikwa, Kala/Balge, Monguno, Askira/Uba - and northern Adamawa - Madagali - where approximately another 30,000 have arrived following military operations.

Finally, the funds will also help maintain UN Humanitarian Air Service operations, crucial to reach and deliver aid in remote areas of the north-east, especially where roads are unusable.

Under the leadership of Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, the NHF is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to provide flexible and timely funds for basic life-saving support. To date, it has raised $48 million in contributions and pledges.",https://allafrica.com/stories/201803280203.html
13,nigeria,"The protracted conflict in the Lake Chad Basin has cut off millions of women and men from their livelihoods, making them entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance to survive. Much emphasis has been given to the stabilization agenda, with a focus on securitization. However, Oxfam’s research in late 2017 showed that early recovery and livelihoods development are much needed and should be prioritized to promote resilience among crisis-affected communities, to reduce dependency on humanitarian aid, and ultimately to promote sustainable peace.

1 INTRODUCTION

After nine years of conflict in north-east Nigeria, 4.5 million people in the Lake Chad Basin need immediate food support and are dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. They remain cut off from their traditional livelihoods in an area where agriculture, fishing, livestock rearing, and regional trade were dynamic prior to the crisis. The number of food-insecure people across the region is expected to increase to 5.8 million by August 2018. The situation will keep deteriorating for the foreseeable future unless there is a concerted effort, driven by the governments of the conflictaffected countries, to lift communities out of a protracted crisis and support them to resume their lives and livelihoods. This cannot wait. A short-term humanitarian response, focused solely on keeping people alive, is not enough.

More than 2.2 million people remain displaced across Niger, Chad, Cameroon and north-east Nigeria as a result of the conflict. At the height of the conflict in 2014–15, non-state armed groups controlled about 20,000 square miles of land within north-east Nigeria alone (20% of Nigeria), where close to 1.8 million people lived. Military strategies to cut the armed groups off from their economic resources and declared ‘state of emergencies’ have had disastrous impacts on civilians’ access to livelihoods.

Despite the government regaining control of areas in recent years, almost one million people are still living in out-of-reach areas and many communities remain displaced – or experience onward displacement – with little or no hope of returning to their homes due to threats from non-state armed actors and ongoing military operations in their villages of origin.

In Nigeria, one in five internally displaced persons (IDPs) have stated their intention to integrate locally in the current area of their displacement; and many others, while expressing the desire to leave, have asserted that the security situation is not yet conducive for going home. A significant return movement is not expected among Niger and Chad’s displaced communities in the coming year.

Ongoing insecurity, compounded by the lack of access to livelihoods, continues to expose displaced communities to protection threats such as killing, abduction, and sexual abuse, forcing them to resort to dangerous activities and negative coping mechanisms to survive. For women and girls, some of these negative coping mechanisms include early marriages (a direct consequence of lack of resources) or survival sex. Men and boys are also targeted and faced with abduction and killing as they go for firewood collection or to farm in insecure areas.

The food situation, far from improving, is expected to deteriorate from mid-2018, when climate-related stresses across the Sahel region are likely to compound the situation.

According to a humanitarian needs forecast for the region, 62% of the Chadian population in the Lake region is expected to be food-insecure during the 2018 lean season: a 52% increase compared with 2017. In Nigeria, 3.7 million people could become food insecure if appropriate assistance is not delivered (compared with 2.6 million in January 2018). According to the 2018 Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan, 5.7 million people are in urgent need of early recovery and livelihood assistance in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. However, the early recovery and livelihood sector was only 7.7% funded in 2017.

While many humanitarian and development actors consider that conditions for early recovery are met in certain locations (the Lake region of Chad, most of Adamawa and Yobe state in Nigeria, the western part of Diffa region in Niger), the relative improvement in the security situation over the past two years has not translated into an improved access to livelihoods in most areas. Thanks to generous funding – 70% of the 2017 humanitarian response plan was funded in Nigeria – and a massive humanitarian scale-up, famine was averted in the north-east of Nigeria. But a similar level of humanitarian assistance will be hard to maintain in 2018, and even if it can, this will not provide a long-term solution to the lack of access to food and livelihoods in this protracted crisis.

The continuing lack of safe livelihoods risks contributing to ongoing cycles of violence, fuelling grievances and further undermining the stretched coping capacities of impoverished communities. Massive investment in livelihoods opportunities is needed now, combining short- and long-term approaches, to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Action must be taken immediately: vulnerable women, men and children cannot wait until they are safe to go home for a more durable solution. A strong political vision is required from the governments of conflict-affected countries, which should take the lead in coordinating humanitarian and development interventions. Moreover, investment in livelihoods should be seen as an opportunity to empower women and youth and to reduce gender inequality, in order to promote long-term peace in the region.",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/supporting-livelihoods-lake-chad-basin-ways-forward-conflict-affected-communities
14,nigeria,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains massive in scale due to ongoing hostilities: 1.7 million persons remain internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and 3.7 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Since October, close to 50,000 people have been displaced requiring a scale-up in the response in the eastern and north-eastern parts of Borno. Close to 930,000 remain in areas hard to reach for international aid organisations, mostly in Borno State.

The emergency Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) convened by the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, ended on Wednesday without resolving the crisis that derailed last Tuesday’s schedule.

Tuesday’s meeting ended in a stalemate following disagreements by representatives of the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory over the amount presented by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as revenue to be shared by the three tiers of government for February.

The Chairman, Forum of FAAC Commissioners, Mahmoud Yunusa, told reporters in Abuja the meeting, which did not last more than an hour, resolved to share what was available pending a formal reconciliation meeting to be convened with the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Maikanti Baru.

The NNPC had presented about N74.06 billion as revenue from its operations for February.

But, members observed there were certain components of the revenue submission that required more explanation and clarification.

They decided to postpone further decisions on sharing the money until they were reconciled.

However, Mrs . Adeosun had stepped in and summoned an emergency meeting of the committee for Wednesday in an effort to resolve the differences.

The Lake Chad Basin humanitarian emergency is among the most severe in the world. The protracted conflict has uprooted around 2.3 million people, stoked high levels of hunger and malnutrition, and subjected millions of civilians to extreme hardship. Insecurity is hampering the resumption of normal life, leaving conflict-affected families dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.

Recent developments

The recent months have been marked by major incidents of insecurity that have claimed lives and disrupted humanitarian operations. On 1 March, armed attackers raided Rann town in Nigeria’s north-east, killing three aid workers and abducting three others. Humanitarian workers have been temporarily relocated from the town.

Two weeks earlier, heavily armed men stormed a school in Dapchi, also in north-east Nigeria, and kidnapped over 100 school girls, most of whom have reportedly been freed. Attacks are recurrent and insecurity is prevalent. In January alone, Cameroon’s Far North region suffered more than 30 armed attacks. Also in January, some 8,000 people were uprooted in the region’s Mayo Tsanaga department by the attacks and military operations. During a visit to Cameroon and Chad, UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, called on the international community and Governments to support humanitarian actors in increasing their operations.

By Kelechukwu Iruoma

MANAGEMENT of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPRe, Effurun, has said that the institution has the potentials to solve Nigeria’s fuel crisis, but lack of funds is destroying the institution’s vision of being one of the best universities in the world.

The institution’s Vice- Chancellor, Professor Akaehomen Ibhadode, who said this when he and his team paid a courtesy visit to Vanguard headquarters in Lagos, however, called on the Federal Government to turn its attention to the institution to help solve the infrastructure and other funding challenges limiting its advancement.

He said: “As a petroleum university, we have a stake in solving this problem (petrol crisis). We have been toying with the idea of mini refineries and you find out that even now, we have shortage of petroleum products. With our little resources, we have been able to come up with designs and at this point, we are looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to actualise the designs in physical form.”

He noted that the institution is trying to work with the marginal field operators, but because of financial challenges, the institution has not been able to come up with something workable. “We want to be challenged as a petroleum university to build mini refineries and we are ready for that, and if we are able to create mini refineries, we can replicate it all over the country and beyond, especially in Africa. It will create employment and change the economic face of the country.”

FUPRE, a specialised petroleum university, was established by the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 to train high level manpower for the oil and gas industry, with a take-off grant of N500 million. Since then, no other grant has been given to the institution.

He said other new universities receive N6 billion take-off grant. “Unfortunately, not enough resources are put in place to achieve that mandate. It’s the first petroleum university in Africa and the sixth in the world. We need to draw the attention of the government that set it up as the proprietor and the sector (education), that we are operating in a situation where we can be of value to the industry (petroleum) and also to the nation,” he added.

He said that as giant of Africa and showing by Nigeria’s resources in terms of population and landmass, Nigeria has everything. “These are things that can make us really tick. Attention has to be drawn to the university. We can draw resources from the government that will be able to make us to achieve more. Unfortunately, that has not been so. It is after 10 years of establishing the university that we now have an act which was signed by the National Assembly and signed into law last year by the president.”

“Every university is shouting we do not have money but we want to go beyond that. What we want to establish is that we have potentials that we can deploy to be able to leverage on them and attract more resources. We want to announce to the world that we have done quite a couple of things and as a specialised university, we can commercialise or partner with organisations to be able to bring solution to the oil industry and the allied industries such that we make life better for Nigerians,” said Akaehome.

He said that the institution is looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to be able to actualise the design of the refineries in the physical form, including production and drilling platforms.

“FUPRE is a specialized university with some special funding for infrastructural development and research purposes. But unfortunately the implementation of that has not been captured in the 2018 budget. We are trying to see how that can be done. It appears it may be too late but it is for us to create awareness that there is need to invest in this university because by doing that we will be creating greater value for the system, especially in the petroleum sector.

“As a petroleum producing country, it is not out of place to have a specialized university. There is the need for it because it will help to drive the industry for a greater performance and increased local content participation. By the specialize nature, we train our students right from the beginning with some specialist knowledge that will help them to work them into the world of oil prepared. That is the intention and that is what we are driving at,” he said.

He said the institution floated a company that is registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, in conjunction with the United Africa Company, UAC. “It is called FUPre energy solutions Limited, where we are providing consultancy and training services to the oil and gas sector. We are driving that very hard. We have this international collaboration-we have foreign students coming for internship to spend about three to four months. When they come, they participate in the research we are doing. They participate in learning.”

“We are doing these things to create value for the system and for the industry in which we are supposed to operate. We are trying to increase the value we want to deliver. We are sending our postgraduate program specially tailored for the oil industry to National Universities Commission, NUC for approval and in that we are hoping that we should be able to attract the students that are being sent abroad by Petroleum Trust Development Fund, PTDF which cost quite a lot of money.”

“We feel that if part of that money-just a little fraction of that money spent by PTDF- is deplored to providing more facilities for us to be able to attract international experts that will save a lot of money for the country. These are the areas we are looking at to increase the local content participation in the industry and to be able to provide products for the petroleum industry for the country. We are not begging. We are challenging the industry, the government and investors to come because we are ready to solve problems and in solving problem, we are going to create wealth and better a lot,” The VC said.

The institution’s registrar, Mr. Ejikeme Ichendu said that the government had a very good vision for setting up that university as a specialized petroleum university in the country, but unfortunately it is one thing to set up a university and it is another thing to ensure that the university is supported to run.

“In our own situation, the government has not done very well at all. It has not done well because we are suffering from serious underfunding. The potentials that I have seen in that university are enough to get that university to the level that it can compete with any university in the world. There is nothing in those universities (foreign) that cannot be replicated here. Those universities were established by their various government and brought to the level they are today by men. The same men are in this country and FUPRE.

He urged the government to turn its attention to the university. According to Ichendu, for 10 years the university was established by the government, it did not have an act establishing it until October last year and it was as a result of fight.

“There are clauses in that bill that if they are implemented will bring a lot of hope and succour to the university. In the bill, there are clauses for the petroleum ministry, PTDF, Nigeria content board to support the university with two percent of their annual budget. We believe that if that is done, we will no longer cry for money. But what it is today is pathetic,” he said.

“I am not being sentimental and I do not owe apologies to anybody for what I want to day- The North East Development Commission bill was signed two weeks after FUPRE bill was signed into law.

“But in 2018 budget, the NEDC bill has 46 billion proposed in the budget whereas FUPRE that was signed before that did not capture in the 2018 budget. Again we have gone to authorities that are supposed to assist in that direction. The response we are getting is that the presidency does not accept supplementary budget that we have to wait until 2019. What a pity for a specialized university that was established to train high level manpower in the oil and gas industry. Till the next five decades, oil and gas will continue to be the driver of our economy and the earlier government paid attention to it, the better for us,” he stated.",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/stake-solving-nigerias-petroleum-crisis-fupre-vc-2/

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In Cameroon’s Far North region, around 30 attacks were recorded in January alone in which around 20 people were killed, homes destroyed, livestock and property looted. Military operations have triggered displacements and restricted humanitarian assistance. Some 8,000 Cameroonians fled their homes in Mayo Tsanaga due to recent military operations and armed incursions. Since January, around 2,000 Nigerian asylum seekers relocated to Minawao camp, the main refugee settlement in Far North region. Part of them fled military counter-offensives in Nigeria’s Sambisa Forest area into Cameroon while a majority were out of camp refugees who decided to join the camp due to robberies and attacks in the villages they had settled in.

In Niger, armed raiders have killed and abducted civilians in Diffa region. An average of 12 civilians were killed, injured or abducted every month in 2017 in the region, a decline from an average of 20 per month in 2015 – 2016.

DISRUPTIVE ARMED ATTACKS

The recent months have been marked by dramatic incidents of insecurity. Armed raiders on 19 February abducted 110 school girls in Dapchi locality in Nigeria’s north-eastern Yobe state. The incident happened nearly four years after the kidnapping of over 270 girls from their school in Chibok area in Borno state. The authorities said most of the girls were freed on 21 March. The Government had previously announced that it prefered to negotiate their release. Attacks and insecurity remain prevalent in north-east Nigeria and the Far North region of Cameroon.

On 1 March, an attack on the town of Rann in Borno, near the border with Cameroon, claimed the lives of three aid workers. Three others were abducted and another injured. As security assessments are being carried out, a temporary relocation of the aid workers stationed in Rann was decided. The town is home to around 80,000 people, including 55,000 internally displaced persons who are mostly dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. Attacks on camps for displaced, villages and towns are recurrent, causing death and injury to civilians and continuous population displacements.

PERSISTENT FOOD INSECURITY

Protracted violence, population displacements and disrupted livelihoods have contributed to high levels of hunger across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin region.

Some 5.8 million are currently food insecure. Increased humanitarian assistance and favourable harvest in certain areas have helped ease food insecurity.

However, most poor households and displaced people remain highly dependent on food assistance to survive.

Staple food prices are mostly well above average, making food access even more difficult for households with few income-earning opportunities. In areas in Nigeria’s north-east which are hard to reach for humanitarian organisations, there is an elevated risk of famine, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) warned on 2 March. However, it pointed out that there is insufficient evidence to make a formal determination on famine.

PROTECTION

Protracted violence continues to subject civilians, including IDPs, refugees and host communities to grave protection risks and violations. In Chad, 106 cases of gender-based violence were reported in January in the western Lac region, mostly physical assaults (33 per cent) and resource deprivation (27 per cent). All victims received psychosocial support, but very few received medical and legal assistance. In 2017, 2,270 cases of sexual and gender-based violence were reported.

Comprehensive care for survivors is a persisting challenge. In 2018, the main challenge is access to justice for GBV survivors due to impunity, weak legal systems and cultural barriers. Access to health care services is also extremely limited and the number of mobile clinics has fallen due to lack of funding.",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/lake-chad-basin-crisis-update-no-22-january-february-2018

Samuel Abiola Robinson has alleged that he was paid less than Rs 5 lakh and that the producer had not kept his promise of paying him more.

Nineteen-year-old Nigerian actor Samuel Abiola Robinson, who recently starred in the Malayalam film Sudani from Nigeria has alleged that he was paid less because of racism.

The actor, who plays the role of a footballer in Sudani, put up the allegations on his social media pages.

Stating that he experienced racial discrimination from producers in Kerala, Samuel wrote, ""I'm saying this now because i cannot sit back and allow it happen to another helpless young black actor. I believe that i was a victim of racial discrimination while in Kerala. It was nothing violent or directly in my face but for my role in Sudani from Nigeria, the producers offered me far less money than Indian actors who are not half as popular or accomplished as i am would normally earn. I only became better enlightened after meeting with several young actors and discussing payment with them. I am of the opinion that this happened purely because of my skin color and the assumption that all africans are poor and don't know the value of money (sic).""

Samuel added that the director and writer of the film, Zakariya, had done his best but that he couldn't change things much because he wasn't financing the film himself. In Nigeria, Samuel is a popular actor who has featured in films and TV series, including Desperate Housewives Africa.

Calling Zakariya a brilliant director with a ""good heart"", Samuel went on to say, ""Promises were made to me by the producers while shooting to pay me more if the movie eventually becomes successful but no promise has been honoured and now i am back in Nigeria. I believe the promises were simply tools of Manipulation to get me to eagerly commit the 5 months of availability for work being October, November, December 2017, January and March 2018 for the shoot and promotion of the movie (sic).""

The actor pointed out that despite the success of the film, the promises made to him had allegedly not been kept: ""The movie is a huge commercial success now and i am grateful for all the love that the fans have shown me and i have been privileged to experience the warm culture of Kerala but i can no longer suffer in silence about this. As i am black, it is my responsibility to speak up because it could ease the suffering of the next generation of black actors. Say no to racial or caste discrimination (sic).""

In an earlier interview to TNM before the release of the film, Samuel was asked whether he'd experienced racism in India. At the time, the actor had said, ""Well, racism is a problem all around the world. I'd say that for the most part of my stay in Kerala, I've had a very pleasant experience. I haven't experienced any sort of direct racism. I felt very comfortable here. Nobody has treated me badly… no direct discrimination anyway. There may have been some subtle things. But nothing directly, in my face, for the most part. I don't want to dwell on that. I've had a wonderful experience in Kerala.""

Speaking to TNM, Samuel said that he'd decided to open up now because the producers had gone back on their word.

""I was paid less than the Rs 5-15 lakhs that Indian newcomers receive in Kerala and this is why I believe it is racial discrimination,"" he said.

Samuel further added that he was promised payment before he returned to Nigeria but that he still hasn't received the money.

""The producers are acting like the promise didn't exist and this is what prompted me to go to the media,"" he said.

Samuel has also put up a video in which he says he was offended by how he was treated and says he feels he was singled out this way only because of his colour.

Sudani from Nigeria released on March 23 in Kerala. It has been produced by Happy Hours Entertainment and distributed by E4 Entertainment. Popular actor Soubin Shahir is also part of the cast. The makers of the film are yet to offer their comments on the issue.

24,nigeria,"Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala currently plays for Chinese club Dalian Quanjian

Asisat Oshoala was left out of Nigeria's squad for next month's friendly against France because of an issue with her Chinese club where she returned late for pre-season training.

Officials of Dalian Quanjian FC are said to be unhappy with the three-time African footballer of the year winner.

""Asisat Oshoala was in [Nigeria] coach Thomas Dennerby's plans but her Chinese club was not ready to release her because she overstayed in Nigeria,"" a top official of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) told BBC Sport.

In her defence, the former Liverpool and Arsenal striker insists she is missing the high-profile friendly to sort out her work permit in China.

Oshoala was in the original squad of 23 for the game in Le Mans on 6 April alongside Onome Ebi, Rashidat Ajibade, Alaba Jonathan, Chinwendu Ihezuo and Uchechi Sunday, who have also been omitted.

""Some players had visa and passport problems, another complained that she was unwell,"" the NFF official added.

Experienced quartet of Desire Oparanozie, Rita Chikwelu, Francisca Ordega and Ngozi Okobi, who helped the Super Falcons to an eighth Women's Africa Cup of Nations title in 2016, have been included.

After the friendly against France, focus will switch to securing a qualifying spot at the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations in Ghana as they aim to retain their continental title.

The biggest challenge in Ghana will be to seal qualification for the 2019 Fifa Women's World Cup in France - in what could be Nigeria's eighth record appearance at the tournament.

Nigeria are the only African team to have played in all of the Women's World Cup tournaments since 1991.

However they have failed to translate their continental dominance on the world stage, their best performance coming in USA in 1999 when they reached the quarter-finals.

Nigeria's 17-person squad:

Goalkeepers: Onyinyechukwu Okeke, Chiamaka Nnadozie

Defenders: Josephine Chukwunonye; Ngozi Ebere; Faith Ikidi; Ugo Njoku; Osinachi Ohale; Glory Ogbonna

Midfielders: Rita Chikwelu; Ngozi Okobi; Ini-Abasi Umotong; Ogonna Chukwudi

Forwards: Francisca Ordega; Desire Oparanozie; Courtney Dike; Esther Sunday; Anam Imo.",http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43597290
25,nigeria,"The UN has allocated 11 million dollars (about N4 billion) to help 60,000 internally displaced people in Borno and other humanitarian operations in North-East Nigeria.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said nine billion dollars (about N3.2 billion) would be used to provide life-saving aid for some 60,000 people displaced by ongoing Boko Haram crisis in Borno.

The UN quoted Mr Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, as saying: “The crisis continues to displace thousands of vulnerable women, children and men every week.

“Many have gone through unspeakable hardship and the UN and its partners remain committed to help alleviate their suffering.’’

Set up through the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF), the assistance includes two million dollars (about N720 million) in support to the UN Humanitarian Air Service for frontline responders in the region.

“This UN fund give us the flexibility to prioritise those who are most in need of aid and act swiftly for the good of the people of north-east Nigeria,” Kallon said.

The UN said the North-east region’s humanitarian crisis, sparked mainly by Boko Haram’s years-long insurgency, remained one of the most severe globally.

“In the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, at least 7.7 million people are in need this year, with about 80 per cent, or 6.1 million, targeted for humanitarian assistance.

“The nine million dollars allocation will help fund 15 projects supporting humanitarian rapid response in areas affected by large-scale conflict-related displacements, particularly in the northern parts of Borno, along the Maiduguri-Monguno axis.

“In just three months, the close to 30,000 people who have fled violence in hard-to-reach areas are in dire need of food, water, shelter, clothes and medical services.

“Additionally, the funds will help scale up the response near the border with Cameroon in eastern Borno – Gwoza, Bama, Dikwa, Kala-Balge, Monguno, Askira/Uba – and northern Adamawa – Madagali – where approximately another 30,000 have arrived following military operations.

“Finally, the funds will also help maintain UN Humanitarian Air Service operations, crucial to reach and deliver aid in remote areas of the North-east, especially where roads are unusable,” the UN said.
