Since launching her BEYGOOD4BURUNDI initiative with UNICEF in 2017, the singer, 36, has provided programs to bring clean, safe drinking water to the landlocked East African nation with efforts to improve water, sanitation and basic hygiene practices for the population.

This year on March 22, Queen Bey has partnered with Gucci and Chime for Change to bring water to the children of Burundi and prevent water-borne diseases. In addition, fewer young girls will be put at risk of dangerous attacks when they walk long distances to gather water.

Gucci is collaborating with Chime for Change, the brand’s global campaign co-founded by Beyoncé and actress Salma Hayek Pinault to convene, unite and strengthen the voices speaking out for girls and women around the world with focuses on education, health and justice.

In 2017 alone, 35 wells were constructed for the people of Burundi to utilize. Gucci’s $1 million commitment to the project will help support UNICEF’s goal to build 80 more wells and give 120,000 more people access to clean water.

1,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope
2,burundi,"Burundi revokes Kosovo recognition, leaving Kosovo PM nonplussed

Almost six years after recognizing Kosovo’s independence, the state of Burundi has revoked its decision, Serbian media report.

The African state of Burundi reversed its decision to recognize Kosovo’s independence, Serbian media reported on Tuesday. The decision was first reported, inauspiciously, on February 17, when Kosovo marked its 10th anniversary of independence. It was confirmed during yesterday’s visit of Burundi’s Foreign Minister Alain Aime Nyamitwe in Belgrade, B92 reported.

The decision comes six years after a nota verbale recognizing Kosovo’s independence was sent to current Kosovo Foreign Minister Behgjet Pacolli, a deputy prime minister at the time.

Kosovo’s Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj acknowledged the news about the revocation after a government cabinet meeting on Wednesday, expressing uncertainty over the reasons.

“We are not protected from revocations of recognitions, this possibility exists. I don’t know how the revocation from Burundi came about, but we are interested that nobody damages Kosovo’s interests and its strategic plan,” Haradinaj said.

According to B92, Nyamitwe said that Burundi withdrew its recognition because of the country’s foreign policy principles.

On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo Enver Hoxhaj said on Twitter that Serbia’s lobbying efforts to get recognitions revoked are making the dialogue between the two countries impossible. He did not mention Burundi specifically.

“Kosovo will act proportionally because such actions are against normalizing relations,” Hoxhaj said.","Burundi revokes Kosovo recognition, leaving Kosovo PM nonplussed",http://prishtinainsight.com/burundi-revokes-kosovo-recognition-leaving-kosovo-pm-nonplussed/
3,burundi,"SEATTLE — On March 22, the news of Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day was announced worldwide. This announcement helped raise awareness of World Water Day and the need to recognize the world’s need for clean water.

Approximately 40 percent of Burundi’s population does not have access to safe and clean drinking water, putting their health at risk. In fact, the leading cause of death in children under the age of five is water and sanitation-related diseases. Even if these diseases do not lead to death, they still affect the growth rate and health of children, as 29.2 percent of children under five suffer from malnutrition.

Burundi’s water supply endured years of destruction during the country’s civil war. During this time, several kilometers of water pipes were sabotaged, denying thousands of people access to water.

Burundi’s drinking water is also limited by the country’s rapid population growth. The current population of 10.5 million people is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.9 percent, putting further strain on the limited water supply. About 2.2 million people spend more than 30 minutes a day collecting water, most of whom are women and children.

Beyoncé, after recognizing Burundi’s dire need for water, began her program BeyGOOD4BURUNDI in July 2017, a multi-year initiative to improve water sanitation and basic hygiene practices in the country. Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day was the second phase of the initiative, with 85 additional wells to aid more than half a million women and children.

Many schools and hospitals throughout Burundi lack access to any water at all. Since girls require water for sanitation during their menstrual cycle, they are unable to attend school when they have their period, putting their education at risk.

March 22 was not only World Water Day, but also marked the closing of Women’s History Month. The announcement of Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day will also send a message of empowerment and affirmation to all women around the world through this mission in Burundi.

BeyGOOD does much more than simply donating money; it remains committed to actually putting in the work and monitoring the progress to make it all a reality. The organization believes that a relationship on the ground with the people is more vital than mere donations.

In 2017, 35 wells were installed, giving nearly 100,000 residents access to clean water. The additional 85 wells will allow close to half a million people to be serviced in new locations where these people are walking furthest for water. With the new wells, Beyoncé has set the goal to provide clean water access to more than 366,000 women and children by the year 2020.

However, in order to allow everyone clean water access in Burundi, the project requires an additional $13 million to complete this goal. BeyGOOD is planning on partnering with multiple organizations in order to hopefully end the water crisis in Burundi.

This Outlook provides an overview of the anticipated humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region from January to June 2018. It focuses on Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and neighbouring countries—including Angola, Kenya and Zambia—that have received refugees and asylum-seekers due to the DRC crisis.

The report covers: drivers of humanitarian crises in the region, particularly the intensification of violence in the DRC; manifestations of humanitarian needs, including record levels of displacement and food insecurity; and constraints to meeting humanitarian needs, including obstacles to humanitarian access and inadequate funding.

The report’s key takeaways are as follows:

• Conflict and internal violence in the DRC have intensified and spread in multiple locations, driving a severe deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the DRC and causing massive displacement, both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region.

These trends are expected to continue in the months ahead. Conflict in the neighbouring states of the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan is also expected to continue to impact the humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region.

• The Great Lakes region is experiencing economic slowdown, rising poverty and increasing costs of basic goods as a result of conflict and political instability. Unless political solutions are found to reverse the current trends, levels of vulnerability and humanitarian needs are expected to rise in the first half of 2018.

• Several locations in the region—western Uganda, north-eastern Rwanda and southern Tanzania—are expected to face higher chances of above normal to normal rainfall from March to May 2018, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides.

• Displacement of populations is increasing at an alarming rate. Nearly 2.8 million people were newly displaced inside, into or from the Great Lakes region in 2017, including about 2.1 million newly internally displaced in the DRC following an escalation in conflict and internal violence in multiple locations. There are now about 7.4 million people internally displaced or living as refugees/ asylum seekers in or from the region1—primarily as a result of the conflicts in CAR, the DRC and South Sudan, and the situation in Burundi—and displacement is expected to rise in the months ahead.

• There is a deepening food insecurity and nutrition crisis in the region, largely driven by conflict, leaving some 10.9 million people severely food insecure at the end of December 2017 across the DRC (7.7 million people), Burundi (2.6 million), Uganda (441,000) and Tanzania (120,000). Over 2.2 million children are estimated to be severely malnourished in the DRC and an estimated 70,000 children under age 5 require treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Burundi. Food insecurity could deteriorate in the coming months if fall armyworm is not contained.

• The region is battling simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases. The DRC is facing its worst cholera epidemic in 15 years, and cholera cases have also been reported in Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. A high malaria burden— especially in Burundi—is expected to worsen during the upcoming rainy seasons in the region.

• Humanitarian access continues to be impeded by direct attacks and widespread insecurity in the DRC, with this trend expected to continue in the months ahead if violence intensifies and spreads.",Regional Humanitarian Outlook for the Great Lakes: January - June 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/regional-humanitarian-outlook-great-lakes-january-june-2018
5,burundi,"The UN Security Council on Wednesday urged the government of Burundi to engage in meaningful talks with the opposition ahead of the 2020 elections, saying it was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in the African nation.

The statement also offered support to the African Union's efforts to help resolve the Burundi conflict, but called on regional states to ""refrain from any interference.""

The Council is ""deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community (EAC), and the lack of engagement"" by the Burundi government read the statement adopted by the 15-member Council.

The international body expects elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi to be ""free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties,"" and to ""ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process,"" the statement said.

The Council however underscored its ""deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180 000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429 000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.""

The government of Burundi has ""the primary responsibility ... for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable.""

The statement also urged Burundi to resume its cooperation with international groups, especially the United Nations.

Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza, first elected to office in 2005, ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution.

That grip on power triggered violence that left at least 1 200 people dead and sent more than 400 000 Burundians fleeing abroad.

Nkurunziza has set May 17 as the date for a referendum on a constitutional reform that would enable him to serve two seven-year mandates from 2020.

6,burundi,"On May 17 2018, Burundian citizens using the referendum vote, will decide whether their country will adopt a new constitution or remain with the old and controversial one. In order to allow all political stakeholders to have a say on the constitutional reforms, the government will need to ensure there is an even playing field. Hopefully, this will reduce tensions and add more credibility to the vote. By PATRICK HAJAYANDI.

In the run-up to the referendum, a lot of contradicting views have emerged regarding the real motivation behind the upcoming constitutional reform and the timing of such an important political event. Some political analysts and commentators argue that the main purpose of the new constitution will be to allow the incumbent president to extend his tenure in office. They go as far as to prophesy on a possible outbreak of deadly violence.

A number of other people support the process arguing that Burundi, has full rights to organise such a political consultation of the population. They also point out, the need to review a constitution which has been criticised for containing a number of loopholes and numerous conflicting interpretations. Indeed, the position of the constitution on some aspects is sometimes ambiguous and requires the interpretation by the constitutional court.

The recent exchange between Professor Stef Vandeginste and Ambassador Anatole Bacanamwo via the Iwacu Newspaper brings to light a number of the constitutional clauses which need clarification or in which there is no unanimous position as to how they should be comprehended.

Firstly, there are constitutional loopholes related to the concomitant interpretation of articles 96 and 302 of the current constitution in relation to presidential tenure in office. For example, article 302 has been interpreted as referring to the terms in office, as far as the opposition is concerned. But the same has been considered as a reference to the mode of election for the ruling CNDD-FDD – curiously, everyone seems to be correct in his interpretation. The conflicting interpretation of the two articles is considered one of the key factors that have led to the sharp disagreement between the ruling party and the opposition, ultimately culminating in the actual political crisis.

Secondly, in relation to the process of the referendum itself, it is becoming obvious that the current constitution is not very clear on some important aspects of how the constitutional reform needs to be carried out. For instance, Prof Vendeginste shows that there is no clarity to whether the referendum should be considered as a decisional act or a mere popular consultation. In addition to this, in order for a constitutional amendment to be adopted, the actual constitution does not clarify what is the required quorum of voters.

Thirdly, there has been a debate about the lack of clarity with regards to how constitutional reforms are adopted after the referendum. Ambassador Bacanamwo argues that, after the referendum vote, the President of the Republic has the power to promulgate the new fundamental law while Prof. Vendeginste argument shows that new constitution can only be promulgated after it has been adopted by the Parliament and Senate. The few constitutional aspects and loopholes mentioned above show that the existing constitution needs to undergo some reforms for more clarity.

Beyond the constitutional clauses and confusing articles, there is a need to also clarify what comes first between the Arusha Peace, Reconciliation Accords and the current Constitution. According to the views of opposition leaders, the Arusha Accords signed in 2000 and hailed to have brought an end to the ethnic conflict, have a supra-constitutional status which gives them a privileged position vis-a-vis the 2005 constitution. For the ruling party, the constitution is without discussion is the supreme law and no other agreement should pretend to replace it or to hold the same status. According to CNDD-FDD members, the Arusha Accords on their own did not bring an end to the conflict, however, the Global Ceasefire Agreement signed in November 2003 needs to be taken into consideration as the ultimate step that led to an effective ceasefire and the end of hostilities.

There is a feeling that the eternal reference to Arusha Accords reduces to almost nothing the progress made in terms of curbing ethnic cleavages. Indeed, the accords have played an important role in diffusing ethnic tensions and in creating a new political landscape where the front line is characterised by more political struggles and less ethnic confrontation. The impact of Arusha Accords is highlighted by the development of cross-ethnic cooperation among political leaders. Today, the co-operation across ethnic lines is becoming an imperative for any group hoping to be taken seriously or attempting to gain political legitimacy from the population. Cross-ethnic collaboration is observed in various contexts- for instance, despite the fact that the CNDD-FDD is described as a pro-Hutu party, it is also true that it has the highest proportion of Tutsis within its leadership and ranks compared to all other political parties. Also, when you look at the various opposition platforms one notices the presence of both Hutu and Tutsi leaders collaborating on different political projects. Ethnic cleavages are gradually being replaced by political struggles for power by an ethnically heterogenous elite.

In return, this has been a very important factor in the prevention of massive violence and the likelihood of genocide. In view of the above, it seems that the Arusha Accords have fully played their role. In the long run, however, Arusha Accords may end up becoming irrelevant for the Burundian context, especially if the political elite continues to collaborate across ethnic lines and if the ethnic quotas remain incorporated in the constitution.

Also, the Arusha Accords should not be looked at as a panacea. As reflected in the current constitution, the accords have become, in some ways, a hindrance to well-functioning government institutions. Some constitutional dispositions which oblige the winning party to compulsory include the opposition members in the government have proven to be counter-productive. They have created a political system in which political affiliation has more importance than the performance. This has a very negative influence on the implementation of development policies.

The need for constitutional reforms is actually something on which many Burundians agree on. The stumbling block has been on how to introduce the reforms in a more inclusive way. Otherwise, the new project of the constitution has been elaborated with the prospect of addressing the obviously crucial issues which do not allow government institutions to be more efficient as a result of intra-institutional opposition. Whether the new constitution will strengthen political institutions and enable them to address the deep-rooted problems of bad governance, equitable distribution of the scarce resources and endemic corruption is yet to be seen. Another problem the new constitution will try to address is related to keeping or removing ethnic quotas in the constitution. According to the new bill, the Senate will have the power to decide within a period of five years, whether ethnic quotas should remain or be removed from the reviewed constitution. This perspective is important but at the same time it has enormous political implications on the stability of the country and should be approached cautiously.

Obviously, the debate around the new constitutional reforms and how they may affect the Burundian nation remains fierce but almost limited to the elite level. In a country where a considerable mass of the population is mostly composed of peasants living in rural areas (around 80%) and whose prominent needs are almost limited to security, food, shelter, education and health, the vicious and elitist debate on referendum should not be viewed as a factor to prompt violence. If violence is to occur at any time during the referendum process, it would be a result of political manipulation and would be an exogenous factor, therefore, the referendum process should not be reduced to being portrayed as a potential source of violence.

Unfortunately for the upcoming referendum, the opposition is once again calling for a boycott. This is yet another wrong decision with null effect on the outcome of the vote. Instead of alarmism and calls to boycott the constitutional referendum, the opposition leadership should rather encourage its supporters to take part in the electoral campaign for the YES or NO vote. Political participation rather than the electoral boycott is likely to have an influence on the new reforms. The victory of the YES or the NO vote will determine which constitution the country will have in the coming years. The participation of the opposition in the referendum process will be a valuable occasion to collect important information on how it is performing, on its popularity and on possible readjustments in perspective of the upcoming elections in 2020. In order to allow all political stakeholders to have a say on the constitutional reforms, the government will need to ensure there is an even playing field. Hopefully, this will reduce tensions and add more credibility to the vote. DM

from PHYLLIS BIRORI in Kigali, Rwanda

KIGALI, (CAJ News) – THE tense relations between Burundi and Rwanda have deteriorated further after Burundi accused its Central African neighbours of expelling more than 1 600 refugees Burundian refugees.

Burundi alleges these have been deported since the beginning of April because they refused to be recruited to join the armed groups in order to attack their country.

Among those deported to Burundi are women and children.

Rwandan authorities said the refugees expelled had refused to register and formalize their stay.

Philippe Nzobonariba, the spokesperson of the Burundi government, refuted the position by Rwanda.

“The official argument put forward to justify their deportation is unfounded,” he lashed.

He said the Rwandan authorities had also violated the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes region.

Eleven governments in the volatile region signed the pact in 2006 to enhance security.

Nzobonariba said Burundi therefore strongly condemned attempst by Rwanda to destabilize Burundi by exploiting the vulnerable conditions of refugees by enlisting them in criminal activities.

“The forced enlistment of refugees including children minors in armed groups is a serious violation of international treaties and conventions that Rwanda has itself ratified.”

While Rwanda had not commented on the allegations, President Paul Kagame, who is also President of the African Union Commission, pledged his commitment to the AU principle of good neighborliness.

Relations between Kagame and Burundi counterpart, Pierre Nkurunziza, have been tense since the latter opposed Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term in 2015. Kagame was accused of aiding a coup that sought to unseat Nkurunziza.

Then, Burundi expelled Rwandan diplomat, Desire Nyaruhirira, whom it accused of “trying to destabilize the country.” – CAJ News","Refugees expulsion deepens Burundi, Rwanda tiff",http://cajnewsafrica.com/2018/04/06/refugees-expulsion-deepens-burundi-rwanda-tiff/
8,burundi,"THE CRISIS IN 2018

A major crisis fast deteriorating.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where one of the world’s major humanitarian emergencies is unfolding, has seen a significant escalation of conflict and violence.

Vast swaths of the national territory, previously untouched by armed conflict, have experienced extreme levels of violence in 2017. More than 2.2 million people were forced to flee their homes, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to 4.5 million by December 2017 – the highest number of any country on the African continent.

An increasing number of refugees from neighboring Burundi, Central African Republic and South Sudan sought sanctuary within the DRC’s borders. This situation was compounded by deepening levels of vulnerability, adding to the burden of epidemics, malnutrition and food insecurity. The deterioration of the situation has prompted the humanitarian community to declare three areas of the country in “Level 3 crisis”, in the Kasai Region and in the East. Projected humanitarian needs have more than doubled, from 7.3 million people in need in 2017,to 13.1 million for 2018.

The developments in 2017 were also a shocking reminder of the highly dynamic, unpredictable and complex nature of the humanitarian crisis in the DRC – a clear contrast to the typical portrayal of the DRC’s humanitarian crisis as a chronic and protracted emergency. The context remains marked by high vulnerability of populations, a consequence of decades of local and regional security instability, especially in the East.

In the statement, the Council also “strongly” condemned human rights violations committed in the country, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, forced disappearance, torture and harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and journalists.

The Security Council also reiterated its “regret” at the Government’s decision to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) and called for a swift solution through dialogue between the UN human rights arm and Burundi in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its mandated activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions.

Also in the statement, the 15-member Council voiced concerns over the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation in the country and, in the context of Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, called on those Governments to ensure that the return of the refugees is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

According to estimates, some 180,000 people remain displaced within Burundi and more than 429,000 have sought refuge across its borders.

10,burundi,"analysis

Burundi will hold a referendum in May 2018 on a constitutional amendment that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power past 2020. The proposed changes would weaken the representation of minority groups in Parliament and further threaten the Arusha peace deal that ended the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war.

The amendment process has been marred by inadequate consultation and an absence of political freedom. With Burundi's tenure on the Peace and Security Council (PSC) ending this month, the African Union (AU) has the opportunity to take a firm stand and end its lacklustre response to the Burundi crisis.

The constitutional amendment is Nkurunziza's second attempt to change the Constitution, after he failed in March 2014. He contested and won the 2015 elections owing to a controversial court ruling. This secured his third term in office and plunged the country into political turmoil that has so far undermined international responses.

Constitutional revisions often produce the same result as power grabs through military coups d'état

Former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, the East African Community (EAC) facilitator of the stalled inter-Burundian dialogue, has warned against the constitutional review, saying it could increase instability in the country.

The proposed changes provide for a limit of two presidential terms, but each term is increased from five to seven years. This could allow Nkurunziza to run for re-election in 2020, and potentially again in 2027, despite having served three terms under the current Constitution.

The constitutional amendments have also been criticised because they would undercut the representation of minority groups in Parliament. The changes could replace the two-thirds majority required to pass legislation with a simple majority.

The two-thirds provision was part of the ethnic and political power-sharing component of the Arusha peace agreement. Although the rule on 60% Hutu and 40% Tutsi representation in the National Assembly remains, the simple majority erodes the built-in mechanism that allows Tutsis' input on critical matters.

The draft constitution also replaces the provision for two vice presidents - one from the opposition and the other from the ruling party - with one vice president and one prime minister. The vice president, who has limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the president, but the influential prime minister will be appointed by the president from the ruling party.

The creation of the prime ministerial position is apparently aimed at appeasing individuals in the ruling National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) who want the presidential position for themselves, but are hamstrung by Nkurunziza's grip on power.

The AU called for consensus among all stakeholders on the proposed constitutional reforms in Burundi, but to no avail. Since May 2017, when Nkurunziza appointed a 15-member committee to draft the proposed changes, the process has been shrouded in secrecy. Critics of the process have reportedly been harassed and arrested by the government.

Through all this, the government has avoided engaging Parliament in an attempt to offset criticism from both opposition members and members of the ruling party who oppose the review. Moreover, the ruling party doesn't have the parliamentary majority needed to unilaterally approve the constitutional amendment.

The AU has the tools to encourage democratic changes of government - it must use them

The AU's unclear position on constitutional reviews in general has not helped matters. Under the AU's watch, countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Chad and Djibouti have altered their constitutions based on an individual's quest to stay in office.

The AU has tools to encourage democratic changes of government, and should use them. Article 23.5 of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance prohibits 'any amendment or revision of the constitution or legal instruments, which is an infringement on the principles of democratic change of government'.

While the AU has called for adherence to the Arusha peace deal and broader consensus, it has not spoken out about the implications of the review process on the African Charter. Burundi has signed but not ratified the charter, and so isn't legally bound by it. By signing, however, Burundi is required to refrain from acts that undermine the charter's purpose. Burundi is also party to several AU declarations as well as the protocol establishing the PSC, which calls for sanctions in cases of unconstitutional changes of government.

The charter mandates the AU Commission to 'evaluate compliance by States Parties' on matters relating to democracy, elections and governance. This has not happened and the commission has generally been non-committal about constitutional review processes. In many cases, these revisions produce the same result as the power grabs by military regimes through coups d'état.

While coups are unacceptable to the AU, there is as yet no precedent when it comes to regimes that stay on thanks to constitutional changes.

The AU has also made contradictory statements that send the wrong message to Burundian authorities about democratic values and human rights. A recent example is when the AU in January condemned the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to open an investigation in Burundi.

With Burundi steering AU policy on the International Criminal Court, human rights won't come first

Burundi is the interim chair of the AU's open-ended ministerial committee on the ICC - a committee established to follow up on the AU's concerns about the court. Over the years, the AU has allowed the 'pen holder' (the chair) to set the agenda and tone of its decisions. As committee chair, Burundi pushed for the AU to reject the ICC investigation, with other AU member states endorsing the decision for the sake of African solidarity.

This is unfortunate because African states hold different opinions in other forums such as the UN and the ICC - where some have supported the court and expressed dismay at Burundi's withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi has also refused to allow observers, including those of the AU and UN Human Rights Council, to operate freely in the country.

Since January 2016, when the AU Assembly rejected the PSC's decision to send a mission to Burundi, the AU's overall capacity to address the crisis has been limited. The PSC has focused on broader thematic issues, with fewer meetings on country-specific situations like the Burundi crisis.

Burundi's two-year tenure on the PSC ends in March 2018, and this could present a unique opportunity for the AU. During its membership in 2016 and 2017, Burundi was able to dilute discussions on its own instability. Indeed, the PSC's most recent meeting on the issue - in October 2017 - came a full year after its previous meeting on Burundi.

The October 2017 meeting produced a communiqué that was devoid of decisions on how the AU could help solve the crisis. This was not surprising, since Burundi chaired the PSC at the time, and the 'pen holder' situation prevailed.

With Burundi out of the PSC, the AU can deliver on its obligation to defend human rights and democracy in the country. This should include a concerted effort to impose targeted sanctions 'against all the Burundian stakeholders whose actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the search for a solution', as agreed by the PSC in 2015. The PSC should also use its mandate under the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to take a firm stand on the ongoing constitutional review.

Meet the 2,523 strange refugees from Burundi.

At around 6am, Rwandan authorities packed them in several dozen buses with all their belongings. They had been housed in a transit center in Gashora, Bugesera district.

In a journey that lasted about one hour they were at the Nemba border.

Inside the buses, they were singing religious songs. Some buses were loaded with only luggage – basically everything they own.

Along the highway, the Rwandans they passed shouted: “mutahe ntimuzagaruke!!!” (go and never come back!!!).

At the border, Rwandan officials recorded each of them as they crossed over. On the Burundi side of the one-stop border, the refugees were received by armed Burundian police and soldiers.

The buses carrying belongings were allowed to cross over to Burundi side. But there were no vehicles waiting to transport the refugees. It is unclear where they will be headed next.

Thus far is the story of the Burundians who on the afternoon of March 7 arrived at the Rwandan border in Rusizi district from Congo. Tired and desperate, they were narrating tales of unimaginable suffering back in the Congolese regions of South Kivu.

They had walked days to get to Rwanda. The refugees said Congolese villagers and armed gangs attacked them.

But then what followed has left Rwandan officials baffled. The refugees refused to be registered as is the common practice. The parents holding sick babies refused to hand them over for treatment and immunization against polio and Rubella.

Since eastern Congo is facing a cholera outbreak, there are treatment facilities along all border entry points. They refused to be tested or even wash their hands.

That was only the beginning of the weeks Rwandan officials may never forget. Refugees also refused packed food, demanding that they be given ONLY fresh food harvested by themselves. Up until last week, the refugees have locked themselves away, avoiding any contact with Rwandans.

Last week, Rwanda decided to relocate them to permanent structures in other areas. They were moved to a transit center in Gashora, in Bugesera district – which is about an hour from Burundi.

As they disembarked from buses at the border, journalists struggled to find any who could talk. They were only shaking their heads – looking irritated by the rampaging media.

Some did speak though. A man said Burundi must accept them with their religious beliefs. “The Virgin Mary has guided us from wherever we have been and will look after us. We cannot abandon God,” he said.

“The Congolese chased us from their country because they detested our faith, God have mercy on them.”

Asked why they had refused all help, food and treatment from Rwanda, he responded: “God takes care of everything. Those medicines damage our bodies and kill the soul.”

An elderly woman said she was happy with how they had been received in Rwanda. “Our Rwandan brothers and sisters treated us very well. Even those who had been detained were released. We are all going home. The Virgin Mary is our God should bless the Rwandans.”

These refugees are said to belong to an obscure Catholic sect that follows a female prophet called Zebiya and they claim to have fled Burundi due to religious persecution and yet they have now decided to go back.

On March 28, the Burundians moved their resistance to another level – trying to hold a protest. Rwandan Police detained some 33 of the ringleaders. They were released and are heading home.

Meanwhile, in Rwanda there has been already more than 90,000 Burundian refugees in several camps. At least a dozen arrive daily – often at night, according to UN agencies.

There are also thousands of other Burundians living in neighborhoods across Rwanda. They are running businesses.

At The Nemba border, there are no Rwandan vehicles going to Burundi as they were banned. But Burundian vehicles are coming to Rwanda.

According to available figures, 60,600 Burundians visited Rwanda between November 2016 to February 2017. They are regular travellers who visit and return to Burundi. For February 2017 alone 13,600 visited Rwanda.

Along with human traffic, come the vehicles. Some 5,700 vehicles entered Rwanda in the same period. For February 2017 alone, 1,400 Burundian vehicles came here and went back.

Back at the Nemba border as the Burundians crossed, they were being collected at spot besides the border post by their Burundian security.

The Rwanda government informed Burundi that it’s people had decided to go home on Friday. But today, there were no vehicles waiting to transport them.

It remains unclear whether they will stay at the border, or will be asked to walk to their next destination.",Burundi’s Strange Refugees,http://ktpress.rw/2018/04/burundis-strange-refugees/
12,burundi,"Background

In the evening of Wednesday the 24 January 2018, refugees fleeing fighting in South Kivu started streaming in Makamba and Rumonge Provinces aboard boats. Since August 2017, the security and humanitarian situation has significantly deteriorated in South Kivu, more specifically on the axis Sebele ‐Kikonde‐Kazimia, the southern coast of Kazimia (Yungu, Talama) and the coastal communities of Ubwari in the Fizi area. On-going clashes between the army FARDC (Democratic Republic of Congo Armed Forces) and the Mai Yakutumba rebel armed group—claiming to be from the National People's Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNSPC)—are behind this deterioration of the situation since January 2018. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is alarmed by a recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is driving large numbers of Congolese to flee eastwards to neighbouring Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. Thousands of children, women and men have abandoned their homes, in the midst of intensified military operations against Mai-Mai armed groups in South Kivu province. Almost 7,000 people have crossed to neighbouring Burundi and an additional 1,200 to Tanzania. It is believed that many more are displaced inside South Kivu in difficult conditions without shelter or food.

Refugees that ACT members have spoken to say they fled forced recruitment, direct violence and other abuses by armed groups. Others say they fled in anticipation of military operations and out of fear. It is imperative that people fleeing the violence are allowed safe passage, and that humanitarian access to the internally displaced is facilitated. Those refugees seeking to reach Burundi are mainly doing so by crossing Lake Tanganyika on small fishing boats. As of 28 January 2018, according to authorities in Burundi, 8,152 persons have crossed Lake Tanganyika and settled into Burundian provinces of Rumonge and Makamba (this includes 6,934 Congolese and 1,218 returning Burundians). On 29 January 2018, 823 additional persons arrived in Burundi. It is therefore estimated that a total of 9,078 people crossed to Burundi so far. The most probable scenario of the humanitarian community (confirmed by UNHCR) is a total number of 15,000 Congolese refugees and 2,000 Burundians fleeing DRC. The worst-case scenario is as high as 50,000 to 60,000 persons moving into Burundi due to the crisis in DRC.",ACT Alliance Concept Note BDI181: Emergency Assistance to Congolese Refugees in Burundi,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/act-alliance-concept-note-bdi181-emergency-assistance-congolese-refugees-burundi

Highlights and Operational Context

Some 430,000 Burundian refugees are being hosted across the region by the governments and people of Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.

The recent surge in violence in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is driving large numbers of Congolese to flee to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, which is straining resources and negatively impacting the response to Burundi refugees and returnees in those countries. During January 2018, Uganda received 10,533 asylum seeks from DRC, Burundi over 8,000, and 1,207 persons had arrived in Tanzania.

The Government of Burundi is encouraging its citizens to sign up to cast their votes in the upcoming constitutional referendum scheduled for May 17.

The constitutional referendum proposes to change the length of the presidential term from five to seven years, among other changes.

Due to funding shortfalls, WFP has implemented in all camps in Rwanda a 25 per cent reduction from January onwards in food or cash assistance affecting more than 100,000 refugees from Burundi and DRC. In Tanzania, which host the majority of Burundian refugees, food rations remain at 72 per cent (reduced by 28 percent) as they have been for much of 2017.",Burundi Situation Regional Update (January 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/burundi-situation-regional-update-january-2018
14,burundi,"Silvie Bugonza* was barely 16 when she became pregnant. A hardworking student at Budahunga communal school, in northern Burundi’s Kirundo Province, Bugonza had dreams of working with the United Nations to help children frequently displaced during war. Instead, she was expelled from school because of her pregnancy, her dreams crushed. Now 19, the young mother wakes up early to feed and bathe her daughter. Then she straps the girl onto her back as she marches through dew-laden grass to fetch water.

She isn’t alone. Bugonza is part of a largely ignored social epidemic wrecking the lives of young girls and women across Burundi. Perched on rolling mountains and plateaus, the Central African country slightly smaller than Maryland has one of the highest teen fertility rates in the region — 50 percent higher than neighboring Rwanda. That is translating into an increasing number of teenage pregnancies. Burundi’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 8 percent of adolescent girls were pregnant in 2017, up from 7 percent in 2010–11.

I wish I could go back to school. Silvie Bugonza, a teenage mother expelled from school

But that’s only part of the problem. Burundi’s high rate of teenage pregnancies is increasingly finding company in another disturbing trend — girls leaving school because of pregnancies. Across the country, more than 12,000 schoolgirls are estimated to have dropped out of school due to pregnancy between 2009 and 2015, according to data from Burundi’s Ministry of Education. Once out of school, they’re even more vulnerable. The teenage conception rate in Burundi among young uneducated girls (23 percent) is almost four times the number (6 percent) for those with secondary or higher education, the data shows. And the challenges aren’t a rural phenomenon. Bujumbura, the capital, has a teenage pregnancy rate of 12 percent — a figure that climbs further to 15 percent for Ngozi, the country’s second-largest city. Though some young mothers opt out of school simply to manage newborns, many others like Bugonza are expelled or suspended from school in a conservative nation where out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a social taboo. Either way, these pregnancies mean an early end to hopes and dreams of a better future.

“There’s nothing good about being a mother,” says Bugonza. “I wish I could go back to school.”

In Mpanda village, which neighbors Bugonza’s hamlet, 18-year-old Lydia Minani* is idly lying on an old mattress, cuddling her baby as mild rain sprinkles on the flimsy tin roof of her shack. On the walls, pieces of cardboard are tacked up on the crumbling mud wall to give the baby some warmth, as a torn curtain hanging over the window blows in the wind. Minani was suspended from Gahinga secondary school in 2015 after she became pregnant. Her father accuses her of compromising their family values.

Bugonza lives with a supportive aunt now — but she too believes family taboos were responsible for her predicament. Her mother, she says, never spoke to her openly about sex and protection. That lack of education about sex and reproductive health is a key contributor to the current crisis, suggests Georges Gahungu, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) agency representative in charge of programs in Burundi. “Many girls who become pregnant don’t know their menstrual cycles,” he says.

While limiting education and career prospects, teenage pregnancies also expose girls to often fatal childbirth complications, say health experts. “Underage girls who become pregnant in their teens are twice as likely to die during childbirth,” says Jeanne Niyongabo, a gynecologist and obstetrician based in Bujumbura.

At the root of the crisis is a deeply patriarchal social structure, where girls — like Minani — often face rejection from their families when they become pregnant, says local residents and experts. “Girls do not have the power to make decisions about their health and life,” says Philippe Ntahombaye, professor of anthropology at the University of Burundi. Many teenage mothers are often forced into marriage, especially in rural areas — suggesting a deeply ingrained stigma around early pregnancy, says Ntahombaye.

To curb spiraling teen pregnancies, Burundi’s government and international organizations have launched multiple initiatives to disseminate education on sex and reproductive health. In 2016, the country’s Ministry of Education launched a Zero Pregnancies at School campaign jointly with the UNFPA to ensure that “no girl gets pregnant.” But activists say the crisis continues to spiral, and won’t come under control until the use of contraceptives, including condoms, spreads widely among sexually active youth. “Parents should not be ashamed to openly talk with their children about sex and the use of contraceptives,” says Diane Alphonso, a women’s rights activist based in Bujumbura.

That remains a challenge, because of cultural taboos that surround acknowledging sexual activity. Many teenage boys shun condoms, calling them too much of a “hassle” — and there’s no social pressure on them. That’s restricted to girls. “When a girl becomes pregnant, she is expected to drop out of school due to the perception that schoolchildren are not supposed to have sex,” says Ntahombaye.

Many school officials remain hesitant about distributing free condoms in the classroom. “I don’t think a school is the right place for distributing condoms,” says Japhet Nyandwi, a teacher at Lycée Communal school in Bujumbura. “We don’t want to encourage students to have sex.” Even parents willing to let their children use condoms are ashamed to be seen getting them for their kids.

Systemic support for teenage mothers remains a distant illusion at the moment, though the start of a debate in Burundi could signal the first stirrings of change. For thousands of girls, that change can’t come too soon.

SECURITY COUNCIL

8223RD MEETING* (PM)

The Security Council today expressed deep concern over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue and the lack of engagement by the Government in that process.

In presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7, presented by Gustavo Meza‑Cuadra (Peru), Council President for April, the Security Council welcomed and supported the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue based on the Arusha Agreement.

Expressing deep concern over the slow progress of the dialogue and calling for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in that process, the Council said it was crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections.

The Security Council further stressed that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi and called upon the United Nations, the African Union and the East African Community, among others, to coordinate their efforts in assisting stakeholders in setting outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement.

Underscoring its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the Council commended the host countries for their efforts, and called upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

Further, the Council strongly condemned all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi and reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 3:08 p.m.

Presidential Statement

The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7 reads as follows:

“The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community and the lack of engagement by the Government of Burundi in that regard. It recalls its statement S/PRST/2017/13.

“The Security Council welcomes and supports the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community, expressed at the thirtieth African Union summit and the nineteenth East African Community summit, to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue on the basis of the Arusha Agreement of 28 August 2000 and the Constitution of Burundi, and reiterates its support to the facilitation led by former President B. Mkapa under the mediation of President Museveni. The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the slow progress of this dialogue and calls for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in this process. It is crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections. The Security Council further stresses that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi.

“The Security Council underlines the utmost importance of respecting the letter and the spirit of the Arusha Agreement, which has helped to sustain a decade of peace in Burundi, and expresses concern that the situation prevailing in Burundi has seriously undermined the significant gains achieved through the Arusha Agreement, with devastating consequences for Burundi and the region. It urges the guarantors of the Agreement to meet their obligations in this regard, to ensure that the entirety of the Agreement is adhered to.

“The Security Council calls upon the United Nations, the African Union, East African Community, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the guarantors of the Arusha Agreement to coordinate their efforts of assisting Burundian stakeholders settle outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement. The Security Council notes with appreciation the readiness of the African Union to deploy the high‑level committee of Heads of State on Burundi.

“The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Burundi. The Security Council stresses the importance of implementation of the Arusha Agreement, calls upon the Burundian authorities to initiate all political initiatives through a broad consensus of all stakeholders, which requires a political and security environment that induces the confidence of all political actors and, in this regard, expresses its strong support for the African Union decision at its thirtieth summit. The Security Council expresses the need that these conditions be fully implemented in advance of planned political initiatives.

“The Security Council calls on States in the region to contribute to finding a political solution for the situation in Burundi, refrain from any interference, including through supporting the activities of armed movements in any way, and to respect their obligations under international law, and recalls in this regard commitments of the States in the region under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

“The Security Council notes its expectation that elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi will be free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties, and will ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process. It also underlines that considerable improvements to the political and human rights situation, in particular regarding fundamental freedoms, including for freedom of the press and of civil society actors such as human rights defenders, and progress on reconciliation are necessary to enable credible elections.

“The Security Council underscores its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, and commends the host countries for their efforts, and calls upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

“The Security Council notes that a number of bilateral and multilateral partners have suspended their financial and technical assistance to the Government of Burundi, in view of the situation in Burundi, and encourages bilateral and multilateral partners and the Government of Burundi to continue their dialogue with a view to the Government of Burundi creating conducive conditions for resumption of the assistance. The Security Council commends the assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral partners to alleviate the humanitarian situation and calls on Member States to continue to provide support to respond to the humanitarian needs in the country.

“The Security Council strongly condemns all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi, whoever perpetrates them, including those involving extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including those concerning children, forced disappearances, acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment, harassment and intimidation of civil society, including human rights defenders, women’s organizations, and journalists, restriction of fundamental freedoms, as well as indiscriminate use of grenade attacks, including against civilians.

“The Security Council reaffirms the primary responsibility of the Government of Burundi for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable. It urges the Government of Burundi to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations, to adhere to the rule of law, to bring to justice and hold accountable all those responsible, including members of the security forces and violent actors affiliated to political parties, for crimes involving violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights, as applicable, including those involving sexual violence and all violations and abuses against children.

“The Security Council notes the steps taken by the Government to withdraw the bans of some civil society organizations, cancel some arrest warrants and release a number of detainees following the presidential pardon on 31 December 2017. The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to take further steps to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations.

“The Security Council reiterates its regret at the decision by the Government of Burundi to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has been present in the country since 1995 to strengthen Burundi’s rule of law institutions, and calls for a swift solution through dialogue between OHCHR and the Government in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions, and fulfill its mandate. The Security Council recalls the commitments the Government of Burundi undertook during the thirty‑sixth session of the Human Rights Council to re‑establish full mutual cooperation with the Human Rights Council and OHCHR, including full cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura, and to accept the visit of a team of three experts from the Office of the High Commissioner to collect information on the human rights situation in Burundi. It notes that discussions regarding revisions to the draft memorandum of understanding between the Republic of Burundi and the United Nations concerning the updated terms for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi have been ongoing for over a year and urges the Government of Burundi to take steps to swiftly finalize the agreement with OHCHR without further delay.

“The Security Council reiterates its concern over the significant delays in the deployment of the African Union human rights observers and military experts. It supports the African Union call for the rapid signing of the memorandum of understanding relating to the activities of the human rights observers and the military experts of the African Union, which will allow the African Union human rights observers and military experts to fully operate in the country in fulfilment of their mandated responsibilities.

“The Security Council acknowledges the contribution of Burundian peacekeepers serving in United Nations- and African Union‑led peacekeeping operations and reiterates the importance of upholding the standards of the United Nations.

“The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to reengage with international partners, especially the United Nations, in a constructive manner based on mutual trust. It reiterates its full support to the Secretary‑General and his Special Envoy in their efforts to engage and work with the Government of Burundi to help overcome the current political impasse and foster an inclusive reconciliation process. It further calls on the Secretary‑General and the Government of Burundi to expeditiously finalize and implement the status of the mission agreement for the Office of the Special Envoy, in order to work with the Government of Burundi and other concerned stakeholders to support the East African Community‑led inter‑Burundian dialogue and in the areas of security and rule of law, to engage with all stakeholders to the crisis, and work with all Burundian parties to develop confidence-building measures, to improve the human rights and security situation, and foster an environment conducive to political dialogue. The Security Council welcomes the active engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission Burundi Configuration as a viable platform for dialogue between Burundi and its partners, using a holistic approach to address the political and socioeconomic situation.

“The Security Council is determined to continue to closely follow the situation in Burundi.”

GENEVA (13 March 2018) - The Human Rights Council this afternoon held an interactive dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi.

Doudou Diène, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said that the Commission would engage with authorities and stakeholders to advance its work. He called on Burundi to review its position and engage in a constructive dialogue. Fact-based information was the priority for the Commission, and it would focus on analyzing in a detailed manner the justice mechanism of Burundi in order to make recommendations that would help avoid future crises.

Francoise Hampson, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, reminded of the restrictions imposed on the media and the fact that only Government-organized demonstrations were allowed. The authorities were threatening political actors not willing to fall in line with the regime. The Commission had received information and testimonies regarding harassment committed by officials against people considering voting against proposed constitutional reforms.

Lucy Asuagbor, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, highlighted the discrepancies in funding requests from the Ministry of Interior regarding electoral procedures. Taxes on sugar and gas had increased, further burdening the population. Burundi was now in the midst of a humanitarian emergency with over three million people requiring assistance.

Burundi, speaking as the concerned country, rejected the report, stating that it was rife with false allegations. It drew the Council’s attention to the excessive enthusiasm by the Commission’s new President and his determination to extend the mandate to new areas which were not under its mandate. The use of selectivity and double standards in the Council did not ensure progress for the people who were victims of conflicts in all countries. The High Commissioner should refrain from promoting this practice. In conclusion, Burundi reaffirmed its determination to spare no effort to improve the human rights situation in the country.

In the ensuing discussion, speakers regretted that Burundi continued to refuse to cooperate with the Commission’s mandate, noting that the announcement of the referendum was an additional reason for concern since it was not preceded or accompanied by inclusive dialogue and could run counter to key provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement. Speakers reminded that the continuation of the inter-Burundian dialogue in an international format was of the utmost importance. They encouraged Burundi to step up efforts to promote and protect human rights, including by combatting poverty in rural areas. The Government had to strengthen the culture of peace and unity and fulfil its commitments to combat impunity. Some speakers condemned the interference from outside and the attitude of mentoring towards an independent State. They noted that it was clear that Western countries were showing their sympathies towards the opposition and were trying to change the political landscape in Burundi. Some speakers noted their firm and principled opposition against any politicization in the Human Rights Council. All States had the responsibility and duty to take all necessary measures to ensure that human rights were not abused to achieve narrow political interests.

Speaking were European Union, Russian Federation, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Czechia, Australia, Syria, France, China, Greece, Venezuela, Iran, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, Algeria, Switzerland, Myanmar and United States.

The following civil society organizations also took the floor: International Service for Human Rights, International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, International Federation of ACAT Action By Christians for the Abolition of Torture (in joint statement with TRIAL INTERNATIONAL and World Organisation Against Torture), Amnesty International, East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project, CIVICUS – World Alliance for Citizen Participation, and Human Rights Watch.

The Council will resume its work on Wednesday, 14 March, at 9 a.m. when it will hear an oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Eritrea, and hold a general debate on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention. In the afternoon, the Council is scheduled to hold an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on minority rights, and to hear the presentation of reports from the Forum on Minority Issues, and the Social Forum, as well as the annual report of the Chair of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures.

Presentation by the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the Commission would engage with the authorities and stakeholders to advance its work. He called on Burundi to review its position and engage in constructive dialogue. Fact-based information was the priority for the Commission. Focus would be given to analyzing in a detailed manner the justice mechanism of Burundi in order to make recommendations that would help avoid future crises. Since last September, the social, economic, and human rights situations in Burundi had not improved and the authorities had restricted cooperation with international agencies. Authorities had also rejected humanitarian response plans. The agreement between Burundi and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights remained suspended. Commission members were also subjected to threats from Burundian representatives.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said restrictions were imposed on the media and only Government-organized demonstrations were allowed to take place. Authorities were threatening political actors not willing to fall in line with the regime. The Commission had received information and testimonies regarding harassment committed by officials against people considering voting against proposed constitutional reforms. Arrests and arbitrary detentions also remained a major concern.

LUCY ASAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the Commission had found discrepancies in funding requests from the Ministry of Interior regarding electoral procedures. Taxes on sugar and gas had increased, further burdening the population. Burundi was now in the midst of a humanitarian emergency with over 3 million people requiring assistance. The Commission had collected testimony of increased border controls aimed at preventing people from leaving the country.

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the situation in Burundi deserved utmost attention from the Human Rights Council. He called on the authorities to be more open to dialogue. The Council would be updated on the situation during its June session.

Statement by the Concerned Country

Burundi, speaking as the concerned country, extended its congratulations to the former President of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi for having resigned in November 2017. His resignation was telling of the aims of this Commission. The Government had formally notified the Human Rights Council of its position on this Commission in 2016. Having in mind the multiple changes of leadership in this Commission, it was difficult to understand how it ensured the accuracy of the accusations in its report. Burundi rejected the report, stating that it was rife with false allegations against Burundi. Burundi drew the Council’s attention to the excessive enthusiasm by the Commission’s new President and his determination to extend the mandate to new areas which were not under its mandate. It brought up questions on the legitimacy of the Commission, its legal nature and the aim of its work. Burundi informed that the negotiations between the two parties were ongoing, and that the High Commissioner for Human Rights had promised to send his team in March 2018 to Bujumbura. Unfortunately, the aggressive and denigrating language used by the Office of the High Commissioner regarding Burundi was not very encouraging. In February 2017, the High Commissioner had described Burundi as one of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times. Burundi had been indignant to hear these words. The use of selectivity and double standards in the Human Rights Council did not ensure progress for the people who were victims of conflicts in all countries, and undermined international cooperation. The High Commissioner should refrain from promoting this practice. In conclusion, Burundi reaffirmed its determination to spare no effort to improve the human rights situation in the country.

Interactive Dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

European Union regretted that Burundi continued to refuse to cooperate with the Commission’s mandate and condemned all threats against the Commission’s members. The announcement of the referendum was an additional reason for concern since it was not preceded or accompanied by inclusive dialogue and could run counter to key provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement. Russia condemned ongoing attacks by extremists on civilian infrastructure in Burundi and said that interference from the outside and the attitude of mentoring to an independent State were unwelcomed. It was clear that Western States were showing their sympathies towards the opposition and were trying to change the political landscape in Burundi. Germany condemned all threats against the Commission and called on the Government of Burundi to cooperate with the Commission and the African Union. The Government was also urged to rapidly conclude the outstanding Memorandum of Understanding on the status of the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura.

Belgium applauded the persistence of the Commission in investigating grave human rights violations. The authorities were called on to reach an agreement with the Office of the High Commissioner so that they could continue their work and the Commission was asked how they would proceed with their work? Denmark noted that the situation in Burundi had not improved since the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Commission in September. Particularly worrisome was that Burundi had become the first country to leave the International Criminal Court. Spain was concerned with the gross violations of human rights, including arbitrary arrests, forced detentions, rape, and restrictions on freedom of association and expression. Burundi was urged to reconsider its decision of leaving the International Criminal Court and to implement recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review.

Czechia said the failure of Burundi to cooperate with the Commission was unacceptable. Noting the crisis that emanated from the failure to organize elections in accordance with democratic standards, Czechia said it was impossible for the proposed constitutional referendum to be credible. Australia said the Commission’s finding that most rights violations were committed by State forces was especially troubling. Australia noted African Union efforts to broker an end to the crisis and asked how the Human Rights Council could help in that process. Syria reaffirmed its position rejecting the use of human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of countries. Such practices would only hurt the credibility of the Human Rights Council. Syria welcomed Burundi’s efforts to pursue peace.

France regretted the lack of cooperation by authorities in Burundi and said it was closely following the constitutional reform process. Human rights violations committed since 2015 could constitute crimes against humanity and perpetrators must be held accountable. The crisis would only be resolved via positive dialogue. China said the situation in Burundi had markedly improved since 2015. Beijing supported all parties in Burundi in their efforts to reach consensus through consultations. The international community must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Burundi. Greece expressed concerns over the lack of cooperation by authorities and regretted ongoing rights violations in Burundi. Attacks against activists, journalists, and human rights defenders were particularly concerning. Long-term solutions required inclusive dialogue.

Venezuela recognized the political will of Burundi to improve the human rights situation in the country. Only genuine dialogue and cooperation among States could fully promote human rights. Iran reiterated its firm and principled opposition against any politicization in the Human Rights Council. All States had the responsibility and duty to take all necessary measures to ensure that human rights were not abused to achieve narrow political interests. Netherlands reminded that the majority of Burundian citizens lived in extreme poverty and in fear of arrest or disappearance when expressing an opposing political view. It raised concern about the increase in arbitrary arrests and detention, used as a tool of intimidation, targeting members of opposition parties.

Remarks by the Commission of Inquiry

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, welcomed the fact that most members of the Council had emphasized the importance of dialogue between the Commission of Inquiry and the Burundian authorities. Burundi had criticized the lack of objectivity and yet it refused the Commission the possibility of a visit. It was in the objective interest of Burundi to allow access to the Commission. It was also important that members of the Council appreciated the efforts of the African Union to push for sustainable dialogue in the country. Responding to some comments made by the delegation of Burundi, Mr. Diène explained that it was a normal practice that inquiry bodies of the United Nations changed leadership. There was a clear linkage between the political crisis and the economic, social and cultural situation, he emphasized. Economic growth was more or less negative, and Burundi had become a country of humanitarian emergency, with more than 30 per cent of the population in need.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said that the situation in Burundi was not improving in any significant way. On the contrary, information pointed to continued human rights violations as in 2017. Some refugees had returned to Burundi, but had left again because the conditions for repatriation had not been in place.

LUCY ASUAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, noted that without access to the country, the Government would always contest any report by the Commission. She pleaded once again with the Government that without access to the country, there would be no progress. A balanced report was only possible through access.

Interactive Dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

United Kingdom regretted that the Burundian Government had failed to acknowledge or address ongoing human rights violations and abuses. Genuine and inclusive dialogue around changes to the Constitution was important as well as maintaining provisions of the Arusha Accords in the Constitution. Ireland condemned the ongoing violations of basic rights, including arbitrary arrests, the increasing pressure on civil society space and house searches. Internally displaced persons and refugees were bearing the brunt of this repressive environment. Lithuania strongly condemned the decision to ban and suspend the work of independent non-governmental organizations and media. The intent to abolish the ethnic political representation quotas enshrined in the Arusha Accords by changing the Constitution were concerning.

Norway said the continuation of the inter-Burundian dialogue in an international format was of the utmost importance. Norway expressed concern that the process for constitutional reform was not being undertaken in a participatory and democratic manner. Algeria encouraged Burundi to step up efforts to promote and protect human rights, including by combatting poverty in rural areas. The Government must strengthen the culture of peace and unity and fulfil its commitments to combat impunity. Switzerland said it was closely following the situation of human rights defenders in Burundi who were facing legal action. Burundi was urged to cooperate with the Commission, including by granting it access to the country.

Myanmar welcomed Burundian efforts to ratify core human rights instruments. In order for the Human Rights Council to achieve certain outcomes, it must promote the principle of cooperation. Country-specific mandates were incapable of fostering genuine dialogue. United States said Burundi continued to commit serious human rights violations and those responsible for such crimes benefited from impunity. Burundi’s refusal to cooperate with the Commission was proof of the State’s disdain for the United Nations. It was disturbing that Burundi, given its human rights record, was a member of the Human Rights Council.

International Service for Human Rights said Burundian civil society actors, and particularly human rights defenders and journalists, had been the primary targets of systematic oppression by the authorities. Journalists and human rights defenders faced heightened risks of threats, intimidation and violent attacks. International Federation for Human Rights Leagues said a dozen people had been arrested recently. The Government was threatening the citizens in order to get them to vote in the upcoming referendum. This was not a favourable climate to hold a referendum and the new attacks and obstacles targeting civil society were very worrisome. International Federation of ACAT Action By Christians for the Abolition of Torture (in joint statement with TRIAL INTERNATIONAL and World Organisation Against Torture), said it had documented 23 disappearances, and over 90 cases of arbitrary arrests, which were perpetrated by activists in cooperation with the forces of law and order. A campaign of terror that would force the population to vote yes on a referendum that would allow the Government a second mandate, was currently in place.

Amnesty International said the country was approaching a major and decisive turning point in its history, with a referendum on constitutional amendments due to take place in May. Amnesty International had repeatedly raised the alarm about the crackdown on dissent since the start of the political crisis in 2015. It urged Burundi to allow full and unfettered access to all parts of the country to all relevant and international human rights observers. East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project said it had been three years since Burundi was plunged into a climate of fear and violence, extrajudicial torture, arbitrary detention and disappearances affecting all segments of society. All voices critical of the Government were under attack. The Commission of Inquiry had reported that there were reasonable grounds that crimes against humanity had been committed. CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation remained extremely concerned about the grave human rights violations taking place in Burundi, which showed no sign of abating. In January, at least 60 people were arrested after publicly advocating that citizens should reject the proposed constitutional amendment which would extend President Pierre Nkurunziza’s term in office beyond 2020.

Human Rights Watch said that today, after the Commission had found reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed, there was still no adequate collective action. This was even more appalling as human rights abuses were likely to increase further as the country’s political crisis deepened. A ruling party official had threatened in front of residents to “break the teeth” of those who campaigned for people to vote “no” for the proposed referendum.

Concluding Remarks

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, underlined the seriousness of the human rights situation in Burundi, which was not only the view of the Commission of Inquiry. There was no more any country in the world that could consider that human rights issues belonged only to their authorities. Burundi was a member of the United Nations and party to international human rights instruments. The Commission had the primary mandate to document human rights violations, namely gathering information at the source. The International Criminal Court had started a process that would move forward. The fact that Burundi had participated in the Universal Periodic Review was a sign of opening. The Commission was aware of the complex situation in the country. There could be no doubt that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was capable of taking necessary measures to give sense and substance between the work done by the group of experts and the Commission of Inquiry. Burundi had an objective interest that its point of view be studied at the source and reflected in the report. The High Commissioner was determined to seek dialogue and the Commission of Inquiry was determined to complete its mandate.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commissions of Inquiry on Burundi, in response to allegations of the partiality of the Commission, said anyone who had dealt with the Commission of Inquiry knew it was independent. In the case that those violations might represent international crimes, the Commission would be sure to state so. But the starting point for the Commission was human rights law. In response to the question on links with groups of experts, these had not yet been established. In response to the question about what Governments could do to help, she said they could persuade Burundi to enter dialogue with the Commission and allow humanitarian access. She also urged Governments to call on the African Union to persuade Burundi to cooperate with the Commission.

LUCY ASUAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said she had asked herself whether in any way the Commission violated the sovereignty of the Government of Burundi. The answer was no. Burundi had, by ratifying international instruments, abandoned its sovereignty and had exposed itself to accountability mechanisms. Consequently, the protection of human rights was a collective responsibility. There was a need for monitoring organisms to be able to intervene, including a monitoring organism that could investigate violations. What was of real relevance now was that cooperation from the Government was required.",Human Rights Council holds interactive dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/human-rights-council-holds-interactive-dialogue-commission-inquiry-burundi-0

Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza. [AFP]

Burundi's ruling party has bestowed the title of 'eternal supreme guide' on President Pierre Nkurunziza, a party official has confirmed Sunday, as critics claim he wants to lock in power for life.

""He is our elder, our father, our adviser,"" CNDD-FDD secretary general Evariste Ndayishimiye said in a video sent to AFP whose authenticity was confirmed by an official.

A party statement issued after a meeting on Saturday of the party's top leadership in Mr Nkurunziza's native Buye in the north of the former Belgian colony did not spell out the implications of the title.

The 54-year-old former rebel leader has ruled the densely populated central African country since 2005 after a devastating civil war.

A constitutional referendum in May could allow him to run in elections in 2020, paving the way for him to remain in power until 2034.

Critics mocked the party, with one decrying the ""cult of personality around his majesty the King Nkurunziza I"".

But another party official, who asked not to be named, insisted to AFP the move did not reflect ""an excess such as those of (former North Korean dictator) Kim Il Sung, as our detractors suggest"".

Burundi has faced a serious political crisis since Nkurunziza sought a fiercely contested third term in office in April 2015.

Post-election violence claimed at least 1,200 lives and displaced more than 400,000 people between April 2015 and May 2017, according to estimates by the International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation.

Nkurunziza has led several purges in the ranks of the former rebellion and surrounded himself with a select group of generals.

Opposition parties warn the constitutional changes could deal a death blow to the Arusha peace accords that helped to end the 1993-2006 civil war, in which more than 300,000 people died.

The Arusha accords stipulate that no president can govern the country for more than 10 years. The constitution sets a limit of two five-year mandates. Last month, it emerged that Burundians were being forced to sign up to vote in the May referendum, claims the government denied.

The constitutional amendment would extend the presidential term to seven years from five. It would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms, but won't take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza's rule to 2034.

The deputy chairman of the opposition FRODEBU party, Léonce Ngendakumana, told Reuters that citizens were being intimidated into signing up to vote in a week-long registration exercise which ended last month.

""Checkpoints have been set up, likely by youths of the ruling party, to check receipts (of registration). Students who have not been registered are sent back to do so,” Ngendakumana said last month. “This referendum is organised in total opacity and extreme intimidation. A referendum held in such conditions will result in a biased outcome.""

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 after a peace deal ended a decade of civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels, in which 300,000 people were killed.

A traveller who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters he had been stopped at a roadblock near the Rwandan border and asked to confirm he had registered. Reuters spoke to people who also reported roadblocks in central Karusi. Five people talked of roadblocks in three different locations.

The registration drive also targeted 16-year-olds, since they would be able to vote in 2020.",Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza is made 'eternal supreme guide',https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001272960/burundi-president-pierre-nkurunziza-is-made-eternal-supreme-guide
18,burundi,"OVERVIEW

Since the beginning of 2018, conflict and internal violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has intensified and spread, driving a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the DRC and causing displacement to neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region. More than 59,000 Congolese, 70 per cent of whom are women and children, crossed into Uganda from 1 January to 16 March 2018 in the wake of new violence in the Ituri and North Kivu regions of DRC. Meanwhile, at least 532 Congolese refugees in Angola were reportedly sent back to Kasai region in the DRC in February under unknown circumstances. In early March, some 2,600 Burundians, previously sheltered near Kamanyola in DRC, arrived in Rwanda through Bugarama border, reporting that they feared being forcibly extradited to Burundi.

There is a deepening food insecurity and nutrition crisis in the region, largely driven by conflict, with some 10.9 million people severely food insecure at the beginning of 2018 across the DRC,

Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania. Over 2.2 million children are estimated to be severely malnourished in the DRC and an estimated 70,000 children under age 5 require treatment for severe acute malnutrition in Burundi.

The region is battling simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases. At the end of 2017,

DRC was facing its worst cholera epidemic in 15 years. However, the number of reported cases declined in January and February 2018 compared to previous months. A new outbreak of cholera started on 12 February 2018 in Kwangwali refugee settlement in Uganda, mostly impacting newly arrived refugees from the DRC.

By Jonathan Clayton

MULONGWE, Democratic Republic of Congo – Praising the generosity of the Congolese people for hosting refugees and sharing often meagre resources, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has called on the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbours to step up efforts to find “principled, just and concrete” solutions to the complex crises of the region.

Grandi also urged the international community not to forget the inter-connected plight of millions of refugees and internally displaced people simply because they are a long way from Europe.

“I must say I am very impressed… this is not a rich area, it is a poor area and yet refugees share many resources together with the local community,” he said during a visit to this site for Burundian refugees in the troubled province of South Kivu in eastern DRC.

Funding shortages cause cuts in food rations.

“There are 35,000 Burundian refugees in this area around us … they have been given land and the children go to local schools and the refugee population can go to the health centres that are provided for the local population,” he added.

Ending a four-day visit the country, Grandi met refugees in this refugee site at Mulongwe. Several told him there was insufficent food aid after funding shortages forced the UN World Food Programme to reduce weekly rations.

A 32-year-old mother of six told the High Commissioner she now felt much safer than when she was in Burundi. However, she said there was not enough to eat and little other help, like clothes and lighting for their mud-walled temporary shelters.

“My children have to go to school barefoot, we have nothing – we left everything behind when we fled. after my husband was killed,” she said.

Grandi, who flew to Eastern Congo on Saturday (April 7) after meeting senior government officials, including President Joseph Kabila, and visiting urban refugees in the capital Kinshasa, said his visit served as a reminder that countries like DRC, which hosts a total of some 540,000 refugees, needed support.

“In many of the places where the refugees are, the impact is very substantive on the meagre resources of the local community,” he declared.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come.”

However, noting that the Great Lakes region had suffered from inter-linked crises for more than a quarter of a century, he said that a renewed emphasis on finding solutions needed to be undertaken.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come and meanwhile people are still suffering – Burundian refugees, the local population and we need to keep these people strong. We need to help the local authorities and the national authorities of Congo to bear the brunt of this hospitality,” Grandi said, adding that recent insecurity in this area had also led to large numbers of internally displaced people who also needed support.

“There is an urgent need to find principled, just, concrete and durable solutions … Many of these refugees will not trek for thousands of miles, cross the sea to remind the world of their existence... They stay here, they suffer here, but they are equally in need and they deserve our attention — our political attention to find solutions, and our humanitarian attention to bring relief to their plight,” he said.

The High Commissioner also met a group of displaced Congolese, all of whom had fled their homes in Nyanzale in North Kivu province at the end of 2017, when armed groups attacked the civilian population.

Grandi said internal displacement again highlighted the need to establish security in the affected areas and then provide longer-term assistance to encourage development to complement humanitarian initiatives.",UN refugee chief calls for solutions to crises affecting Great Lakes region,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/un-refugee-chief-calls-solutions-crises-affecting-great-lakes
20,burundi,"With Burundi leaving the Peace and Security Council this month, the AU must act decisively to stabilise the country. By Ndubuisi Christian Ani for ISS TODAY.

First published by ISS Today

Burundi will hold a referendum in May 2018 on a constitutional amendment that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power past 2020. The proposed changes would weaken the representation of minority groups in Parliament and further threaten the Arusha peace deal that ended the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war.

The amendment process has been marred by inadequate consultation and an absence of political freedom. With Burundi’s tenure on the Peace and Security Council (PSC) ending this month, the African Union (AU) has the opportunity to take a firm stand and end its lacklustre response to the Burundi crisis.

The constitutional amendment is Nkurunziza’s second attempt to change the constitution, after he failed in March 2014. He contested and won the 2015 elections owing to a controversial court ruling. This secured his third term in office and plunged the country into political turmoil that has so far undermined international responses.

Former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, the East African Community (EAC) facilitator of the stalled inter-Burundian dialogue, has warned against the constitutional review, saying it could increase instability in the country.

The proposed changes provide for a limit of two presidential terms, but each term is increased from five to seven years. This could allow Nkurunziza to run for re-election in 2020, and potentially again in 2027, despite having served three terms under the current constitution.

The constitutional amendments have also been criticised because they would undercut the representation of minority groups in parliament. The changes could replace the two-thirds majority required to pass legislation with a simple majority.

The two-thirds provision was part of the ethnic and political power-sharing component of the Arusha peace agreement. Although the rule on 60% Hutu and 40% Tutsi representation in the National Assembly remains, the simple majority erodes the built-in mechanism that allows Tutsis’ input on critical matters.

The draft constitution also replaces the provision for two vice presidents – one from the opposition and the other from the ruling party – with one vice-president and one prime minister. The vice-president, who has limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the president, but the influential prime minister will be appointed by the president from the ruling party.

The creation of the prime ministerial position is apparently aimed at appeasing individuals in the ruling National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) who want the presidential position for themselves, but are hamstrung by Nkurunziza’s grip on power.

The AU called for consensus among all stakeholders on the proposed constitutional reforms in Burundi, but to no avail. Since May 2017, when Nkurunziza appointed a 15-member committee to draft the proposed changes, the process has been shrouded in secrecy. Critics of the process have reportedly been harassed and arrested by the government.

Through all this, the government has avoided engaging Parliament in an attempt to offset criticism from both opposition members and members of the ruling party who oppose the review. Moreover, the ruling party doesn’t have the parliamentary majority needed to unilaterally approve the constitutional amendment.

The AU’s unclear position on constitutional reviews in general has not helped matters. Under the AU’s watch, countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Chad and Djibouti have altered their constitutions based on an individual’s quest to stay in office.

The AU has tools to encourage democratic changes of government, and should use them. Article 23.5 of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance prohibits “any amendment or revision of the constitution or legal instruments, which is an infringement on the principles of democratic change of government”.

While the AU has called for adherence to the Arusha peace deal and broader consensus, it has not spoken out about the implications of the review process on the African Charter. Burundi has signed but not ratified the charter, and so isn’t legally bound by it. By signing, however, Burundi is required to refrain from acts that undermine the charter’s purpose. Burundi is also party to several AU declarations as well as the protocol establishing the PSC, which calls for sanctions in cases of unconstitutional changes of government.

The charter mandates the AU Commission to “evaluate compliance by States Parties” on matters relating to democracy, elections and governance. This has not happened and the commission has generally been non-committal about constitutional review processes. In many cases, these revisions produce the same result as the power grabs by military regimes through coups d’état.

While coups are unacceptable to the AU, there is as yet no precedent when it comes to regimes that stay on thanks to constitutional changes.

The AU has also made contradictory statements that send the wrong message to Burundian authorities about democratic values and human rights. A recent example is when the AU in January condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to open an investigation in Burundi.

Burundi is the interim chair of the AU’s open-ended ministerial committee on the ICC – a committee established to follow up on the AU’s concerns about the court. Over the years, the AU has allowed the “pen holder” (the chair) to set the agenda and tone of its decisions. As committee chair, Burundi pushed for the AU to reject the ICC investigation, with other AU member states endorsing the decision for the sake of African solidarity.

This is unfortunate because African states hold different opinions in other forums such as the UN and the ICC – where some have supported the court and expressed dismay at Burundi’s withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi has also refused to allow observers, including those of the AU and UN Human Rights Council, to operate freely in the country.

Since January 2016, when the AU Assembly rejected the PSC’s decision to send a mission to Burundi, the AU’s overall capacity to address the crisis has been limited. The PSC has focused on broader thematic issues, with fewer meetings on country-specific situations like the Burundi crisis.

Burundi’s two-year tenure on the PSC ends in March 2018, and this could present a unique opportunity for the AU. During its membership in 2016 and 2017, Burundi was able to dilute discussions on its own instability. Indeed, the PSC’s most recent meeting on the issue – in October 2017 – came a full year after its previous meeting on Burundi.

The October 2017 meeting produced a communiqué that was devoid of decisions on how the AU could help solve the crisis. This was not surprising, since Burundi chaired the PSC at the time, and the “pen holder” situation prevailed.

With Burundi out of the PSC, the AU can deliver on its obligation to defend human rights and democracy in the country. This should include a concerted effort to impose targeted sanctions “against all the Burundian stakeholders whose actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the search for a solution”, as agreed by the PSC in 2015.

The PSC should also use its mandate under the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to take a firm stand on the ongoing constitutional review. DM

21,burundi,"Human Rights Watch welcomes the oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi.

High Commissioner Zeid said in his opening statement at this 37th session that Burundi and a number of other countries or regions in the world had “become some of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times, because not enough was done, early and collectively, to prevent the rising horrors.” We couldn’t agree more. In the case of Burundi, not only was not enough done to prevent the horrors, but today–after the Commission found “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity” were committed–there’s still no adequate collective action. This is even more appalling as human rights abuses are likely to increase further as the country’s political crisis deepens.

We continue to receive regular reports of murder, arbitrary arrest, and persecution in the country, against a backdrop of almost total impunity.

On March 8, three members of PARCEM (Parole et Action pour le Réveil des Consciences et l’Évolution des Mentalités), a Burundian human rights organization, were convicted to ten years in prison for “threatening state security.” They had been arrested in June 2017. The activists and their lawyers were absent when the verdict was announced.

Meanwhile, the Burundian authorities are organizing a referendum to amend the Constitution, planned for May this year, which would in theory allow president Pierre Nkurunziza to remain in power until 2034. On March 10, the ruling party named Nkurunziza its “Eternal Guide.”

Many Burundians who have voiced their opposition to the proposed referendum have been beaten, arrested, and detained. People have been forced to register to vote in the referendum, and some Burundians failing to prove registration have encountered problems at roadblocks or have been denied treatment at hospitals. Hate speech has increased. A ruling party official for example threatened in front of residents to “break the teeth” of those who campaign for people to vote “No” for the proposed referendum.

Instead of facing up to its responsibilities under international law, the Burundian government is in complete denial. Officials have taken insufficient measures to hold those responsible for abuses to account, and continue to refuse any form of cooperation with the Commission of Inquiry. It is high time for UN members to show there are consequences for such actions and consider suspension of Burundi’s Council membership.",Burundi in Denial as Rights Abuses Continue with Impunity,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/13/burundi-denial-rights-abuses-continue-impunity
