0,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope

2,burundi,"(Kinshasa, 10 April 2018) – CARE International is calling on donors to significantly increase their commitment to the humanitarian crisis in the DRC ahead of this week’s pledging conference taking place in Geneva.

Labelled a “silent humanitarian tsunami”, as the humanitarian situation in the DRC deteriorates dramatically, this week’s meeting will seek to raise $1.68 billion, nearly four times the amount secured in 2017.

“Every day, people across Congo are dying because of conflict and violence, and right now there’s not enough resources to help them all,” says David Bisimwa, CARE’s Emergency Coordinator in DRC. “This year, we’re expecting around 13 million Congolese will need humanitarian assistance, that’s one out of every six people. “

The scale of need in DRC is enormous. According to the United Nations, more than 7.5 million Congolese do not have enough food to eat, an increase of 30 per cent over 12 months, and more than 2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. Girls and women have suffered horrific sexual and gender-based violence, and outbreak of diseases, including cholera, measles and malaria, affect tens of thousands of people every year.

A surge in violent conflict and intercommunal tensions forced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them women and children, to flee their homes in 2017.

Escalating violence, particularly in the country’s east, has seen an exodus of Congolese seeking refugee in neighbouring countries in recent months. Refugees from DRC have sought shelter in Angola, Burundi, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

“DRC is a very complex humanitarian emergency, and more than anything people need peace. But for now we need to make sure people survive. Without sufficient funds it is impossible for us to reach all the people in need,” says Bisimwa. “Right now, aid agencies cannot reach all of the seven and a half million Congolese who don’t have enough food to eat.”

About CARE International in DRC. CARE has been working in DRC since 1994, initially responding to a refugee crisis following the Rwandan genocide. Our programs focus on the empowerment of women and young people, support for the resilience of vulnerable communities, gender, support for civil societies and community involvement for good governance.

3,burundi,"With Burundi leaving the Peace and Security Council this month, the AU must act decisively to stabilise the country. By Ndubuisi Christian Ani for ISS TODAY.

First published by ISS Today

Burundi will hold a referendum in May 2018 on a constitutional amendment that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power past 2020. The proposed changes would weaken the representation of minority groups in Parliament and further threaten the Arusha peace deal that ended the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war.

The amendment process has been marred by inadequate consultation and an absence of political freedom. With Burundi’s tenure on the Peace and Security Council (PSC) ending this month, the African Union (AU) has the opportunity to take a firm stand and end its lacklustre response to the Burundi crisis.

The constitutional amendment is Nkurunziza’s second attempt to change the constitution, after he failed in March 2014. He contested and won the 2015 elections owing to a controversial court ruling. This secured his third term in office and plunged the country into political turmoil that has so far undermined international responses.

Former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, the East African Community (EAC) facilitator of the stalled inter-Burundian dialogue, has warned against the constitutional review, saying it could increase instability in the country.

The proposed changes provide for a limit of two presidential terms, but each term is increased from five to seven years. This could allow Nkurunziza to run for re-election in 2020, and potentially again in 2027, despite having served three terms under the current constitution.

The constitutional amendments have also been criticised because they would undercut the representation of minority groups in parliament. The changes could replace the two-thirds majority required to pass legislation with a simple majority.

The two-thirds provision was part of the ethnic and political power-sharing component of the Arusha peace agreement. Although the rule on 60% Hutu and 40% Tutsi representation in the National Assembly remains, the simple majority erodes the built-in mechanism that allows Tutsis’ input on critical matters.

The draft constitution also replaces the provision for two vice presidents – one from the opposition and the other from the ruling party – with one vice-president and one prime minister. The vice-president, who has limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the president, but the influential prime minister will be appointed by the president from the ruling party.

The creation of the prime ministerial position is apparently aimed at appeasing individuals in the ruling National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) who want the presidential position for themselves, but are hamstrung by Nkurunziza’s grip on power.

The AU called for consensus among all stakeholders on the proposed constitutional reforms in Burundi, but to no avail. Since May 2017, when Nkurunziza appointed a 15-member committee to draft the proposed changes, the process has been shrouded in secrecy. Critics of the process have reportedly been harassed and arrested by the government.

Through all this, the government has avoided engaging Parliament in an attempt to offset criticism from both opposition members and members of the ruling party who oppose the review. Moreover, the ruling party doesn’t have the parliamentary majority needed to unilaterally approve the constitutional amendment.

The AU’s unclear position on constitutional reviews in general has not helped matters. Under the AU’s watch, countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Chad and Djibouti have altered their constitutions based on an individual’s quest to stay in office.

The AU has tools to encourage democratic changes of government, and should use them. Article 23.5 of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance prohibits “any amendment or revision of the constitution or legal instruments, which is an infringement on the principles of democratic change of government”.

While the AU has called for adherence to the Arusha peace deal and broader consensus, it has not spoken out about the implications of the review process on the African Charter. Burundi has signed but not ratified the charter, and so isn’t legally bound by it. By signing, however, Burundi is required to refrain from acts that undermine the charter’s purpose. Burundi is also party to several AU declarations as well as the protocol establishing the PSC, which calls for sanctions in cases of unconstitutional changes of government.

The charter mandates the AU Commission to “evaluate compliance by States Parties” on matters relating to democracy, elections and governance. This has not happened and the commission has generally been non-committal about constitutional review processes. In many cases, these revisions produce the same result as the power grabs by military regimes through coups d’état.

While coups are unacceptable to the AU, there is as yet no precedent when it comes to regimes that stay on thanks to constitutional changes.

The AU has also made contradictory statements that send the wrong message to Burundian authorities about democratic values and human rights. A recent example is when the AU in January condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to open an investigation in Burundi.

Burundi is the interim chair of the AU’s open-ended ministerial committee on the ICC – a committee established to follow up on the AU’s concerns about the court. Over the years, the AU has allowed the “pen holder” (the chair) to set the agenda and tone of its decisions. As committee chair, Burundi pushed for the AU to reject the ICC investigation, with other AU member states endorsing the decision for the sake of African solidarity.

This is unfortunate because African states hold different opinions in other forums such as the UN and the ICC – where some have supported the court and expressed dismay at Burundi’s withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi has also refused to allow observers, including those of the AU and UN Human Rights Council, to operate freely in the country.

Since January 2016, when the AU Assembly rejected the PSC’s decision to send a mission to Burundi, the AU’s overall capacity to address the crisis has been limited. The PSC has focused on broader thematic issues, with fewer meetings on country-specific situations like the Burundi crisis.

Burundi’s two-year tenure on the PSC ends in March 2018, and this could present a unique opportunity for the AU. During its membership in 2016 and 2017, Burundi was able to dilute discussions on its own instability. Indeed, the PSC’s most recent meeting on the issue – in October 2017 – came a full year after its previous meeting on Burundi.

The October 2017 meeting produced a communiqué that was devoid of decisions on how the AU could help solve the crisis. This was not surprising, since Burundi chaired the PSC at the time, and the “pen holder” situation prevailed.

With Burundi out of the PSC, the AU can deliver on its obligation to defend human rights and democracy in the country. This should include a concerted effort to impose targeted sanctions “against all the Burundian stakeholders whose actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the search for a solution”, as agreed by the PSC in 2015.

The PSC should also use its mandate under the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to take a firm stand on the ongoing constitutional review. DM

5,burundi,"“The negative forces, including the Allied Democratic Forces, continue to attack and terrify the population, causing suffering and displacement, and fuelling mistrust between the countries of the region,” said the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes, Said Djinnit.

The UN has long been engaged in efforts to bring peace and stability to the vast region, stretches across Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

It has been plagued by decades of political instability and armed conflicts, porous borders and humanitarian crises, as well as tensions over natural resources and other potentially destabilizing factors.

A key step has been the adoption of a UN-brokered accord in February 2013 aimed at stabilizing the DRC and the region.

In today’s briefing, Mr. Djinnit told the Council that while implementation of this accord, formally known as the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, has been slow and requires greater political will, it remains a vital tool to bring stability to the region.

One of the root causes of conflict in the region is exploitation of natural resources from the DRC.

“Continued illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources from the DRC contributes, as we know, to financing negative forces and deprives the country of critical sources of growth and development,” he said.

He also said that in the DRC, tensions persist between the Government and the opposition despite progress in preparations for the elections.

Mr. Djinnit noted that in Burundi, the political and human rights situation remains of great concern as the country heads towards a referendum for constitutional changes.

Further, human rights violations and impunity remain central to the instability across the region, he added, stressing that the humanitarian situation there also requires greater attention.

In a press statement issued after the briefing, the Council reaffirmed that the accord “remains an essential mechanism to achieve durable peace and stability” in the DRC and the region, and called on all signatories to fulfil their respective commitments to address the root causes of conflict and promote lasting regional development.

The accord was signed by 11 countries, namely Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The UN, the African Union (AU), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) act as guarantors of the accord. In early 2014, Kenya and Sudan became the 12th and 13th signatories of the accord, respectively.",UN Security Council urges an end to recurring cycles of instability in Africa’s Great Lakes region,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1006971
6,burundi,"UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi praises generosity of Congo, urges more international support for concrete solutions.

By Jonathan Clayton

MULONGWE, Democratic Republic of Congo – Praising the generosity of the Congolese people for hosting refugees and sharing often meagre resources, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has called on the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbours to step up efforts to find “principled, just and concrete” solutions to the complex crises of the region.

Grandi also urged the international community not to forget the inter-connected plight of millions of refugees and internally displaced people simply because they are a long way from Europe.

“I must say I am very impressed… this is not a rich area, it is a poor area and yet refugees share many resources together with the local community,” he said during a visit to this site for Burundian refugees in the troubled province of South Kivu in eastern DRC.

Funding shortages cause cuts in food rations.

“There are 35,000 Burundian refugees in this area around us … they have been given land and the children go to local schools and the refugee population can go to the health centres that are provided for the local population,” he added.

Ending a four-day visit the country, Grandi met refugees in this refugee site at Mulongwe. Several told him there was insufficent food aid after funding shortages forced the UN World Food Programme to reduce weekly rations.

A 32-year-old mother of six told the High Commissioner she now felt much safer than when she was in Burundi. However, she said there was not enough to eat and little other help, like clothes and lighting for their mud-walled temporary shelters.

“My children have to go to school barefoot, we have nothing – we left everything behind when we fled. after my husband was killed,” she said.

Grandi, who flew to Eastern Congo on Saturday (April 7) after meeting senior government officials, including President Joseph Kabila, and visiting urban refugees in the capital Kinshasa, said his visit served as a reminder that countries like DRC, which hosts a total of some 540,000 refugees, needed support.

“In many of the places where the refugees are, the impact is very substantive on the meagre resources of the local community,” he declared.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come.”

However, noting that the Great Lakes region had suffered from inter-linked crises for more than a quarter of a century, he said that a renewed emphasis on finding solutions needed to be undertaken.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come and meanwhile people are still suffering – Burundian refugees, the local population and we need to keep these people strong. We need to help the local authorities and the national authorities of Congo to bear the brunt of this hospitality,” Grandi said, adding that recent insecurity in this area had also led to large numbers of internally displaced people who also needed support.

“There is an urgent need to find principled, just, concrete and durable solutions … Many of these refugees will not trek for thousands of miles, cross the sea to remind the world of their existence... They stay here, they suffer here, but they are equally in need and they deserve our attention — our political attention to find solutions, and our humanitarian attention to bring relief to their plight,” he said.

The High Commissioner also met a group of displaced Congolese, all of whom had fled their homes in Nyanzale in North Kivu province at the end of 2017, when armed groups attacked the civilian population.

Grandi said internal displacement again highlighted the need to establish security in the affected areas and then provide longer-term assistance to encourage development to complement humanitarian initiatives.",UN refugee chief calls for solutions to crises affecting Great Lakes region,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/un-refugee-chief-calls-solutions-crises-affecting-great-lakes
7,burundi,"Human Rights Watch welcomes the oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi.

High Commissioner Zeid said in his opening statement at this 37th session that Burundi and a number of other countries or regions in the world had “become some of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times, because not enough was done, early and collectively, to prevent the rising horrors.” We couldn’t agree more. In the case of Burundi, not only was not enough done to prevent the horrors, but today–after the Commission found “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity” were committed–there’s still no adequate collective action. This is even more appalling as human rights abuses are likely to increase further as the country’s political crisis deepens.

We continue to receive regular reports of murder, arbitrary arrest, and persecution in the country, against a backdrop of almost total impunity.

On March 8, three members of PARCEM (Parole et Action pour le Réveil des Consciences et l’Évolution des Mentalités), a Burundian human rights organization, were convicted to ten years in prison for “threatening state security.” They had been arrested in June 2017. The activists and their lawyers were absent when the verdict was announced.

Meanwhile, the Burundian authorities are organizing a referendum to amend the Constitution, planned for May this year, which would in theory allow president Pierre Nkurunziza to remain in power until 2034. On March 10, the ruling party named Nkurunziza its “Eternal Guide.”

Many Burundians who have voiced their opposition to the proposed referendum have been beaten, arrested, and detained. People have been forced to register to vote in the referendum, and some Burundians failing to prove registration have encountered problems at roadblocks or have been denied treatment at hospitals. Hate speech has increased. A ruling party official for example threatened in front of residents to “break the teeth” of those who campaign for people to vote “No” for the proposed referendum.

Instead of facing up to its responsibilities under international law, the Burundian government is in complete denial. Officials have taken insufficient measures to hold those responsible for abuses to account, and continue to refuse any form of cooperation with the Commission of Inquiry. It is high time for UN members to show there are consequences for such actions and consider suspension of Burundi’s Council membership.",Burundi in Denial as Rights Abuses Continue with Impunity,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/13/burundi-denial-rights-abuses-continue-impunity
8,burundi,"SEATTLE — On March 22, the news of Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day was announced worldwide. This announcement helped raise awareness of World Water Day and the need to recognize the world’s need for clean water.

Approximately 40 percent of Burundi’s population does not have access to safe and clean drinking water, putting their health at risk. In fact, the leading cause of death in children under the age of five is water and sanitation-related diseases. Even if these diseases do not lead to death, they still affect the growth rate and health of children, as 29.2 percent of children under five suffer from malnutrition.

Burundi’s water supply endured years of destruction during the country’s civil war. During this time, several kilometers of water pipes were sabotaged, denying thousands of people access to water.

Burundi’s drinking water is also limited by the country’s rapid population growth. The current population of 10.5 million people is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.9 percent, putting further strain on the limited water supply. About 2.2 million people spend more than 30 minutes a day collecting water, most of whom are women and children.

Beyoncé, after recognizing Burundi’s dire need for water, began her program BeyGOOD4BURUNDI in July 2017, a multi-year initiative to improve water sanitation and basic hygiene practices in the country. Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day was the second phase of the initiative, with 85 additional wells to aid more than half a million women and children.

Many schools and hospitals throughout Burundi lack access to any water at all. Since girls require water for sanitation during their menstrual cycle, they are unable to attend school when they have their period, putting their education at risk.

March 22 was not only World Water Day, but also marked the closing of Women’s History Month. The announcement of Beyoncé’s plan to build wells in Burundi for World Water Day will also send a message of empowerment and affirmation to all women around the world through this mission in Burundi.

BeyGOOD does much more than simply donating money; it remains committed to actually putting in the work and monitoring the progress to make it all a reality. The organization believes that a relationship on the ground with the people is more vital than mere donations.

In 2017, 35 wells were installed, giving nearly 100,000 residents access to clean water. The additional 85 wells will allow close to half a million people to be serviced in new locations where these people are walking furthest for water. With the new wells, Beyoncé has set the goal to provide clean water access to more than 366,000 women and children by the year 2020.

However, in order to allow everyone clean water access in Burundi, the project requires an additional $13 million to complete this goal. BeyGOOD is planning on partnering with multiple organizations in order to hopefully end the water crisis in Burundi.

9,burundi,"Burundi exported 325 tons of ""Gakara rare earths"" in six months

The Director-General of ""Rainbow Mining Burundi"" (RMB), Gilbert Midende announced on Monday that Burundi has exported 325 tons of ""rare earth from Gakara"" since the start of exploitation six months ago of a mining deposit located in his province of Bujumbura-rural (west).

RMB is the Burundian branch of an international company called ""Rainbow International Resources Limited"" having obtained in 2015 from the Burundian government a license to exploit these lands.

According to the convention of exploitation of the rare earths deposit of Gakara signed between the State of Burundi and the society Rainbow International Resources Limited, the State Burundi, holder of the ""right of the ground"", has a free action of 10%, a tax of 4% on the turnover and a tax of 30% on the profit realized, throughout the process of exploitation of this mining deposit.

During a press conference in Bujumbura, Midende said that the rare earth exploitation of Gakara has created 250 jobs, with an investment of 15 million USD. He estimated that RMB planned to export 3,000 tons of rare earths abroad in 2018, ""instead of the 5,000 tons originally announced"", following realities on the ground. For Mr. Midende, the big challenge of this mining remains to date ""the insufficiency of the electrical energy"" in Burundi in general, and in the perimeter of the mining zone in particular.

With Burundi steering AU policy on the International Criminal Court, human rights won't come first

Burundi is the interim chair of the AU's open-ended ministerial committee on the ICC - a committee established to follow up on the AU's concerns about the court. Over the years, the AU has allowed the 'pen holder' (the chair) to set the agenda and tone of its decisions. As committee chair, Burundi pushed for the AU to reject the ICC investigation, with other AU member states endorsing the decision for the sake of African solidarity.

This is unfortunate because African states hold different opinions in other forums such as the UN and the ICC - where some have supported the court and expressed dismay at Burundi's withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi has also refused to allow observers, including those of the AU and UN Human Rights Council, to operate freely in the country.

Since January 2016, when the AU Assembly rejected the PSC's decision to send a mission to Burundi, the AU's overall capacity to address the crisis has been limited. The PSC has focused on broader thematic issues, with fewer meetings on country-specific situations like the Burundi crisis.

Burundi's two-year tenure on the PSC ends in March 2018, and this could present a unique opportunity for the AU. During its membership in 2016 and 2017, Burundi was able to dilute discussions on its own instability. Indeed, the PSC's most recent meeting on the issue - in October 2017 - came a full year after its previous meeting on Burundi.

The October 2017 meeting produced a communiqué that was devoid of decisions on how the AU could help solve the crisis. This was not surprising, since Burundi chaired the PSC at the time, and the 'pen holder' situation prevailed.

With Burundi out of the PSC, the AU can deliver on its obligation to defend human rights and democracy in the country. This should include a concerted effort to impose targeted sanctions 'against all the Burundian stakeholders whose actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the search for a solution', as agreed by the PSC in 2015. The PSC should also use its mandate under the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to take a firm stand on the ongoing constitutional review.

Rwanda Tuesday announced a ban on importation of sheep, goat and their products from neighbouring Burundi following reports of a viral disease outbreak.

The Minister of Agriculture, Gerardine Mukeshimana, in a statement said the Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) that primarily affects goats and sheep has been reported in Burundi’s provinces of Gitega, Mwaro, Kirundo and Karuzi.

“Movement of livestock including sheep and goat and their products; meat, hides and fertilizers from Burundi are hereby banned,” the minister said in the statement.

She appealed to livestock farmers, traders, veterinary officers and security agencies in the country and at the border points to be vigilant.

The ministry added that the ban was based on a report about the disease outbreak that was done earlier by Burundian veterinary services and sent to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

According to the FAO, PPR, also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants.

Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of an animal heard, and kill between from 30 and 70 per cent of infected animals.

The FAO said the virus does not infect humans.

In the evening of Wednesday the 24 January 2018, refugees fleeing fighting in South Kivu started streaming in Makamba and Rumonge Provinces aboard boats. Since August 2017, the security and humanitarian situation has significantly deteriorated in South Kivu, more specifically on the axis Sebele ‐Kikonde‐Kazimia, the southern coast of Kazimia (Yungu, Talama) and the coastal communities of Ubwari in the Fizi area. On-going clashes between the army FARDC (Democratic Republic of Congo Armed Forces) and the Mai Yakutumba rebel armed group—claiming to be from the National People's Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNSPC)—are behind this deterioration of the situation since January 2018. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is alarmed by a recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is driving large numbers of Congolese to flee eastwards to neighbouring Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. Thousands of children, women and men have abandoned their homes, in the midst of intensified military operations against Mai-Mai armed groups in South Kivu province. Almost 7,000 people have crossed to neighbouring Burundi and an additional 1,200 to Tanzania. It is believed that many more are displaced inside South Kivu in difficult conditions without shelter or food.

Refugees that ACT members have spoken to say they fled forced recruitment, direct violence and other abuses by armed groups. Others say they fled in anticipation of military operations and out of fear. It is imperative that people fleeing the violence are allowed safe passage, and that humanitarian access to the internally displaced is facilitated. Those refugees seeking to reach Burundi are mainly doing so by crossing Lake Tanganyika on small fishing boats. As of 28 January 2018, according to authorities in Burundi, 8,152 persons have crossed Lake Tanganyika and settled into Burundian provinces of Rumonge and Makamba (this includes 6,934 Congolese and 1,218 returning Burundians). On 29 January 2018, 823 additional persons arrived in Burundi. It is therefore estimated that a total of 9,078 people crossed to Burundi so far. The most probable scenario of the humanitarian community (confirmed by UNHCR) is a total number of 15,000 Congolese refugees and 2,000 Burundians fleeing DRC. The worst-case scenario is as high as 50,000 to 60,000 persons moving into Burundi due to the crisis in DRC.",ACT Alliance Concept Note BDI181: Emergency Assistance to Congolese Refugees in Burundi,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/act-alliance-concept-note-bdi181-emergency-assistance-congolese-refugees-burundi
13,burundi,"Silvie Bugonza* was barely 16 when she became pregnant. A hardworking student at Budahunga communal school, in northern Burundi’s Kirundo Province, Bugonza had dreams of working with the United Nations to help children frequently displaced during war. Instead, she was expelled from school because of her pregnancy, her dreams crushed. Now 19, the young mother wakes up early to feed and bathe her daughter. Then she straps the girl onto her back as she marches through dew-laden grass to fetch water.

She isn’t alone. Bugonza is part of a largely ignored social epidemic wrecking the lives of young girls and women across Burundi. Perched on rolling mountains and plateaus, the Central African country slightly smaller than Maryland has one of the highest teen fertility rates in the region — 50 percent higher than neighboring Rwanda. That is translating into an increasing number of teenage pregnancies. Burundi’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 8 percent of adolescent girls were pregnant in 2017, up from 7 percent in 2010–11.

I wish I could go back to school. Silvie Bugonza, a teenage mother expelled from school

But that’s only part of the problem. Burundi’s high rate of teenage pregnancies is increasingly finding company in another disturbing trend — girls leaving school because of pregnancies. Across the country, more than 12,000 schoolgirls are estimated to have dropped out of school due to pregnancy between 2009 and 2015, according to data from Burundi’s Ministry of Education. Once out of school, they’re even more vulnerable. The teenage conception rate in Burundi among young uneducated girls (23 percent) is almost four times the number (6 percent) for those with secondary or higher education, the data shows. And the challenges aren’t a rural phenomenon. Bujumbura, the capital, has a teenage pregnancy rate of 12 percent — a figure that climbs further to 15 percent for Ngozi, the country’s second-largest city. Though some young mothers opt out of school simply to manage newborns, many others like Bugonza are expelled or suspended from school in a conservative nation where out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a social taboo. Either way, these pregnancies mean an early end to hopes and dreams of a better future.

“There’s nothing good about being a mother,” says Bugonza. “I wish I could go back to school.”

In Mpanda village, which neighbors Bugonza’s hamlet, 18-year-old Lydia Minani* is idly lying on an old mattress, cuddling her baby as mild rain sprinkles on the flimsy tin roof of her shack. On the walls, pieces of cardboard are tacked up on the crumbling mud wall to give the baby some warmth, as a torn curtain hanging over the window blows in the wind. Minani was suspended from Gahinga secondary school in 2015 after she became pregnant. Her father accuses her of compromising their family values.

Bugonza lives with a supportive aunt now — but she too believes family taboos were responsible for her predicament. Her mother, she says, never spoke to her openly about sex and protection. That lack of education about sex and reproductive health is a key contributor to the current crisis, suggests Georges Gahungu, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) agency representative in charge of programs in Burundi. “Many girls who become pregnant don’t know their menstrual cycles,” he says.

While limiting education and career prospects, teenage pregnancies also expose girls to often fatal childbirth complications, say health experts. “Underage girls who become pregnant in their teens are twice as likely to die during childbirth,” says Jeanne Niyongabo, a gynecologist and obstetrician based in Bujumbura.

At the root of the crisis is a deeply patriarchal social structure, where girls — like Minani — often face rejection from their families when they become pregnant, says local residents and experts. “Girls do not have the power to make decisions about their health and life,” says Philippe Ntahombaye, professor of anthropology at the University of Burundi. Many teenage mothers are often forced into marriage, especially in rural areas — suggesting a deeply ingrained stigma around early pregnancy, says Ntahombaye.

To curb spiraling teen pregnancies, Burundi’s government and international organizations have launched multiple initiatives to disseminate education on sex and reproductive health. In 2016, the country’s Ministry of Education launched a Zero Pregnancies at School campaign jointly with the UNFPA to ensure that “no girl gets pregnant.” But activists say the crisis continues to spiral, and won’t come under control until the use of contraceptives, including condoms, spreads widely among sexually active youth. “Parents should not be ashamed to openly talk with their children about sex and the use of contraceptives,” says Diane Alphonso, a women’s rights activist based in Bujumbura.

That remains a challenge, because of cultural taboos that surround acknowledging sexual activity. Many teenage boys shun condoms, calling them too much of a “hassle” — and there’s no social pressure on them. That’s restricted to girls. “When a girl becomes pregnant, she is expected to drop out of school due to the perception that schoolchildren are not supposed to have sex,” says Ntahombaye.

Many school officials remain hesitant about distributing free condoms in the classroom. “I don’t think a school is the right place for distributing condoms,” says Japhet Nyandwi, a teacher at Lycée Communal school in Bujumbura. “We don’t want to encourage students to have sex.” Even parents willing to let their children use condoms are ashamed to be seen getting them for their kids.

Systemic support for teenage mothers remains a distant illusion at the moment, though the start of a debate in Burundi could signal the first stirrings of change. For thousands of girls, that change can’t come too soon.

14,burundi,"RWANDA – Drive for half an hour by four-wheel drive down a crater-strewn red dirt track off the RN3 highway to Tanzania and you descend into a vast, flat valley.

Flowing north through this plain is the Kagera river, the natural boundary separating Rwanda from its eastern neighbour. On the western side of the river, the metal roofs of thousands of brick huts glint in the sun. In less than three years, the Mahama camp has mushroomed to accommodate people fleeing Burundi.

Rwanda’s southern neighbour is now the unhappiest place in the world, according to last month’s UN annual World Happiness listing of 156 nations.

Misery around Africa’s Great Lakes

Misery appears to have a permanent home in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. Rwanda might be on the road to an improbable recovery from the 1994 genocide. But the cruelly mis-named Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) lies directly to the west, where there is a surge in sexual and ethnic violence in its lawless eastern regions. Strife in this vast country has directly or indirectly claimed six million live in the past 20 years.

Tutsi-vs-Hutu ethnic violence in Burundi

Burundi has experienced the same Tutsi-vs-Hutu ethnic violence that consumed Rwanda, which probably explains the willingness of Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s government to help people fleeing its small southern neighbour. Some people mumble that Mr Kagame doesn’t show the same empathy for refugee camps bordering DRC, into which he has launched several heavy-handed incursions in search of genocide perpetrators, and in which Rwanda has participated in two devastating wars. Reports last month that Rwandan troops crossed the border and killed five Congolese soldiers highlighted the ongoing militaristic foreign policy of post-genocide Rwanda — President Paul Kagame’s response to what he sees as the utter failure of democracy and international law to save his people.

Mahama – a model refugee camp

Nonetheless, aid workers speak of Mahama, with a population of 64,000 and growing, as an example of how to plan refugee camps. There are no tents, only small brick houses. There are health centres and washing facilities powered by solar panels. Plans are afoot to install permanent electricity supplies. UNHCR and the World Food Programme have a large presence here. But there’s no doubt who’s really charge. Senior UNHCR officials keep schtum. “The Rwandan government decides what happens here. It sees this place as a model – more of a town than a refugee camp. Authorities always say that when they’re responsible for camps – but this one does seem to be better than others ones,” says one NGO worker.

“Refugees need something to do. They need employment”

In the oppressive heat, scores of young Burundians sing while they pass buckets of cement in a line and lay bricks in the construction of a large building, on the western edge of the camp, funded by the Maison Shalom charity that became available when it won the 2016 Aurora humanitarian prize. The building will be a workshop where refugees can make clothes and earn money. “These people need something to do. They need employment,” the charity’s founder, Marguerite “Maggy” Barankitse, 62, says. She supports Rwanda’s assertiveness with NGOs: “I wish Kagame were the President of Burundi. Here, he’s thrown out over 100 NGOs. We don’t need people simply buying cars and organising workshops. Kagame said: ‘If you can’t get real results, we don’t need you.’”

Telling NGOs how to spend the money

She sucks her teeth recalling how a Belgium NGO once expressed concern to her that by helping with the development of re-education unit of Burundian convicts she would be putting the staff of that legal charity “out of jobs”. Her colleague and adopted son, Richard Nijimbere, a Burundian orphan, notes that in Burundi 40 per cent of funding comes directly from the state. In Rwanda it’s 80 to 90 per cent. That means Rwanda has more control and is able to spend the money where it’s needed rather than have things decided by officials in Geneva, he says.

People’s lives can be changed for the better

The problems in this part of the world seem vast and sometimes in intractable. But people like Barankitse and her colleagues remind us that there is much good in the world. And that people’s lives can be changed for the better. Salvator Ndikumagenge, 21, and Eric Naacayisaba, 24, both fled to the camp after violence and death threats in Burundi in 2015. Now they’re studying civil engineering at the University of Kigali, thanks to Maison Shalom funding, that became available when it won the 2016 Aurora humanitarian prize. They sing the praises of the Maison Shalom charity. “It’s beyond my ability to express how grateful we are,” Ndikumagenge says.

Hope: something priceless

But Ndikumagenge can’t see himself returning to Burundi in the immediate future. Neither can his friend. Both have left their parents and siblings in their home country who they are unable to contact. When the term time ends, and students return to the Mahama camp, a three and half hour drive to the east from Kigali. Mahama is much safer place than where they’ve come from. But life here is hard. Up to 12 people share huts consisting of just two rooms. “We get 8 kg of maize and 2 kg of beans, says Ndikumagenge: “How is that supposed to last a month?” He’d love to get a job in Rwanda once he’s graduated. But he knows that will not be easy. “I’ll try. It’s difficult for Rwandans to find work so it’s going to be more difficult for me.” Most things we take for granted are absent, or in short supply, for Burundians here. But help from Rwanda, and Maison Shalom, has given them something priceless: hope.

Marguerite Barankitse

With a personality as bright as her traditional African clothing, Marguerite Barankitse is a luminary in humanitarian circles. In Burundi in 1993, Barankitse, a Tutsu, saw her family killed by Hutu extremists.

A day later she was made to watch the slaughter of 72 Hutu friends she had tried to shelter from revenge attacks. She managed to save 25 children and formed the Maison Shalom charity, dedicated to the protection of young Burundians. By 2015, her outspoken criticism of human rights abuses put her on the authorities’ hit list and she fled to Rwanda.

She is now supported by the Kigali government,in helping Burundian refugees. She won the inaugural Aurora Prize, in 2016. This humanitarian award, dedicated to the Armenian genocide, and promoted by celebrities such as George Clooney, gave her a $100,000 to help fellow Burundians fleeing violence in their country.

The money has been spent radically upgrading the Maison Shalom facilities in Kigali and paying the students university fees. Already the Aurora Prize money has enable 365 homeless Burundian refugees to graduate in the past two years. As the winner, Barankitse was able to distribute an additional $1 million to others charities working in Rwanda, DRC, Ethiopia and Brazil.","Rwanda might be healing after the 1994 genocide, but Biblical-scale catastrophes continue in the region",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/rwanda-might-be-healing-after-the-1994-genocide-but-biblical-scale-catastrophes-continue-in-the-region/
15,burundi,"Burundi has accused Rwanda of holding Burundian refugees hostage and militarily training them to oust Pierre Nkurunziza's government.

The allegations came after more than 2,000 Burundian refugees were repatriated from Rwanda last week, with Kigali saying they refused to comply with the national laws.

Last month, 33 Burundian refugees were arrested by the Rwandan authorities allegedly for inciting fellow refugees to reject assistance from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Rwanda Foreign Affairs Ministry said a number of refugees refused to provide biometric data or comply with public health requirements and that after consultations with the UNHCR and the asylum seekers, the group preferred to be repatriated to their motherland.

The government of Rwanda said that it was ready to provide asylum to those who comply with national laws as well as the international convention on refugees.

But Burundi government spokesman Philippe Nzobonariba claimed that Rwanda does not only host the 2015 coup plotters, is also recruiting young children to join armed group.

""This constitutes a serious violation of the treaty and international conventions, which Rwanda ratified that prohibit arming and militarily train refugees,"" said Mr Nzobonariba.

Mr Nzobonariba also accused Rwanda of trying to disrupt the referendum that is expected to be conducted next month.

The refugees who were repatriated from Rwanda are believed to be followers of a Prophet Zebiya Ngendakumana, who say their faith prohibits them to use biometric registration.

""They wanted to separate us and we could not accept any separation because we always pray together and that's why we refused and decided to return to Burundi,"" said Baranjoreje Barthelemy, one of the refugees who were repatriated from Rwanda.

In September last year, at least 36 Burundian refugees, followers of Zebiya, were reportedly killed by Congolese forces during a protest in South Kivu of Kamanyola.

Early last month, the same group of Burundian refugees fled DRC to seek asylum in Rwanda but within less than a month they requested to be repatriated to Burundi.

""The refugees were received by the police at the border and identified by the police and police will continue to protect them while adopting in their new life, however, many of them testified that young people were detained with the objective to recruit and train them,"" Burundi police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye told The EastAfrican.

Burundi and Rwanda relation has continued to deteriorate since 2015 when President Nkurunziza vied for another term in office, Rwanda accused Burundi of hosting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels, who are said to have committed the 1994 genocide.

Burundi also accuses Rwanda of sheltering May 2015 coup plotters and militarily training refugees in efforts to oust the current government.

Contacted, Rwanda's State Minister for Foreign Affairs, in charge of the East African Community (EAC), Olivier Nduhungirehe said that the claims of military training were not worth commenting on.

Rwanda said all the refugees, as they arrived from DR Congo, were sent back to Burundi. There were slightly over 2,500 and were sent back to their country after they rejected biometric verification, citing religious belief.

Rwanda's Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees said the verification like vaccination is among the basic conditions they had to fulfill to be granted refugee status in the country.",Burundi Cries Foul Over Refugee Repatriations,http://allafrica.com/stories/201804100341.html
16,burundi,"KAMPALA, Uganda — A Burundian man recently deported from the United States after failing to receive political asylum has been detained without charge back home, activists said Saturday.

Clement Nkurunziza has had no access to a lawyer since his March 22 arrest, said the group iBurundi, which monitors alleged government abuses.

Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye confirmed Nkurunziza is in custody but gave no details.

Nkurunziza was arrested after arriving on a plane from the U.S., iBurundi said.

Over 1,000 people had signed an online petition urging the U.S. not to send Nkurunziza back to Burundi, saying “his life would be in jeopardy.”

But another group of Burundians signed a separate petition urging his deportation, alleging that he had a role in the killings of students during his time as president of the students’ union at the University of Burundi in the 1990s during the country’s 13-year civil war.

“When supporters of the Burundian government saw the petition urging the U.S. government to not deport him, they jumped on it and started saying he should be sent to Burundi to be jailed,” iBurundi said. It called for an independent investigation of those allegations.

Burundian prosecutors have not said what crime Nkurunziza is likely to be charged with.

Nkurunziza had fled Burundi after urging the president to retire after two terms in 2015. Deadly protests broke out when President Pierre Nkurunziza successfully sought a third, disputed, term, leaving an estimated 1,200 people dead.

The two men are not related.

The International Criminal Court judges last year authorized an investigation into allegations of state-sponsored crimes during the recent political upheaval in the East African nation that the U.N. human rights chief has called one of “the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times.”

Burundian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of serious rights abuses, saying they are the victim of propaganda by exiles opposed to the government.

Burundi’s president rose to power in 2005 following the signing of the Arusha accords ending the civil war that killed about 300,000 people. He was re-elected unopposed in 2010 after the opposition boycotted the vote. He said he was eligible for the third term in 2015 because lawmakers, not the general population, had chosen him for his first term. Critics called the move unconstitutional.

Burundi now faces a referendum in May on proposed changes to the constitution that would let the president rule until 2034.

SECURITY COUNCIL

8223RD MEETING* (PM)

The Security Council today expressed deep concern over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue and the lack of engagement by the Government in that process.

In presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7, presented by Gustavo Meza‑Cuadra (Peru), Council President for April, the Security Council welcomed and supported the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue based on the Arusha Agreement.

Expressing deep concern over the slow progress of the dialogue and calling for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in that process, the Council said it was crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections.

The Security Council further stressed that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi and called upon the United Nations, the African Union and the East African Community, among others, to coordinate their efforts in assisting stakeholders in setting outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement.

Underscoring its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the Council commended the host countries for their efforts, and called upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

Further, the Council strongly condemned all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi and reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 3:08 p.m.

Presidential Statement

The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7 reads as follows:

“The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community and the lack of engagement by the Government of Burundi in that regard. It recalls its statement S/PRST/2017/13.

“The Security Council welcomes and supports the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community, expressed at the thirtieth African Union summit and the nineteenth East African Community summit, to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue on the basis of the Arusha Agreement of 28 August 2000 and the Constitution of Burundi, and reiterates its support to the facilitation led by former President B. Mkapa under the mediation of President Museveni. The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the slow progress of this dialogue and calls for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in this process. It is crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections. The Security Council further stresses that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi.

“The Security Council underlines the utmost importance of respecting the letter and the spirit of the Arusha Agreement, which has helped to sustain a decade of peace in Burundi, and expresses concern that the situation prevailing in Burundi has seriously undermined the significant gains achieved through the Arusha Agreement, with devastating consequences for Burundi and the region. It urges the guarantors of the Agreement to meet their obligations in this regard, to ensure that the entirety of the Agreement is adhered to.

“The Security Council calls upon the United Nations, the African Union, East African Community, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the guarantors of the Arusha Agreement to coordinate their efforts of assisting Burundian stakeholders settle outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement. The Security Council notes with appreciation the readiness of the African Union to deploy the high‑level committee of Heads of State on Burundi.

“The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Burundi. The Security Council stresses the importance of implementation of the Arusha Agreement, calls upon the Burundian authorities to initiate all political initiatives through a broad consensus of all stakeholders, which requires a political and security environment that induces the confidence of all political actors and, in this regard, expresses its strong support for the African Union decision at its thirtieth summit. The Security Council expresses the need that these conditions be fully implemented in advance of planned political initiatives.

“The Security Council calls on States in the region to contribute to finding a political solution for the situation in Burundi, refrain from any interference, including through supporting the activities of armed movements in any way, and to respect their obligations under international law, and recalls in this regard commitments of the States in the region under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

“The Security Council notes its expectation that elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi will be free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties, and will ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process. It also underlines that considerable improvements to the political and human rights situation, in particular regarding fundamental freedoms, including for freedom of the press and of civil society actors such as human rights defenders, and progress on reconciliation are necessary to enable credible elections.

“The Security Council underscores its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, and commends the host countries for their efforts, and calls upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

“The Security Council notes that a number of bilateral and multilateral partners have suspended their financial and technical assistance to the Government of Burundi, in view of the situation in Burundi, and encourages bilateral and multilateral partners and the Government of Burundi to continue their dialogue with a view to the Government of Burundi creating conducive conditions for resumption of the assistance. The Security Council commends the assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral partners to alleviate the humanitarian situation and calls on Member States to continue to provide support to respond to the humanitarian needs in the country.

“The Security Council strongly condemns all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi, whoever perpetrates them, including those involving extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including those concerning children, forced disappearances, acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment, harassment and intimidation of civil society, including human rights defenders, women’s organizations, and journalists, restriction of fundamental freedoms, as well as indiscriminate use of grenade attacks, including against civilians.

“The Security Council reaffirms the primary responsibility of the Government of Burundi for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable. It urges the Government of Burundi to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations, to adhere to the rule of law, to bring to justice and hold accountable all those responsible, including members of the security forces and violent actors affiliated to political parties, for crimes involving violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights, as applicable, including those involving sexual violence and all violations and abuses against children.

“The Security Council notes the steps taken by the Government to withdraw the bans of some civil society organizations, cancel some arrest warrants and release a number of detainees following the presidential pardon on 31 December 2017. The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to take further steps to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations.

“The Security Council reiterates its regret at the decision by the Government of Burundi to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has been present in the country since 1995 to strengthen Burundi’s rule of law institutions, and calls for a swift solution through dialogue between OHCHR and the Government in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions, and fulfill its mandate. The Security Council recalls the commitments the Government of Burundi undertook during the thirty‑sixth session of the Human Rights Council to re‑establish full mutual cooperation with the Human Rights Council and OHCHR, including full cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura, and to accept the visit of a team of three experts from the Office of the High Commissioner to collect information on the human rights situation in Burundi. It notes that discussions regarding revisions to the draft memorandum of understanding between the Republic of Burundi and the United Nations concerning the updated terms for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi have been ongoing for over a year and urges the Government of Burundi to take steps to swiftly finalize the agreement with OHCHR without further delay.

“The Security Council reiterates its concern over the significant delays in the deployment of the African Union human rights observers and military experts. It supports the African Union call for the rapid signing of the memorandum of understanding relating to the activities of the human rights observers and the military experts of the African Union, which will allow the African Union human rights observers and military experts to fully operate in the country in fulfilment of their mandated responsibilities.

“The Security Council acknowledges the contribution of Burundian peacekeepers serving in United Nations- and African Union‑led peacekeeping operations and reiterates the importance of upholding the standards of the United Nations.

“The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to reengage with international partners, especially the United Nations, in a constructive manner based on mutual trust. It reiterates its full support to the Secretary‑General and his Special Envoy in their efforts to engage and work with the Government of Burundi to help overcome the current political impasse and foster an inclusive reconciliation process. It further calls on the Secretary‑General and the Government of Burundi to expeditiously finalize and implement the status of the mission agreement for the Office of the Special Envoy, in order to work with the Government of Burundi and other concerned stakeholders to support the East African Community‑led inter‑Burundian dialogue and in the areas of security and rule of law, to engage with all stakeholders to the crisis, and work with all Burundian parties to develop confidence-building measures, to improve the human rights and security situation, and foster an environment conducive to political dialogue. The Security Council welcomes the active engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission Burundi Configuration as a viable platform for dialogue between Burundi and its partners, using a holistic approach to address the political and socioeconomic situation.

“The Security Council is determined to continue to closely follow the situation in Burundi.”

18,burundi,"AFTERNOON

GENEVA (13 March 2018) - The Human Rights Council this afternoon held an interactive dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi.

Doudou Diène, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said that the Commission would engage with authorities and stakeholders to advance its work. He called on Burundi to review its position and engage in a constructive dialogue. Fact-based information was the priority for the Commission, and it would focus on analyzing in a detailed manner the justice mechanism of Burundi in order to make recommendations that would help avoid future crises.

Francoise Hampson, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, reminded of the restrictions imposed on the media and the fact that only Government-organized demonstrations were allowed. The authorities were threatening political actors not willing to fall in line with the regime. The Commission had received information and testimonies regarding harassment committed by officials against people considering voting against proposed constitutional reforms.

Lucy Asuagbor, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, highlighted the discrepancies in funding requests from the Ministry of Interior regarding electoral procedures. Taxes on sugar and gas had increased, further burdening the population. Burundi was now in the midst of a humanitarian emergency with over three million people requiring assistance.

Burundi, speaking as the concerned country, rejected the report, stating that it was rife with false allegations. It drew the Council’s attention to the excessive enthusiasm by the Commission’s new President and his determination to extend the mandate to new areas which were not under its mandate. The use of selectivity and double standards in the Council did not ensure progress for the people who were victims of conflicts in all countries. The High Commissioner should refrain from promoting this practice. In conclusion, Burundi reaffirmed its determination to spare no effort to improve the human rights situation in the country.

In the ensuing discussion, speakers regretted that Burundi continued to refuse to cooperate with the Commission’s mandate, noting that the announcement of the referendum was an additional reason for concern since it was not preceded or accompanied by inclusive dialogue and could run counter to key provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement. Speakers reminded that the continuation of the inter-Burundian dialogue in an international format was of the utmost importance. They encouraged Burundi to step up efforts to promote and protect human rights, including by combatting poverty in rural areas. The Government had to strengthen the culture of peace and unity and fulfil its commitments to combat impunity. Some speakers condemned the interference from outside and the attitude of mentoring towards an independent State. They noted that it was clear that Western countries were showing their sympathies towards the opposition and were trying to change the political landscape in Burundi. Some speakers noted their firm and principled opposition against any politicization in the Human Rights Council. All States had the responsibility and duty to take all necessary measures to ensure that human rights were not abused to achieve narrow political interests.

Speaking were European Union, Russian Federation, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Czechia, Australia, Syria, France, China, Greece, Venezuela, Iran, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, Algeria, Switzerland, Myanmar and United States.

The following civil society organizations also took the floor: International Service for Human Rights, International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, International Federation of ACAT Action By Christians for the Abolition of Torture (in joint statement with TRIAL INTERNATIONAL and World Organisation Against Torture), Amnesty International, East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project, CIVICUS – World Alliance for Citizen Participation, and Human Rights Watch.

The Council will resume its work on Wednesday, 14 March, at 9 a.m. when it will hear an oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Eritrea, and hold a general debate on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention. In the afternoon, the Council is scheduled to hold an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on minority rights, and to hear the presentation of reports from the Forum on Minority Issues, and the Social Forum, as well as the annual report of the Chair of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures.

Presentation by the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the Commission would engage with the authorities and stakeholders to advance its work. He called on Burundi to review its position and engage in constructive dialogue. Fact-based information was the priority for the Commission. Focus would be given to analyzing in a detailed manner the justice mechanism of Burundi in order to make recommendations that would help avoid future crises. Since last September, the social, economic, and human rights situations in Burundi had not improved and the authorities had restricted cooperation with international agencies. Authorities had also rejected humanitarian response plans. The agreement between Burundi and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights remained suspended. Commission members were also subjected to threats from Burundian representatives.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said restrictions were imposed on the media and only Government-organized demonstrations were allowed to take place. Authorities were threatening political actors not willing to fall in line with the regime. The Commission had received information and testimonies regarding harassment committed by officials against people considering voting against proposed constitutional reforms. Arrests and arbitrary detentions also remained a major concern.

LUCY ASAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the Commission had found discrepancies in funding requests from the Ministry of Interior regarding electoral procedures. Taxes on sugar and gas had increased, further burdening the population. Burundi was now in the midst of a humanitarian emergency with over 3 million people requiring assistance. The Commission had collected testimony of increased border controls aimed at preventing people from leaving the country.

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said the situation in Burundi deserved utmost attention from the Human Rights Council. He called on the authorities to be more open to dialogue. The Council would be updated on the situation during its June session.

Statement by the Concerned Country

Burundi, speaking as the concerned country, extended its congratulations to the former President of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi for having resigned in November 2017. His resignation was telling of the aims of this Commission. The Government had formally notified the Human Rights Council of its position on this Commission in 2016. Having in mind the multiple changes of leadership in this Commission, it was difficult to understand how it ensured the accuracy of the accusations in its report. Burundi rejected the report, stating that it was rife with false allegations against Burundi. Burundi drew the Council’s attention to the excessive enthusiasm by the Commission’s new President and his determination to extend the mandate to new areas which were not under its mandate. It brought up questions on the legitimacy of the Commission, its legal nature and the aim of its work. Burundi informed that the negotiations between the two parties were ongoing, and that the High Commissioner for Human Rights had promised to send his team in March 2018 to Bujumbura. Unfortunately, the aggressive and denigrating language used by the Office of the High Commissioner regarding Burundi was not very encouraging. In February 2017, the High Commissioner had described Burundi as one of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times. Burundi had been indignant to hear these words. The use of selectivity and double standards in the Human Rights Council did not ensure progress for the people who were victims of conflicts in all countries, and undermined international cooperation. The High Commissioner should refrain from promoting this practice. In conclusion, Burundi reaffirmed its determination to spare no effort to improve the human rights situation in the country.

Interactive Dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

European Union regretted that Burundi continued to refuse to cooperate with the Commission’s mandate and condemned all threats against the Commission’s members. The announcement of the referendum was an additional reason for concern since it was not preceded or accompanied by inclusive dialogue and could run counter to key provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement. Russia condemned ongoing attacks by extremists on civilian infrastructure in Burundi and said that interference from the outside and the attitude of mentoring to an independent State were unwelcomed. It was clear that Western States were showing their sympathies towards the opposition and were trying to change the political landscape in Burundi. Germany condemned all threats against the Commission and called on the Government of Burundi to cooperate with the Commission and the African Union. The Government was also urged to rapidly conclude the outstanding Memorandum of Understanding on the status of the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura.

Belgium applauded the persistence of the Commission in investigating grave human rights violations. The authorities were called on to reach an agreement with the Office of the High Commissioner so that they could continue their work and the Commission was asked how they would proceed with their work? Denmark noted that the situation in Burundi had not improved since the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Commission in September. Particularly worrisome was that Burundi had become the first country to leave the International Criminal Court. Spain was concerned with the gross violations of human rights, including arbitrary arrests, forced detentions, rape, and restrictions on freedom of association and expression. Burundi was urged to reconsider its decision of leaving the International Criminal Court and to implement recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review.

Czechia said the failure of Burundi to cooperate with the Commission was unacceptable. Noting the crisis that emanated from the failure to organize elections in accordance with democratic standards, Czechia said it was impossible for the proposed constitutional referendum to be credible. Australia said the Commission’s finding that most rights violations were committed by State forces was especially troubling. Australia noted African Union efforts to broker an end to the crisis and asked how the Human Rights Council could help in that process. Syria reaffirmed its position rejecting the use of human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of countries. Such practices would only hurt the credibility of the Human Rights Council. Syria welcomed Burundi’s efforts to pursue peace.

France regretted the lack of cooperation by authorities in Burundi and said it was closely following the constitutional reform process. Human rights violations committed since 2015 could constitute crimes against humanity and perpetrators must be held accountable. The crisis would only be resolved via positive dialogue. China said the situation in Burundi had markedly improved since 2015. Beijing supported all parties in Burundi in their efforts to reach consensus through consultations. The international community must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Burundi. Greece expressed concerns over the lack of cooperation by authorities and regretted ongoing rights violations in Burundi. Attacks against activists, journalists, and human rights defenders were particularly concerning. Long-term solutions required inclusive dialogue.

Venezuela recognized the political will of Burundi to improve the human rights situation in the country. Only genuine dialogue and cooperation among States could fully promote human rights. Iran reiterated its firm and principled opposition against any politicization in the Human Rights Council. All States had the responsibility and duty to take all necessary measures to ensure that human rights were not abused to achieve narrow political interests. Netherlands reminded that the majority of Burundian citizens lived in extreme poverty and in fear of arrest or disappearance when expressing an opposing political view. It raised concern about the increase in arbitrary arrests and detention, used as a tool of intimidation, targeting members of opposition parties.

Remarks by the Commission of Inquiry

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, welcomed the fact that most members of the Council had emphasized the importance of dialogue between the Commission of Inquiry and the Burundian authorities. Burundi had criticized the lack of objectivity and yet it refused the Commission the possibility of a visit. It was in the objective interest of Burundi to allow access to the Commission. It was also important that members of the Council appreciated the efforts of the African Union to push for sustainable dialogue in the country. Responding to some comments made by the delegation of Burundi, Mr. Diène explained that it was a normal practice that inquiry bodies of the United Nations changed leadership. There was a clear linkage between the political crisis and the economic, social and cultural situation, he emphasized. Economic growth was more or less negative, and Burundi had become a country of humanitarian emergency, with more than 30 per cent of the population in need.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said that the situation in Burundi was not improving in any significant way. On the contrary, information pointed to continued human rights violations as in 2017. Some refugees had returned to Burundi, but had left again because the conditions for repatriation had not been in place.

LUCY ASUAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, noted that without access to the country, the Government would always contest any report by the Commission. She pleaded once again with the Government that without access to the country, there would be no progress. A balanced report was only possible through access.

Interactive Dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi

United Kingdom regretted that the Burundian Government had failed to acknowledge or address ongoing human rights violations and abuses. Genuine and inclusive dialogue around changes to the Constitution was important as well as maintaining provisions of the Arusha Accords in the Constitution. Ireland condemned the ongoing violations of basic rights, including arbitrary arrests, the increasing pressure on civil society space and house searches. Internally displaced persons and refugees were bearing the brunt of this repressive environment. Lithuania strongly condemned the decision to ban and suspend the work of independent non-governmental organizations and media. The intent to abolish the ethnic political representation quotas enshrined in the Arusha Accords by changing the Constitution were concerning.

Norway said the continuation of the inter-Burundian dialogue in an international format was of the utmost importance. Norway expressed concern that the process for constitutional reform was not being undertaken in a participatory and democratic manner. Algeria encouraged Burundi to step up efforts to promote and protect human rights, including by combatting poverty in rural areas. The Government must strengthen the culture of peace and unity and fulfil its commitments to combat impunity. Switzerland said it was closely following the situation of human rights defenders in Burundi who were facing legal action. Burundi was urged to cooperate with the Commission, including by granting it access to the country.

Myanmar welcomed Burundian efforts to ratify core human rights instruments. In order for the Human Rights Council to achieve certain outcomes, it must promote the principle of cooperation. Country-specific mandates were incapable of fostering genuine dialogue. United States said Burundi continued to commit serious human rights violations and those responsible for such crimes benefited from impunity. Burundi’s refusal to cooperate with the Commission was proof of the State’s disdain for the United Nations. It was disturbing that Burundi, given its human rights record, was a member of the Human Rights Council.

International Service for Human Rights said Burundian civil society actors, and particularly human rights defenders and journalists, had been the primary targets of systematic oppression by the authorities. Journalists and human rights defenders faced heightened risks of threats, intimidation and violent attacks. International Federation for Human Rights Leagues said a dozen people had been arrested recently. The Government was threatening the citizens in order to get them to vote in the upcoming referendum. This was not a favourable climate to hold a referendum and the new attacks and obstacles targeting civil society were very worrisome. International Federation of ACAT Action By Christians for the Abolition of Torture (in joint statement with TRIAL INTERNATIONAL and World Organisation Against Torture), said it had documented 23 disappearances, and over 90 cases of arbitrary arrests, which were perpetrated by activists in cooperation with the forces of law and order. A campaign of terror that would force the population to vote yes on a referendum that would allow the Government a second mandate, was currently in place.

Amnesty International said the country was approaching a major and decisive turning point in its history, with a referendum on constitutional amendments due to take place in May. Amnesty International had repeatedly raised the alarm about the crackdown on dissent since the start of the political crisis in 2015. It urged Burundi to allow full and unfettered access to all parts of the country to all relevant and international human rights observers. East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project said it had been three years since Burundi was plunged into a climate of fear and violence, extrajudicial torture, arbitrary detention and disappearances affecting all segments of society. All voices critical of the Government were under attack. The Commission of Inquiry had reported that there were reasonable grounds that crimes against humanity had been committed. CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation remained extremely concerned about the grave human rights violations taking place in Burundi, which showed no sign of abating. In January, at least 60 people were arrested after publicly advocating that citizens should reject the proposed constitutional amendment which would extend President Pierre Nkurunziza’s term in office beyond 2020.

Human Rights Watch said that today, after the Commission had found reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed, there was still no adequate collective action. This was even more appalling as human rights abuses were likely to increase further as the country’s political crisis deepened. A ruling party official had threatened in front of residents to “break the teeth” of those who campaigned for people to vote “no” for the proposed referendum.

Concluding Remarks

DOUDOU DIÈNE, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, underlined the seriousness of the human rights situation in Burundi, which was not only the view of the Commission of Inquiry. There was no more any country in the world that could consider that human rights issues belonged only to their authorities. Burundi was a member of the United Nations and party to international human rights instruments. The Commission had the primary mandate to document human rights violations, namely gathering information at the source. The International Criminal Court had started a process that would move forward. The fact that Burundi had participated in the Universal Periodic Review was a sign of opening. The Commission was aware of the complex situation in the country. There could be no doubt that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was capable of taking necessary measures to give sense and substance between the work done by the group of experts and the Commission of Inquiry. Burundi had an objective interest that its point of view be studied at the source and reflected in the report. The High Commissioner was determined to seek dialogue and the Commission of Inquiry was determined to complete its mandate.

FRANCOISE HAMPSON, Member of the Commissions of Inquiry on Burundi, in response to allegations of the partiality of the Commission, said anyone who had dealt with the Commission of Inquiry knew it was independent. In the case that those violations might represent international crimes, the Commission would be sure to state so. But the starting point for the Commission was human rights law. In response to the question on links with groups of experts, these had not yet been established. In response to the question about what Governments could do to help, she said they could persuade Burundi to enter dialogue with the Commission and allow humanitarian access. She also urged Governments to call on the African Union to persuade Burundi to cooperate with the Commission.

LUCY ASUAGBOR, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, said she had asked herself whether in any way the Commission violated the sovereignty of the Government of Burundi. The answer was no. Burundi had, by ratifying international instruments, abandoned its sovereignty and had exposed itself to accountability mechanisms. Consequently, the protection of human rights was a collective responsibility. There was a need for monitoring organisms to be able to intervene, including a monitoring organism that could investigate violations. What was of real relevance now was that cooperation from the Government was required.",Human Rights Council holds interactive dialogue with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/human-rights-council-holds-interactive-dialogue-commission-inquiry-burundi-0

Burundi police said Tuesday they had arrested 21 people suspected of holding meetings to ""disrupt security"", while those close to the suspects claim they were merely gathering to play table tennis.

Nairobi, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News, app - 10th Apr, 2018 ) :Burundi police said Tuesday they had arrested 21 people suspected of holding meetings to ""disrupt security"", while those close to the suspects claim they were merely gathering to play table tennis.

""Twenty-one people including an army officer, two police officers, a retired army officer and civilians were apprehended by police on (Monday) night at a house in the Carama district"" of the capital, police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye told state radio.

""The population alerted security forces that people were often meeting at this house and that they had plans to disrupt security,"" he said, adding that an investigation was under way that would allow him to elaborate on the charges against them.

Several people close to those arrested told AFP they belonged to a table tennis club, officially registered with the Bujumbura municipality, and met there several times a week to play. A high-ranking security official told AFP on condition of anonymity that ""all those arrested have been placed in SNR (National Intelligence Services) cells and are being interrogated"".

The feared SNR, which falls directly under President Pierre Nkurunziza, is considered one of the main tools of repression in Burundi. ""The leader of this tennis club showed their authorisation to the agents but the Burundi secret service is very nervous with the upcoming constitutional referendum because they fear opponents will try disturb security,"" he said.

Nkurunziza, 54, has set May 17 as the date for a referendum on a controversial constitutional reform that could keep him in power until 2034. Nkurunziza ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution, triggering violence that left at least 1,200 people dead and sent more than 400,000 Burundians fleeing abroad.",21 'table Tennis Club' Members Arrested In Burundi,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/21-table-tennis-club-members-arrested-in-bu-311138.html

The statement also offered support to the African Union's efforts to help resolve the Burundi conflict, but called on regional states to ""refrain from any interference.""

The Council is ""deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community (EAC), and the lack of engagement"" by the Burundi government read the statement adopted by the 15-member Council.

The international body expects elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi to be ""free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties,"" and to ""ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process,"" the statement said.

The Council however underscored its ""deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180 000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429 000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.""

The government of Burundi has ""the primary responsibility ... for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable.""

The statement also urged Burundi to resume its cooperation with international groups, especially the United Nations.

Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza, first elected to office in 2005, ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution.

Nkurunziza has set May 17 as the date for a referendum on a constitutional reform that would enable him to serve two seven-year mandates from 2020.

Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza. [AFP]

Burundi's ruling party has bestowed the title of 'eternal supreme guide' on President Pierre Nkurunziza, a party official has confirmed Sunday, as critics claim he wants to lock in power for life.

""He is our elder, our father, our adviser,"" CNDD-FDD secretary general Evariste Ndayishimiye said in a video sent to AFP whose authenticity was confirmed by an official.

A party statement issued after a meeting on Saturday of the party's top leadership in Mr Nkurunziza's native Buye in the north of the former Belgian colony did not spell out the implications of the title.

The 54-year-old former rebel leader has ruled the densely populated central African country since 2005 after a devastating civil war.

A constitutional referendum in May could allow him to run in elections in 2020, paving the way for him to remain in power until 2034.

Critics mocked the party, with one decrying the ""cult of personality around his majesty the King Nkurunziza I"".

But another party official, who asked not to be named, insisted to AFP the move did not reflect ""an excess such as those of (former North Korean dictator) Kim Il Sung, as our detractors suggest"".

Burundi has faced a serious political crisis since Nkurunziza sought a fiercely contested third term in office in April 2015.

Post-election violence claimed at least 1,200 lives and displaced more than 400,000 people between April 2015 and May 2017, according to estimates by the International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation.

Nkurunziza has led several purges in the ranks of the former rebellion and surrounded himself with a select group of generals.

Opposition parties warn the constitutional changes could deal a death blow to the Arusha peace accords that helped to end the 1993-2006 civil war, in which more than 300,000 people died.

The Arusha accords stipulate that no president can govern the country for more than 10 years. The constitution sets a limit of two five-year mandates. Last month, it emerged that Burundians were being forced to sign up to vote in the May referendum, claims the government denied.

The constitutional amendment would extend the presidential term to seven years from five. It would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms, but won't take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza's rule to 2034.

The deputy chairman of the opposition FRODEBU party, Léonce Ngendakumana, told Reuters that citizens were being intimidated into signing up to vote in a week-long registration exercise which ended last month.

""Checkpoints have been set up, likely by youths of the ruling party, to check receipts (of registration). Students who have not been registered are sent back to do so,” Ngendakumana said last month. “This referendum is organised in total opacity and extreme intimidation. A referendum held in such conditions will result in a biased outcome.""

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 after a peace deal ended a decade of civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels, in which 300,000 people were killed.

A traveller who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters he had been stopped at a roadblock near the Rwandan border and asked to confirm he had registered. Reuters spoke to people who also reported roadblocks in central Karusi. Five people talked of roadblocks in three different locations.

22,burundi,"The High Court of Justice ruled that Israel's attorney general has five days to approve the highly-contested deportation plan of African asylum seekers to a ""third country""or, once the set deadline passes, those currently jailed will be released.

""In the absence of an up-to-date deal...there is no longer justification to detain them,"" judges stated, according to the Times of Israel.

After several setbacks, including nixed deals with Rwanda and the UN, the Israeli government submitted a plan to the Israeli High Court of Justice on Tuesday regarding its plan to deport roughly 32,500 African migrants from Eritrea and Sudan.

According to Hadashot TV news, citing senior interior ministry sources, Israel was expected to tell the Supreme Court on Tuesday that deportations to Uganda will begin soon. However, it appears the court rejected this bid.

During a hearing, Supreme Court President Esther Hayut asked the state’s attorney Shosh Shmueli, “if you loaded up a plane full of asylum seekers, would they be guaranteed asylum [when they arrived] or not?”

“According to the attorney general, there is a high probability that they will be,” Shmueli said.

“Then there is no deal.You are simply holding people in detention,"" Hayut replied, the Times of Israel reported.

At least several hundred African migrants voluntarily departed Israel for Uganda in recent years in exchange for $3,500 payments, although both governments denied it.

Since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scuppered a UN-brokered deal to resettle 16,250 in Western countries while granting several thousands more temporary status, Israel has reportedly struck a new deal with Uganda, although Uganda denied any agreement to allow Israel to “dump” asylum seekers in the country.

Hadashot reported that despite Uganda’s protestations in the media, it has not officially withdrawn from the deal.

A plan to deport the migrants to Rwanda was scrapped, with officials from the country not only denying any deal between the two countries, but also publicly refusing to take in any refugees from Israel.

Interior ministry officials cited by Hadashot warned, however, that Uganda could still follow Rwanda’s lead and formally jettison the agreement.

Separately, Ynet reported on last Tuesday, without citing sources, that Israel made payments to an unnamed African country in March and April as payment for accepting deported asylum-seekers.

The migrant issue has also taken on a public health angle. On Monday, Sweden-based Eritrean activist Meron Estafanos told Haaretz that 52 migrants deported from Israel to Uganda told her that they were not inoculated against yellow fever, which the Ugandan president’s office said was mandatory for visitors to the country.

Some of the 52 told Estafanos that they were ushered aside by an official upon landing in the capital, Kampala, and were not required to show documentation of their vaccination.

They said they were not told by Israel that the shots were required. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment on the claims.

In the statement, the Council also “strongly” condemned human rights violations committed in the country, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, forced disappearance, torture and harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and journalists.

The Security Council also reiterated its “regret” at the Government’s decision to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) and called for a swift solution through dialogue between the UN human rights arm and Burundi in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its mandated activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions.

Also in the statement, the 15-member Council voiced concerns over the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation in the country and, in the context of Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, called on those Governments to ensure that the return of the refugees is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

According to estimates, some 180,000 people remain displaced within Burundi and more than 429,000 have sought refuge across its borders.
