A Burundian activist was sentenced to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was ""eminently political"".

Germain Rukuki was given ""32 years of penal servitude"" at Bujumbura's district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing said Thursday on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

UNREST

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for ""having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from May 13, 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property"".

Burundian authorities use the term 'insurrectional movement' to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and more than 400,000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

LIFE SENTENCE

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on July 13, 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: ""The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

""It is a message from the authorities to all those who dare to oppose the regime and denounce the crimes it commits, one month before a highly disputed constitutional referendum.""",Burundi activist jailed for anti-president demo,https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Burundi-activist-given-32-years/1066-4532508-avhbud/index.html
1,burundi,"ISS: Talks remain ineffective as Burundi’s crisis continues

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the East African Community (EAC) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the African Union (AU).Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and COMESA jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives.Written by Gustavo de Carvalho, Senior Researcher and Priyal Singh, Researcher, Peace Operations and Peacebuilding Programme, ISS Pretoria.Republished with permission from ISS Africa .

2,burundi,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – As the campaign heats up in Burundi ahead of a May 17 referendum that could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to rule the central African country until 2034, the Catholic Church has said it opposes the change.

The draft constitution extends the presidential term to seven years from five, allowing Nkurunziza to run again in 2020. It would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms but would not take into account previous terms.

A statement signed by ten Catholic bishops said it was “not the appropriate time to make profound changes” to the constitution.

The President of the Burundi Episcopal Conference, Bishop Joachim Ntahondereye, said that the proposed constitutional changes do not take into account article 299 of the current constitution which stipulates that “no procedure to revise the constitution shall be entertained that endangers national unity, the cohesion of the Burundian people or reconciliation.”

“What we notice is that instead of uniting the Burundian people, the draft constitution seems to have worsened divisions,” the bishop said.

Interviewed by Vatican Radio, Ntahondereye said he feared the referendum could “revive the old demons of division, and that there could be misdirected speeches during the on-going campaign.”

He said opposition figures who had fled the country could use the tense period to reorganize themselves and threaten the present government. The bishop added a “climate of fear” now permeates Burundian society.

Ntahondereye said there were divergent views on the draft amendments, but “many citizens are afraid, even if they don’t voice it. People are afraid to say what they think for fear of reprisals.”

He condemned the abusive use of force and the abuse of power that is now used by some public authorities to suppress the freedom of speech of their political opponents.

The bishops have received the support of the opposition, which has been campaigning for a boycott of the referendum.

“The Catholic bishops have understood that the referendum scheduled to take place on May 17 is a referendum that will plunge the country into a bloodbath; it will completely bury the Arusha accords and will be the harbinger of all dangers. There are people who have died because they did not register to vote. Others have simply disappeared. Violence is raging,” said opposition figure Charles Ndjitijé in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

The 2000 Arusha accords ended years of ethnic fighting in the country after U.N.-brokered talks.

But the permanent representative of Burundi to the United Nations, Albert Shingiro waved aside all these criticisms, telling Deutsche Welle that “the time is ripe for the referendum. It is the result of broad-based consultations that took about a year. Nkurunziza hasn’t declared his candidacy for 2020. We still have two years till then.”

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 following the Arusha peace and reconciliation accords of 2000 that ended a decade-long civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels, in which 300,000 people were killed.

The country’s constitution limits a presidential term to five years, with a maximum of two terms. When Nkurunziza decided to flout the constitution and run for a third term in 2015, violence erupted in what is one of the world’s poorest countries.

The decision generated protests, a failed coup, and hundreds of deaths.

There are rising fears that in the face of the political crisis, the country’s humanitarian situation could worsen: Right now, over 400,000 Burundians have already fled the country to seek asylum.

“The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi’s problems are political at the root and at their base,” says Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch.

“It’s hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it’s very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi’s neighbors,” he told IRIN, a humanitarian news agency.

According to the U.N.’s Humanitarian Response Plan, more than 3.6 million Burundians are now in need of humanitarian aid, while some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016.

Knowing they can’t get the referendum called off, the bishops are asking that it at least be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere.

“Since our country has chosen the path of democracy, all we can wish for is that the referendum is carried out peacefully and that no Burundian should be pressured to vote,” the bishops statement concluded.",Burundi bishops oppose referendum to allow president to extend rule,https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/05/07/burundi-bishops-oppose-referendum-to-allow-president-to-extend-rule/
3,burundi,"Authorities in Burundi have banned the BBC and Voice of America (VOA), as well as two local broadcasters, just weeks before a crucial constitutional referendum on presidential term limits.

The National Communications Council (NCC) said on Friday that the news organisations' operations would be suspended for at least six months for breaching the ""laws governing the press and ethics.""

The ban will come into effect on Monday, Karenga Ramadhani, the head of the regulator, told journalists in the capital, Bujumbura.

The NCC said the BBC invited a Burundian who made ""inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified [remarks], damaging the reputation of the head of state, to ethnic hatred, to political conflict and civil disobedience"".

VOA, for its part, was accused of spreading ""very tendentious"" information and hiring a journalist ""sought by Burundian justice"", according to AFP news agency.

{articleGUID}

French broadcaster Radio France International was also issued a stern warning in the same statement, and was asked to put a more vigorous verification process in place.

Two local broadcasters were also banned after the presidency complained their reporting was biased, the National Communications Council said.

The BBC and VOA both broadcast daily in the national Kirundi language and have amassed a large following over the years, especially in rural areas.

Amanda Bennett, VOA's director, denounced the regulator's action and said the news organisation's content would continue to be available through its shortwave channels, online and on FM transmitters located in neighbouring countries.

""Our audience members count on VOA to provide factual, unbiased and objective coverage of current events, so this ban deprives the citizens of Burundi of a trusted news source during a critical time in that country,"" she said in a statement.

""This is even more distressing coming only one day after World Press Freedom Day - a day calling for governments to remove, not impose, restrictions on the media,"" Bennett added.

Key referendum

While the country's constitution currently limits presidents to two five-year terms, a ""yes"" vote in the upcoming referendum on May 17 could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza, 54, to run for an additional two seven-year terms.

In concrete terms, this would mean that Nkurunziza, in power since 2005, could potentially rule until 2034 if he is re-elected in the next scheduled election in two years.

His run for a controversial third term in 2015 triggered a deep political crisis that has since seen 1,200 people killed and 400,000 flee their homes in the country of 10.5 million.

""Conditions for holding a credible referendum deteriorate as days go by,"" Leonce Ngendakumana, deputy chairman of the opposition party FRODEBU, the Front for Democracy in Burundi, told the Reuters news agency.

""The regime is now afraid of the media's force, which can derail their plan for the upcoming referendum and the 2020 elections.""

Also commenting on the regulator's announcement, Lews Mudge, a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's Africa division, called the broadcasting ban ""worrying"".

""This falls in line with the repression in Burundi as we head closer to the referendum,"" Mudge told Reuters.

""This is happening in the context of journalists getting threatened, those reporting on some of the oppression are being muzzled.""

Earlier this week, Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the US Department of State, denounced alleged acts of violence against the opposition and called on the Burundian government to respect its international commitments to protect freedoms of speech and association.

""We call on the government to respect Burundi's international legal obligations regarding the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association,"" Nauert said on Tuesday.

4,burundi,"Burundi isn’t at war, but it has all the humanitarian hallmarks of a country that is.

Campaigning began this week ahead of a 17 May referendum that will allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. A government clampdown and an uptick in political violence are raising fears that the humanitarian situation will deteriorate further as civil liberties and the rule of law are eroded, prompting more people to join some 400,000 already seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.

Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, said Burundians will continue to flee unless the political crisis is resolved.

“The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi's problems are political at the root and at their base,” he said. “It's hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it's very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi's neighbours.”

More than 3.6 million Burundians – about a quarter of the population of what is the world’s fourth poorest country – now need aid to get by, an increase of almost 20 percent over 2017, according to the UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan.

Some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016. One in six children under the age of five are affected by chronic malnutrition, a condition that stunts growth and impairs mental development.

Aid agencies say they need some $142 million to meet needs this year. So far, only two percent of the appeal has been funded.

Much of this money is required to fill the gap left by a cash-strapped and ineffective state in providing basic services – countering widespread malnutrition and food insecurity, boosting primary healthcare (six million Burundians got malaria in 2017), and helping 190,000 internally displaced people (mostly due to natural disasters such as floods and landslides in 2016) and 65,000 refugees from neighbouring states.

Multiple causes

Burundi’s inability to care for its citizens has several causes: the lingering effects of a civil war that broke out in 1993 and only formally ended in 2006; an economy overly dependent on an inefficient agriculture sector; the political crisis ignited in 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run for re-election in apparent violation of constitutional term limits; and the drying-up of the foreign cash on which the government long depended.

Such overseas assistance “is on a drip at the moment”, according to one aid worker, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of working in Burundi. Suspended donor support has led to a 72-percent cut in the government’s water and sanitation budget, increasing the risk of epidemics such as cholera, while funds for healthcare have been more than halved.

Hundreds of thousands of Burundians fled the country in the early stages of the 2015 political crisis, and continue to leave at a rate of up to 70 a day, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR.

Richard Moncrieff, Central Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, blamed government policy for the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

“Some progress was being made before the crisis in 2015 in food security and malnutrition, but this is being reversed partly because donors are pulling out – for which government is to blame also – and partly because government incompetence is being exposed by uncertainty, violence, and flight of human capital,” he said.

Government policies are also making it harder for humanitarian agencies to deliver aid in Burundi. The 2018 Response Plan pointed to numerous “legal and administrative restrictions [that] limit current and future operational efficiency” of aid agencies and their ability to travel into the interior of the country, except in extremely urgent cases. It added that legislation covering NGOs adopted in January 2017 undermined the independence of aid agencies.

These constraints “remain a key issue for humanitarian actors” in Burundi, Philippe Adapoe, Save the Children’s country director in neighbouring Rwanda, said.

Abuses rise as poll draws near

Wide-ranging human rights abuses committed by security forces and affiliated groups over the past few years led the International Criminal Court to announce in November that it would conduct an investigation into Burundi, even though the country became the first in the world to withdraw from the tribunal the previous month.

Alleged crimes against humanity cited by the ICC include: murder and attempted murder; imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty; torture; rape; enforced disappearance; and persecution. Depending on its findings, the ICC’s next step could be indictments and arrest warrants.

The run-up to the 17 May poll has seen a spike in abuses and threats against those opposed to the amendments.

Mediation efforts led by the East African Community have failed to reconcile the government and the opposition. “The mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results,” the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies think tank said this week. “Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis,” it added.

Many of Nkurunziza’s leading opponents now live in exile, while those still in Burundi who favour a “No” vote in the referendum are being cast by officials as enemies and criminals.

“Opponents, including elected officials are constantly harassed. The [Imbonerakure] militia which protects government bigwigs commits abuses in deplorable indifference of a judiciary which is a mere shadow of itself,” Dieudonné Bashirahishize, the head of a group of lawyers representing victims of the 2015 crisis, told IRIN. “Leaders of the ruling party keep calling for those who dare to push for a ‘No’ vote to be lynched.”

In one of several similar videos circulating on social media, a ruling party official says: “If you vote ‘No’, you know it will be death.”

And in a rare case of hate speech prosecution, a ruling party official was handed a three-year jail term on 30 April, days after publicly warning that opponents of the referendum would be put into pirogues on Lake Tanganyika (widely understood to mean opponents would be fed to the lake’s fish).

A group of “concerned citizens” tweeting collectively as @iBurundi, described this trial as a “sideshow” designed to cover up incitement to violence by some of the most senior officials in the ruling party.

Speaking out about abuses in Burundi carries great risks. On 26 April, human rights activist Germain Rukuki was handed a 32-year jail sentence after being convicted of taking part in an “insurrection movement” in 2015. Amnesty International said the charges were trumped up.

AU UN IST Photo President Pierre Nkurunziza

In 2015, the country’s most prominent human rights defender, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The monthly report for March 2018 prepared by the organisation Mbonimpa heads, APRODH, lists the most recent killings, arbitrary detentions, torture, beatings, and intimidation, and paints a picture of “growing” insecurity. Many abuses were allegedly carried out by the Imbonerakure - the ruling party’s powerful youth wing -, the police, and intelligence agents working for Nkurunziza’s government.

Lamenting that the prevailing climate of fear was preventing citizens from freely expressing their opinions, Burundi’s bishops said on 2 May that “the time is not right to make profound changes to the constitution”.

Night raids

Earlier this month, legislators approved a draft law that would give police the power to conduct night-time raids on people’s homes.

“The ruling party has just buried democracy in Burundi,” one opposition MP stated after the decision.

Jérémie Minani, the spokesperson for humanitarian issues in the CNARED opposition coalition – which has called for a boycott of the referendum – said the vote would “create chaos and worsen the suffering and misery of the population”.

He added that if the constitutional changes were adopted, it would spell the end of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement – signed in 2000 under the stewardship of Nelson Mandela to end the civil war and create a governance framework for sustainable peace.

The death of the accord would “certainly take the country back to a new civil war,” he warned. “The humanitarian consequences will be extremely serious: a total collapse of the economy resulting in increased poverty.”

The government, which denies there is a political crisis in Burundi and has contested the data in the latest humanitarian appeal as “fabricated figures”, turned Minani’s accusation on its head.

The opposition were the ones who “took the path of violence”, Interior Ministry Spokesman Terence Ntahiraja told IRIN. “They showed that on 13 May 2015,” he added, referring to the day of a failed coup attempt. “So I would ask them to change their behaviour, to abandon their intentions to create trouble in the country and to accept democracy and compete on the ground, [in the referendum campaign] and to win if the people so decide.”

Such an outcome is virtually impossible, said Bashirahishize, the victims’ lawyer. “It’s not a referendum, but a piece of theatre set up to enthrone the ‘Eternal Supreme Guide,’” he told IRIN, using the title the ruling party bestowed on the head of state in March.

What next?

Around 400,000 Burundians who fled since 2015 are still living in neighbouring states, but their welcome in two of them is wearing thin. Tanzania, which hosts some 60 percent of the caseload, no longer grants Burundians prima facie refugee status and is keen to step up the rate of repatriations.

Relations between Burundi and Rwanda have soured, with the neighbours accusing one another of backing rebellions.

Earlier this month, Bujumbura protested the deportation by Kigali of some 1,600 Burundian refugees, alleging they had been sent back for refusing to join an armed group formed to attack Burundi.

Lucy Hovil, senior research associate at the International Refugee Rights Initiative, said the situation facing those fleeing Burundi’s political violence was deeply concerning.

“Given [conditions in] the neighbouring countries to Burundi, this leaves them in a very difficult position because, as you know, many don't want to flee to Rwanda because it's not very safe… and neither is [the Democratic Republic of] Congo,” she said.

Robert Rugurika, a Burundian living in Brussels, told IRIN that the political repression in his home country deters many refugees from going back.

“There is nothing the regime can do to convince people to return if it does not stop oppressing Burundians. This won’t happen because the regime only survives by terrorising its own people and committing human rights violations,” he said. “People are still fleeing even now ahead of the referendum. Since assassinations and torture continues against opponents, people will continue to flee in large numbers.”

Bashirahishize said the international community “needs to pay more attention to the Burundian crisis, which is getting worse with time, so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe which risks getting worse with this referendum.”

30 RRRP PARTNERS INVOLVED

REGIONAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

While insecurity and violence in Burundi were at a lower scale in 2017 than the previous year, political tensions and human rights violations continued to cause outflows of refugees, even as others chose to return. Some 61,000 asylum seekers left Burundi in 2017. Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) all stopped granting refugee status to Burundians on a prima facie basis during 2017, while Rwanda continues to do so. Receiving countries have struggled throughout the year to meet the basic needs of refugees due to severe underfunding of the crisis.

Tanzania is supporting the largest number of Burundian refugees with 40,238 arrivals in 2017, most of whom arrived in the first few months of the year. Rwanda received a total of 7,683 Burundian refugees, with arrival rates remaining relatively stable throughout the year. The DRC registered 8,575 new refugees from Burundi in 2017. And arrivals to Uganda amounted to 5,312, decreasing from over 700 in January to less than 100 in December 2017. A total of 13,104 refugees were assisted to return from Tanzania to Burundi between 7 September and 31 December 2017 as per the agreement resulting from the Tripartite Commission meeting on 31 August 2017. UNHCR is not promoting refugee return to Burundi, but is assisting those who indicate they have made a voluntary choice to repatriate.

Protection: Progress on protection activities by RRP partners was noted throughout the region. This included achievements such as: providing 100% of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) survivors with support in Uganda; training government officials and implementing partners on refugee and migrant protection in Rwanda; biometric registration of 100% of refugees in DRC; and reuniting 750 children with their families through inter-camp and intra-camp tracing programs in Tanzania. Alongside the progress, many gaps still remain. These include, but are not limited to: scaling up support for SGBV survivors in the DRC, and improving access to individual case management services for children with specific needs in Uganda.

Education: Across the region, there has been success in achieving high enrollment rates to primary schools, but difficulties persist in terms of attendance. In the DRC, despite an 85% enrollment rate, actual attendance is believed to be much lower. Similarly in Uganda, while there is an enrollment rate of 65% in primary schools, only 45% have been recorded as attending. Distance from learning facilities and parental attitudes towards education are two key factors affecting attendance. A positive approach in addressing this was taken in Rwanda whereby RRP partners participated in parents and teachers association meetings to improve school attendance and quality of education. The ratio of students to teachers is another challenge being faced in all countries of asylum (up to 100:1 in some classrooms), exacerbated by a shortage of classrooms and qualified teachers. More funding is needed for countries to make adequate investments in education for Burundian refugees.

Food Security: RRP partners managed to maintain food assistance throughout the year to Burundian refugees in the region, including special assistance to vulnerable groups in all countries. Achievements included the increased dietary diversity score in Uganda from to 3.7 in 2016, to 3.8 in 2017 and the provision of monthly in-kind food distribution to 56,206 refugees in Mahama camp, Rwanda. However, due to funding shortfalls, food rations were not always at 100% and in Tanzania food ration reductions ranged between approximately 10% and 40% throughout the year, arguably a factor in some refugees’ decisions to return to Burundi.

Health and Nutrition: Improvements in health facilities in 2017 included the expansion of facilities in Tanzania increasing health service provision capacity, and in Rwanda, the upgrade of facilities from emergency to semi-permanent structures. Common challenges in the health and nutrition sector persist regionally, including a lack of trained health care staff. Tanzania has reported that staffing levels at health care facilities are inadequate to sustain the provision of quality healthcare services and the DRC has noted the absence of psychiatric staff to treat refugees, and a lack of training for health care staff working in maternal care.

Livelihoods and Environment: With the RRP’s emphasis on promoting economic self-reliance and reducing dependence on aid, Burundian refugees received livelihood support that included over 37,000 people benefiting from livelihood programs in Tanzania, and over 3,000 refugees receiving support to start businesses in Uganda. A common issue in the region is dependence on limited natural resources, sometimes leading to conflict with surrounding communities and related protection concerns. In the DRC, an initiative to support income generating activities in Lusenda camp included the production of briquettes for cooking, reducing dependence on firewood. Similar initiatives are needed and would ideally be scaled up around the region, environmental protection being a high priority of all host governments.

Shelter and NFIs: Across the region shelter facilities were established to accommodate new arrivals. Key achievements included 84% of Burundian refugees in Rwanda with semi-permanent shelter in 2017, and 100% distribution of NFI kits to new refugee households in Uganda. Alongside this success there is room for improvement, especially in Tanzania where 65% of the refugee population continued to live emergency shelters without access to semi- permanent shelter, and in Uganda where only 4% of refugees with specific needs were provided with semi-permanent shelter.

WASH: Significant progress was made regionally in the WASH sector. In Uganda, there was a move from emergency water systems to more sustainable models, with 97% of the population now supplied with water at an average rate of 17.5 liters per person per day. In Tanzania, improved access to potable water was achieved for over 115,000 Burundian refugees in Nduta camp, who are now receiving an average of 20.5 lit/person/day. A new water treatment plant was set up in Rwanda with the capacity to support 60,000 refugees and the host community around Mahama camp. However, more support is needed to improve maintenance of water supply. In Uganda for example, despite the achievement of drilling 8 new boreholes in 2017, only 6 of the 27 boreholes drilled in 2016 remain functional.

Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF): RRP partners and government counterparts applied the CRRF approach throughout the region by seeking to anchor the multi-sector assistance and protection response in government systems, policies, and plans, delivering integrated services for refugees and host communities wherever possible. In Rwanda, some 19,000 Burundian refugee children are enrolled in the national school system alongside host community children. In the DRC, the new Mulongwe site was purposefully developed with the refugees and host community benefiting from the same health, education, and other social services.

from OMEGA SSUUNA in Bujumbura, Burundi

BUJUMBURA, (CAJ News) – BURUNDIAN authorities and rights groups have taken off more than 900 children and adolescents living and working in the streets in the tense East African country.

The children and adolescents placed in custody include 940 boys and 19 girls.

Most of them have been released to the care of their families or non-governmental organisations.

Their release follows joint advocacy efforts from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners.

“Discussions with the government of Burundi and child protection partners are ongoing to identify longer terms solutions,” said a local spokesperson of UNICEF.

UNICEF is nonetheless facing funding problems for the humanitarian crisis in Burundi.

“Without additional funds, UNICEF will not be able to address the essential needs of children and women in Burundi,” a UNICEF spokesperson said.

The East African country of some 12 million people is beset by conflict after President Pierre Nkurunziza controversially secured a third term in 2015. Nkurunziza (aged 54) has led Burundi since 2005 when he succeeded Domitien Ndayizeye.

About 400 000 refugees, over half of them children, have found refuge in neighbouring countries, mainly Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda since Nkurunziza’s retention of power.

Operations to rid the children and adolescents off the streets are continuing.

7,burundi,"Nairobi, May 7, 2018--Authorities in Burundi should immediately lift a six-month licensing suspension imposed on radio broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Voice of America (VOA), the Committee to Protect Journalists said today. Burundi's National Communication Council (CNC), the media industry regulator, on May 4 accused the two stations of breaching the country's media laws and professional ethics and ordered the stations' licensing suspended, according to a statement from the regulator. A government agency that regulates telecommunication subsequently turned off their signals, according to media reports.

The media regulator accused the BBC of broadcasting ""exaggerated, non-verified, defamatory"" comments made by a Brussels-based activist that were harmful to the reputation of Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza during an April 24 broadcast of the French-language program L'invité de la Semaine, according to CNC Chairman Ramadhan Karenga who spoke to CPJ and a report by The EastAfrican newspaper.

In its statement, the CNC also claimed that on four different occasions in April, VOA aired content that lacked balance, fell short of rigorous verification of sources, and prejudiced Burundi's relations with the United Nations. The U.S. government-funded station is also facing allegations from the media regulator of hiring a journalist sought by Burundian law enforcement and partnering with Bonesha FM, a local station that has been banned by the government, according to Karenga and the report by The EastAfrican.

The BBC and VOA suspension, which became effective today, comes before a May 17 constitutional referendum that, if passed, could extend Nkurunziza's rule to 2034. Two journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for their security told CPJ that the bans were attempts by the government to silence critical voices ahead of the referendum.

""These actions are a transparent attempt to silence the media during this politically sensitive period, when Burundians are in most urgent need of information to make important political decisions,"" said CPJ Africa Program Coordinator Angela Quintal from New York. ""It is not too late to rethink this ill-informed decision and the regulator should immediately lift the suspension and allow the press to operate freely.""

Karenga told CPJ that the decision to suspend the media outlets had nothing to do with the upcoming referendum but was about ensuring stations meet regulatory standards, especially with regard to balance. He added that the stations had the opportunity to appeal directly to the regulator or to the courts.

The VOA condemned the suspension and said its content would be ""available in Kirundi and Kinyarwanda via shortwave channels, on the Internet and on FM transmitters located in neighboring countries."" In a separate statement to CPJ, the VOA said that it was ""exploring legal options that would permit its broadcasting operations to reopen in Burundi as quickly as possible.""

In an emailed statement, the BBC told CPJ that it was ""disappointed"" by the government action and said it would respond appropriately against ""any broadcast"" found to be falling short of ""strict editorial guidelines.""

The CNC also issued warnings in the May 4 statement to Radio France International (RFI) and two local, privately owned radio stations, Isanganiro and CCIB-FM Plus. RFI was accused of broadcasting dishonest reports about the referendum. The CNC said that the two local radio stations failed to verify sources in their reporting and did not stick to the programming schedule they had submitted to the regulator.

Yves Rocle, Africa director of RFI, told CPJ that he was not precisely sure of the accusations facing the station but ""apparently"" a guest's comments displeased the CNC, though he did not specify which guest.

CPJ could not reach CCIB-FM Plus or Isanganiro for comment.

Burundi once had a robust press but the media environment has become hostile in recent years. Between April 2015 and August 2015, at least 100 Burundian journalists fled into exile, following attacks, threats and intimidation during a political crisis that included an attempted coup, according to CPJ research.","Burundi media regulator suspends BBC and VOA, warns other broadcasters",https://cpj.org/2018/05/burundi-media-regulator-suspends-bbc-and-voa-warns.php

NAIROBI,

Burundi on Tuesday launched the official campaign for a referendum on constitutional change that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power for another 16 years.

Twenty-six parties, most of them aligned with the ruling CNDD-FDD party, have been authorised to campaign for the May 17 plebiscite in the politically tense central African nation.

The vote is taking place in tightly-controlled conditions, and parties which advise electors to abstain — rather than cast a Yes or No ballot — risk up to three years' jail.

ARUSHA ACCORDS

Burundi's exiled opposition, gathered in an alliance called CNARED, has called for a boycott of the referendum, which it describes as the ""death knell"" to a 2000 agreement that helped end a bloody civil war.

Nkurunziza, a 54-year-old former rebel leader, has ruled the small, densely populated central African nation since 2005.

No president can govern Burundi for more than 10 years under the 2000 Arusha peace accords, which helped to end a 1993-2006 conflict that killed more than 300,000 people.

But if the amendment is approved, Nkurunziza would be entitled to stand for two more seven-year terms from 2020.

CRISIS

In 2015, Burundi was plunged into a deep political crisis when Nkurunziza ran for a third term in office.

At least 1,200 people were killed and 400,000 fled the country.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun an investigation into widespread abuses that took place at this time.

More than five million people have signed up to vote, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) says.

DRAFT CONSTITUTION

Opposition leaders accuse the government of stifling debate and failing even to issue the official draft of the proposed change.

""The government has not even officially communicated to us the draft of the revised constitution so that we can examine it and know for sure which text will be submitted for public approval or disapproval,"" Georges Nikiza, the spokesman for the National Rally for Change, RANAC, told AFP.

Even the Amizero y'Abarundi coalition, which has five members in the government, said it was still unaware of the final text.

""When the time came to discuss the constitutional amendment in the cabinet, the text was handed out to ministers and it was taken away from them shortly afterwards... The risk is that we are called out to vote without knowing officially what is going to change,"" a coalition leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

On April 20, police said eight people had been arrested with ""the goal of disrupting the next referendum with the use of firearms.""",Burundi kicks off referendum campaign,https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Burundi-kicks-off-campaign-for-controversial-referendum/1066-4540130-clgppt/index.html

Voluntary repatriation: The Tripartite (Burundi/Tanzania/UNHCR) Commission for the Voluntary Repatriation of Burundian Refugees in Tanzania, which held its 20th meeting in Bujumbura on 28 March, adopted an action plan for the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian refugees from Tanzania between April and December 2018.

According to the plan, 2,000 refugees will be repatriated each week, starting on 5 April, with the possibility of progressively increasing the number. The priority will be given to the 19,148 refugees already registered for voluntary repatriation. WFP will be supporting the process by providing the returnees with a three-month food package for their reintegration. As of 31 March 2018, a total of 20,768 Burundians had returned home with the support of the humanitarian community since the launch of the operation in September 2017. In March 2018, 4,319 Burundians returned home.

Advocacy for Cankuzo province WFP and FAO are jointly advocating for assistance in the province of Cankuzo, one of the provinces most affected by food and nutrition insecurity due to high food prices, reduced labor markets due to limited trans-border movements in Tanzania and slow recovery of agricultural livelihoods after the 2016 drought. The province is among those receiving the largest number of returnees from Tanzania. The food security situation is expected to deteriorate from May to June. According to 2016-2017 Burundi Health and Demographic Survey-III, chronic malnutrition rates are at 59.4 percent, while acute malnutrition is at 6.3 percent.

Assistance is urgently needed to improve the food security of the population of Cankuzo.

Provision of assistance to IDPs: 2,000 IDPs displaced by torrential rains that hit south Burundi 3 years ago have recently been relocated by the government to Kigwena,

Rumonge province in southern Burundi. In March, WFP provided them with food assistance; a total of 95 mt was distributed representing a three-month ration. WFP will continue to closely monitor their food security situation. In June, a multi sectoral assessment including food security will be conducted in the site, and the results will determine the type of assistance to be provided.","WFP Burundi Country Brief, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/wfp-burundi-country-brief-march-2018

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The socio-political situation in Burundi remains precarious and continue to spur on movement of population and humanitarian needs. A total of 397,526 refugees, the majority of whom are children (54.6 per cent), have found refuge in neighbouring countries (mainly in Tanzania, Rwanda, DRC and Uganda), a slight increase of 1,353 people since the last report in February 2018. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) registered in eighteen provinces continues to decrease and is currently 174,011 of which 58 per cent are children (IOM, March 2018).

On 28 March 2018, a new tripartite agreement was signed between the Government of Burundi, the Government of Tanzania and UNHCR to continue supporting the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian from Tanzania in 2018. Since September 2017, a total of 20,739 people have been repatriated to Burundi (UNHCR, 22 March 2018). An estimated 60,000 people have also spontaneously returned.

There was a sharp decrease in malaria cases and deaths since the beginning of the year. According to the Ministry of Health (MoH) data, the cumulative number of malaria cases reported during the first fifteen weeks of 2018 is 1,542,769 cases with 744 deaths, which is 44% lower than the number of cases reported for the same period in 2017 (2,743,764 cases and 1,240 deaths).",UNICEF Burundi Humanitarian Situation Report – March – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/unicef-burundi-humanitarian-situation-report-march-april-2018

Burundi’s constitutional referendum campaign has been marred by violence as government security forces and ruling party members have intimidated, beaten, and killed perceived opponents. The government has tried to keep news of these abuses from the outside world.

Last Friday it doubled down on that effort, suspending the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America from reporting in the country before the critical final days of the scheduled May 17 vote.

A win in the constitutional referendum will allow President Pierre Nkurunziza – who has been in power since 2005 – to extend his term in office until 2034.

The government-controlled National Communication Council (CNC), Burundi’s media regulator, suspended the BBC for six months for “violating press laws” and “unprofessional conduct” after inviting a Burundian national to its program on March 12. It claimed his remarks were “inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified and damaged the reputation of the head of state.” The CNC banned VOA for the technical reason that it was using a banned frequency.

The CNC warned French broadcaster Radio France Internationale that it could face consequences for recent remarks it deemed “untruthful and partisan,” and the Burundian station Isanganiro was criticized for apparently poor verification of sources.

Several weeks earlier the CNC suspended the online comments section of Iwacu, Burundi’s main independent newspaper.

Burundi previously had one of the most independent media environments in the region. But when Nkurunziza announced his bid for a contested third term in 2015, a crackdown on protests led to a serious political and human rights crisis and tightened restrictions on the media. Local stations were physically destroyed and a journalist went missing as Burundians, the majority of whom live in the countryside, turned to international broadcasts for information.

And now the government has turned to silencing some of these crucial international voices.

The CNC knows the power of the media. It recognizes that when the country is deprived of accurate news, then government security forces can act with impunity. As campaigning kicks off around the referendum, more violence can be expected, with Burundians increasingly in the dark, reliant on rumors and scraps of information. But the government can’t stop the networks of Burundians sending information to Burundian and international human rights groups. Even with all the radio stations in the country shut, crimes will ultimately be reported and those responsible eventually brought to justice.",International Media Banned During Burundi’s Referendum Campaign,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/06/international-media-banned-during-burundis-referendum-campaign

13,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope
14,burundi,"Caritas Rwanda is launching an emergency appeal to assist thousands of refugees from Burundi and help improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in the Mahama camp in the country’s east. Caritas is struggling to raise financial support, with a shortfall in funding of nearly €200,000.

There are more than 57,650 Burundians living in the camp. Many fled Burundi when conflict broke out in 2015 and are still unable to return. Camp newcomers are arriving each month.

Caritas Rwanda wants to continue its programmes providing critical food, economic and psychological support for refugees.

With this new project, Caritas plans to continue its work and assist a total of 5,100 people by providing nutritional assistance to 1,300 chronically ill, 1,400 elderly and 1,000 others with disabilities. It also intends to offer counselling to 200 people who may have been victims of violence or suffered other kinds of trauma. Caritas Rwanda also serves the newcomers during their first 3 days in the camps with meals.

“A great deal has been achieved in the past three years but with no end in sight to the crisis in Burundi, there is an ongoing need to assist refugees, in particular the chronically ill, mentally and physically disabled and the elderly,” said Therese Nduwamungu, Carita Rwanda project coordinator.

Financial sustainability is crucial for long-term refugees. Caritas will offer advice and training to 1,100 women about savings and loans and cultivating their own vegetable gardens to improve households’ everyday nutrition.

Due to funding shortfalls in the past year, Caritas Rwanda has been forced to make a difficult decision and cut back its fresh food assistance for chronically ill people, including those living with HIV, diabetics and anaemic patients. The negative impact is huge. Chronically ill cannot survive without fresh food and the number of malnourished children under the age of five is rising.

Pascal Mushengezi, 60, suffers from cancer. He used to receive a hot daily meal. “I have been treated for my illness for a long time and finally they let me know I had cancer. Caritas gave me a hot meal that gradually gave me energy. I live alone. I have no one to help me.”

Marie Mbonimpa, a 78-year-old widow who suffers from anaemia and lives alone, relied on food assistance which has now been stopped. “Every week, I was given 5 kg of potatoes, two eggs, a cabbage, a kilo of beans and a handful carrots. Today, I feel I have no life left, I am wasting away every day.”

Caritas Rwanda staff and volunteers in the Mahama camp said people who had benefited from fresh food assistance were dying and the restoration of this assistance was essential for the survival of the most vulnerable.

Caritas Rwanda is one of only three local non-government organizations working in the Mahama camp and also works closely with UN bodies there. Staff spoke to representatives of the American Refugee Committee and Save the Children International to find out more about the consequences.

Jean Damascène Habimana, a nutritionist for the American Refugee Committee at the Mahama camp, said there had been an increase in the number of anaemic patients and the length of time they were being treated. In March alone 455 anaemic children were treated at the Mahama I health centre, while the number had never exceeded 200 previously.

Pascal Nkuru, nutrition co-ordinator for Save the Children, said 289 malnourished children under five were being cared for at the end of March by the health centre where he worked inside the Mahama camp. “A patient who does not receive adequate food not only cannot see the extension of his treatment, but worse still, withers away even more,” he said. “This is obvious for chronically ill people who require an appropriate diet. ”

Fresh food for hospitalised patients has been kept in the new project, even if reduced to a bare minimum because of the cost, to try to continue to support those vulnerable in the coming months, the time for Caritas Rwanda to try to find a solution.",Bad news for Burundian refugees in Rwanda as funds dry up,https://reliefweb.int/report/rwanda/bad-news-burundian-refugees-rwanda-funds-dry

Does the East African Community have what it takes to help bring stability to Burundi?

First published by ISS Today

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the EAC (East African Community) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the AU (African Union).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and Comesa jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.

Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.

Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.

More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.

The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives. DM

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tanzania hosts the largest number of Burundian refugees in the region with a total of 318,202 refugees as of end January 2018. Over 234,000 are Burundian refugees hosted in three camps in Nyarugusu, Mtendeli and Nduta, and 84,202 are Congolese refugees who are also in Nyarugusu. The majority of the refugees from DRC have been in the country for the past 20 years. All the camps are overcrowded with overstretched basic services.

More than 60 per cent of the refugees are still in mass shelters. Children make up 57 per cent of the refugee population and more than 7,000 children are unaccompanied and separated. Protection concerns such as sexual and gender-based violence are significant. There is an inadequate number of schools, a shortage of water especially in Mtendeli camp, and health and nutrition facilities are overstretched. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity, accounting for 33 per cent of all Out Patient Department (OPD) attendances.

No new asylum seekers have been received from Burundi in 2018, but Tanzania received over 2,000 refugees from the Democratic of Congo between November 2017 and January 2018. Voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees resumed in the second week of February 2018, and so far 2,460 refuges have been assisted to voluntary return between January and February 2018. This makes a total of 16,130 refugees repatriated out of the registered 43,060 since the commencement of the assisted Voluntary return in September 2017.

Kigoma is endemic to cholera due to recurring outbreaks. The latest outbreak started in November 2017 that affected over 300 people was brought under control in January 2018. Cholera is still a major threat in the refugee camps and host communities. There were a few suspected cholera cases reported from the new asylum seekers arriving from DRC at Kibirizi reception centre in January 2018 who were admitted at Gungu CTC and later discharged.

Under the coordination of the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UNICEF continues to support the refugee hosting districts in Kigoma region through the UN Kigoma Joint Programme and is leading two Outcomes; Violence against Women and Children (VAWC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). In addition, UNICEF is part of outcome 4: Empowering adolescent girls through education. The government notified all development partners on 23 January 2018 that they will no longer continue to engage in the pilot initiative under the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CCRF). UNICEF and partners will continue to engage with the government to ensure that the refugee response and the needs of host communities are addressed holistically.

While the socio-political situation in Burundi and DRC remains unpredictable, cross–border influxes are expected to continue throughout 2018. Without counting new arrivals and even with the ongoing voluntary repatriations, the refugee population continues to grow with over 1500 babies born every month in the three camps.",Tanzania Humanitarian Situation Report (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/tanzania-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018
