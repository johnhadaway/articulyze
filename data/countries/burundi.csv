Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tanzania hosts the largest number of Burundian refugees in the region with a total of 318,202 refugees as of end January 2018. Over 234,000 are Burundian refugees hosted in three camps in Nyarugusu, Mtendeli and Nduta, and 84,202 are Congolese refugees who are also in Nyarugusu. The majority of the refugees from DRC have been in the country for the past 20 years. All the camps are overcrowded with overstretched basic services.

More than 60 per cent of the refugees are still in mass shelters. Children make up 57 per cent of the refugee population and more than 7,000 children are unaccompanied and separated. Protection concerns such as sexual and gender-based violence are significant. There is an inadequate number of schools, a shortage of water especially in Mtendeli camp, and health and nutrition facilities are overstretched. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity, accounting for 33 per cent of all Out Patient Department (OPD) attendances.

No new asylum seekers have been received from Burundi in 2018, but Tanzania received over 2,000 refugees from the Democratic of Congo between November 2017 and January 2018. Voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees resumed in the second week of February 2018, and so far 2,460 refuges have been assisted to voluntary return between January and February 2018. This makes a total of 16,130 refugees repatriated out of the registered 43,060 since the commencement of the assisted Voluntary return in September 2017.

Kigoma is endemic to cholera due to recurring outbreaks. The latest outbreak started in November 2017 that affected over 300 people was brought under control in January 2018. Cholera is still a major threat in the refugee camps and host communities. There were a few suspected cholera cases reported from the new asylum seekers arriving from DRC at Kibirizi reception centre in January 2018 who were admitted at Gungu CTC and later discharged.

Under the coordination of the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UNICEF continues to support the refugee hosting districts in Kigoma region through the UN Kigoma Joint Programme and is leading two Outcomes; Violence against Women and Children (VAWC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). In addition, UNICEF is part of outcome 4: Empowering adolescent girls through education. The government notified all development partners on 23 January 2018 that they will no longer continue to engage in the pilot initiative under the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CCRF). UNICEF and partners will continue to engage with the government to ensure that the refugee response and the needs of host communities are addressed holistically.

While the socio-political situation in Burundi and DRC remains unpredictable, cross–border influxes are expected to continue throughout 2018. Without counting new arrivals and even with the ongoing voluntary repatriations, the refugee population continues to grow with over 1500 babies born every month in the three camps.",Tanzania Humanitarian Situation Report (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/tanzania-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018

Conflicts in Africa often reflect a breakdown of peace agreements that have been methodically dismantled by politicians intent on evading checks on power while oversight is weak. Vigilance is vital as early progress is not a guarantee of long-term success.

Many of the conflicts in Africa today are resumptions of earlier conflicts. These conflicts, therefore, reflect a breakdown, to some degree, of previously negotiated peace agreements. A review of the experiences from three of these cases—Lesotho, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—offers lessons that can help inform future such accords.

Coalition-Building in Lesotho

For decades, Lesotho’s political system used the first-past-the-post electoral system as a means of selecting leaders. Owing to poorly designed voting districts, this method generated outcomes where winning parties gained a disproportionate share of parliamentary seats and left losers without representation. Lesotho had already experienced coups in 1970, 1986, 1991, and 1994 when the 1998 elections sparked yet another crisis as a result of the then–ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy winning 79 of 80 parliamentary seats despite garnering only 60 percent of the vote.

Anger over this lopsided result culminated in a violent coup attempt and weeks of fighting between soldiers linked to the opposition and regional peacekeepers. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) established an Interim Political Authority (IPA) to oversee reforms that would break Lesotho’s cycle of instability. Among them was adoption of a mixed member proportional (MMP) electoral system that expanded parliament to 120 seats—80 contested through first-past-the-post voting (tied to constituencies) and 40 filled using proportional representation—to ensure that the number of seats held by each party would more or less reflect its proportion of the national vote.

The MMP was intended to compensate for the underrepresentation of political parties seen in the previous system, a key driver of the crisis in 1998. The 2002 polls, the first to implement the new process, saw a significantly higher voter turnout, gave smaller parties a voice in government, and introduced more equitable representation. The new system also limited single-party dominance by creating incentives for competitors to create coalitions once elected.

What Went Wrong?

Despite these reforms, Lesotho saw an election marred by allegations of massive fraud and violent riots in 2007, a coup attempt in 2014, the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Tom Thabane in 2015, the murder of two army chiefs of staff and several senior police officers in 2015 and 2017, and numerous clashes between elements in the army and police loyal to political factions. What happened?

Politicians began to find loopholes in the new rules that allowed them to manipulate the electoral system to gain greater control of government than was allowed. For instance, one provision of the SADC-negotiated system stipulates that the more first-past-the-post seats a party wins, the fewer it can earn through proportional representation. Thus, bigger parties began to forge coalitions with smaller surrogates and fraudulently field the same people on two separate ballots. This undermined the integrity of the entire system and the legitimacy of election results.

Another frequently used tool is “floor crossing”—when members switch party allegiances on the floor in Lesotho’s highly factional parliament. Through floor-crossing, disgruntled members can punish their parties by depriving them of numbers, engineering new opposition coalitions—most of them short-lived—and forcing elections. Members of the military aligned to different factions are often background players in these schemes, pledging allegiances on party lines and preferred election outcomes. In Lesotho, floor-crossing has been a fundamentally destabilizing tactic that has led to the collapse of three governments since 2012. The result has been political leaders effectively operating under the old rules in the pursuit of power.

Power-Sharing in Burundi

The August 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement sought to put an end to Burundi’s recurring episodes of conflict, including two genocides and a 13-year civil war that killed more than 300,000 civilians. Its protocols on power sharing, checks and balances, equitable participation in government, and equal representation in the military were designed to encourage coalition-building across ethnic lines, minority overrepresentation as a security provision, and accountable governance.

The idea of imposing institutional caps to discourage the concentration of power in a single party was borrowed from the Lesotho model, and indeed, some of the drafters of the IPA arrangements also drafted the Arusha Accords. Under the new system, the ruling party and its allies cannot control more than 67 percent of central and local government posts and 60 percent of national institutions even if they secure majority votes. In the military, not more than 50 percent can be drawn from any one ethnic group in view of the need to achieve ethnic balance and inclusion. Furthermore, the Ministry of Defense, which oversees all aspects of the military, was made institutionally independent from the rest of the executive branch to protect it from interference and partisan politics.

What Went Wrong?

While the Arusha Accords are widely credited with advancing peace, stability, and reform in Burundi for more than a decade, the situation has sharply deteriorated since 2015. The crisis triggered by President Pierre Nkurunziza’s quest for a disputed third term generated protests, a failed coup, thousands of deaths, and the discovery of several mass graves. Government officials are being investigated for crimes against humanity, and more than half a million citizens have fled the country or been internally displaced.

The first signs of trouble in Burundi appeared in 2006, just a year after the Implementation Monitoring Committee wound up its work. Elements of the military, intelligence, and police carried out a wave of targeted killings in an attempt to suppress opponents. This pattern would repeat itself in 2008 and in the run-up to the 2010 and 2015 polls.

In 2016, a state commission aligned with the ruling party recommended the lifting of presidential term limits and reverting to a majoritarian system—effectively dismantling the Arusha Accords. The changes would allow the ruling party to gain majority control at the local, provincial, and national level.

Other changes dilute the independence of the Defense Ministry, give the ruling party greater control over the force, and create auxiliary forces that many fear provide a cover to formally integrate the state-sponsored ethnic militia, the Imbonerakure, into the security sector. These sweeping changes will be put before a referendum on May 17, 2018, despite warnings by the African Union (AU) that the breakdown of these Accords will lead to civil war.

Regional guarantors that helped shape the Arusha Accords and usher in their implementation have, however, failed to act to stop them from unraveling. The United Nations and African Union have condemned the government’s moves and accused the Imbonerakure of conducting widespread mass atrocities. Yet, little action has been taken to back up their reproaches. In January 2017, the AU reversed an earlier decision to deploy a protection force into Burundi to avert mass atrocities following the killing of more than 300 people in a single day in the capital, Bujumbura. Both the AU and UN have failed to secure the consent of the Burundian authorities to deploy unarmed police units to create a protective presence on the ground short of deploying a peacekeeping force. The UN closed its political mission in 2014, and peace talks led by the East African Community remain frozen largely due to disagreements among member states.

The upshot has been that the ties intended to sustain the Arusha Accords have been insufficient to withstand the pressures to break out of the agreement.

Checks and Balances in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

The 2002 Sun City Accords that negotiated the end of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s devastating civil wars created a powerful legislative branch to act as a crucial check on power of the executive branch and overcome the legacy of kleptocratic rule dating back to DRC’s independence. The government at the time was a minority in the new parliamentary set-up, with 94 out of 500 seats. The rest were held by opposition parties and civil society, with the former controlling the strategic Office of the Speaker and the latter the oversight committees. Because of its minority status, the ruling party was forced to build coalitions. By the end of the Accords’ interim period in 2006, a culture of accountability was taking root, with the new parliament starting to conduct rigorous oversight of the presidency. By early 2009, parliamentarians had raised more than 43 oral questions of government officials and state-owned firms, prompting 28 independent investigations into misconduct.

What Went Wrong?

By the middle of 2009, loyalists of President Joseph Kabila had contrived to remove the Speaker to frustrate investigations into the executive branch. The next year, they were able to increase their share of seats to 341 through gerrymandering and patronage. This supermajority allowed them to then push through a raft of partisan bills tilted in Kabila’s favor, including a bill scrapping the two-round runoff rule and another allowing Kabila to remain in office if elections were delayed. The former allowed Kabila to win the 2011 polls with just 49 percent of the vote while the latter provided a veneer of legitimacy for his continued stay in office after his second term had expired in December 2016.

The Constitutional Court called for in the Sun City Accords only became operational in 2015—10 years after its creation. All of its judges are Kabila loyalists (three elected by him, three by the regime-dominated parliament, and three by the judicial council, which is staffed by ruling party cadres). In 2016, it ruled that the bill allowing Kabila to stay in office in case of a poll delay was constitutional. That same year, the Supreme Court allowed him to appoint governors to 26 new provinces created under a 2006 constitutional provision to divide the country’s 11 provinces. Its sudden and chaotic implementation 10 years later guaranteed that elections would not be held on time.

When Kabila predictably refused to step down at the end of his two-term limit, it galvanized many of the estimated 70 armed groups currently active in anti-government strongholds in the east, Kasai, and Katanga and has sparked widespread protests and government crackdowns.

Lessons

A key takeaway from this review is that successful peace agreements are anchored on leaders honoring their commitments. This was the case in the South African, Namibian, and Mozambican peace processes. However, such committed leadership cannot be assumed. In Lesotho, Burundi, and DRC, political leaders methodically dismantled key elements of the agreements that they saw as impediments to their pursuit of power. Regional and international partners, in turn, failed to enforce the peace processes’ provisions when these were being violated. This underscores the indispensable role that external guarantors play in the years after an agreement is signed. This is more than a perfunctory responsibility.

Given the tendency of political elites to challenge new norms and revert to entrenched legacies of malpractice, institutional strengthening and robust oversight are fundamental ingredients in the success of peace agreements. Yet, nearly all countries emerging from conflict have weak institutions.

Peace agreements, therefore, must be explicitly bolstered and protected against anticipated executive branch interference. In short, domestic political actors will want to test these limits. Experience shows that clear, early responses from guarantors to these tests is warranted to keep peace processes on track.

Agreements should include strong protections of civil liberties since civil society and the media play a critical role in providing domestic oversight and upholding institutions. Restrictions on civil society and the media, therefore, should be an early warning signal to external actors of threats to the implementation of the peace process. Protections of civil liberties should be accompanied by clearly defined and strict term limits for political leaders. Such limits are especially important in these early years when norms of succession have not yet been established and restraining institutions are weak.

Another important lesson that emerges from these cases is that successful consolidation of peace agreements takes time. Early progress is not a guarantee of long-term success. As sustaining the peace process relies on resilient institutions, success requires ongoing engagement by domestic, regional, and international actors. This consolidation process typically requires at least a decade.

Regional enforcement through collective action may appear cumbersome. However, as the cases cited above show, inaction opens the seam for the unravelling of the rest of what may be a well-knit peace agreement. The cost of this inaction, moreover is invariably higher—for the designated country and its neighbors.

5,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope

Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Up to 14 million older people with disabilities are currently affected by humanitarian emergencies and, even though they are among the most at risk, a new study reveals how they routinely face barriers that limit their access to assistance and protection.

Missing millions: how older people with disabilities are excluded from humanitarian response is launched today (30 April) by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and HelpAge International.

Although there is increasingly a focus on including older people and people with disabilities in humanitarian efforts, the study found that people who are both older and disabled risk having their rights to safe and dignified assistance and protection denied.

The study drew upon a comprehensive literature review, data analysis, and interviews with older people affected by crises in Tanzania and Ukraine. It reveals how older people with disabilities fared worse than those without disabilities, and how this is related to various physical and institutional barriers, as well as hostile attitudes.

Data analysis revealed that between 7.8 and 13.7 million older people with disabilities are currently affected by humanitarian crises. It showed that these people, compared to older people without disabilities, are more likely to have been out of work, have a serious health problem, spend more than a quarter of their income on healthcare, be unable to participate in community life, and rate their quality of life as poor.

A person's capacity to survive a humanitarian crisis correlates with their health and financial status. Those with money and good health are better able to escape and live elsewhere than those who have little money and poor health.

The literature review reflected this, showing how older people with disabilities were at greater risk of being left behind during emergencies in Ethiopia, Japan, Syria and USA. For those who do escape, older people with disabilities face barriers in accessing information and services, and they are more likely to be affected psychologically by crises.

Humanitarian responders often require recipients to collect aid or social protection payments in person, and that it can be difficult or impossible across long distances and tough terrain without transportation.

A 100-year-old woman who fled Burundi to camps in Tanzania who was interviewed for the study said: ""It's difficult for me to carry my food ration because of my poor health and my disabilities.""

Some older people with disabilities were humiliated by the negative attitudes of staff, and even told to leave the camp by younger people. Those interviewed in Tanzania said they felt forgotten about because of their age, and in Ukraine they felt vulnerable to theft when collecting their pensions.

""Our research showed that older people with disabilities are at greater risk of poverty and more likely to have health problems that require costly medication. Yet they are rarely included in livelihoods programmes and activities that would offer opportunities to work and earn money, despite expressing a desire to do so,"" said Dr Sarah Polack, Associate Professor at LSHTM's International Centre for Evidence in Disability.

A 90-year-old woman in Tanzania said: ""I feel sad that I can't do the things I did before. I used to cultivate some land and be independent, but I can’t do that now. I used to have visitors and manage to give them something, but not anymore. I can't do anything. This upsets me a lot.""

Homes, public facilities and toilets are typically not accessible, and lack wheelchair ramps, handrails and other low-cost adaptations that can make a big difference. This can leave older people with disabilities socially isolated, housebound and deprived of their dignity, threatening their mental health at a time when conflict, disaster and insecurity has already impacted on their emotional wellbeing.

An 87-year-old man in eastern Ukraine said: ""My wife stayed in the basement all the time. I used to go outside sometimes, but she couldn't go out because of the stairs. It affected her a lot.""

These barriers marginalise older people with disabilities and threaten their rights to independence, dignity and participation.

""For too long, older people with disabilities have been invisible in humanitarian responses, their fundamental human rights denied,"" said Madeleine McGivern, Global Humanitarian Advocacy Adviser at HelpAge International.

""This must change. Barriers to accessing assistance and protection need to be removed, and the voices of older people with disabilities must be heard so that humanitarian responses meet their needs.""

What can be done to support the rights of older people with disabilities in humanitarian crises?

The study advocates that donors, policy makers and humanitarian responders demonstrate leadership and commitment to ensure older people with disabilities are always included. Recommendations include:

using the Humanitarian Inclusion Standards for Older People and People with Disabilities, and ensuring senior staff take responsibility to include these groups

collecting data fully disaggregated by sex, age and disability, and only funding programmes that meet this standard

recognising the right and capabilities of older people with disabilities, and consulting and including them at all ages

investing in tackling age and disability discrimination, and giving older people with disabilities a voice

supporting NGOs, state welfare departments and healthcare providers to make services and distributions inclusive and accessible.

11,burundi,"One of the main causes of food insecurity for farmers in rural areas is limited access to agricultural inputs.

In a bid to combat that, international donors and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) have instigated input trade fairs and voucher schemes to provide poor, vulnerable and food insecure farmers with access to seeds, fertilisers and tools.

Similar schemes are being promoted by the EU, which has placed support for ‘resilience’ in farming and food security at the heart of its projects in sub-Saharan Africa. That includes building links with agri-businesses and promoting access to finance, such as crop insurance schemes.

Edenred, a French company, is probably best known in Europe for its lunch voucher system, but it has been running agriculture voucher schemes in sub-Saharan Africa for a number of years. In Burundi, the Ticket Agri scheme was launched in 2013, with the support of the government, to increase food security through the use of adapted fertilisers.

The rationale for the scheme was that the high cost of fertilisers was limiting crop production. The vouchers were part of a national fertiliser subsidy.

The scheme is simple enough: one voucher buys a bag of fertiliser. Four and a half years on, and 3.3 million vouchers have been used by more than 300,000 farmers in Burundi, one of East Africa’s smallest and most fragile states.

Encouraging the fertiliser market quickly increased production and income for small-holder farmers, generating an average 18% increase in revenue for local farmers.

The voucher scheme has also served as a market-maker. Farmers were initially only contributing 25% of the price, with the Burundian government subsidising the remaining 75%. That subsidy is now down to 25% and is likely to be scrapped now that the market is thriving and farmers can afford it.

“There was no fertiliser import, we were trying to bring back the importers. That created a market for merchants,” says Edenred’s Public Programme Manager, Nolwenn Bertrand.

The firm ran a similar pilot scheme in the eastern Kivu regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2015 and 2016 with the national fertiliser organization. That was administered digitally, via a plastic card that merchants could read. It was used by 3500 beneficiaries. Projects in Mali and South Sudan, meanwhile, were halted by civil wars.

So what’s the attraction of such schemes over cash hand-outs?

For one, they can be targeted at specific commodities and communities that are most in need of assistance.

“We know when the merchants have asked to be reimbursed, who got them – we can see the life-cycle of the vouchers,” said Bertrand.

A cashless system, meanwhile, is also far less susceptible to fraud. Merchants are far less likely to be robbed of vouchers – whether digital or paper – that have no value to anyone outside the ecosystem than if they were carrying cash.

Donors also like such schemes because of the need to have a close relationship with the host government, who agree on how the money is spent. They contend that such schemes are also a reliable means to alleviate rural poverty—by improving yields, and offering smallholder farmers the opportunity to scale up and increase their own investment in their business.",Market-making for Burundi’s farmers,https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/market-making-for-burundis-farmers/
12,burundi,"Expand Germain Rukiki. © Facebook

A Burundian human rights activist, Germain Rukuki, was sentenced to 32 years in prison on Thursday on charges of “rebellion,” “threatening state security,” “participation in an insurrectional movement,” and “attacks on the head of state.” The verdict and harsh sentence come just weeks before a constitutional referendum that will allow the president to extend his term in office.

Rukuki’s conviction sends a strong message to anyone who dares document government abuse ahead of the vote. As the referendum approaches, the government is brutally cracking down on suspected opponents and signaling clearly that those who do not register or who dare to vote “no” will face dire consequences.

Rukuki, a member of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT)-Burundi, has been detained since last July. His organization conducted investigations and advocacy before and during the violence of 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his bid for a controversial third term, plunging the country into a serious political and human rights crisis that continues today.

The government closed ACAT down in October 2016, along with several other human rights groups accused of working to “tarnish the image of the country” and “sow hatred and division” among the people. But that wasn’t enough. Human rights groups regard Rukuki’s subsequent arrest and trial as a direct attack.

Rukuki is not the only rights activist to be targeted. In November, authorities arrested Nestor Nibitanga, an observer for the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (APRODH), a leading Burundian human rights organization. Like Rukuki, Nibitanga was charged with “threatening state security.” The national intelligence service (Service national de renseignement, SNR) held both of them before transferring them to prison.

Last August, a group of UN experts called for Rukiki’s release and raised concerns over using charges of acting against state security and threats to silence human rights activists. These concerns are proving well founded in the run up to the referendum. With Rukiki’s conviction, the message is clear to anyone who seeks to raise the alarm about abuse in Burundi: you are not safe.",Paying the Price in Burundi,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/27/paying-price-burundi

SECURITY COUNCIL

8223RD MEETING* (PM)

The Security Council today expressed deep concern over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue and the lack of engagement by the Government in that process.

In presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7, presented by Gustavo Meza‑Cuadra (Peru), Council President for April, the Security Council welcomed and supported the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue based on the Arusha Agreement.

Expressing deep concern over the slow progress of the dialogue and calling for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in that process, the Council said it was crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections.

The Security Council further stressed that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi and called upon the United Nations, the African Union and the East African Community, among others, to coordinate their efforts in assisting stakeholders in setting outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement.

Underscoring its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the Council commended the host countries for their efforts, and called upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

Further, the Council strongly condemned all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi and reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 3:08 p.m.

Presidential Statement

The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7 reads as follows:

“The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community and the lack of engagement by the Government of Burundi in that regard. It recalls its statement S/PRST/2017/13.

“The Security Council welcomes and supports the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community, expressed at the thirtieth African Union summit and the nineteenth East African Community summit, to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue on the basis of the Arusha Agreement of 28 August 2000 and the Constitution of Burundi, and reiterates its support to the facilitation led by former President B. Mkapa under the mediation of President Museveni. The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the slow progress of this dialogue and calls for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in this process. It is crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections. The Security Council further stresses that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi.

“The Security Council underlines the utmost importance of respecting the letter and the spirit of the Arusha Agreement, which has helped to sustain a decade of peace in Burundi, and expresses concern that the situation prevailing in Burundi has seriously undermined the significant gains achieved through the Arusha Agreement, with devastating consequences for Burundi and the region. It urges the guarantors of the Agreement to meet their obligations in this regard, to ensure that the entirety of the Agreement is adhered to.

“The Security Council calls upon the United Nations, the African Union, East African Community, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the guarantors of the Arusha Agreement to coordinate their efforts of assisting Burundian stakeholders settle outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement. The Security Council notes with appreciation the readiness of the African Union to deploy the high‑level committee of Heads of State on Burundi.

“The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Burundi. The Security Council stresses the importance of implementation of the Arusha Agreement, calls upon the Burundian authorities to initiate all political initiatives through a broad consensus of all stakeholders, which requires a political and security environment that induces the confidence of all political actors and, in this regard, expresses its strong support for the African Union decision at its thirtieth summit. The Security Council expresses the need that these conditions be fully implemented in advance of planned political initiatives.

“The Security Council calls on States in the region to contribute to finding a political solution for the situation in Burundi, refrain from any interference, including through supporting the activities of armed movements in any way, and to respect their obligations under international law, and recalls in this regard commitments of the States in the region under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

“The Security Council notes its expectation that elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi will be free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties, and will ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process. It also underlines that considerable improvements to the political and human rights situation, in particular regarding fundamental freedoms, including for freedom of the press and of civil society actors such as human rights defenders, and progress on reconciliation are necessary to enable credible elections.

“The Security Council underscores its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, and commends the host countries for their efforts, and calls upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

“The Security Council notes that a number of bilateral and multilateral partners have suspended their financial and technical assistance to the Government of Burundi, in view of the situation in Burundi, and encourages bilateral and multilateral partners and the Government of Burundi to continue their dialogue with a view to the Government of Burundi creating conducive conditions for resumption of the assistance. The Security Council commends the assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral partners to alleviate the humanitarian situation and calls on Member States to continue to provide support to respond to the humanitarian needs in the country.

“The Security Council strongly condemns all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi, whoever perpetrates them, including those involving extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including those concerning children, forced disappearances, acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment, harassment and intimidation of civil society, including human rights defenders, women’s organizations, and journalists, restriction of fundamental freedoms, as well as indiscriminate use of grenade attacks, including against civilians.

“The Security Council reaffirms the primary responsibility of the Government of Burundi for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable. It urges the Government of Burundi to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations, to adhere to the rule of law, to bring to justice and hold accountable all those responsible, including members of the security forces and violent actors affiliated to political parties, for crimes involving violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights, as applicable, including those involving sexual violence and all violations and abuses against children.

“The Security Council notes the steps taken by the Government to withdraw the bans of some civil society organizations, cancel some arrest warrants and release a number of detainees following the presidential pardon on 31 December 2017. The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to take further steps to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations.

“The Security Council reiterates its regret at the decision by the Government of Burundi to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has been present in the country since 1995 to strengthen Burundi’s rule of law institutions, and calls for a swift solution through dialogue between OHCHR and the Government in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions, and fulfill its mandate. The Security Council recalls the commitments the Government of Burundi undertook during the thirty‑sixth session of the Human Rights Council to re‑establish full mutual cooperation with the Human Rights Council and OHCHR, including full cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura, and to accept the visit of a team of three experts from the Office of the High Commissioner to collect information on the human rights situation in Burundi. It notes that discussions regarding revisions to the draft memorandum of understanding between the Republic of Burundi and the United Nations concerning the updated terms for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi have been ongoing for over a year and urges the Government of Burundi to take steps to swiftly finalize the agreement with OHCHR without further delay.

“The Security Council reiterates its concern over the significant delays in the deployment of the African Union human rights observers and military experts. It supports the African Union call for the rapid signing of the memorandum of understanding relating to the activities of the human rights observers and the military experts of the African Union, which will allow the African Union human rights observers and military experts to fully operate in the country in fulfilment of their mandated responsibilities.

“The Security Council acknowledges the contribution of Burundian peacekeepers serving in United Nations- and African Union‑led peacekeeping operations and reiterates the importance of upholding the standards of the United Nations.

“The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to reengage with international partners, especially the United Nations, in a constructive manner based on mutual trust. It reiterates its full support to the Secretary‑General and his Special Envoy in their efforts to engage and work with the Government of Burundi to help overcome the current political impasse and foster an inclusive reconciliation process. It further calls on the Secretary‑General and the Government of Burundi to expeditiously finalize and implement the status of the mission agreement for the Office of the Special Envoy, in order to work with the Government of Burundi and other concerned stakeholders to support the East African Community‑led inter‑Burundian dialogue and in the areas of security and rule of law, to engage with all stakeholders to the crisis, and work with all Burundian parties to develop confidence-building measures, to improve the human rights and security situation, and foster an environment conducive to political dialogue. The Security Council welcomes the active engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission Burundi Configuration as a viable platform for dialogue between Burundi and its partners, using a holistic approach to address the political and socioeconomic situation.

“The Security Council is determined to continue to closely follow the situation in Burundi.”

14,burundi,"Authorities in Burundi on Monday arrested a ruling party official after he called on supporters to throw political opponents into a lake, a judicial source said, ahead of a referendum on extending President Pierre Nkurunziza’s term in office.

The comments by Melchiade Nzopfabarushe, made during a rally on Sunday to party members in his native village, came amid increased political jitters in Burundi, whose modern history has been marred by ethnically-charged civil war.

Nearly 430,000 people, including opposition politicians, have fled the tiny East African nation of 10.5 million since Nkurunziza won a third term in a 2015 election that sparked violent clashes.

His foes said he had no right to run again.

“We said that we have ordered boats. We will send them (opponents) into Lake Tanganyika,” Nzopfabarushe said in a video clip of his comments, which have been circulating online, to the party members in Kabezi, near the capital Bujumbura.

“He, who has the president’s support successfully achieves his endeavors. That is the message we are giving either here or nationwide,” said Nzopfabarushehe, a former Senior Official in the president’s office.

The judicial source said that Nzopfabarushe was being held in custody in the capital.

Though he did not confirm the arrest, Justice Ministry spokesman, Adolphe Havyarimana, said that Nzopfabarushe would appear in court on Monday.

The ruling CNDD FDD party sought to dissociate itself from Nzopfabarushe’s comments, saying on Twitter it rejected “any subversive message which may jeopardise unity and cohesion among the Burundian people”.

The party also said it had asked the justice ministry to investigate all cases of divisive language used by politicians ahead of the May 17 vote.

The referendum would extend the presidential term to seven years from five, allowing Nkurunziza to run again in 2020.

It would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms, but would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending his rule to 2034.

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 after a peace deal ended a decade of civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels, in which 300,000 people were killed.

He ran for a third term in 2015, which opponents said violated the terms of the peace deal, sparking clashes that resulted in hundreds of deaths.

NAIROBI – A Burundian activist was sentenced Thursday to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was ""eminently political"".

Germain Rukuki was given ""32 years of penal servitude"" at Bujumbura's district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for ""having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from May 13, 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property"".

Burundian authorities use the term 'insurrectional movement' to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and more than 400,000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: ""The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

""It is a message from the authorities to all those who dare to oppose the regime and denounce the crimes it commits, one month before a highly disputed constitutional referendum.""

The referendum, scheduled for May 17, would allow 54-year-old Nkurunziza, president since 2005, to stay in power until 2034.

BUJUMBURA, (CAJ News) – ILL-equipped humanitarian groups fear a deadly outbreak of diseases after over 800 pit latrines overflowed following heavy rains in southern Burundi.

Some 500 latrines in the village of Gatabo and 300 latrines in Buga village of Kayogoro Commune in Makamba province have overflowed in the wake of the inclement weather last week.

The dirty water from these latrines poured into these neighboring villages and residents who are fearing for their health.

Volunteers from the Burundi Red Cross have mobilise themselves to sanitise the affected localities but are ill-equipped.

“The Makamba Branch faces an insufficient stock of aquatabs and chlorine for water treatment at home as well as pumps, overalls and boots to successfully perform the spraying activities,” said a spokesperson.

The lack of sufficient equipment also hinders the conduct of hygiene awareness sessions.

Heavy rains have pummeled the entire East African country in recent days.

Last week, a least four people, including three children, drowned in the floods afflicting the capital Bujumbura.

Hundreds of residents have been left homeless.

Over 50 people were injured when a landslide caused by heavy rain left at least six people dead in Bujumbura in March.

Across the Great Lakes region, some 7.4 million people are uprooted. Uganda now hosts the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. About 74,500 Congolese crossed into Uganda from 1 January to 16 April, in the wake of new violence in the Ituri and North Kivu regions of the DRC, with an average of more than 680 refugees arriving from the DRC each day in March. The DRC is itself host to more than half a million refugees from other countries in the region. Meanwhile, there are unverified reports of Congolese returning to the DRC from Angola, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. In early April, 2,600 Burundians who had arrived from the DRC to Rwanda in March decided to voluntarily return to Burundi. However, some 432,000 Burundian refugees remain in neighbouring countries.

Sexual violence is a major concern in the region, much of it unreported and unaddressed. Many refugees arriving from the DRC in neighbouring countries report having endured sexual and gender-based violence. A recent assessment found that 10 per cent of newly arrived children in Uganda said they were raped during their journey.

Levels of hunger and malnutrition are at historically high levels in the DRC, with more than 4.6 million children acutely malnourished, 2.2 million of whom severely acutely malnourished. However, in a positive development, maize prices in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda in March were well below their levels at the same time in 2017. Heavy rains and floods in Burundi, Tanzania and Rwanda have left at least 60 people dead, others injured and many houses destroyed or damaged in March and April.

The region continues to battle simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases, mainly cholera. In the DRC, nearly 8,000 cholera cases have been reported in 2018 but the weekly incidence is declining. More than 2,000 cholera cases have been reported in Uganda since February, mainly among new arrivals from the DRC. Some 36 per cent of the cholera cases reported in Uganda are children under age 5.

Does the East African Community have what it takes to help bring stability to Burundi?

First published by ISS Today

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the EAC (East African Community) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the AU (African Union).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and Comesa jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.

Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.

Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.

More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.

The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

20,burundi,"ISS: Talks remain ineffective as Burundi’s crisis continues

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the East African Community (EAC) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the African Union (AU).Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and COMESA jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives.Written by Gustavo de Carvalho, Senior Researcher and Priyal Singh, Researcher, Peace Operations and Peacebuilding Programme, ISS Pretoria.Republished with permission from ISS Africa .

21,burundi,"By AFP

A Burundian activist was sentenced on Thursday to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was “eminently political”.

Germain Rukuki was given “32 years of penal servitude” at Bujumbura’s district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for “having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from 13 May 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property”.

Burundian authorities use the term ‘insurrectional movement’ to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza’s candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1 200 people dead and more than 400 000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: “The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

“It is a message from the authorities to all those who dare to oppose the regime and denounce the crimes it commits, one month before a highly disputed constitutional referendum.”

The referendum, scheduled for the 17th of May, would allow 54-year-old Nkurunziza, president since 2005, to stay in power until 2034.",Burundi activist given 32 years for anti-president demo,https://www.newzimbabwe.com/burundi-activist-given-32-years-for-anti-president-demo/
22,burundi,"Silvie Bugonza* was barely 16 when she became pregnant. A hardworking student at Budahunga communal school, in northern Burundi’s Kirundo Province, Bugonza had dreams of working with the United Nations to help children frequently displaced during war. Instead, she was expelled from school because of her pregnancy, her dreams crushed. Now 19, the young mother wakes up early to feed and bathe her daughter. Then she straps the girl onto her back as she marches through dew-laden grass to fetch water.

She isn’t alone. Bugonza is part of a largely ignored social epidemic wrecking the lives of young girls and women across Burundi. Perched on rolling mountains and plateaus, the Central African country slightly smaller than Maryland has one of the highest teen fertility rates in the region — 50 percent higher than neighboring Rwanda. That is translating into an increasing number of teenage pregnancies. Burundi’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 8 percent of adolescent girls were pregnant in 2017, up from 7 percent in 2010–11.

I wish I could go back to school. Silvie Bugonza, a teenage mother expelled from school

But that’s only part of the problem. Burundi’s high rate of teenage pregnancies is increasingly finding company in another disturbing trend — girls leaving school because of pregnancies. Across the country, more than 12,000 schoolgirls are estimated to have dropped out of school due to pregnancy between 2009 and 2015, according to data from Burundi’s Ministry of Education. Once out of school, they’re even more vulnerable. The teenage conception rate in Burundi among young uneducated girls (23 percent) is almost four times the number (6 percent) for those with secondary or higher education, the data shows. And the challenges aren’t a rural phenomenon. Bujumbura, the capital, has a teenage pregnancy rate of 12 percent — a figure that climbs further to 15 percent for Ngozi, the country’s second-largest city. Though some young mothers opt out of school simply to manage newborns, many others like Bugonza are expelled or suspended from school in a conservative nation where out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a social taboo. Either way, these pregnancies mean an early end to hopes and dreams of a better future.

“There’s nothing good about being a mother,” says Bugonza. “I wish I could go back to school.”

In Mpanda village, which neighbors Bugonza’s hamlet, 18-year-old Lydia Minani* is idly lying on an old mattress, cuddling her baby as mild rain sprinkles on the flimsy tin roof of her shack. On the walls, pieces of cardboard are tacked up on the crumbling mud wall to give the baby some warmth, as a torn curtain hanging over the window blows in the wind. Minani was suspended from Gahinga secondary school in 2015 after she became pregnant. Her father accuses her of compromising their family values.

Bugonza lives with a supportive aunt now — but she too believes family taboos were responsible for her predicament. Her mother, she says, never spoke to her openly about sex and protection. That lack of education about sex and reproductive health is a key contributor to the current crisis, suggests Georges Gahungu, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) agency representative in charge of programs in Burundi. “Many girls who become pregnant don’t know their menstrual cycles,” he says.

While limiting education and career prospects, teenage pregnancies also expose girls to often fatal childbirth complications, say health experts. “Underage girls who become pregnant in their teens are twice as likely to die during childbirth,” says Jeanne Niyongabo, a gynecologist and obstetrician based in Bujumbura.

At the root of the crisis is a deeply patriarchal social structure, where girls — like Minani — often face rejection from their families when they become pregnant, says local residents and experts. “Girls do not have the power to make decisions about their health and life,” says Philippe Ntahombaye, professor of anthropology at the University of Burundi. Many teenage mothers are often forced into marriage, especially in rural areas — suggesting a deeply ingrained stigma around early pregnancy, says Ntahombaye.

To curb spiraling teen pregnancies, Burundi’s government and international organizations have launched multiple initiatives to disseminate education on sex and reproductive health. In 2016, the country’s Ministry of Education launched a Zero Pregnancies at School campaign jointly with the UNFPA to ensure that “no girl gets pregnant.” But activists say the crisis continues to spiral, and won’t come under control until the use of contraceptives, including condoms, spreads widely among sexually active youth. “Parents should not be ashamed to openly talk with their children about sex and the use of contraceptives,” says Diane Alphonso, a women’s rights activist based in Bujumbura.

That remains a challenge, because of cultural taboos that surround acknowledging sexual activity. Many teenage boys shun condoms, calling them too much of a “hassle” — and there’s no social pressure on them. That’s restricted to girls. “When a girl becomes pregnant, she is expected to drop out of school due to the perception that schoolchildren are not supposed to have sex,” says Ntahombaye.

Many school officials remain hesitant about distributing free condoms in the classroom. “I don’t think a school is the right place for distributing condoms,” says Japhet Nyandwi, a teacher at Lycée Communal school in Bujumbura. “We don’t want to encourage students to have sex.” Even parents willing to let their children use condoms are ashamed to be seen getting them for their kids.

Systemic support for teenage mothers remains a distant illusion at the moment, though the start of a debate in Burundi could signal the first stirrings of change. For thousands of girls, that change can’t come too soon.

MUSASA, Burundi – UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has called on the international community to give increased support to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi and as they step up efforts to find lasting solutions to the protracted refugee situations of the Great Lakes region.

Grandi said that the Central African neighbours, all of whom shelter large numbers of refugees from each other, must work closely together and renew efforts to put an end to the result of more than two decades of inter-linked and overlapping conflicts.

Praising these countries’ generosity, Grandi assured all sides that the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR was on hand to support dialogue and pledged to raise the issue of increased funding a conference on the humanitarian situation in DRC, including Congolese refugees and internally displaced, in Geneva on Friday.

“There are several countries in this region that continue to host a large number of refugees. The total number is about 700,000 and I think there has to be more recognition of this effort that has now gone on for many years,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared as he wound up a week-long visit to the region.

“The generosity of these host countries and host communities who are sharing meagre resources needs to be recognized. This generosity should not be taken for granted, these countries need support. What I have seen here is that still some very basic needs here are only partially met,” Grandi added.

During his visit Grandi met Congolese refugees in Rwanda and Burundi, Burundian refugees in DRC and Rwanda, and Rwandan refugees, preparing to go home after more than 20 years, in Congo. All told him similar things. They wanted peace and security so they could work and provide an education for their children.

Many spoke of the hardships caused by large population movements and insecurity – inadequate housing, insufficient food, overstretched educational and health facilities. Most said they wanted to work and be self-reliant.

In Burundi, he met a group of young refugees who referred to him as ‘Papa’ and asked him to try and provide them with more opportunities.

Grandi said their concerns pointed up the need for a more inclusive approach. Future support must include the refugee dimension until durable solutions are found.

“The future is theirs to build. And we need to help them to do that, not just hand out relief items and food. But also help them learn a trade, help them to have a better education, help them to have better mobility in the country so that they can go out and look for employment,” he said.

He added it was crucial to have an holistic approach and also provide development to the host communities.

“Humanitarian assistance continues to be important, but we really need to make a step change in the type of support that we provide. We need to encourage more self-reliance, more inclusion in the local communities,” he said.

“We have to also help the local community so that their own economy can absorb an additional number of people of people, and they too can benefit. These are poor areas and they are sharing meagre resources. We thank them for their hospitality,” he added.

Ruzigama Gentil, 22, who borrowed smart white pants and matching shirt, to meet the High Commissioner, said he had arrived in Burundi from Congo’s troubled South Kivu area more than a decade ago aged 11.

He said he had not lost hope, but was frustrated with the lack of opportunities facing him.

“Even if I succeed and get my High School diploma, I can’t find work and don’t have the means for more study. There is no work for us here, when you work it helps you in life,” he said.

All returns must be 'voluntary', says Grandi

In Goma, Grandi met Rwandan refugees waiting to return to a country they left more than 20 years ago, members of a total Rwandan refugee population in DRC of some 220,000.

They told how it was difficult to go to assembly points for onward transfer to the border crossing points without risking attack from “negative forces” opposed to peace.

Grandi welcomed news that some Burundian refugees were returning from Tanzania to Burundi, but underlined that all returns everywhere in the region must be voluntary.

“I met the president of Burundi and many of his officials and they said that everybody is welcome back. I told the president this is good, but what are needed are two things. One is security; people need to be confident that there is security. And two, a good programme of reintegration so that people can rebuild their lives in their own country,” he stressed.",UNHCR chief calls for increased support for Congolese refugees,http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2018/4/5ad07f294/unhcr-chief-calls-increased-support-congolese-refugees.html
24,burundi,"Burundi on Tuesday launched the official campaign for a referendum on constitutional change that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power for another 16 years.

Twenty-six parties, most of them aligned with the ruling CNDD-FDD party, have been authorised to campaign for the May 17 plebiscite in the politically tense central African nation.

The vote is taking place in tightly-controlled conditions, and parties which advise electors to abstain - rather than cast a Yes or No ballot - risk up to three years' jail.

Burundi's exiled opposition, gathered in an alliance called CNARED, has called for a boycott of the referendum, which it describes as the ""death knell"" to a 2000 agreement that helped end a bloody civil war.

Nkurunziza, a 54-year-old former rebel leader, has ruled the small, densely populated central African nation since 2005.

No president can govern Burundi for more than 10 years under the 2000 Arusha peace accords, which helped to end a 1993-2006 conflict that killed more than 300 000 people.

But if the amendment is approved, Nkurunziza would be entitled to stand for two more seven-year terms from 2020.

In 2015, Burundi was plunged into a deep political crisis when Nkurunziza ran for a third term in office.

At least 1 200 people were killed and 400 000 fled the country. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun an investigation into widespread abuses that took place at this time.

More than five million people have signed up to vote, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) says.

Opposition leaders accuse the government of stifling debate and failing even to issue the official draft of the proposed change.

""The government has not even officially communicated to us the draft of the revised constitution so that we can examine it and know for sure which text will be submitted for public approval or disapproval,"" Georges Nikiza, the spokesperson for the National Rally for Change, RANAC,told AFP.

Even the Amizero y'Abarundi coalition, which has five members in the government, said it was still unaware of the final text.

""When the time came to discuss the constitutional amendment in the cabinet, the text was handed out to ministers and it was taken away from them shortly afterwards... The risk is that we are called out to vote without knowing officially what is going to change,"" a coalition leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

On April 20, police said eight people had been arrested with ""the goal of disrupting the next referendum with the use of firearms.""

25,burundi,"On the first Saturday of every month, members of the Association Burundaise pour la protection de la Nature (ABN - Birdlife Partner) prepare for Naturewalk, their famous bird discovery trip. Participants set out in the hope of spotting a beautiful new bird species – but these shared moments in nature are also a valuable opportunity to observe and monitor the state of the environment. Members keep a weather eye out for signs of pollution, habitat degradation, landslides and poaching along their route.

On the morning of 3 March 2018, Naturewalk took its members to the suburbs of Bujumbura city to explore Buterere sewage lagoons. This might not sound like the most glamorous of excursions, but in fact, the waste water provides nutrients that support an abundant diversity of life, attracting large flocks of birds that congregate and feed there.

However, on this particular day, the birdwatchers’ appreciation of the area’s special species (including the Jacobin Cuckoo Clamator jacobinus) was interrupted by panicked cries from local children shouting: “NO Imvubu irabarya!"" – which in Kirundi means “Stop! You could be attacked by a hippo!”

The surprise was universal and the bucolic stroll, carefully planned by ornithologist guide Eric Niyongabo, suddenly took on the dimensions of a dangerous safari.

Only the inhabitants were not surprised. Lately, there have been several reports of hippos in the neighbourhood.

But what was this hippo doing in the waters of Buterere, so close to residential areas? Only the inhabitants were not surprised. Lately, there have been several reports of solitary hippos wandering the neighbourhood. Some residents even claim to have seen this individual in particular: ""It lets children approach and even touch it. Even local calves come closer, imagining it is their mother."" And yet, with an animal of this size, all who come near risk being crushed or mauled.

Normally, these animals wallow in the river Rusizi, which empties into Lake Tanganyika on the outskirts of the city. This landscape, once pristine, is today being gradually invaded by agriculture and development, driven by a growing population and the rapid expansion of the Burundian capital.

Hippopotamuses generally live in large groups dominated by a polygamous and aggressive male, for whom the protection of females and territory are his primary concern. Males that are highly submissive or lacking in combat skills move away from the herd and thus find themselves alone, isolated from their fellow pachyderms. This, combined with the abundance of green space at Buterere and the destruction of their original territory, is what drives these colossal herbivores to seek refuge here. And, in doing so, disturb our naturalists’ escapade.

Although it is herbivorous, this animal is among the most dangerous species in Africa, responsible for 2,900 human deaths a year. However, humans pose an equal threat to the species, and are often forced to exterminate intruding hippopotami in defence of their community. It’s safe to say that human-hippo overlap ends badly for both parties.

To be on the safe side, the Naturewalk attendees turned back and retraced their steps, in equal parts impressed to encounter this majestic wild beast, and worried for the future of its kind.

This unexpected encounter drives home a valuable lesson: that encroaching bit by bit upon our wild spaces is not without consequence. To avoid human-wildlife conflict, we need to respect the Environment Code in force in Burundi, which stipulates that nothing can be built within 150 meters of the banks of Lake Tanganyika, 50 meters for the other lakes and 25 meters for the rivers. These measures need to be enforced more strongly, including an appropriate and shared approach to land use. Otherwise, encounters such as these will inevitably increase.",Surprise hippo invades bird walk in Burundi,https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/surprise-hippo-invades-bird-walk-burundi
