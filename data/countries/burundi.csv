1,burundi,"Burundi police said on Friday eight people had been arrested for planning attacks to disrupt a constitutional referendum next month that could keep President Pierre Nkurunziza in power until 2034.

Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye said security forces on Thursday morning discovered two automatic weapons and ammunition during a ""search and seizure"" operation at the home of a suspect in western Burundi.

""Our investigation resulted in the arrest of seven more people, eight in total, who shared the goal of disrupting the next referendum with the use of firearms,"" he said.

The eight suspects were displayed to journalists in the capital Bujumbura on Friday, along with the alleged evidence.

Nkurikiye said investigations were underway to find ""who is behind this criminal movement"" warning that there were ""some politicians who have already expressed through the media their intention to disrupt this referendum by any means, including weapons.""

A draft constitutional amendment, proposed in October and allowing Nkurunziza, 54, to stand for two more seven-year terms from 2020, is due to be voted on in May.

The government has accused exiled oppositionists, and neighbouring countries, of planning to undermine the referendum and has deployed military units to areas bordering Rwanda to the north and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west.

Patrols by the ruling party's youth wing the Imbonerakure - described as a militia by the UN - have also increased.

Nkurunziza's run for a controversial third term in 2015 plunged Burundi into a deep political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and forced 400,000 to flee the country. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun an investigation into widespread abuses since then.

Earlier this week US-based Human Rights Watch said government forces and ruling party members - including the Imbonerakure - were targeting suspected opponents ahead of the May 17 referendum.

Burundi's lower house late on Wednesday voted to allow security forces in the politically tense nation to conduct night raids without a search warrant.

The bill must now go before the Senate before being passed into law by President Pierre Nkurunziza ""as fast as possible"", a senior member of the ruling CNDD-FDD party told AFP, asking not to be named.",Eight arrested in Burundi for planning to disrupt key vote,https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/africa/2018-04-20-eight-arrested-in-burundi-for-planning-to-disrupt-key-vote/
2,burundi,"Silvie Bugonza* was barely 16 when she became pregnant. A hardworking student at Budahunga communal school, in northern Burundi’s Kirundo Province, Bugonza had dreams of working with the United Nations to help children frequently displaced during war. Instead, she was expelled from school because of her pregnancy, her dreams crushed. Now 19, the young mother wakes up early to feed and bathe her daughter. Then she straps the girl onto her back as she marches through dew-laden grass to fetch water.

She isn’t alone. Bugonza is part of a largely ignored social epidemic wrecking the lives of young girls and women across Burundi. Perched on rolling mountains and plateaus, the Central African country slightly smaller than Maryland has one of the highest teen fertility rates in the region — 50 percent higher than neighboring Rwanda. That is translating into an increasing number of teenage pregnancies. Burundi’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 8 percent of adolescent girls were pregnant in 2017, up from 7 percent in 2010–11.

I wish I could go back to school. Silvie Bugonza, a teenage mother expelled from school

But that’s only part of the problem. Burundi’s high rate of teenage pregnancies is increasingly finding company in another disturbing trend — girls leaving school because of pregnancies. Across the country, more than 12,000 schoolgirls are estimated to have dropped out of school due to pregnancy between 2009 and 2015, according to data from Burundi’s Ministry of Education. Once out of school, they’re even more vulnerable. The teenage conception rate in Burundi among young uneducated girls (23 percent) is almost four times the number (6 percent) for those with secondary or higher education, the data shows. And the challenges aren’t a rural phenomenon. Bujumbura, the capital, has a teenage pregnancy rate of 12 percent — a figure that climbs further to 15 percent for Ngozi, the country’s second-largest city. Though some young mothers opt out of school simply to manage newborns, many others like Bugonza are expelled or suspended from school in a conservative nation where out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a social taboo. Either way, these pregnancies mean an early end to hopes and dreams of a better future.

“There’s nothing good about being a mother,” says Bugonza. “I wish I could go back to school.”

In Mpanda village, which neighbors Bugonza’s hamlet, 18-year-old Lydia Minani* is idly lying on an old mattress, cuddling her baby as mild rain sprinkles on the flimsy tin roof of her shack. On the walls, pieces of cardboard are tacked up on the crumbling mud wall to give the baby some warmth, as a torn curtain hanging over the window blows in the wind. Minani was suspended from Gahinga secondary school in 2015 after she became pregnant. Her father accuses her of compromising their family values.

Bugonza lives with a supportive aunt now — but she too believes family taboos were responsible for her predicament. Her mother, she says, never spoke to her openly about sex and protection. That lack of education about sex and reproductive health is a key contributor to the current crisis, suggests Georges Gahungu, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) agency representative in charge of programs in Burundi. “Many girls who become pregnant don’t know their menstrual cycles,” he says.

While limiting education and career prospects, teenage pregnancies also expose girls to often fatal childbirth complications, say health experts. “Underage girls who become pregnant in their teens are twice as likely to die during childbirth,” says Jeanne Niyongabo, a gynecologist and obstetrician based in Bujumbura.

At the root of the crisis is a deeply patriarchal social structure, where girls — like Minani — often face rejection from their families when they become pregnant, says local residents and experts. “Girls do not have the power to make decisions about their health and life,” says Philippe Ntahombaye, professor of anthropology at the University of Burundi. Many teenage mothers are often forced into marriage, especially in rural areas — suggesting a deeply ingrained stigma around early pregnancy, says Ntahombaye.

To curb spiraling teen pregnancies, Burundi’s government and international organizations have launched multiple initiatives to disseminate education on sex and reproductive health. In 2016, the country’s Ministry of Education launched a Zero Pregnancies at School campaign jointly with the UNFPA to ensure that “no girl gets pregnant.” But activists say the crisis continues to spiral, and won’t come under control until the use of contraceptives, including condoms, spreads widely among sexually active youth. “Parents should not be ashamed to openly talk with their children about sex and the use of contraceptives,” says Diane Alphonso, a women’s rights activist based in Bujumbura.

That remains a challenge, because of cultural taboos that surround acknowledging sexual activity. Many teenage boys shun condoms, calling them too much of a “hassle” — and there’s no social pressure on them. That’s restricted to girls. “When a girl becomes pregnant, she is expected to drop out of school due to the perception that schoolchildren are not supposed to have sex,” says Ntahombaye.

Many school officials remain hesitant about distributing free condoms in the classroom. “I don’t think a school is the right place for distributing condoms,” says Japhet Nyandwi, a teacher at Lycée Communal school in Bujumbura. “We don’t want to encourage students to have sex.” Even parents willing to let their children use condoms are ashamed to be seen getting them for their kids.

Systemic support for teenage mothers remains a distant illusion at the moment, though the start of a debate in Burundi could signal the first stirrings of change. For thousands of girls, that change can’t come too soon.

3,burundi,"The Burundian government desperately wants an overwhelming win in next month’s constitutional referendum that will enable the president to extend his term in office. To do this, it must present the image of unity in the country – and open debate and criticism are less than welcome.

Expand Logo for Iwacu newspaper, ""The voices of Burundi."" © Iwacu

As the referendum approaches, the government is brutally cracking down on suspected opponents and signaling clearly that those who do not register to vote in the referendum or who dare to vote “no” will face dire consequences. And that crackdown is widening. On April 11, Iwacu, a well-respected and widely read independent newspaper in Burundi, received a written decision from Burundi’s National Communication Council (CNC) announcing a three-month suspension of its online comments section for “violation of professional standards.”

The CNC is a national administrative authority responsible for overseeing the media and advising the government on communication. The president appoints its members.

Whereas criticism was once tolerated, albeit unhappily, any glimmer of hope that independent media and rights groups might operate freely in Burundi has vanished. The government has become increasingly intolerant of debate since a political crisis engulfed the country in 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term.

Since then, independent national nongovernmental organizations have been banned, suspended, seen their bank accounts frozen and staff arrested. New restrictions have been placed on a once independent media, as several radio stations have been taken off the air. A journalist for Iwacu has been missing since July 2016.

Against this broader repression, Iwacu has managed to continue publishing, and it remains a source for independent news in Burundi and beyond, despite its thousands of readers now being unable to post their comments. In a statement, Iwacu said that its comments section was a “democratic space open to all opinions,” something clearly intolerable to an increasingly repressive government.",‘No Comment’ in Burundi,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/20/no-comment-burundi
4,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope
5,burundi,"President Trump started dominating the American news cycle before he was even elected, and the soap opera that has unfolded from his twitter feed alone since then has kept headlines and newsrooms constantly focused on his unpredictable behavior. I assumed that a few months after the election, the drama would eventually subside and a new version of political normalcy would take place, making room for a wider variety of breaking news. It didn’t really.

A friend and colleague, Sulome Anderson, who has been covering the middle east as a foreign correspondent for the last seven years, told me that after the elections she began having so much trouble getting editors to accept pitches not directly related to Trump’s antics that she closed up shop all together and is focusing on writing her next book on domestic issues.

This anecdote speaks to a larger media trend. With a disproportionate amount of news squarely focused on one person in the United States, what stories are being pushed from the headlines?

A report from a major global NGO offers some insights into one area where important stories are being largely ignored: humanitarian crises.

Using the media monitoring services of Meltwater Group, the humanitarian group CARE analyzed global online news coverage (in English, French and German) of all 39 natural or manmade disaster affecting at least 1 million people in 2017, then listed the 10 disasters receiving the least media coverage.

According to that metric, these were the five most under-reported crises of 2017, and they are still happening right now.

1 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

North Korea has stayed in the global spotlight for increasing political tensions and weapons testing and has long been regarded as one of the repressive authoritarian states in the world. Kim Jong Un is known for his ability to generate fearful obedience from his citizens with a creative array of horrific threats; from forced labor in harsh and sometimes fatal conditions to executions. But what has been drastically underreported in the last year is that unprecedented number of people who are going hungry. The UN estimates that 70 percent of the population, or 18 million people, are food-insecure and reliant on government aid. To make things worse, last year North Korea experienced its worst drought in 16 years, exacerbating an already dire food shortage. With tight control of its borders keeping out aid organizations and journalists, it’s almost impossible to capture how many are actually receiving the urgent food aid they need.

2 Eritrea

Geographically isolated and bordered by two countries infamous for famine and conflict, the East African country of Eritrea rarely makes headlines. When it does, it’s commonly in relation to border tensions. What isn’t making headlines is that over 700,000 Eritreans are in crisis struggling to feed themselves and their families, marking the severity of a prolonged drought catalyzed by El Niño two years ago. Over half of all children in Eritrea today are stunted, a sign they are not getting the nutrients they need to cognitively and physically develop in order to live healthy and productive lives. Additionally, widespread gender-based violence including rape and female genital mutilation leaves women and girls disempowered and living in fear. Conscription into military service serves as a pretext for population control and enslavement. Because of the desperate state of the country, over 400,000 migrants have left their home country in the past decade, making Eritreans one of the largest groups of refugees in Europe and Africa.

3 Burundi

Struggling to emerge from a 12 year ethnic-based civil war, political unrest has sponsored sever economic instability devastating those living in the central African country. The future political state of Burundi as the current leader, President Nkurunziza, has indicated he intends to run again in 2020, potentially extending his term 14 years. Opposition forces and civilians are bracing for even more violence in response to this possibility. Over 2.2 million people currently are not able to sufficiently feed their families. The country is experiencing rising food prices resulting from economic and agricultural decline and disruption of markets and trade. The ripple effect of lack of basic services and food shortages extends into massive health issues, like the outbreak of malaria in 2017 that infected over 6.6 million people with 2,875 deaths reported in the first eight months of the epidemic. Persecution and violence have driven over 400,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Over 200,000 people remain displaced inside Burundi.

4 Sudan

The genocide in Darfur may be a historical event no longer worthy of headlines, but the impact of 13 years of war now leaves over 5 million people on the edge of survival. As climate change exacerbates agriculture conditions, the country also faces droughts and floods, making it even harder for people to feed their families. The current fuel crisis has driven the cost gallon of gasoline up to over 140 Sudanese pounds ($7.70) a diesel gallon on the black market, leaving farmers without fuel to power water pumps necessary for irrigation. Power outages from scarcity of fuel are paralyzing daily life in parts of the country as well.

5 Democratic Republic of Congo

With over 120 armed groups currently operated in Eastern DRC alone, recent reports state over 4.5 million people are currently displaced inside the Congo. Political instability and clashes between soldiers and militia continue to escalate, a result of presidential elections that were scheduled for November of 2017 have been repeatedly postponed. Like many humanitarian crises, this lack of stability burdens women and children most. Rape is often used as a weapon of war, and reports from the field show over 2 million children are suffering from acute malnutrition.

Does the East African Community have what it takes to help bring stability to Burundi?

First published by ISS Today

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the EAC (East African Community) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the AU (African Union).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and Comesa jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.

Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.

Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.

More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.

The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives. DM

A Burundian human rights activist, Germain Rukuki, was sentenced to 32 years in prison on Thursday on charges of “rebellion,” “threatening state security,” “participation in an insurrectional movement,” and “attacks on the head of state.” The verdict and harsh sentence come just weeks before a constitutional referendum that will allow the president to extend his term in office.

Rukuki’s conviction sends a strong message to anyone who dares document government abuse ahead of the vote. As the referendum approaches, the government is brutally cracking down on suspected opponents and signaling clearly that those who do not register or who dare to vote “no” will face dire consequences.

Rukuki, a member of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT)-Burundi, has been detained since last July. His organization conducted investigations and advocacy before and during the violence of 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his bid for a controversial third term, plunging the country into a serious political and human rights crisis that continues today.

The government closed ACAT down in October 2016, along with several other human rights groups accused of working to “tarnish the image of the country” and “sow hatred and division” among the people. But that wasn’t enough. Human rights groups regard Rukuki’s subsequent arrest and trial as a direct attack.

Rukuki is not the only rights activist to be targeted. In November, authorities arrested Nestor Nibitanga, an observer for the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (APRODH), a leading Burundian human rights organization. Like Rukuki, Nibitanga was charged with “threatening state security.” The national intelligence service (Service national de renseignement, SNR) held both of them before transferring them to prison.

Last August, a group of UN experts called for Rukiki’s release and raised concerns over using charges of acting against state security and threats to silence human rights activists. These concerns are proving well founded in the run up to the referendum. With Rukiki’s conviction, the message is clear to anyone who seeks to raise the alarm about abuse in Burundi: you are not safe.",Paying the Price in Burundi,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/27/paying-price-burundi

Burundi police said Friday eight people had been arrested for planning attacks to disrupt a constitutional referendum next month that could keep President Pierre Nkurunziza in power until 2034.

Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye said security forces on Thursday morning discovered two automatic weapons and ammunition during a ""search and seizure"" operation at the home of a suspect in western Burundi.

""Our investigation resulted in the arrest of seven more people, eight in total, who shared the goal of disrupting the next referendum with the use of firearms,"" he said.

The eight suspects were displayed to journalists in the capital Bujumbura on Friday, along with the alleged evidence.

Nkurikiye said investigations were underway to find ""who is behind this criminal movement"" warning that there were ""some politicians who have already expressed through the media their intention to disrupt this referendum by any means, including weapons.""

REFERENDUM

A draft constitutional amendment, proposed in October and allowing Nkurunziza, 54, to stand for two more seven-year terms from 2020, is due to be voted on in May.

The government has accused exiled oppositionists, and neighbouring countries, of planning to undermine the referendum and has deployed military units to areas bordering Rwanda to the north and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west.

Patrols by the ruling party's youth wing the Imbonerakure — described as a militia by the UN — have also increased.

Nkurunziza's run for a controversial third term in 2015 plunged Burundi into a deep political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and forced 400,000 to flee the country.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun an investigation into widespread abuses since then.

Earlier this week US-based Human Rights Watch said government forces and ruling party members — including the Imbonerakure — were targeting suspected opponents ahead of the May 17 referendum.

The mom of three (including two daughters) has joined forces with UNICEF USA and Gucci-founded CHIME FOR CHANGE to bring clean, safe water to girls in Burundi.

Burundi is a small, landlocked country in East Africa where nearly half the population lacks access to safe water. The problem is particularly critical among children, no more so than girls for whom it represents “ the foundation for equality,” according to the “BeyGOOD4Burundi” campaign site.

“Access to clean, safe water means girls won’t be forced to walk long, often dangerous, distances where they are at risk of attack,” it explains. “When girls don’t have to walk for hours every day to collect safe water, they can go to school. When that school has clean toilets, they don’t have to skip class when they have their period.”

The campaign actually began last year, but recently on World Water Day, a BG4B update announced Gucci and CHIME FOR CHANGE had come on board as an official partner.

11,burundi,"A Burundian activist was sentenced on Thursday to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was ""eminently political"".

Germain Rukuki was given ""32 years of penal servitude"" at Bujumbura's district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for ""having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from 13 May 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property"".

Burundian authorities use the term 'insurrectional movement' to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1 200 people dead and more than 400 000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: ""The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

""It is a message from the authorities to all those who dare to oppose the regime and denounce the crimes it commits, one month before a highly disputed constitutional referendum.""

The referendum, scheduled for the 17th of May, would allow 54-year-old Nkurunziza, president since 2005, to stay in power until 2034.

12,burundi,"analysis

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the East African Community (EAC) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups - following President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC's weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza's government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC's attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the African Union (AU).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries - and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and COMESA jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza's bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni's 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania's former president, assuming a leading role.

Another issue that has soured regional relations - and has led to Burundi's subsequent scepticism of the EAC - is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country's elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza - the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.

Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body's key decisions.

More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won't engage at all before the country's constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.

The EAC's recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives.

13,burundi,"BUJUMBURA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza on Monday signed a decree on the launch of the campaign for the constitutional referendum set for May 17.

The campaign for the referendum is open from May 1 at 6 a.m. local time up to May 14 at 6 p.m., any campaign activity made out of that period is prohibited, said the presidential decree.

The decree stipulated that only political parties and independent people registered with the National Independent Electoral Commission are allowed to hold campaign meetings.

The decree also indicated that state media can be used for the campaign during the campaign period, adding that the National Media Council will ensure that campaigners will have equal access to the state media.

Nkurunziza also indicated campaigners will have to abstain from insults and defamation.

The decree also provides sanctions against political parties or independent citizens that will commit offences during the electoral campaign.

Around 5 million Burundian citizens registered for the upcoming constitutional referendum and the general elections in the combined registration, according to the National Independent Electoral Commission of Burundi.

The central African country is expected to hold the referendum of the constitution on May 17 this year. The draft constitution, which doesn't ban the current president to run again in 2020, extends the presidential term from five years provided in the 2005 constitution to seven years and allows the president to serve two consecutive terms.

It will be passed if it is approved by over 50 percent of voters, according to the presidential decree for inviting registered voters to vote in the referendum.

Nkurunziza was elected the president of Burundi by the parliament in 2005. He was re-elected in a universal suffrage in 2010 and in 2015.

Burundi plunged into a crisis in April 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run his controversial third term bid, which he won in July 2015. His candidature, which was opposed by the opposition and civil society groups, resulted in a wave of protests, violence and even a failed coup in May 2015.",Burundi decrees campaign for May 17 constitutional referendum - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/24/c_137131833.htm

The Council is “deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community (EAC), and the lack of engagement” by the Burundi government read the statement adopted by the 15-member Council.

The international body expects elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi to be “free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties,” and to “ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process,” the statement said.

The Council however underscored its “deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries.”

The government of Burundi has “the primary responsibility … for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable.”

The statement also urged Burundi to resume its cooperation with international groups, especially the United Nations.

Burundi’s President Pierre Nkurunziza, first elected to office in 2005, ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution.

That grip on power triggered violence that left at least 1,200 people dead and sent more than 400,000 Burundians fleeing abroad.

Nkurunziza has set May 17 as the date for a referendum on a constitutional reform that would enable him to serve two seven-year mandates from 2020.

15,burundi,"Overview

Across the Great Lakes region, some 7.4 million people are uprooted. Uganda now hosts the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. About 74,500 Congolese crossed into Uganda from 1 January to 16 April, in the wake of new violence in the Ituri and North Kivu regions of the DRC, with an average of more than 680 refugees arriving from the DRC each day in March. The DRC is itself host to more than half a million refugees from other countries in the region. Meanwhile, there are unverified reports of Congolese returning to the DRC from Angola, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. In early April, 2,600 Burundians who had arrived from the DRC to Rwanda in March decided to voluntarily return to Burundi. However, some 432,000 Burundian refugees remain in neighbouring countries.

Sexual violence is a major concern in the region, much of it unreported and unaddressed. Many refugees arriving from the DRC in neighbouring countries report having endured sexual and gender-based violence. A recent assessment found that 10 per cent of newly arrived children in Uganda said they were raped during their journey.

Levels of hunger and malnutrition are at historically high levels in the DRC, with more than 4.6 million children acutely malnourished, 2.2 million of whom severely acutely malnourished. However, in a positive development, maize prices in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda in March were well below their levels at the same time in 2017. Heavy rains and floods in Burundi, Tanzania and Rwanda have left at least 60 people dead, others injured and many houses destroyed or damaged in March and April.

The region continues to battle simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases, mainly cholera. In the DRC, nearly 8,000 cholera cases have been reported in 2018 but the weekly incidence is declining. More than 2,000 cholera cases have been reported in Uganda since February, mainly among new arrivals from the DRC. Some 36 per cent of the cholera cases reported in Uganda are children under age 5. Tanzania is tackling cholera outbreaks in five locations and an outbreak of dengue fever is ongoing in Dar es Salaam, with 13 cases reported so far.",Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (March - April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/great-lakes-region-humanitarian-snapshot-march-april-2018
16,burundi,"“Dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi,” underscored the Security Council in a statement read-out by its President at a formal meeting Thursday afternoon.

In the statement, the Council also “strongly” condemned human rights violations committed in the country, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, forced disappearance, torture and harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and journalists.

The Security Council also reiterated its “regret” at the Government’s decision to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) and called for a swift solution through dialogue between the UN human rights arm and Burundi in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its mandated activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions.

Also in the statement, the 15-member Council voiced concerns over the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation in the country and, in the context of Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, called on those Governments to ensure that the return of the refugees is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

According to estimates, some 180,000 people remain displaced within Burundi and more than 429,000 have sought refuge across its borders.

MUSASA, Burundi – UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has called on the international community to give increased support to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi and as they step up efforts to find lasting solutions to the protracted refugee situations of the Great Lakes region.

Grandi said that the Central African neighbours, all of whom shelter large numbers of refugees from each other, must work closely together and renew efforts to put an end to the result of more than two decades of inter-linked and overlapping conflicts.

Praising these countries’ generosity, Grandi assured all sides that the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR was on hand to support dialogue and pledged to raise the issue of increased funding a conference on the humanitarian situation in DRC, including Congolese refugees and internally displaced, in Geneva on Friday.

“There are several countries in this region that continue to host a large number of refugees. The total number is about 700,000 and I think there has to be more recognition of this effort that has now gone on for many years,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared as he wound up a week-long visit to the region.

“The generosity of these host countries and host communities who are sharing meagre resources needs to be recognized. This generosity should not be taken for granted, these countries need support. What I have seen here is that still some very basic needs here are only partially met,” Grandi added.

During his visit Grandi met Congolese refugees in Rwanda and Burundi, Burundian refugees in DRC and Rwanda, and Rwandan refugees, preparing to go home after more than 20 years, in Congo. All told him similar things. They wanted peace and security so they could work and provide an education for their children.

Many spoke of the hardships caused by large population movements and insecurity – inadequate housing, insufficient food, overstretched educational and health facilities. Most said they wanted to work and be self-reliant.

In Burundi, he met a group of young refugees who referred to him as ‘Papa’ and asked him to try and provide them with more opportunities.

Grandi said their concerns pointed up the need for a more inclusive approach. Future support must include the refugee dimension until durable solutions are found.

“The future is theirs to build. And we need to help them to do that, not just hand out relief items and food. But also help them learn a trade, help them to have a better education, help them to have better mobility in the country so that they can go out and look for employment,” he said.

He added it was crucial to have an holistic approach and also provide development to the host communities.

“Humanitarian assistance continues to be important, but we really need to make a step change in the type of support that we provide. We need to encourage more self-reliance, more inclusion in the local communities,” he said.

“We have to also help the local community so that their own economy can absorb an additional number of people of people, and they too can benefit. These are poor areas and they are sharing meagre resources. We thank them for their hospitality,” he added.

Ruzigama Gentil, 22, who borrowed smart white pants and matching shirt, to meet the High Commissioner, said he had arrived in Burundi from Congo’s troubled South Kivu area more than a decade ago aged 11.

He said he had not lost hope, but was frustrated with the lack of opportunities facing him.

“Even if I succeed and get my High School diploma, I can’t find work and don’t have the means for more study. There is no work for us here, when you work it helps you in life,” he said.

All returns must be 'voluntary', says Grandi

In Goma, Grandi met Rwandan refugees waiting to return to a country they left more than 20 years ago, members of a total Rwandan refugee population in DRC of some 220,000.

They told how it was difficult to go to assembly points for onward transfer to the border crossing points without risking attack from “negative forces” opposed to peace.

Grandi welcomed news that some Burundian refugees were returning from Tanzania to Burundi, but underlined that all returns everywhere in the region must be voluntary.

“I met the president of Burundi and many of his officials and they said that everybody is welcome back. I told the president this is good, but what are needed are two things. One is security; people need to be confident that there is security. And two, a good programme of reintegration so that people can rebuild their lives in their own country,” he stressed.",UNHCR chief calls for increased support for Congolese refugees,http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2018/4/5ad07f294/unhcr-chief-calls-increased-support-congolese-refugees.html

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tanzania hosts the largest number of Burundian refugees in the region with a total of 318,202 refugees as of end January 2018. Over 234,000 are Burundian refugees hosted in three camps in Nyarugusu, Mtendeli and Nduta, and 84,202 are Congolese refugees who are also in Nyarugusu. The majority of the refugees from DRC have been in the country for the past 20 years. All the camps are overcrowded with overstretched basic services.

More than 60 per cent of the refugees are still in mass shelters. Children make up 57 per cent of the refugee population and more than 7,000 children are unaccompanied and separated. Protection concerns such as sexual and gender-based violence are significant. There is an inadequate number of schools, a shortage of water especially in Mtendeli camp, and health and nutrition facilities are overstretched. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity, accounting for 33 per cent of all Out Patient Department (OPD) attendances.

No new asylum seekers have been received from Burundi in 2018, but Tanzania received over 2,000 refugees from the Democratic of Congo between November 2017 and January 2018. Voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees resumed in the second week of February 2018, and so far 2,460 refuges have been assisted to voluntary return between January and February 2018. This makes a total of 16,130 refugees repatriated out of the registered 43,060 since the commencement of the assisted Voluntary return in September 2017.

Kigoma is endemic to cholera due to recurring outbreaks. The latest outbreak started in November 2017 that affected over 300 people was brought under control in January 2018. Cholera is still a major threat in the refugee camps and host communities. There were a few suspected cholera cases reported from the new asylum seekers arriving from DRC at Kibirizi reception centre in January 2018 who were admitted at Gungu CTC and later discharged.

Under the coordination of the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UNICEF continues to support the refugee hosting districts in Kigoma region through the UN Kigoma Joint Programme and is leading two Outcomes; Violence against Women and Children (VAWC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). In addition, UNICEF is part of outcome 4: Empowering adolescent girls through education. The government notified all development partners on 23 January 2018 that they will no longer continue to engage in the pilot initiative under the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CCRF). UNICEF and partners will continue to engage with the government to ensure that the refugee response and the needs of host communities are addressed holistically.

While the socio-political situation in Burundi and DRC remains unpredictable, cross–border influxes are expected to continue throughout 2018. Without counting new arrivals and even with the ongoing voluntary repatriations, the refugee population continues to grow with over 1500 babies born every month in the three camps.",Tanzania Humanitarian Situation Report (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/tanzania-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018

With 7.9 million people in humanitarian need in the country, the Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) released in March requires $1.66 billion to provide emergency food and non-food assistance mainly in the southern and south eastern parts of the country. The HDRP is jointly managed with the Government of Ethiopia, which also funds a significant part of the plan and delivers assistance through national systems in place. The plan meets immediate needs and at the same time it is a first step away from short term response and the development of a multi-year planning framework.

HRPs were finalized last month for Iraq, occupied Palestinian territory and Libya.

Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are now returning to their homes and communities in Iraq. Partners will work closely with national authorities to protect and otherwise support 3.4 million people in the areas struggling most with hardship induced by four years of intensive, virtually non-stop conflict. The Iraq HRP for 2018 requires $568.7 million, which is 42% less than last year’s HRP for the country. As of mid-April it was only 10% funded.

The HRP for the occupied Palestinian territory addresses urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Urgent funding of $539.7 million is required to assist 1.9 million people in the oPt, especially in light of the worsening situation in Gaza and the acute funding shortfall. Gaza’s health sector is struggling to deal with the many casualties and the critical shortage of medicine, medical disposables, laboratory materials and other emergency care supplies. Years of blockade, internal divide and a chronic energy crisis have meant essential services in Gaza are barely functioning. UNRWA, the main provider of assistance in the oPt, accounting for 53 percent of the oPt HRP appeal, is facing its most severe funding shortfall to date. The UN Secretary-General has called on donors to step forward to support UNRWA.

The 2018 Libya Humanitarian Response Plan published on 1 March was developed in collaboration with Libyan authorities and with multi-stakeholders including development and stabilisation actors. Humanitarian partners require $312.7 million to assist 940,000 people suffering the impact of the protracted political crisis, outbreaks of violence, displacement and deteriorating living conditions.

Acute rainfall deficits in Senegal in 2017 have had a damaging effect on agriculture and placed 814,000 people in humanitarian need. Humanitarian organizations require $17 million to coordinate and carry out humanitarian response as outlined in the Plan de travail humanitaire produced in March.

Meanwhile Mauritania will require $116 million to help 618,000 people overcome the consequences of meagre rainfall and waning security. The Mauritanian needs and requirements were published in March as part of the OCHA Sahel 2018 Overview of Humanitarian Needs and Requirements.

Since the beginning of 2018, the ERC has allocated a total of $246 million through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), including $146 million through the rapid response window. In March, the CERF secretariat completed the first round of the underfunded emergency allocations for a total of $100 million to nine protracted crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Haiti, Mali, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania and Uganda, as well as natural disaster-induced needs following the natural disaster in Cameroon. The grants allocated to these under-resourced emergencies will make it possible to assist over ten million people in need of food, shelter and water, amongst others. In parallel, the Emergency Relief Coordinator approved $43.7 million in rapid response grants to assist people affected by drought in Mauritania, an earthquake in Papua New Guinea, displacement in Ethiopia, as well as refugee inflows to Burundi and Chad. Due to unprecedented funding constraints, an exceptional grant of $15 million was allocated to UNRWA to avoid the immediate disruption of life-saving food and cash assistance to vulnerable people in the occupied Palestinian territory where over 2.5 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.

By the end of March, country-based pooled funds (CBPFs) in 17 countries had received $189 million from 15 donors (including pledges). Largest amounts went to the whole of Syria response ($34.6 million), Sudan ($24.5 million), Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($21.3 million respectively). Some $78 million have been allocated for 193 humanitarian projects implemented by 152 partners in 12 countries (34 per cent to international NGOs, 33 per cent to UN agencies, 32 percent to national NGOs and 1 percent to Red Cross/Red Crescent organizations) and another $89 million is under allocation. The DRC Humanitarian Fund is finalizing a $21 million allocation for urgent humanitarian needs in 12 of DRC’s 26 provinces, closely coordinated with CERF allocations of $50 million.",2018 Humanitarian Funding Update (as of March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2018-humanitarian-funding-update-march-2018

NAIROBI – A Burundian activist was sentenced Thursday to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was ""eminently political"".

Germain Rukuki was given ""32 years of penal servitude"" at Bujumbura's district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for ""having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from May 13, 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property"".

Burundian authorities use the term 'insurrectional movement' to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and more than 400,000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: ""The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

""It is a message from the authorities to all those who dare to oppose the regime and denounce the crimes it commits, one month before a highly disputed constitutional referendum.""

The referendum, scheduled for May 17, would allow 54-year-old Nkurunziza, president since 2005, to stay in power until 2034.
