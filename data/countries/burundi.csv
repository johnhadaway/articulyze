• The preliminary results of the national SMART nutrition survey indicate that 11 Health Districts out of 46 are at risk for global acute malnutrition, whilst the stunting rate exceeds 50% in 43 Health Districts.

• 959 children and adolescents living and working in the streets, (19 girls and 940 boys), were picked up and placed in custody from 20-23 April 2018. Most of them have been released to the care of their families or NGOs, following joint advocacy efforts from UNICEF and partners.

Discussions with the Government of Burundi and Child Protection partners are on-going to identify longer terms solutions.

• UNICEF Burundi is facing a serious funding shortfall, with only 11 per cent of 2018 HAC funding available. Without additional funds, UNICEF will not be able to address the essential needs of children and women in Burundi.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The socio-political situation in Burundi remains precarious and continue to spur on movement of population and humanitarian needs. A total of 397,526 refugees, the majority of whom are children (54.6 per cent), have found refuge in neighbouring countries (mainly in Tanzania, Rwanda, DRC and Uganda), a slight increase of 1,353 people since the last report in February 2018. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) registered in eighteen provinces continues to decrease and is currently 174,011 of which 58 per cent are children (IOM, March 2018).

On 28 March 2018, a new tripartite agreement was signed between the Government of Burundi, the Government of Tanzania and UNHCR to continue supporting the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian from Tanzania in 2018. Since September 2017, a total of 20,739 people have been repatriated to Burundi (UNHCR, 22 March 2018). An estimated 60,000 people have also spontaneously returned.

There was a sharp decrease in malaria cases and deaths since the beginning of the year. According to the Ministry of Health (MoH) data, the cumulative number of malaria cases reported during the first fifteen weeks of 2018 is 1,542,769 cases with 744 deaths, which is 44% lower than the number of cases reported for the same period in 2017 (2,743,764 cases and 1,240 deaths).",UNICEF Burundi Humanitarian Situation Report – March – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/unicef-burundi-humanitarian-situation-report-march-april-2018

2,burundi,"BUJUMBURA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Voter cards for Burundi's constitutional referendum on May 17 will start to be distributed Wednesday at registration centers, a spokesperson for the Burundian electoral commission (CENI) said Tuesday.

The number of registered voters expected to get voter cards is 4,768,142 in total, spokesperson Prosper Ntahorwamiye said at a press conference.

The distribution will take place at registration centers nationwide between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. local time, and will be concluded on May 13, Ntahorwamiye said.

The spokesperson said heavy electoral equipment like ballot boxes and electoral booths are being deployed to provinces, and is due to finish on May 12.

All the electoral equipment should have arrived in provinces by May 13, he said.

The CENI granted accreditations to 39 local civil society organizations to monitor the referendum, according to Ntahorwamiye.

Political parties are currently campaigning for the referendum across the country. As the ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) and its allies are calling on the Burundian people to support draft amendments, opposition coalition Burundians' Hope asks voters to vote against the change.

The draft Constitution provides for the creation of the post of a prime minister and only one vice-president, whereas the 2005 Constitution provides for two vice-presidents. The prime minister is to be designated from the ruling party, while the vice-president will come from a different party.

It extends the presidential term from the five years provided in the 2005 Constitution to seven years and allows the president to serve two consecutive terms.

The present Constitution of Burundi stipulates that a president of Burundi cannot serve for more than two terms.

The draft Constitution will be passed if it is approved by over 50 percent of voters.

Incumbent President Pierre Nkurunziza was elected the president of Burundi by the parliament in 2005, and was re-elected in a universal suffrage in 2010 and in 2015.

The landlocked country plunged into a crisis in April 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run for a third term, which he won in July 2015. His candidature, opposed by the opposition and civil society groups, resulted in a wave of protests, violence and even a failed coup in May 2015.

Main opposition groups had been saying that Nkurunziza's third term bid was a violation of the Constitution and the Arusha Agreement that ended an over decade-long civil war, but the Constitutional Court issued a ruling saying that Nkurunziza's 2005-2010 term should not be considered as a term because he was elected by the parliament and not directly by citizens.",Burundi to distribute voter cards for constitutional referendum - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/09/c_137165164.htm
3,burundi,"Nairobi, May 7, 2018--Authorities in Burundi should immediately lift a six-month licensing suspension imposed on radio broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Voice of America (VOA), the Committee to Protect Journalists said today. Burundi's National Communication Council (CNC), the media industry regulator, on May 4 accused the two stations of breaching the country's media laws and professional ethics and ordered the stations' licensing suspended, according to a statement from the regulator. A government agency that regulates telecommunication subsequently turned off their signals, according to media reports.

The media regulator accused the BBC of broadcasting ""exaggerated, non-verified, defamatory"" comments made by a Brussels-based activist that were harmful to the reputation of Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza during an April 24 broadcast of the French-language program L'invité de la Semaine, according to CNC Chairman Ramadhan Karenga who spoke to CPJ and a report by The EastAfrican newspaper.

In its statement, the CNC also claimed that on four different occasions in April, VOA aired content that lacked balance, fell short of rigorous verification of sources, and prejudiced Burundi's relations with the United Nations. The U.S. government-funded station is also facing allegations from the media regulator of hiring a journalist sought by Burundian law enforcement and partnering with Bonesha FM, a local station that has been banned by the government, according to Karenga and the report by The EastAfrican.

The BBC and VOA suspension, which became effective today, comes before a May 17 constitutional referendum that, if passed, could extend Nkurunziza's rule to 2034. Two journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for their security told CPJ that the bans were attempts by the government to silence critical voices ahead of the referendum.

""These actions are a transparent attempt to silence the media during this politically sensitive period, when Burundians are in most urgent need of information to make important political decisions,"" said CPJ Africa Program Coordinator Angela Quintal from New York. ""It is not too late to rethink this ill-informed decision and the regulator should immediately lift the suspension and allow the press to operate freely.""

Karenga told CPJ that the decision to suspend the media outlets had nothing to do with the upcoming referendum but was about ensuring stations meet regulatory standards, especially with regard to balance. He added that the stations had the opportunity to appeal directly to the regulator or to the courts.

The VOA condemned the suspension and said its content would be ""available in Kirundi and Kinyarwanda via shortwave channels, on the Internet and on FM transmitters located in neighboring countries."" In a separate statement to CPJ, the VOA said that it was ""exploring legal options that would permit its broadcasting operations to reopen in Burundi as quickly as possible.""

In an emailed statement, the BBC told CPJ that it was ""disappointed"" by the government action and said it would respond appropriately against ""any broadcast"" found to be falling short of ""strict editorial guidelines.""

The CNC also issued warnings in the May 4 statement to Radio France International (RFI) and two local, privately owned radio stations, Isanganiro and CCIB-FM Plus. RFI was accused of broadcasting dishonest reports about the referendum. The CNC said that the two local radio stations failed to verify sources in their reporting and did not stick to the programming schedule they had submitted to the regulator.

Yves Rocle, Africa director of RFI, told CPJ that he was not precisely sure of the accusations facing the station but ""apparently"" a guest's comments displeased the CNC, though he did not specify which guest.

CPJ could not reach CCIB-FM Plus or Isanganiro for comment.

Burundi once had a robust press but the media environment has become hostile in recent years. Between April 2015 and August 2015, at least 100 Burundian journalists fled into exile, following attacks, threats and intimidation during a political crisis that included an attempted coup, according to CPJ research.","Burundi media regulator suspends BBC and VOA, warns other broadcasters",https://cpj.org/2018/05/burundi-media-regulator-suspends-bbc-and-voa-warns.php
4,burundi,"Burundi is bracing itself for a constitutional referendum, announced on May 8, 2018 by the country's ruling party. Katie Dobosz-Kenney examines the lead up to the referendum as the bouts of violence in Burundi continue to increase.

BY: KATIE DOBOSZ KENNEY

Burundi’s ruling party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), launched a long-discussed campaign for a constitutional referendum on May 2, 2018. The referendum calls for an amendment to the constitutional provision on presidential term limits, allowing current president, Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. Pierre Nkurunziza has served as Burundi’s president since 2005 following the violent 12-year civil war, marked by ethnic conflict between the country’s Hutu majority and Tutsi minority leaving over 300,000 people dead. The conflict ended with the signing of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi , which instated an ethnic quota system for political representation alongside laying the foundation for the 2005 constitution.

After a period of relative political and civil stability, Nkurunziza controversially ran for a third term in 2015, despite limitation of two, five-year terms for presidents. The election sparked a political crisis and an attempted coup, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 500 dissidents including protesters, opposition leaders, and human rights advocates. Approximately 230,000 Burundians fled to neighboring countries, including Rwanda, DRC, and Tanzania, a number that has since grown to over 400,000 for fear of government coercion and intimidation, as well as poor access to resources and economic opportunity.

Burundi’s government is currently the subject of an open investigation by the ICC into crimes against humanity in 2015-2016 on charges of “imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty, torture, rape, enforced disappearance” in the wake of the 2015 election. Burundi became the first nation to pull out of the Rome Statute and the ICC in October of 2017. Additionally, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2303 to further monitor the security and human rights situation. The above mentioned scrutiny sets the stage for the current political climate.

One of the chief political concerns with the referendum is its violation of Article 299, which states that any revision to the constitution that disrupts national unity, cohesion, reconciliation, democracy etc. should not be implemented. This violation is the topic of local Twitter feeds and Burundi’s only independent media outlet, IWACU, and is supported by the Burundi Conference of Catholic Bishops. Archbishop Joachim Ntahondereye feels the timing of the vote is inopportune and would create further ruptures, as so many are currently displaced and unable to participate, and those who remain fear government backlash for expressing their beliefs.

The fear of government retaliation is further exacerbated by government officials calling for the use of violence against political opponents, with language such as “castrate the enemy,” as well as grassroots reports of violent beatings by the Imbonerakure, the CNDD-FDD’s youth militia, who are known for their brutal use of rape to as a tactic of coercion. In February and March of this year 22 killings and 60 unlawful detentions had already taken place related to the referendum, according to a report by CIVICUS of South Africa.

Oppositionl parties are frustrated that the proposed constitutional amendment has largely taken place in secret and therefore not full assessed by all parties. The lack of information has prompted a variety of stances from oppositional leaders; the Amizero y’Abarundi Coalition is outright campaigning for a vote of no whereas the National Rally for Change (RANAC) is simply not participating in campaigning. Much of the political opposition remains in exile as well.

Accurately assessing the situation on the ground is challenging as Burundi’s National Council for Communication cracks down on coverage of the referendum campaign. Local media outlets are almost non-existent – Burundi is ranked 159 out of 180 for freedom of the press by Reporters Without Borders. On Sunday May 6, action was taken against local and international media outlets as the BBC and VOA were issued six-month suspensions for violating Burundian press laws, as well as two Burundian and a French radio station were issued warnings for not using properly verified sources. The many Burundian journalists in exile have to work anonymously in order to continue reporting and protect their own lives as well as those of their family.

As the hospitality of national hosting Burundian refugees wears thin, the international community, including the EAC, AU, United States, and UN, must do more than condemn the actions of the CNDD-FDD and President Nkurunziza. Familiar use of incendiary, ethnically charged language could reignite old tensions; and with approximately a quarter of the of the population in need of humanitarian assistance, the world needs to turn its attention to tangible actions for Burundi as this referendum will surely exacerbate humanitarian needs.

5,burundi,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – As the campaign heats up in Burundi ahead of a May 17 referendum that could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to rule the central African country until 2034, the Catholic Church has said it opposes the change.

The draft constitution extends the presidential term to seven years from five, allowing Nkurunziza to run again in 2020. It would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms but would not take into account previous terms.

A statement signed by ten Catholic bishops said it was “not the appropriate time to make profound changes” to the constitution.

The President of the Burundi Episcopal Conference, Bishop Joachim Ntahondereye, said that the proposed constitutional changes do not take into account article 299 of the current constitution which stipulates that “no procedure to revise the constitution shall be entertained that endangers national unity, the cohesion of the Burundian people or reconciliation.”

“What we notice is that instead of uniting the Burundian people, the draft constitution seems to have worsened divisions,” the bishop said.

Interviewed by Vatican Radio, Ntahondereye said he feared the referendum could “revive the old demons of division, and that there could be misdirected speeches during the on-going campaign.”

He said opposition figures who had fled the country could use the tense period to reorganize themselves and threaten the present government. The bishop added a “climate of fear” now permeates Burundian society.

Ntahondereye said there were divergent views on the draft amendments, but “many citizens are afraid, even if they don’t voice it. People are afraid to say what they think for fear of reprisals.”

He condemned the abusive use of force and the abuse of power that is now used by some public authorities to suppress the freedom of speech of their political opponents.

The bishops have received the support of the opposition, which has been campaigning for a boycott of the referendum.

“The Catholic bishops have understood that the referendum scheduled to take place on May 17 is a referendum that will plunge the country into a bloodbath; it will completely bury the Arusha accords and will be the harbinger of all dangers. There are people who have died because they did not register to vote. Others have simply disappeared. Violence is raging,” said opposition figure Charles Ndjitijé in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

The 2000 Arusha accords ended years of ethnic fighting in the country after U.N.-brokered talks.

But the permanent representative of Burundi to the United Nations, Albert Shingiro waved aside all these criticisms, telling Deutsche Welle that “the time is ripe for the referendum. It is the result of broad-based consultations that took about a year. Nkurunziza hasn’t declared his candidacy for 2020. We still have two years till then.”

Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 following the Arusha peace and reconciliation accords of 2000 that ended a decade-long civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels, in which 300,000 people were killed.

The country’s constitution limits a presidential term to five years, with a maximum of two terms. When Nkurunziza decided to flout the constitution and run for a third term in 2015, violence erupted in what is one of the world’s poorest countries.

The decision generated protests, a failed coup, and hundreds of deaths.

There are rising fears that in the face of the political crisis, the country’s humanitarian situation could worsen: Right now, over 400,000 Burundians have already fled the country to seek asylum.

“The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi’s problems are political at the root and at their base,” says Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch.

“It’s hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it’s very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi’s neighbors,” he told IRIN, a humanitarian news agency.

According to the U.N.’s Humanitarian Response Plan, more than 3.6 million Burundians are now in need of humanitarian aid, while some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016.

Knowing they can’t get the referendum called off, the bishops are asking that it at least be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere.

“Since our country has chosen the path of democracy, all we can wish for is that the referendum is carried out peacefully and that no Burundian should be pressured to vote,” the bishops statement concluded.",Burundi bishops oppose referendum to allow president to extend rule,https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/05/07/burundi-bishops-oppose-referendum-to-allow-president-to-extend-rule/

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tanzania hosts the largest number of Burundian refugees in the region with a total of 318,202 refugees as of end January 2018. Over 234,000 are Burundian refugees hosted in three camps in Nyarugusu, Mtendeli and Nduta, and 84,202 are Congolese refugees who are also in Nyarugusu. The majority of the refugees from DRC have been in the country for the past 20 years. All the camps are overcrowded with overstretched basic services.

More than 60 per cent of the refugees are still in mass shelters. Children make up 57 per cent of the refugee population and more than 7,000 children are unaccompanied and separated. Protection concerns such as sexual and gender-based violence are significant. There is an inadequate number of schools, a shortage of water especially in Mtendeli camp, and health and nutrition facilities are overstretched. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity, accounting for 33 per cent of all Out Patient Department (OPD) attendances.

No new asylum seekers have been received from Burundi in 2018, but Tanzania received over 2,000 refugees from the Democratic of Congo between November 2017 and January 2018. Voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees resumed in the second week of February 2018, and so far 2,460 refuges have been assisted to voluntary return between January and February 2018. This makes a total of 16,130 refugees repatriated out of the registered 43,060 since the commencement of the assisted Voluntary return in September 2017.

Kigoma is endemic to cholera due to recurring outbreaks. The latest outbreak started in November 2017 that affected over 300 people was brought under control in January 2018. Cholera is still a major threat in the refugee camps and host communities. There were a few suspected cholera cases reported from the new asylum seekers arriving from DRC at Kibirizi reception centre in January 2018 who were admitted at Gungu CTC and later discharged.

Under the coordination of the Resident Coordinator’s Office, UNICEF continues to support the refugee hosting districts in Kigoma region through the UN Kigoma Joint Programme and is leading two Outcomes; Violence against Women and Children (VAWC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). In addition, UNICEF is part of outcome 4: Empowering adolescent girls through education. The government notified all development partners on 23 January 2018 that they will no longer continue to engage in the pilot initiative under the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CCRF). UNICEF and partners will continue to engage with the government to ensure that the refugee response and the needs of host communities are addressed holistically.

While the socio-political situation in Burundi and DRC remains unpredictable, cross–border influxes are expected to continue throughout 2018. Without counting new arrivals and even with the ongoing voluntary repatriations, the refugee population continues to grow with over 1500 babies born every month in the three camps.",Tanzania Humanitarian Situation Report (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/tanzania-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018
7,burundi,"Burundi isn’t at war, but it has all the humanitarian hallmarks of a country that is.

Campaigning began this week ahead of a 17 May referendum that could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. A government clampdown and an uptick in political violence are raising fears that the humanitarian situation will deteriorate further as civil liberties and the rule of law are eroded, prompting more people to join some 400,000 already seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.

Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, said Burundians will continue to flee unless the political crisis is resolved.

“The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi's problems are political at the root and at their base,” he said. “It's hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it's very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi's neighbours.”

More than 3.6 million Burundians – about a quarter of the population of what is the world’s fourth poorest country – now need aid to get by, an increase of almost 20 percent over 2017, according to the UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan.

Some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016. One in six children under the age of five are affected by chronic malnutrition, a condition that stunts growth and impairs mental development.

Aid agencies say they need some $142 million to meet needs this year. So far, only two percent of the appeal has been funded.

Much of this money is required to fill the gap left by a cash-strapped and ineffective state in providing basic services – countering widespread malnutrition and food insecurity, boosting primary healthcare (six million Burundians got malaria in 2017), and helping 190,000 internally displaced people (mostly due to natural disasters such as floods and landslides in 2016) and 65,000 refugees from neighbouring states.

Multiple causes

Burundi’s inability to care for its citizens has several causes: the lingering effects of a civil war that broke out in 1993 and only formally ended in 2006; an economy overly dependent on an inefficient agriculture sector; the political crisis ignited in 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run for re-election in apparent violation of constitutional term limits; and the drying-up of the foreign cash on which the government long depended.

Such overseas assistance “is on a drip at the moment”, according to one aid worker, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of working in Burundi. Suspended donor support has led to a 72-percent cut in the government’s water and sanitation budget, increasing the risk of epidemics such as cholera, while funds for healthcare have been more than halved.

Hundreds of thousands of Burundians fled the country in the early stages of the 2015 political crisis, and continue to leave at a rate of up to 70 a day, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR.

Richard Moncrieff, Central Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, blamed government policy for the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

“Some progress was being made before the crisis in 2015 in food security and malnutrition, but this is being reversed partly because donors are pulling out – for which government is to blame also – and partly because government incompetence is being exposed by uncertainty, violence, and flight of human capital,” he said.

Government policies are also making it harder for humanitarian agencies to deliver aid in Burundi. The 2018 Response Plan pointed to numerous “legal and administrative restrictions [that] limit current and future operational efficiency” of aid agencies and their ability to travel into the interior of the country, except in extremely urgent cases. It added that legislation covering NGOs adopted in January 2017 undermined the independence of aid agencies.

These constraints “remain a key issue for humanitarian actors” in Burundi, Philippe Adapoe, Save the Children’s country director in neighbouring Rwanda, said.

Abuses rise as poll draws near

Wide-ranging human rights abuses committed by security forces and affiliated groups over the past few years led the International Criminal Court to announce in November that it would conduct an investigation into Burundi, even though the country became the first in the world to withdraw from the tribunal the previous month.

Alleged crimes against humanity cited by the ICC include: murder and attempted murder; imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty; torture; rape; enforced disappearance; and persecution. Depending on its findings, the ICC’s next step could be indictments and arrest warrants.

The run-up to the 17 May poll has seen a spike in abuses and threats against those opposed to the amendments.

Mediation efforts led by the East African Community have failed to reconcile the government and the opposition. “The mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results,” the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies think tank said this week. “Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis,” it added.

Many of Nkurunziza’s leading opponents now live in exile, while those still in Burundi who favour a “No” vote in the referendum are being cast by officials as enemies and criminals.

“Opponents, including elected officials, are constantly harassed. The [Imbonerakure] militia which protects government bigwigs commits abuses in deplorable indifference of a judiciary which is a mere shadow of itself,” Dieudonné Bashirahishize, the head of a group of lawyers representing victims of the 2015 crisis, told IRIN. “Leaders of the ruling party keep calling for those who dare to push for a ‘No’ vote to be lynched.”

In one of several similar videos circulating on social media, a ruling party official says: “If you vote ‘No’, you know it will be death.”

And in a rare case of hate speech prosecution, a ruling party official was handed a three-year jail term on 30 April, days after publicly warning that opponents of the referendum would be put into pirogues on Lake Tanganyika (widely understood to mean opponents would be fed to the lake’s fish).

A group of “concerned citizens”, tweeting collectively as @iBurundi, described this trial as a “sideshow” designed to cover up incitement to violence by some of the most senior officials in the ruling party.

Speaking out about abuses in Burundi carries great risks. On 26 April, human rights activist Germain Rukuki was handed a 32-year jail sentence after being convicted of taking part in an “insurrection movement” in 2015. Amnesty International said the charges were trumped up.

In 2015, the country’s most prominent human rights defender, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The monthly report for March 2018 prepared by the organisation Mbonimpa heads, APRODH, lists the most recent killings, arbitrary detentions, torture, beatings, and intimidation, and paints a picture of “growing” insecurity. Many abuses were allegedly carried out by the Imbonerakure - the ruling party’s powerful youth wing -, the police, and intelligence agents working for Nkurunziza’s government.

Lamenting that the prevailing climate of fear was preventing citizens from freely expressing their opinions, Burundi’s bishops said on 2 May that “the time is not right to make profound changes to the constitution”.

Night raids

Earlier this month, legislators approved a draft law that would give police the power to conduct night-time raids on people’s homes.

“The ruling party has just buried democracy in Burundi,” one opposition MP stated after the decision.

Jérémie Minani, the spokesperson for humanitarian issues in the CNARED opposition coalition – which has called for a boycott of the referendum – said the vote would “create chaos and worsen the suffering and misery of the population”.

He added that if the constitutional changes were adopted, it would spell the end of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement – signed in 2000 under the stewardship of Nelson Mandela to end the civil war and create a governance framework for sustainable peace.

The death of the accord would “certainly take the country back to a new civil war,” he warned. “The humanitarian consequences will be extremely serious: a total collapse of the economy resulting in increased poverty.”

The government, which denies there is a political crisis in Burundi and has contested the data in the latest humanitarian appeal as “fabricated figures”, turned Minani’s accusation on its head.

The opposition were the ones who “took the path of violence”, Interior Ministry Spokesman Terence Ntahiraja told IRIN. “They showed that on 13 May 2015,” he added, referring to the day of a failed coup attempt. “So I would ask them to change their behaviour, to abandon their intentions to create trouble in the country and to accept democracy and compete on the ground, [in the referendum campaign] and to win if the people so decide.”

Such an outcome is virtually impossible, said Bashirahishize, the victims’ lawyer. “It’s not a referendum, but a piece of theatre set up to enthrone the ‘Eternal Supreme Guide,’” he told IRIN, using the title the ruling party bestowed on the head of state in March.

What next?

Around 400,000 Burundians who fled since 2015 are still living in neighbouring states, but their welcome in two of them is wearing thin. Tanzania, which hosts some 60 percent of the caseload, no longer grants Burundians prima facie refugee status and is keen to step up the rate of repatriations.

Relations between Burundi and Rwanda have soured, with the neighbours accusing one another of backing rebellions.

Earlier this month, Bujumbura protested the deportation by Kigali of some 1,600 Burundian refugees, alleging they had been sent back for refusing to join an armed group formed to attack Burundi.

Lucy Hovil, senior research associate at the International Refugee Rights Initiative, said the situation facing those fleeing Burundi’s political violence was deeply concerning.

“Given [conditions in] the neighbouring countries to Burundi, this leaves them in a very difficult position because, as you know, many don't want to flee to Rwanda because it's not very safe… and neither is [the Democratic Republic of] Congo,” she said.

Robert Rugurika, a Burundian living in Brussels, told IRIN that the political repression in his home country deters many refugees from going back.

“There is nothing the regime can do to convince people to return if it does not stop oppressing Burundians. This won’t happen because the regime only survives by terrorising its own people and committing human rights violations,” he said. “People are still fleeing even now ahead of the referendum. Since assassinations and torture continues against opponents, people will continue to flee in large numbers.”

Bashirahishize said the international community “needs to pay more attention to the Burundian crisis, which is getting worse with time, so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe which risks getting worse with this referendum.”

Operational Updates

Voluntary repatriation: The Tripartite (Burundi/Tanzania/UNHCR) Commission for the Voluntary Repatriation of Burundian Refugees in Tanzania, which held its 20th meeting in Bujumbura on 28 March, adopted an action plan for the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian refugees from Tanzania between April and December 2018.

According to the plan, 2,000 refugees will be repatriated each week, starting on 5 April, with the possibility of progressively increasing the number. The priority will be given to the 19,148 refugees already registered for voluntary repatriation. WFP will be supporting the process by providing the returnees with a three-month food package for their reintegration. As of 31 March 2018, a total of 20,768 Burundians had returned home with the support of the humanitarian community since the launch of the operation in September 2017. In March 2018, 4,319 Burundians returned home.

Advocacy for Cankuzo province WFP and FAO are jointly advocating for assistance in the province of Cankuzo, one of the provinces most affected by food and nutrition insecurity due to high food prices, reduced labor markets due to limited trans-border movements in Tanzania and slow recovery of agricultural livelihoods after the 2016 drought. The province is among those receiving the largest number of returnees from Tanzania. The food security situation is expected to deteriorate from May to June. According to 2016-2017 Burundi Health and Demographic Survey-III, chronic malnutrition rates are at 59.4 percent, while acute malnutrition is at 6.3 percent.

Assistance is urgently needed to improve the food security of the population of Cankuzo.

Rumonge province in southern Burundi. In March, WFP provided them with food assistance; a total of 95 mt was distributed representing a three-month ration. WFP will continue to closely monitor their food security situation. In June, a multi sectoral assessment including food security will be conducted in the site, and the results will determine the type of assistance to be provided.","WFP Burundi Country Brief, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/wfp-burundi-country-brief-march-2018
10,burundi,"Caritas Rwanda is launching an emergency appeal to assist thousands of refugees from Burundi and help improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in the Mahama camp in the country’s east. Caritas is struggling to raise financial support, with a shortfall in funding of nearly €200,000.

There are more than 57,650 Burundians living in the camp. Many fled Burundi when conflict broke out in 2015 and are still unable to return. Camp newcomers are arriving each month.

Caritas Rwanda wants to continue its programmes providing critical food, economic and psychological support for refugees.

With this new project, Caritas plans to continue its work and assist a total of 5,100 people by providing nutritional assistance to 1,300 chronically ill, 1,400 elderly and 1,000 others with disabilities. It also intends to offer counselling to 200 people who may have been victims of violence or suffered other kinds of trauma. Caritas Rwanda also serves the newcomers during their first 3 days in the camps with meals.

“A great deal has been achieved in the past three years but with no end in sight to the crisis in Burundi, there is an ongoing need to assist refugees, in particular the chronically ill, mentally and physically disabled and the elderly,” said Therese Nduwamungu, Carita Rwanda project coordinator.

Financial sustainability is crucial for long-term refugees. Caritas will offer advice and training to 1,100 women about savings and loans and cultivating their own vegetable gardens to improve households’ everyday nutrition.

Due to funding shortfalls in the past year, Caritas Rwanda has been forced to make a difficult decision and cut back its fresh food assistance for chronically ill people, including those living with HIV, diabetics and anaemic patients. The negative impact is huge. Chronically ill cannot survive without fresh food and the number of malnourished children under the age of five is rising.

Pascal Mushengezi, 60, suffers from cancer. He used to receive a hot daily meal. “I have been treated for my illness for a long time and finally they let me know I had cancer. Caritas gave me a hot meal that gradually gave me energy. I live alone. I have no one to help me.”

Marie Mbonimpa, a 78-year-old widow who suffers from anaemia and lives alone, relied on food assistance which has now been stopped. “Every week, I was given 5 kg of potatoes, two eggs, a cabbage, a kilo of beans and a handful carrots. Today, I feel I have no life left, I am wasting away every day.”

Caritas Rwanda staff and volunteers in the Mahama camp said people who had benefited from fresh food assistance were dying and the restoration of this assistance was essential for the survival of the most vulnerable.

Caritas Rwanda is one of only three local non-government organizations working in the Mahama camp and also works closely with UN bodies there. Staff spoke to representatives of the American Refugee Committee and Save the Children International to find out more about the consequences.

Jean Damascène Habimana, a nutritionist for the American Refugee Committee at the Mahama camp, said there had been an increase in the number of anaemic patients and the length of time they were being treated. In March alone 455 anaemic children were treated at the Mahama I health centre, while the number had never exceeded 200 previously.

Pascal Nkuru, nutrition co-ordinator for Save the Children, said 289 malnourished children under five were being cared for at the end of March by the health centre where he worked inside the Mahama camp. “A patient who does not receive adequate food not only cannot see the extension of his treatment, but worse still, withers away even more,” he said. “This is obvious for chronically ill people who require an appropriate diet. ”

Fresh food for hospitalised patients has been kept in the new project, even if reduced to a bare minimum because of the cost, to try to continue to support those vulnerable in the coming months, the time for Caritas Rwanda to try to find a solution.",Bad news for Burundian refugees in Rwanda as funds dry up,https://reliefweb.int/report/rwanda/bad-news-burundian-refugees-rwanda-funds-dry

The president's bid to stay in power until 2034 could further destabilise the country

Burundi isn't at war, but it has all the humanitarian hallmarks of a country that is.

Campaigning began this week ahead of a 17 May referendum that will allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. A government clampdown and an uptick in political violence are raising fears that the humanitarian situation will deteriorate further as civil liberties and the rule of law are eroded, prompting more people to join some 400,000 already seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.

Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, said Burundians will continue to flee unless the political crisis is resolved.

""The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi's problems are political at the root and at their base,"" he said. ""It's hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it's very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi's neighbours.""

More than 3.6 million Burundians - about a quarter of the population of what is the world's fourth poorest country - now need aid to get by, an increase of almost 20 percent over 2017, according to the UN's Humanitarian Response Plan.

Some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016. One in six children under the age of five are affected by chronic malnutrition, a condition that stunts growth and impairs mental development.

Aid agencies say they need some $142 million to meet needs this year. So far, only two percent of the appeal has been funded.

Much of this money is required to fill the gap left by a cash-strapped and ineffective state in providing basic services - countering widespread malnutrition and food insecurity, boosting primary healthcare (six million Burundians got malaria in 2017), and helping 190,000 internally displaced people (mostly due to natural disasters such as floods and landslides in 2016) and 65,000 refugees from neighbouring states.

Burundi's inability to care for its citizens has several causes: the lingering effects of a civil war that broke out in 1993 and only formally ended in 2006; an economy overly dependent on an inefficient agriculture sector; the political crisis ignited in 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run for re-election in apparent violation of constitutional term limits; and the drying-up of the foreign cash on which the government long depended.

Such overseas assistance ""is on a drip at the moment"", according to one aid worker, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of working in Burundi. Suspended donor support has led to a 72-percent cut in the government's water and sanitation budget, increasing the risk of epidemics such as cholera, while funds for healthcare have been more than halved.

Hundreds of thousands of Burundians fled the country in the early stages of the 2015 political crisis, and continue to leave at a rate of up to 70 a day, according to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR.

Richard Moncrieff, Central Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, blamed government policy for the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

""Some progress was being made before the crisis in 2015 in food security and malnutrition, but this is being reversed partly because donors are pulling out - for which government is to blame also - and partly because government incompetence is being exposed by uncertainty, violence, and flight of human capital,"" he said.

Government policies are also making it harder for humanitarian agencies to deliver aid in Burundi. The 2018 Response Plan pointed to numerous ""legal and administrative restrictions [that] limit current and future operational efficiency"" of aid agencies and their ability to travel into the interior of the country, except in extremely urgent cases. It added that legislation covering NGOs adopted in January 2017 undermined the independence of aid agencies.

These constraints ""remain a key issue for humanitarian actors"" in Burundi, Philippe Adapoe, Save the Children's country director in neighbouring Rwanda, said.

Wide-ranging human rights abuses committed by security forces and affiliated groups over the past few years led the International Criminal Court to announce in November that it would conduct an investigation into Burundi, even though the country became the first in the world to withdraw from the tribunal the previous month.

Alleged crimes against humanity cited by the ICC include: murder and attempted murder; imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty; torture; rape; enforced disappearance; and persecution. Depending on its findings, the ICC's next step could be indictments and arrest warrants.

The run-up to the 17 May poll has seen a spike in abuses and threats against those opposed to the amendments.

Mediation efforts led by the East African Community have failed to reconcile the government and the opposition. ""The mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results,"" the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies think tank said this week. ""Nkurunziza's government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis,"" it added.

Many of Nkurunziza's leading opponents now live in exile, while those still in Burundi who favour a ""No"" vote in the referendum are being cast by officials as enemies and criminals.

""Opponents, including elected officials are constantly harassed. The [Imbonerakure] militia which protects government bigwigs commits abuses in deplorable indifference of a judiciary which is a mere shadow of itself,"" Dieudonné Bashirahishize, the head of a group of lawyers representing victims of the 2015 crisis, told IRIN. ""Leaders of the ruling party keep calling for those who dare to push for a 'No' vote to be lynched.""

In one of several similar videos circulating on social media, a ruling party official says: ""If you vote 'No', you know it will be death.""

And in a rare case of hate speech prosecution, a ruling party official was handed a three-year jail term on 30 April, days after publicly warning that opponents of the referendum would be put into pirogues on Lake Tanganyika (widely understood to mean opponents would be fed to the lake's fish).

A group of ""concerned citizens"" tweeting collectively as @iBurundi, described this trial as a ""sideshow"" designed to cover up incitement to violence by some of the most senior officials in the ruling party.

Speaking out about abuses in Burundi carries great risks. On 26 April, human rights activist Germain Rukuki was handed a 32-year jail sentence after being convicted of taking part in an ""insurrection movement"" in 2015. Amnesty International said the charges were trumped up.

In 2015, the country's most prominent human rights defender, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The monthly report for March 2018 prepared by the organisation Mbonimpa heads, APRODH, lists the most recent killings, arbitrary detentions, torture, beatings, and intimidation, and paints a picture of ""growing"" insecurity. Many abuses were allegedly carried out by the Imbonerakure - the ruling party's powerful youth wing -, the police, and intelligence agents working for Nkurunziza's government.

Lamenting that the prevailing climate of fear was preventing citizens from freely expressing their opinions, Burundi's bishops said on 2 May that ""the time is not right to make profound changes to the constitution"".

Earlier this month, legislators approved a draft law that would give police the power to conduct night-time raids on people's homes.

""The ruling party has just buried democracy in Burundi,"" one opposition MP stated after the decision.

Jérémie Minani, the spokesperson for humanitarian issues in the CNARED opposition coalition - which has called for a boycott of the referendum - said the vote would ""create chaos and worsen the suffering and misery of the population"".

He added that if the constitutional changes were adopted, it would spell the end of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement - signed in 2000 under the stewardship of Nelson Mandela to end the civil war and create a governance framework for sustainable peace.

The death of the accord would ""certainly take the country back to a new civil war,"" he warned. ""The humanitarian consequences will be extremely serious: a total collapse of the economy resulting in increased poverty.""

The government, which denies there is a political crisis in Burundi and has contested the data in the latest humanitarian appeal as ""fabricated figures"", turned Minani's accusation on its head.

The opposition were the ones who ""took the path of violence"", Interior Ministry Spokesman Terence Ntahiraja told IRIN.

12,burundi,"Authorities in Burundi have banned the BBC and Voice of America (VOA), as well as two local broadcasters, just weeks before a crucial constitutional referendum on presidential term limits.

The National Communications Council (NCC) said on Friday that the news organisations' operations would be suspended for at least six months for breaching the ""laws governing the press and ethics.""

The ban will come into effect on Monday, Karenga Ramadhani, the head of the regulator, told journalists in the capital, Bujumbura.

The NCC said the BBC invited a Burundian who made ""inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified [remarks], damaging the reputation of the head of state, to ethnic hatred, to political conflict and civil disobedience"".

VOA, for its part, was accused of spreading ""very tendentious"" information and hiring a journalist ""sought by Burundian justice"", according to AFP news agency.

{articleGUID}

French broadcaster Radio France International was also issued a stern warning in the same statement, and was asked to put a more vigorous verification process in place.

Two local broadcasters were also banned after the presidency complained their reporting was biased, the National Communications Council said.

The BBC and VOA both broadcast daily in the national Kirundi language and have amassed a large following over the years, especially in rural areas.

Amanda Bennett, VOA's director, denounced the regulator's action and said the news organisation's content would continue to be available through its shortwave channels, online and on FM transmitters located in neighbouring countries.

""Our audience members count on VOA to provide factual, unbiased and objective coverage of current events, so this ban deprives the citizens of Burundi of a trusted news source during a critical time in that country,"" she said in a statement.

""This is even more distressing coming only one day after World Press Freedom Day - a day calling for governments to remove, not impose, restrictions on the media,"" Bennett added.

Key referendum

While the country's constitution currently limits presidents to two five-year terms, a ""yes"" vote in the upcoming referendum on May 17 could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza, 54, to run for an additional two seven-year terms.

In concrete terms, this would mean that Nkurunziza, in power since 2005, could potentially rule until 2034 if he is re-elected in the next scheduled election in two years.

His run for a controversial third term in 2015 triggered a deep political crisis that has since seen 1,200 people killed and 400,000 flee their homes in the country of 10.5 million.

""Conditions for holding a credible referendum deteriorate as days go by,"" Leonce Ngendakumana, deputy chairman of the opposition party FRODEBU, the Front for Democracy in Burundi, told the Reuters news agency.

""The regime is now afraid of the media's force, which can derail their plan for the upcoming referendum and the 2020 elections.""

Also commenting on the regulator's announcement, Lews Mudge, a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's Africa division, called the broadcasting ban ""worrying"".

""This falls in line with the repression in Burundi as we head closer to the referendum,"" Mudge told Reuters.

""This is happening in the context of journalists getting threatened, those reporting on some of the oppression are being muzzled.""

Earlier this week, Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the US Department of State, denounced alleged acts of violence against the opposition and called on the Burundian government to respect its international commitments to protect freedoms of speech and association.

""We call on the government to respect Burundi's international legal obligations regarding the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association,"" Nauert said on Tuesday.

13,burundi,"A political almanac, a miniature desk flag, a poster of presidents past and present: symbols of Tanzania, the country that has given her refuge since she fled violence in neighbouring Burundi in 1972, dot the home of Magreth Lameck Mtema in the town of Kigoma, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika.

By rights, these symbols should now represent Mtema’s own nationality but, like tens of thousands of her compatriots, she’s still waiting for the promise of naturalisation – first issued to her more than a decade ago – to be made good, in the form of a certificate of citizenship.

But even for the many former Burundian refugees who have received such documents, life in Tanzania remains full of uncertainty and restrictions, buffeted by the policy changes of the government and its uneasy relations with international partners.

Increasingly violent political tensions in Burundi in the run-up to a controversial referendum due on 17 May, raising the possibility of a fresh exodus, only add to the anxiety.

The Tanzanian government moved Mtema’s family to a house in Kigoma after they spent a few months of 1972 in one of several sprawling settlement centres that still house tens of thousands of refugees and newly naturalised citizens.

“There's when our lives started again,"" Mtema recalled. In the 40 years since, her family have helped make ends meet with the tomatoes, maize, and cassava grown on the plot outside their house. But the recent hardening of the government’s attitude towards refugees has her concerned. Now, she said, her family feels “insecure, because the general mood around here is changing” and they are still waiting for official citizenship.

“We're starting to get worried; we're unsure what's causing the delay, and this has left us in limbo,” she said.

Open doors

Tanzania has a long history of welcoming refugees. For decades, it has opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict in their countries, especially Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, going further than most host nations by allotting new arrivals plots of land to farm and encouraging local integration.

There are now some 315,000 refugees in Tanzania, more than 230,000 of whom fled Burundi since the political crisis there erupted in 2015.

In 2007, Tanzania offered the earlier 1972 Burundian caseload, numbering some 200,000 (many of whom were born in Tanzania), a choice of being helped to return to Burundi or of receiving Tanzanian citizenship, an option accepted by 80 percent of them.

The international community hailed the move, which included plans to allow the refugees to move out of sprawling settlement camps to anywhere in Tanzania, as a model for the world’s protracted displacement crises.

Although the process of naturalisation proceeded, it only did so in fits and starts. Some 170,000 Burundian former refugees have now been granted Tanzanian citizenship, but tens of thousands of others, including Mtema, are still waiting.

Not only are an estimated 30,000 Burundian refugees yet to receive their certificates, but plans to allow hundreds of thousands of new citizens to move to other parts of the country have never fully come to fruition because of local resistance to such influxes and disagreements over who would foot the bills.

Doors begin to close

To make matter worse, the government of Tanzanian President John Magufuli has over the past year appeared to be toughening its stance on refugees.

After a meeting with Burundian counterpart Pierre Nkurunziza in July 2017, Magufuli ordered yet another halt to the naturalisation process. He also sparked alarm by urging more recent Burundian refugees to return home, deeming their country safe enough to do so despite reports of widespread human rights abuses. A few months earlier, Tanzania stopped granting automatic refugee status for those arriving from Burundi.

Between September 2017 and February 2018, more than 16,500 Burundian refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi, according to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR. The government-led scheme starts a new round in April.

Timeline: Tanzania's many twists and turns on refugee policy

In another significant move, in January 2018, Tanzania pulled out of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, or CRRF, a supposedly game-changing new global compact aimed at easing pressure on host countries by helping refugees to become more self-reliant and supporting the communities in which they live. Tanzania, one of 13 pilot countries for the initiative, cited lack of donor funds and unspecified security concerns as reasons for withdrawing.

This reference to security baffles Mussa Kiumbe Kunda, a Tanzanian resident of Kigoma who has witnessed the arrival of many waves of refugees over the years.

“We've never had the sense that refugees cause us insecurity in the town here, because I have never once felt threatened by having them here,” he said. “They're not a threat at all to our community.”

“The government has started interfering in refugees' lives and disturbing them; this was never the case before,” he said.

Mtema’s experiences back this up.

“Immigration officers come here often and disturb us; sometimes they ask for bribes, too,” she said.

Mtema said her brother, the family breadwinner, was recently sacked from his job as a senior civil servant after 15 years, simply because of his nationality.

""My grandchildren can't go to school at the moment because their parents aren't recognised as citizens and can't get a job. They can't have a good life in Tanzania without citizenship. My dream was not to see my children or grandchildren suffer any more, but without citizenship there are barriers,” she added.

According to Lucy Hovil, a researcher with with the International Refugee Rights Initiative, an advocacy group, the naturalisation process has been counterproductive for many in Mtema’s situation.

“A scheme which was supposed to sort out their legal status has actually made it much less clear,” she said. “This whole process has raised their level of visibility and they have become much more vulnerable as a result.”

Charlie Ensor/IRIN Posters of Magufuli and the ruling CCM regime adorn Magreth Mtema’s living room.

Pressure to return

Populist politics may play a part in Tanzania’s recent calls for Burundian refugees to return to their country of origin, but analysts also point to the government’s fraught relationship with the international donor community.

“Tanzania has long felt that it has not been fully supported by the donor community in its response to refugee-hosting, which has historically been generous,” said James Milner, associate professor at Carleton University. ""This narrative of Tanzania being abandoned, of Tanzania not receiving, of donors not delivering on the promises they made to Tanzania, is very important, and a very powerful narrative.”

As of January this year, UNHCR had received only five percent of the $119 million it had sought from donors to meet the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in Tanzania.

While lack of clarity over how responsibilities for implementing the CRRF should be shared between the government, the UN, and donors was a key reason for Tanzania’s withdrawal from the scheme, it is refugees who are feeling the effects.

“These projects were meant to build services for the host communities as well – primary schools, boreholes, hospitals, and so on,” said an aid worker who asked not to be named, while condemning a government that has been criticised as increasingly repressive and hostile to NGOs.

Troubles at home

Since September 2017, UNHCR has helped more than 20,000 Burundians to return from Tanzania. This year, according to a joint communiqué between both governments, as many as 72,000 Burundians “who wish to return” will be repatriated.

""The governments of Burundi and Tanzania agree that, given the existence of peace, security and political stability in the Republic of Burundi, the two governments are in the position to move forward from providing assistance to voluntary repatriation… and promotion of returns,” the communiqué said.

But, given its own assessment of the current conditions in Burundi, UNHCR has said it will only support, not “promote”, such returns.

Last month, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein listed Burundi as among “the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times”, in the same breath as Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“While Burundi isn't making the headlines that it was during the failed coup in 2015, we are still documenting serious human rights abuses being perpetrated mostly by state actors,” Lewis Mudge, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told IRIN, citing the “illegal and arbitrary detention of individuals who are suspected of being against the referendum” as common abuses.

A Burundian refugee in Tanzania who only gave his name as Nathaniel described people in Burundi as “worried” and “terrorised”. He said that “to escape from being arrested and/or killed, they will vote ‘yes’” in the referendum, which could allow Nkurunziza to stay in power until 2034.

Another aid worker who spoke on condition of anonymity, again for fear of reprisals, said that poor conditions in Tanzania’s refugee camps may drive refugees to return home on a “less than voluntary” basis.

""Refugees reported to our staff that decreasing rations in the camps appear to be a driver for returns,” the worker said, explaining that they are not permitted to work and earn money to buy additional food.

People like Mtema find themselves between a rock and a hard place.

“I have felt for a long time now that this is my home,” she said. “But these days I no longer feel welcome in Tanzania.”

It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years.

Does the East African Community have what it takes to help bring stability to Burundi?

First published by ISS Today

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the EAC (East African Community) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the AU (African Union).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and Comesa jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives. DM
