0,burundi,"Burundi announced on Tuesday the official launch of campaigning for controversial constitutional changes that could potentially allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034.

The proposed amendment is expected to ask voters on May 17 to consider scrapping a current constitutional limit on two presidential terms each spanning five years.

If approved, Nkurunziza - in power since 2005 - would be able to seek two more seven-year terms in office.

According to the east central African country's electoral commission, more than five million people have registered to take part in the referendum

What is the context?

The constitution of Burundi only allows a president to be elected twice, for a total of 10 years in power.

A crisis was triggered after he decided to run for a third term, arguing before polls in July 2015 that he had only been directly elected by the people once.

Nkurunziza's decision to seek re-election led to weeks of violent clashes between protesters and security forces in the capital, Bujumbura. His third bid for office also triggered an attempted coup, which was quashed.

The former rebel leader won the disputed election, which was boycotted by the opposition, and was widely criticised as neither free nor fair.

At least 1,200 people were killed in the violence and more than 400,000 displaced. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has said it is investigating alleged state-sponsored crimes against humanity in the country.

In 2017, Burundi became the first country to leave the Hague-based court.

Nkurunziza's third term in office will come to an end in 2020.

Free and fair?

Twenty-six parties, almost all aligned with the ruling CNDD-FDD party, have been authorised to campaign and take part in the referendum.

But Burundi's exiled opposition has called for a boycott, describing the referendum as the ""death knell"" to the agreement that helped end Burundi's 1995-2003 civil war, which killed more than 300,000 people.

The vote is taking place in tightly-controlled conditions, and parties which call on voters to boycott - rather than cast a Yes or No ballot - risk up to three years' in jail.

Opposition leaders accuse the government of stifling debate and failing even to issue the official draft of the proposed change.



""The government has not even officially communicated to us the draft of the revised constitution so that we can examine it and know for sure which text will be submitted for public approval or disapproval,"" Georges Nikiza, the spokesman for the National Rally for Change, RANAC, told AFP news agency on Tuesday.



On April 20, police said eight people had been arrested with ""the goal of disrupting the next referendum with the use of firearms"".

The United States on Tuesday denounced the ""violence, intimidation, and harassment"" against people thought to oppose the referendum.

Washington said it was concerned about the ""non-transparent process"" of changing the constitution in the referendum.",Why is Burundi holding a referendum?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/burundi-holding-referendum-180502062813382.html

Burundi’s constitutional referendum campaign has been marred by violence as government security forces and ruling party members have intimidated, beaten, and killed perceived opponents. The government has tried to keep news of these abuses from the outside world.

Last Friday it doubled down on that effort, suspending the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America from reporting in the country before the critical final days of the scheduled May 17 vote.

A win in the constitutional referendum will allow President Pierre Nkurunziza – who has been in power since 2005 – to extend his term in office until 2034.

The government-controlled National Communication Council (CNC), Burundi’s media regulator, suspended the BBC for six months for “violating press laws” and “unprofessional conduct” after inviting a Burundian national to its program on March 12. It claimed his remarks were “inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified and damaged the reputation of the head of state.” The CNC banned VOA for the technical reason that it was using a banned frequency.

The CNC warned French broadcaster Radio France Internationale that it could face consequences for recent remarks it deemed “untruthful and partisan,” and the Burundian station Isanganiro was criticized for apparently poor verification of sources.

Several weeks earlier the CNC suspended the online comments section of Iwacu, Burundi’s main independent newspaper.

Burundi previously had one of the most independent media environments in the region. But when Nkurunziza announced his bid for a contested third term in 2015, a crackdown on protests led to a serious political and human rights crisis and tightened restrictions on the media. Local stations were physically destroyed and a journalist went missing as Burundians, the majority of whom live in the countryside, turned to international broadcasts for information.

And now the government has turned to silencing some of these crucial international voices.

The CNC knows the power of the media. It recognizes that when the country is deprived of accurate news, then government security forces can act with impunity. As campaigning kicks off around the referendum, more violence can be expected, with Burundians increasingly in the dark, reliant on rumors and scraps of information. But the government can’t stop the networks of Burundians sending information to Burundian and international human rights groups. Even with all the radio stations in the country shut, crimes will ultimately be reported and those responsible eventually brought to justice.",International Media Banned During Burundi’s Referendum Campaign,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/06/international-media-banned-during-burundis-referendum-campaign

• UNICEF Burundi is facing a serious funding shortfall, with only 11 per cent of 2018 HAC funding available. Without additional funds, UNICEF will not be able to address the essential needs of children and women in Burundi.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The socio-political situation in Burundi remains precarious and continue to spur on movement of population and humanitarian needs. A total of 397,526 refugees, the majority of whom are children (54.6 per cent), have found refuge in neighbouring countries (mainly in Tanzania, Rwanda, DRC and Uganda), a slight increase of 1,353 people since the last report in February 2018. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) registered in eighteen provinces continues to decrease and is currently 174,011 of which 58 per cent are children (IOM, March 2018).

On 28 March 2018, a new tripartite agreement was signed between the Government of Burundi, the Government of Tanzania and UNHCR to continue supporting the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian from Tanzania in 2018. Since September 2017, a total of 20,739 people have been repatriated to Burundi (UNHCR, 22 March 2018). An estimated 60,000 people have also spontaneously returned.

There was a sharp decrease in malaria cases and deaths since the beginning of the year. According to the Ministry of Health (MoH) data, the cumulative number of malaria cases reported during the first fifteen weeks of 2018 is 1,542,769 cases with 744 deaths, which is 44% lower than the number of cases reported for the same period in 2017 (2,743,764 cases and 1,240 deaths).",UNICEF Burundi Humanitarian Situation Report – March – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/unicef-burundi-humanitarian-situation-report-march-april-2018

Does the East African Community have what it takes to help bring stability to Burundi?

First published by ISS Today

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the EAC (East African Community) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.

The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.

However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.

The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the AU (African Union).

Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.

Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.

Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and Comesa jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.

This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.

Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.

Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.

More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.

The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.

The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.

If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.

More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives. DM

425,780 BURUNDIAN REFUGEES (DEC 2017)

US$ 249.3M REQUIREMENTS IN 2017

21% FUNDING RECEIVED (DEC 2017)

30 RRRP PARTNERS INVOLVED

REGIONAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

While insecurity and violence in Burundi were at a lower scale in 2017 than the previous year, political tensions and human rights violations continued to cause outflows of refugees, even as others chose to return. Some 61,000 asylum seekers left Burundi in 2017. Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) all stopped granting refugee status to Burundians on a prima facie basis during 2017, while Rwanda continues to do so. Receiving countries have struggled throughout the year to meet the basic needs of refugees due to severe underfunding of the crisis.

Tanzania is supporting the largest number of Burundian refugees with 40,238 arrivals in 2017, most of whom arrived in the first few months of the year. Rwanda received a total of 7,683 Burundian refugees, with arrival rates remaining relatively stable throughout the year. The DRC registered 8,575 new refugees from Burundi in 2017. And arrivals to Uganda amounted to 5,312, decreasing from over 700 in January to less than 100 in December 2017. A total of 13,104 refugees were assisted to return from Tanzania to Burundi between 7 September and 31 December 2017 as per the agreement resulting from the Tripartite Commission meeting on 31 August 2017. UNHCR is not promoting refugee return to Burundi, but is assisting those who indicate they have made a voluntary choice to repatriate.

Protection: Progress on protection activities by RRP partners was noted throughout the region. This included achievements such as: providing 100% of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) survivors with support in Uganda; training government officials and implementing partners on refugee and migrant protection in Rwanda; biometric registration of 100% of refugees in DRC; and reuniting 750 children with their families through inter-camp and intra-camp tracing programs in Tanzania. Alongside the progress, many gaps still remain. These include, but are not limited to: scaling up support for SGBV survivors in the DRC, and improving access to individual case management services for children with specific needs in Uganda.

Education: Across the region, there has been success in achieving high enrollment rates to primary schools, but difficulties persist in terms of attendance. In the DRC, despite an 85% enrollment rate, actual attendance is believed to be much lower. Similarly in Uganda, while there is an enrollment rate of 65% in primary schools, only 45% have been recorded as attending. Distance from learning facilities and parental attitudes towards education are two key factors affecting attendance. A positive approach in addressing this was taken in Rwanda whereby RRP partners participated in parents and teachers association meetings to improve school attendance and quality of education. The ratio of students to teachers is another challenge being faced in all countries of asylum (up to 100:1 in some classrooms), exacerbated by a shortage of classrooms and qualified teachers. More funding is needed for countries to make adequate investments in education for Burundian refugees.

Food Security: RRP partners managed to maintain food assistance throughout the year to Burundian refugees in the region, including special assistance to vulnerable groups in all countries. Achievements included the increased dietary diversity score in Uganda from to 3.7 in 2016, to 3.8 in 2017 and the provision of monthly in-kind food distribution to 56,206 refugees in Mahama camp, Rwanda. However, due to funding shortfalls, food rations were not always at 100% and in Tanzania food ration reductions ranged between approximately 10% and 40% throughout the year, arguably a factor in some refugees’ decisions to return to Burundi.

Health and Nutrition: Improvements in health facilities in 2017 included the expansion of facilities in Tanzania increasing health service provision capacity, and in Rwanda, the upgrade of facilities from emergency to semi-permanent structures. Common challenges in the health and nutrition sector persist regionally, including a lack of trained health care staff. Tanzania has reported that staffing levels at health care facilities are inadequate to sustain the provision of quality healthcare services and the DRC has noted the absence of psychiatric staff to treat refugees, and a lack of training for health care staff working in maternal care.

Livelihoods and Environment: With the RRP’s emphasis on promoting economic self-reliance and reducing dependence on aid, Burundian refugees received livelihood support that included over 37,000 people benefiting from livelihood programs in Tanzania, and over 3,000 refugees receiving support to start businesses in Uganda. A common issue in the region is dependence on limited natural resources, sometimes leading to conflict with surrounding communities and related protection concerns. In the DRC, an initiative to support income generating activities in Lusenda camp included the production of briquettes for cooking, reducing dependence on firewood. Similar initiatives are needed and would ideally be scaled up around the region, environmental protection being a high priority of all host governments.

Shelter and NFIs: Across the region shelter facilities were established to accommodate new arrivals. Key achievements included 84% of Burundian refugees in Rwanda with semi-permanent shelter in 2017, and 100% distribution of NFI kits to new refugee households in Uganda. Alongside this success there is room for improvement, especially in Tanzania where 65% of the refugee population continued to live emergency shelters without access to semi- permanent shelter, and in Uganda where only 4% of refugees with specific needs were provided with semi-permanent shelter.

WASH: Significant progress was made regionally in the WASH sector. In Uganda, there was a move from emergency water systems to more sustainable models, with 97% of the population now supplied with water at an average rate of 17.5 liters per person per day. In Tanzania, improved access to potable water was achieved for over 115,000 Burundian refugees in Nduta camp, who are now receiving an average of 20.5 lit/person/day. A new water treatment plant was set up in Rwanda with the capacity to support 60,000 refugees and the host community around Mahama camp. However, more support is needed to improve maintenance of water supply. In Uganda for example, despite the achievement of drilling 8 new boreholes in 2017, only 6 of the 27 boreholes drilled in 2016 remain functional.

Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF): RRP partners and government counterparts applied the CRRF approach throughout the region by seeking to anchor the multi-sector assistance and protection response in government systems, policies, and plans, delivering integrated services for refugees and host communities wherever possible. In Rwanda, some 19,000 Burundian refugee children are enrolled in the national school system alongside host community children. In the DRC, the new Mulongwe site was purposefully developed with the refugees and host community benefiting from the same health, education, and other social services. In Uganda, in an effort to integrate humanitarian health services into the national health system, improvements were made to semi-permanent and permanent health structures which were part of the local government development plans. In Tanzania, in an initiative supported by UNICEF, government social workers have been deployed to refugee camps as part of child protection and SGBV response. Greater investments are needed to strengthen government systems to better serve refugees and host communities alike, and to increase opportunities for refugee self-reliance.",Burundi - Regional RRP - 2017 End of Year Report - December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/burundi-regional-rrp-2017-end-year-report-december-2017

Operational Updates

Voluntary repatriation: The Tripartite (Burundi/Tanzania/UNHCR) Commission for the Voluntary Repatriation of Burundian Refugees in Tanzania, which held its 20th meeting in Bujumbura on 28 March, adopted an action plan for the voluntary repatriation of 72,000 Burundian refugees from Tanzania between April and December 2018.

According to the plan, 2,000 refugees will be repatriated each week, starting on 5 April, with the possibility of progressively increasing the number. The priority will be given to the 19,148 refugees already registered for voluntary repatriation. WFP will be supporting the process by providing the returnees with a three-month food package for their reintegration. As of 31 March 2018, a total of 20,768 Burundians had returned home with the support of the humanitarian community since the launch of the operation in September 2017. In March 2018, 4,319 Burundians returned home.

Advocacy for Cankuzo province WFP and FAO are jointly advocating for assistance in the province of Cankuzo, one of the provinces most affected by food and nutrition insecurity due to high food prices, reduced labor markets due to limited trans-border movements in Tanzania and slow recovery of agricultural livelihoods after the 2016 drought. The province is among those receiving the largest number of returnees from Tanzania. The food security situation is expected to deteriorate from May to June. According to 2016-2017 Burundi Health and Demographic Survey-III, chronic malnutrition rates are at 59.4 percent, while acute malnutrition is at 6.3 percent.

Assistance is urgently needed to improve the food security of the population of Cankuzo.

Provision of assistance to IDPs: 2,000 IDPs displaced by torrential rains that hit south Burundi 3 years ago have recently been relocated by the government to Kigwena,

Rumonge province in southern Burundi. In March, WFP provided them with food assistance; a total of 95 mt was distributed representing a three-month ration. WFP will continue to closely monitor their food security situation. In June, a multi sectoral assessment including food security will be conducted in the site, and the results will determine the type of assistance to be provided.","WFP Burundi Country Brief, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/wfp-burundi-country-brief-march-2018

A Burundian activist was sentenced to 32 years in prison for taking part in protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, sources said, a punishment rights groups said was ""eminently political"".

Germain Rukuki was given ""32 years of penal servitude"" at Bujumbura's district court, a civil society member who was at the hearing said Thursday on condition of anonymity, adding that neither Rukuki, who is in detention, nor his lawyers were present at the hearing.

UNREST

A judicial source confirmed to AFP Rukuki was convicted for ""having participated in an insurrectional movement in order to change the constitutional regime, to have participated in the assassination of police and soldiers from May 13, 2015 and to have defaced both public and private property"".

Burundian authorities use the term 'insurrectional movement' to describe the unrest against the controversial decision of President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in 2015, which he won in July that year.

Hundreds of Burundians have since been convicted on the charge.

The announcement of Nkurunziza's candidacy in April 2015 plunged Burundi into a political crisis that has left at least 1,200 people dead and more than 400,000 displaced, and on which the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation.

LIFE SENTENCE

Prosecutors on 6 April called for Rukuki to be given a life sentence, while his defence lawyers pleaded for his acquittal.

Rukuki was arrested on July 13, 2017 by the feared National Intelligence Service (SNR) and held in isolation in Bujumbura for over a month before being transferred to Ngozi Prison in the north of the country, where he has been detained ever since.

Justine Duby from the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said: ""The conviction of Germain Rukuki for 32 years in prison is one of the heaviest sentences ever pronounced in Burundi against a human rights defender and this decision, which falls three years to the day after the outbreak of the Burundian crisis, is eminently political.

NAIROBI,

Burundi on Tuesday launched the official campaign for a referendum on constitutional change that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power for another 16 years.

Twenty-six parties, most of them aligned with the ruling CNDD-FDD party, have been authorised to campaign for the May 17 plebiscite in the politically tense central African nation.

The vote is taking place in tightly-controlled conditions, and parties which advise electors to abstain — rather than cast a Yes or No ballot — risk up to three years' jail.

Burundi's exiled opposition, gathered in an alliance called CNARED, has called for a boycott of the referendum, which it describes as the ""death knell"" to a 2000 agreement that helped end a bloody civil war.

No president can govern Burundi for more than 10 years under the 2000 Arusha peace accords, which helped to end a 1993-2006 conflict that killed more than 300,000 people.

But if the amendment is approved, Nkurunziza would be entitled to stand for two more seven-year terms from 2020.

CRISIS

In 2015, Burundi was plunged into a deep political crisis when Nkurunziza ran for a third term in office.

At least 1,200 people were killed and 400,000 fled the country.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun an investigation into widespread abuses that took place at this time.

More than five million people have signed up to vote, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) says.

8,burundi,"Our editors’ Friday roundup of humanitarian trends and developments.

On our radar:

Yemen: A Twitter battle for Hodeidah

Let’s talk about Hodeidah — everyone else is, at least online. Late last month, Saudi officials (and a press release) said that Houthi rebels were “holding hostage” 19 ships in the waters outside Hodeidah, the Red Sea port that’s key to staving off famine in Yemen and is subject to an on-off blockade by the Saudi-led coalition. This, the Saudis said, prevented the ships from delivering fuel. A maritime tracking project jumped in via Twitter, saying that their data showed not only were the tankers delivering fuel and then departing from the port, but that the deliveries were more frequent than usual. “It seems that the more time we spend on tracking the [Hodeidah] tanker situation, the more bizarre it becomes,” the group, TankerTrackers.com, tweeted. Things got even weirder when YCHO, the coalition’s humanitarian operations in Yemen, used TankerTrackers’ data in a tweet to show that “there is no blockade on Yemen.” Confused? Here’s a handy summary from PRI. Oh, and now’s a good time to add that a battle for the port city – which would be disastrous for civilians — is still not out of the question. A senior Houthi official was recently killed nearby, apparently by a UAE drone, and we hear that the rumour mill is churning. We’ll keep you posted.

We've now identified and logged all of the vessels in question. Should they move, we'll know about it. They came in (for the most part) from the UAE via Djibouti, carrying fuel for the population, given it's collectively over 2.2M barrels. Saudis say Houthis blocked all 18. #OOTT pic.twitter.com/Zzm8W1ElN4 — TankerTrackers.com:oil_drum: (@TankerTrackers) April 21, 2018

Afghanistan: Who’s in control?

If Afghan officials need another worry, here’s one: in the past three years, government control over Afghanistan’s territory has steadily eroded as insurgent influence has climbed. That’s according to estimates from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, which was created by the US to monitor rebuilding efforts. Newly released figures offer a snapshot of the Afghan government’s unsteady grip on its own country: Militant groups including the Taliban and so-called Islamic State-aligned fighters now have control or influence in more than 14 percent of Afghanistan’s 407 districts, up from about 7 percent in November 2015, when SIGAR began tracking such things.

What does this mean for civilians, including the hundreds of thousands of refugees expected to return home – or to be pushed back home – this year? Afghans who have already returned find a country at war and their former homes in conflict zones, as we detailed this week from the border town of Spin Boldak. Recent returnees say they’re struggling with no land of their own, and no government plan to provide it. Others unable to return to their family homes head to rapidly multiplying tent settlements, where basic services are minimal or non-existent and humanitarian aid is often hard to come by.

Niger: Arrests in Agadez

Niger calls them mercenaries and wants them expelled. The UN reckons they were potential victims of slavery or extortion searching for safety. Either way, some 1,700 Sudanese refugees have left Libya for neighbouring Niger since December — moving south in search of more secure lives rather than north, a reversal of usual migration trends that was prompted by European Union efforts to stem migration. On 2 May, police in Agadez arrested around 150 Sudanese who were housed by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). It’s unclear why.

Journalist Eric Reidy was recently in Agadez reporting for us and said a number of refugees told him they’re worried that Niger’s government will deport them to Libya or Sudan. Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s interior minister, told Reidy that the Sudanese “came here because they expect to go to Europe.” None of the refugees Reidy spoke to in Agadez said that was their incentive. UNHCR says Niger is the only accessible, safe country for them right now. “Is there any corridor out of southern Libya that can offer… safety? No other corridor than Niger,” said Alessandra Morelli, UNHCR’s top official in the country.

Their presence is stoking fears that intensified conflict in southern Libya could lead to a large scale displacement crisis in northern Niger. Also in question is whether the UNHCR evacuation and resettlement mechanism for refugees trapped in Libyan detention centres is playing a role in drawing the Sudanese to Niger. Watch for our upcoming coverage, in which Reidy will explore these and other issues.

Myanmar: Lives upended, again

In January, we reported on early signs of renewed conflict in northern Myanmar, where clashes between the military and ethnic armed groups were quietly simmering – and civilians caught in the midst of things were out of the reach of aid organisations that face severe restrictions on access. Now, the conflict has escalated: in April alone, more than 5,000 civilians were displaced, and aid groups say recent clashes are the most extensive in years. This week, local and international humanitarian organisations called for a ceasefire and demanded that the government lift access restrictions. The UN’s rights watchdog for Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said she had “grave concerns” for the “sharp escalation in hostilities”. About 100,000 civilians have been displaced in northern Myanmar since 2011, when a ceasefire between the military and the Kachin Independence Army collapsed. They’ll likely soon be joined in long-term displacement by the 5,000 people whose lives were upended last month, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The prospect of quick returns, the federation said in a recent update, “is rather small”.







UAE: Undercurrents in Indian Ocean strategy

What do Yemen and Somalia have in common? If you said they’re home to some of the most vulnerable people on earth, you’d be right. The UN has estimated their combined humanitarian need at $4.5 billion for 2018. Their geo-strategic value might be an ingredient in their suffering, prompting international military involvement and political jockeying for influence. Which leads to another commonality: the UAE. The UAE’s Indian Ocean strategy appears to be in flux, with Yemen and Somalia playing (perhaps unwitting) roles.

In mid-April UAE pulled out of a military cooperation deal with Somalia, in a messy episode involving the looting of weapons and a planeload of $10 million in cash, according to Reuters. And this week, the UK’s Independent stated that the UAE is gradually taking over the Yemeni island of Socotra. Journalists who visited undercover say the UAE has already “all but annexed” the island, a poor, remote, and ecologically unique part of Yemen, off the coast of the Horn of Africa. Mainland Yemen has abandoned Socotra, the report notes, and the UAE’s ability to expand its influence was helped by the impact of cyclones in 2015. This week, the Gulf state further boosted its military presence there, according to Yemeni officials. Along with setting up a military base, the UAE has invested in social services and offers education and work opportunities in the Emirates. And the Independent adds that there may be plans for tourist resorts. It’s hard to gauge if there’s any resentment among residents of Socotra, but protests did break out when UAE officials tried to burn a shipment of qat, the stimulant leaf widely chewed all over the region. Oh, and in case you forgot: UAE is a key partner to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict.

Burundi: The human price of politics

Another vote, another call to boycott it, and fresh warnings that life may get tougher before it gets better for many in Burundi. Burundians go the polls on 17 May to vote on constitutional amendments that could see President Pierre Nkurunziza, who came to power in 2005, remain in office until 2034. The lingering effects of a devastating civil war that ended more than a decade ago, a moribund economy, a violent political crisis, and foreign aid cuts have conspired to leave one in four of Burundi’s citizens in need of humanitarian aid. Our analysis examines the toll the political tensions leading up to and perhaps following the 17 May poll may exact on Burundi’s people. And, as we’ll report next week, the growing tensions are adding to the anxiety of 170,000 Burundian long-term refugees in neighbouring Tanzania. They face increasing pressure to return despite promises of citizenship from a once-welcoming country, where many of them have spent their entire lives. One last thing before you read our analysis: In an announcement that just happened to follow World Press Freedom Day (see below), Burundi officials said local-language re-broadcasts by VOA and BBC are on hold for six months, according to a tweet from the state broadcaster, further limiting public access to information in the runup to the referendum.

Keep in mind:

Calling all humanitarian scholars

If you study humanitarian issues, this one’s for you: 1 June is the deadline to submit papers for the field’s leading academic conference, to be held 27-28 August in the Hague. The theme of the World Conference on Humanitarian Studies is “(Re-)Shaping Boundaries in Crisis and Crisis Response” — boundaries both symbolic and literal, obvs. Four themes and 60 panels (think “datafication” to “social museology”) will guide the proceedings at the fifth bi-annual gathering. What might all this achieve? There’s a panel for that: “What do Practitioners Really Need from Academics?”

And finally:

World Press Freedom Day: Horror and hope

We’re always humbled to mark World Press Freedom Day, with reminders of just how difficult it is for so many people to access fact-based, impartial information and how perilous it can be to report that information. A harsh reminder came shortly before the day was marked on Thursday, when a 30 April suicide blast killed nine journalists in Kabul, including veteran AFP photographer Shah Marai. The journalists were covering the aftermath of an earlier bombing when a second attacker struck. Marai’s images from his native Afghanistan gave the world a window onto life through civil war, Taliban rule and today’s instability. In a 2016 essay re-published after his death, Marai spoke frankly about life in Afghanistan, 15 years after the Taliban’s ouster. “There is no more hope,” he wrote: “… I have never felt life to have so little prospects and I don’t see a way out.” This New York Times piece offers more on Marai and his images. Our hope lies in the continued work of journalists around the world.

from OMEGA SSUUNA in Bujumbura, Burundi

BUJUMBURA, (CAJ News) – BURUNDIAN authorities and rights groups have taken off more than 900 children and adolescents living and working in the streets in the tense East African country.

The children and adolescents placed in custody include 940 boys and 19 girls.

Most of them have been released to the care of their families or non-governmental organisations.

Their release follows joint advocacy efforts from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners.

“Discussions with the government of Burundi and child protection partners are ongoing to identify longer terms solutions,” said a local spokesperson of UNICEF.

UNICEF is nonetheless facing funding problems for the humanitarian crisis in Burundi.

“Without additional funds, UNICEF will not be able to address the essential needs of children and women in Burundi,” a UNICEF spokesperson said.

The East African country of some 12 million people is beset by conflict after President Pierre Nkurunziza controversially secured a third term in 2015. Nkurunziza (aged 54) has led Burundi since 2005 when he succeeded Domitien Ndayizeye.

About 400 000 refugees, over half of them children, have found refuge in neighbouring countries, mainly Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda since Nkurunziza’s retention of power.

Operations to rid the children and adolescents off the streets are continuing.

Across the Great Lakes region, some 7.4 million people are uprooted. Uganda now hosts the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. About 74,500 Congolese crossed into Uganda from 1 January to 16 April, in the wake of new violence in the Ituri and North Kivu regions of the DRC, with an average of more than 680 refugees arriving from the DRC each day in March. The DRC is itself host to more than half a million refugees from other countries in the region. Meanwhile, there are unverified reports of Congolese returning to the DRC from Angola, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. In early April, 2,600 Burundians who had arrived from the DRC to Rwanda in March decided to voluntarily return to Burundi. However, some 432,000 Burundian refugees remain in neighbouring countries.

Sexual violence is a major concern in the region, much of it unreported and unaddressed. Many refugees arriving from the DRC in neighbouring countries report having endured sexual and gender-based violence. A recent assessment found that 10 per cent of newly arrived children in Uganda said they were raped during their journey.

Levels of hunger and malnutrition are at historically high levels in the DRC, with more than 4.6 million children acutely malnourished, 2.2 million of whom severely acutely malnourished. However, in a positive development, maize prices in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda in March were well below their levels at the same time in 2017. Heavy rains and floods in Burundi, Tanzania and Rwanda have left at least 60 people dead, others injured and many houses destroyed or damaged in March and April.

The region continues to battle simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases, mainly cholera. In the DRC, nearly 8,000 cholera cases have been reported in 2018 but the weekly incidence is declining. More than 2,000 cholera cases have been reported in Uganda since February, mainly among new arrivals from the DRC. Some 36 per cent of the cholera cases reported in Uganda are children under age 5. Tanzania is tackling cholera outbreaks in five locations and an outbreak of dengue fever is ongoing in Dar es Salaam, with 13 cases reported so far.",Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (March - April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/great-lakes-region-humanitarian-snapshot-march-april-2018
13,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope
14,burundi,"ISS: Talks remain ineffective as Burundi’s crisis continues

In early December 2017, a new round of talks led by the East African Community (EAC) was initiated in Arusha, Tanzania, with the aim of reaching an agreement to end the Burundian crisis.The country has, since early 2015, experienced political instability marked by violent clashes between government and opposition forces as well as the suppression of civil society, media and opposition groups – following President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office.However the mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results. It has highlighted the EAC’s weaknesses in responding to conflicts, and questions its capacity to design viable mediation processes and its capability to get member states to commit to peace efforts.The current talks are aimed at mediating and promoting dialogue among Burundians in order to find a solution to the crisis that has now lasted more than three years. Over this period, Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis. The EAC’s attempt to mediate the conflict follows extensive earlier initiatives by the African Union (AU).Working at times in concert with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the AU, the EAC has emerged as the primary de facto regional actor. Given that it has had relatively little historic mediation and conflict prevention experience, the reasoning behind this development must be more deeply considered.Some answers can be found in the early initiative of regional leaders, particularly Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, who may have acted out of interest with regard to their own national security. A common concern would be the potential spill-over effects of the Burundian crisis, especially in relation to the historical influx of Burundian refugees to neighbouring countries – and the consequent potential for greater regional instability.Regardless, several EAC initiatives have tried to establish a formal mediation process building on a number of previous conflict prevention efforts. For instance in 2014, the EAC and COMESA jointly deployed an AU Panel of the Wise mission, which consulted with various stakeholders in Burundi over a period of three months.This was followed by the submission of a legal opinion by the EAC Attorneys General to the EAC summit in 2015 which found Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term unconstitutional. Following this, Nkurunziza rejected Museveni’s 10-point exit plan. This resulted in Museveni withdrawing from the process, and Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania’s former president, assuming a leading role.Another issue that has soured regional relations – and has led to Burundi’s subsequent scepticism of the EAC – is that the 2015 coup that occurred shortly after the country’s elections, took place during an EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The EAC was already divided on how to deal with Nkurunziza – the non-attendance of various EAC summits by Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda was indicative of this. The EAC was criticised for its lack of cohesion in responding to the 2015 coup.Also, despite the fact that leaders like Museveni and Mkapa have attempted to engage throughout the crisis, these efforts have been largely undermined by insufficient consensus and initiative from EAC member states to effectively implement some of the regional body’s key decisions.More recently, in April 2018, the United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the lack of progress made by the EAC-led inter-Burundian dialogue. It called on key Burundian stakeholders to renew their commitment to the process by actively and unconditionally engaging in the process. Despite this, however, reports suggest that the Burundian government won’t engage at all before the country’s constitutional referendum, expected to be held on 17 May.The EAC’s recent engagements concerning Burundi highlight the growing significance of Regional Economic Communities in conflict prevention initiatives, while marking a new phase for the EAC in mediation processes. But they also show how conflict prevention efforts (in line with the principle of regional subsidiarity) have to be better designed in order to promote greater political will, consensus and buy-in of the mediation process by the parties.The lack of capacity and strategic coherence displayed in and among EAC member states in initiating and sustaining an effective mediation process for Burundi has made this clear.If the EAC is to continue engaging in mediation processes, internal reflection is important. This should critically identify how its own structures, approaches and internal mechanisms for reaching consensus can effectively assist countries in preventing conflict and sustaining peace.More importantly, with so many challenges and contradictions, a key question is whether the EAC is in fact fit for purpose to play such a central role in developing conflict prevention initiatives.Written by Gustavo de Carvalho, Senior Researcher and Priyal Singh, Researcher, Peace Operations and Peacebuilding Programme, ISS Pretoria.Republished with permission from ISS Africa .

The National Communications Council (NCC) said on Friday that the news organisations' operations would be suspended for at least six months for breaching the ""laws governing the press and ethics.""

The ban will come into effect on Monday, Karenga Ramadhani, the head of the regulator, told journalists in the capital, Bujumbura.

The NCC said the BBC invited a Burundian who made ""inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified [remarks], damaging the reputation of the head of state, to ethnic hatred, to political conflict and civil disobedience"".

VOA, for its part, was accused of spreading ""very tendentious"" information and hiring a journalist ""sought by Burundian justice"", according to AFP news agency.

French broadcaster Radio France International was also issued a stern warning in the same statement, and was asked to put a more vigorous verification process in place.

Two local broadcasters were also banned after the presidency complained their reporting was biased, the National Communications Council said.

The BBC and VOA both broadcast daily in the national Kirundi language and have amassed a large following over the years, especially in rural areas.

Amanda Bennett, VOA's director, denounced the regulator's action and said the news organisation's content would continue to be available through its shortwave channels, online and on FM transmitters located in neighbouring countries.

""Our audience members count on VOA to provide factual, unbiased and objective coverage of current events, so this ban deprives the citizens of Burundi of a trusted news source during a critical time in that country,"" she said in a statement.

""This is even more distressing coming only one day after World Press Freedom Day - a day calling for governments to remove, not impose, restrictions on the media,"" Bennett added.

Key referendum

While the country's constitution currently limits presidents to two five-year terms, a ""yes"" vote in the upcoming referendum on May 17 could allow President Pierre Nkurunziza, 54, to run for an additional two seven-year terms.

In concrete terms, this would mean that Nkurunziza, in power since 2005, could potentially rule until 2034 if he is re-elected in the next scheduled election in two years.

His run for a controversial third term in 2015 triggered a deep political crisis that has since seen 1,200 people killed and 400,000 flee their homes in the country of 10.5 million.

""Conditions for holding a credible referendum deteriorate as days go by,"" Leonce Ngendakumana, deputy chairman of the opposition party FRODEBU, the Front for Democracy in Burundi, told the Reuters news agency.

""The regime is now afraid of the media's force, which can derail their plan for the upcoming referendum and the 2020 elections.""

Also commenting on the regulator's announcement, Lews Mudge, a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's Africa division, called the broadcasting ban ""worrying"".

""This falls in line with the repression in Burundi as we head closer to the referendum,"" Mudge told Reuters.

""This is happening in the context of journalists getting threatened, those reporting on some of the oppression are being muzzled.""

Earlier this week, Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the US Department of State, denounced alleged acts of violence against the opposition and called on the Burundian government to respect its international commitments to protect freedoms of speech and association.

""We call on the government to respect Burundi's international legal obligations regarding the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association,"" Nauert said on Tuesday.

BUJUMBURA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Campaigns for a referendum on constitutional amendments started Wednesday in Burundi with political parties holding rallies throughout the land-locked African country.

Campaigns for the referendum, due on May 17, are allowed till May 14, according to a presidential decree.

The draft constitution provides for the creation of the post of a prime minister and only one vice-president, whereas the 2005 constitution provides for two vice-presidents. The prime minister is to be designated from the ruling party, while the vice-president will come from a different party.

It extends the presidential term from the five years provided in the 2005 constitution to seven years and allows the president to serve two consecutive terms.

The draft constitution will be passed if it is approved by over 50 percent of voters.

The ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party launched its campaign in Gitega, a central province where President Pierre Nkurunziza called on all citizens to vote ""yes"".

""I will also cast the 'yes' ballot during the constitutional referendum. The constitution is ours,"" he said.

""Adopting the constitutional referendum means kicking away colonizers and oppressors. We, Burundian citizens, have decided to have our own destiny in our hands. We want to prepare our own future and to construct our own nation without relying on foreigners,"" Evariste Ndayishimiye, CNDD-FDD secretary general, told a crowd of party members.

According to Ndayishimiye, the adoption of the draft constitution would mean an end to disorder in Burundi and the president would be able to choose the leaders to run the country.

Other parties also launched their campaigns on Wednesday.

The ruling party's allies, like the National Progress Union, the party of First Vice-President Gaston Sindimwo, the Front for Democracy in Burundi, and the Development and Peace Union also called for support for the draft constitution.

The opposition coalition Burundians' Hope, headed by First Vice-Speaker of the National Assembly Agathon Rwasa, began campaigning against the draft constitution in northern Burundi.

Around 5 million citizens have registered for the referendum and the general elections, the National Independent Electoral Commission said.

Nkurunziza was elected president by parliament in 2005 and re-elected by universal suffrage in 2010 and in 2015.

Burundi plunged into a crisis in April 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run his controversial third term bid, which he won in July 2015. His candidature, which was opposed by the opposition and civil society groups, resulted in a wave of protests, violence and even a failed coup in May 2015.",Campaigns for constitutional referendum kick off in Burundi - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/03/c_137153262.htm
18,burundi,"Burundi isn’t at war, but it has all the humanitarian hallmarks of a country that is.

Campaigning began this week ahead of a 17 May referendum that will allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. A government clampdown and an uptick in political violence are raising fears that the humanitarian situation will deteriorate further as civil liberties and the rule of law are eroded, prompting more people to join some 400,000 already seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.

Lewis Mudge, senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, said Burundians will continue to flee unless the political crisis is resolved.

“The current situation is worrying, as a lot of Burundi's problems are political at the root and at their base,” he said. “It's hard to put a timeline on it, but unless these political issues are resolved, I think it's very possible that we could see even more people fleeing the country, which would put an enormous strain on Burundi's neighbours.”

More than 3.6 million Burundians – about a quarter of the population of what is the world’s fourth poorest country – now need aid to get by, an increase of almost 20 percent over 2017, according to the UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan.

Some 2.6 million people lack reliable access to food, up from 1.5 million a year ago and 700,000 in April 2016. One in six children under the age of five are affected by chronic malnutrition, a condition that stunts growth and impairs mental development.

Aid agencies say they need some $142 million to meet needs this year. So far, only two percent of the appeal has been funded.

Much of this money is required to fill the gap left by a cash-strapped and ineffective state in providing basic services – countering widespread malnutrition and food insecurity, boosting primary healthcare (six million Burundians got malaria in 2017), and helping 190,000 internally displaced people (mostly due to natural disasters such as floods and landslides in 2016) and 65,000 refugees from neighbouring states.

Multiple causes

Burundi’s inability to care for its citizens has several causes: the lingering effects of a civil war that broke out in 1993 and only formally ended in 2006; an economy overly dependent on an inefficient agriculture sector; the political crisis ignited in 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to run for re-election in apparent violation of constitutional term limits; and the drying-up of the foreign cash on which the government long depended.

Such overseas assistance “is on a drip at the moment”, according to one aid worker, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of working in Burundi. Suspended donor support has led to a 72-percent cut in the government’s water and sanitation budget, increasing the risk of epidemics such as cholera, while funds for healthcare have been more than halved.

Hundreds of thousands of Burundians fled the country in the early stages of the 2015 political crisis, and continue to leave at a rate of up to 70 a day, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR.

Richard Moncrieff, Central Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, blamed government policy for the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

“Some progress was being made before the crisis in 2015 in food security and malnutrition, but this is being reversed partly because donors are pulling out – for which government is to blame also – and partly because government incompetence is being exposed by uncertainty, violence, and flight of human capital,” he said.

Government policies are also making it harder for humanitarian agencies to deliver aid in Burundi. The 2018 Response Plan pointed to numerous “legal and administrative restrictions [that] limit current and future operational efficiency” of aid agencies and their ability to travel into the interior of the country, except in extremely urgent cases. It added that legislation covering NGOs adopted in January 2017 undermined the independence of aid agencies.

These constraints “remain a key issue for humanitarian actors” in Burundi, Philippe Adapoe, Save the Children’s country director in neighbouring Rwanda, said.

Abuses rise as poll draws near

Wide-ranging human rights abuses committed by security forces and affiliated groups over the past few years led the International Criminal Court to announce in November that it would conduct an investigation into Burundi, even though the country became the first in the world to withdraw from the tribunal the previous month.

Alleged crimes against humanity cited by the ICC include: murder and attempted murder; imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty; torture; rape; enforced disappearance; and persecution. Depending on its findings, the ICC’s next step could be indictments and arrest warrants.

The run-up to the 17 May poll has seen a spike in abuses and threats against those opposed to the amendments.

Mediation efforts led by the East African Community have failed to reconcile the government and the opposition. “The mediation process still shows signs of being highly fractured and is yet to achieve tangible results,” the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies think tank said this week. “Nkurunziza’s government has shown an increasingly intransigent and uncooperative position towards resolving the crisis,” it added.

Many of Nkurunziza’s leading opponents now live in exile, while those still in Burundi who favour a “No” vote in the referendum are being cast by officials as enemies and criminals.

“Opponents, including elected officials are constantly harassed. The [Imbonerakure] militia which protects government bigwigs commits abuses in deplorable indifference of a judiciary which is a mere shadow of itself,” Dieudonné Bashirahishize, the head of a group of lawyers representing victims of the 2015 crisis, told IRIN. “Leaders of the ruling party keep calling for those who dare to push for a ‘No’ vote to be lynched.”

In one of several similar videos circulating on social media, a ruling party official says: “If you vote ‘No’, you know it will be death.”

And in a rare case of hate speech prosecution, a ruling party official was handed a three-year jail term on 30 April, days after publicly warning that opponents of the referendum would be put into pirogues on Lake Tanganyika (widely understood to mean opponents would be fed to the lake’s fish).

A group of “concerned citizens” tweeting collectively as @iBurundi, described this trial as a “sideshow” designed to cover up incitement to violence by some of the most senior officials in the ruling party.

Speaking out about abuses in Burundi carries great risks. On 26 April, human rights activist Germain Rukuki was handed a 32-year jail sentence after being convicted of taking part in an “insurrection movement” in 2015. Amnesty International said the charges were trumped up.

In 2015, the country’s most prominent human rights defender, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The monthly report for March 2018 prepared by the organisation Mbonimpa heads, APRODH, lists the most recent killings, arbitrary detentions, torture, beatings, and intimidation, and paints a picture of “growing” insecurity. Many abuses were allegedly carried out by the Imbonerakure - the ruling party’s powerful youth wing -, the police, and intelligence agents working for Nkurunziza’s government.

Lamenting that the prevailing climate of fear was preventing citizens from freely expressing their opinions, Burundi’s bishops said on 2 May that “the time is not right to make profound changes to the constitution”.

Night raids

Earlier this month, legislators approved a draft law that would give police the power to conduct night-time raids on people’s homes.

“The ruling party has just buried democracy in Burundi,” one opposition MP stated after the decision.

Jérémie Minani, the spokesperson for humanitarian issues in the CNARED opposition coalition – which has called for a boycott of the referendum – said the vote would “create chaos and worsen the suffering and misery of the population”.

He added that if the constitutional changes were adopted, it would spell the end of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement – signed in 2000 under the stewardship of Nelson Mandela to end the civil war and create a governance framework for sustainable peace.

The death of the accord would “certainly take the country back to a new civil war,” he warned. “The humanitarian consequences will be extremely serious: a total collapse of the economy resulting in increased poverty.”

The government, which denies there is a political crisis in Burundi and has contested the data in the latest humanitarian appeal as “fabricated figures”, turned Minani’s accusation on its head.

The opposition were the ones who “took the path of violence”, Interior Ministry Spokesman Terence Ntahiraja told IRIN. “They showed that on 13 May 2015,” he added, referring to the day of a failed coup attempt. “So I would ask them to change their behaviour, to abandon their intentions to create trouble in the country and to accept democracy and compete on the ground, [in the referendum campaign] and to win if the people so decide.”

Such an outcome is virtually impossible, said Bashirahishize, the victims’ lawyer. “It’s not a referendum, but a piece of theatre set up to enthrone the ‘Eternal Supreme Guide,’” he told IRIN, using the title the ruling party bestowed on the head of state in March.

What next?

Around 400,000 Burundians who fled since 2015 are still living in neighbouring states, but their welcome in two of them is wearing thin. Tanzania, which hosts some 60 percent of the caseload, no longer grants Burundians prima facie refugee status and is keen to step up the rate of repatriations.

Relations between Burundi and Rwanda have soured, with the neighbours accusing one another of backing rebellions.

Earlier this month, Bujumbura protested the deportation by Kigali of some 1,600 Burundian refugees, alleging they had been sent back for refusing to join an armed group formed to attack Burundi.

Lucy Hovil, senior research associate at the International Refugee Rights Initiative, said the situation facing those fleeing Burundi’s political violence was deeply concerning.

“Given [conditions in] the neighbouring countries to Burundi, this leaves them in a very difficult position because, as you know, many don't want to flee to Rwanda because it's not very safe… and neither is [the Democratic Republic of] Congo,” she said.

Robert Rugurika, a Burundian living in Brussels, told IRIN that the political repression in his home country deters many refugees from going back.

“There is nothing the regime can do to convince people to return if it does not stop oppressing Burundians. This won’t happen because the regime only survives by terrorising its own people and committing human rights violations,” he said. “People are still fleeing even now ahead of the referendum. Since assassinations and torture continues against opponents, people will continue to flee in large numbers.”

Bashirahishize said the international community “needs to pay more attention to the Burundian crisis, which is getting worse with time, so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe which risks getting worse with this referendum.”
