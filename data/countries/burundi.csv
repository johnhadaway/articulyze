0,burundi,"IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has successfully decommissioned four internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Burundi: Cashi, Gitaza, Mushasha I and Mushasha II. The four camps have been home to 5,022 people – including over 4,000 women and children – who were victims of natural disasters, including landslides and floods, that greatly impacted parts of western Burundi in 2015 and 2016. The decommissioning process began in January 2018 to improve the living conditions of IDPs in these displacement camps.

When flash floods swept her home away, Julienne, a mother of eight was among those displaced to Gitaza camp where she lived for two years. “We were in very poor conditions, in torn down tents as small as bird nests. With eight children, it was very tough,” she explains.

The natural disasters not only forced people to seek shelter in the camps, but also to abandon their initial source of livelihoods such as agriculture, commerce and other income-generating activities. They were robbed of their means to support their families, leading to widespread food insecurity and eventually, malnutrition. IDPs learned to adapt to their new lives to the best of their ability, despite the difficulties of the living conditions inside the camps.

“This place caused a lot of diseases, particularly amongst children. There was a lot of malaria, diarrhea, and lack of hygiene because of many people living together. It was very difficult,” says Julienne.

Although the camps were initially established as temporary solutions for the region’s displaced populations, budgetary constraints and various external challenges caused them to remain active well beyond the intended sixmonth duration. The tents quickly became tattered as they bore the brunt of Burundi’s harsh weather, including torrential rain and wind. The deterioration of the tents left families exposed and contributed to the spread of diseases within the camps.

With the support of the Swedish government, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and humanitarian actors, more than 5,000 of Burundi’s most vulnerable IDPs are receiving shelter support, aid packages, transportation and reintegration assistance – providing them not only with a roof over their heads but more importantly, giving them hope for a better tomorrow.

Julienne could not hide her joy at having a new home. “I am now excited to have a house, a room for children, a room where I can relax and a room for guests. I was no longer able to host visitors as there was no room for them,” explains Julienne. “We are now very grateful that we are going to have enough space, a toilet for each household and enough security.”

A palpable sense of delight could be felt at the ceremony held to mark the end of the camp decommissioning process. “I am so grateful and joy overflows my heart and I feel exceeding peace to see this work happening,” said Julienne.",Decommissioning Burundi’s IDP Camps: A Story of Hope,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/decommissioning-burundi-s-idp-camps-story-hope

2,burundi,"With Burundi leaving the Peace and Security Council this month, the AU must act decisively to stabilise the country. By Ndubuisi Christian Ani for ISS TODAY.

First published by ISS Today

Burundi will hold a referendum in May 2018 on a constitutional amendment that could enable President Pierre Nkurunziza to stay in power past 2020. The proposed changes would weaken the representation of minority groups in Parliament and further threaten the Arusha peace deal that ended the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war.

The amendment process has been marred by inadequate consultation and an absence of political freedom. With Burundi’s tenure on the Peace and Security Council (PSC) ending this month, the African Union (AU) has the opportunity to take a firm stand and end its lacklustre response to the Burundi crisis.

The constitutional amendment is Nkurunziza’s second attempt to change the constitution, after he failed in March 2014. He contested and won the 2015 elections owing to a controversial court ruling. This secured his third term in office and plunged the country into political turmoil that has so far undermined international responses.

Former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, the East African Community (EAC) facilitator of the stalled inter-Burundian dialogue, has warned against the constitutional review, saying it could increase instability in the country.

The proposed changes provide for a limit of two presidential terms, but each term is increased from five to seven years. This could allow Nkurunziza to run for re-election in 2020, and potentially again in 2027, despite having served three terms under the current constitution.

The constitutional amendments have also been criticised because they would undercut the representation of minority groups in parliament. The changes could replace the two-thirds majority required to pass legislation with a simple majority.

The two-thirds provision was part of the ethnic and political power-sharing component of the Arusha peace agreement. Although the rule on 60% Hutu and 40% Tutsi representation in the National Assembly remains, the simple majority erodes the built-in mechanism that allows Tutsis’ input on critical matters.

The draft constitution also replaces the provision for two vice presidents – one from the opposition and the other from the ruling party – with one vice-president and one prime minister. The vice-president, who has limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the president, but the influential prime minister will be appointed by the president from the ruling party.

The creation of the prime ministerial position is apparently aimed at appeasing individuals in the ruling National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) who want the presidential position for themselves, but are hamstrung by Nkurunziza’s grip on power.

The AU called for consensus among all stakeholders on the proposed constitutional reforms in Burundi, but to no avail. Since May 2017, when Nkurunziza appointed a 15-member committee to draft the proposed changes, the process has been shrouded in secrecy. Critics of the process have reportedly been harassed and arrested by the government.

Through all this, the government has avoided engaging Parliament in an attempt to offset criticism from both opposition members and members of the ruling party who oppose the review. Moreover, the ruling party doesn’t have the parliamentary majority needed to unilaterally approve the constitutional amendment.

The AU’s unclear position on constitutional reviews in general has not helped matters. Under the AU’s watch, countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Chad and Djibouti have altered their constitutions based on an individual’s quest to stay in office.

The AU has tools to encourage democratic changes of government, and should use them. Article 23.5 of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance prohibits “any amendment or revision of the constitution or legal instruments, which is an infringement on the principles of democratic change of government”.

While the AU has called for adherence to the Arusha peace deal and broader consensus, it has not spoken out about the implications of the review process on the African Charter. Burundi has signed but not ratified the charter, and so isn’t legally bound by it. By signing, however, Burundi is required to refrain from acts that undermine the charter’s purpose. Burundi is also party to several AU declarations as well as the protocol establishing the PSC, which calls for sanctions in cases of unconstitutional changes of government.

The charter mandates the AU Commission to “evaluate compliance by States Parties” on matters relating to democracy, elections and governance. This has not happened and the commission has generally been non-committal about constitutional review processes. In many cases, these revisions produce the same result as the power grabs by military regimes through coups d’état.

While coups are unacceptable to the AU, there is as yet no precedent when it comes to regimes that stay on thanks to constitutional changes.

The AU has also made contradictory statements that send the wrong message to Burundian authorities about democratic values and human rights. A recent example is when the AU in January condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to open an investigation in Burundi.

Burundi is the interim chair of the AU’s open-ended ministerial committee on the ICC – a committee established to follow up on the AU’s concerns about the court. Over the years, the AU has allowed the “pen holder” (the chair) to set the agenda and tone of its decisions. As committee chair, Burundi pushed for the AU to reject the ICC investigation, with other AU member states endorsing the decision for the sake of African solidarity.

This is unfortunate because African states hold different opinions in other forums such as the UN and the ICC – where some have supported the court and expressed dismay at Burundi’s withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi has also refused to allow observers, including those of the AU and UN Human Rights Council, to operate freely in the country.

Since January 2016, when the AU Assembly rejected the PSC’s decision to send a mission to Burundi, the AU’s overall capacity to address the crisis has been limited. The PSC has focused on broader thematic issues, with fewer meetings on country-specific situations like the Burundi crisis.

Burundi’s two-year tenure on the PSC ends in March 2018, and this could present a unique opportunity for the AU. During its membership in 2016 and 2017, Burundi was able to dilute discussions on its own instability. Indeed, the PSC’s most recent meeting on the issue – in October 2017 – came a full year after its previous meeting on Burundi.

The October 2017 meeting produced a communiqué that was devoid of decisions on how the AU could help solve the crisis. This was not surprising, since Burundi chaired the PSC at the time, and the “pen holder” situation prevailed.

With Burundi out of the PSC, the AU can deliver on its obligation to defend human rights and democracy in the country. This should include a concerted effort to impose targeted sanctions “against all the Burundian stakeholders whose actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the search for a solution”, as agreed by the PSC in 2015.

The PSC should also use its mandate under the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance to take a firm stand on the ongoing constitutional review. DM

""It is a great relief, the SNR (National Intelligence Services) finally realised it was really a table tennis club ... and that they were training for an upcoming regional tournament,"" the source said on condition of anonymity.

A police source confirmed the players had been released on Monday night a few hours after their arrest.

Government critics took to Twitter to slam the ""paranoia"" of Burundian authorities.

Police spokesperson Pierre Nkurikiye had announced the arrest of the 21 people including ""an army officer, two police officers, a retired army officer and civilians.""

""The population alerted security forces that people were often meeting at this house and that they had plans to disrupt security,"" he said.

The incident comes in the run-up to a constitutional referendum on May 17 that could keep President Pierre Nkurunziza in power until 2034.

Nkurunziza ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution, triggering violence that left at least 1 200 people dead and sent more than 400,000 Burundians fleeing abroad.

MUSASA, Burundi – UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has called on the international community to give increased support to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi and as they step up efforts to find lasting solutions to the protracted refugee situations of the Great Lakes region.

Grandi said that the Central African neighbours, all of whom shelter large numbers of refugees from each other, must work closely together and renew efforts to put an end to the result of more than two decades of inter-linked and overlapping conflicts.

Praising these countries’ generosity, Grandi assured all sides that the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR was on hand to support dialogue and pledged to raise the issue of increased funding a conference on the humanitarian situation in DRC, including Congolese refugees and internally displaced, in Geneva on Friday.

“There are several countries in this region that continue to host a large number of refugees. The total number is about 700,000 and I think there has to be more recognition of this effort that has now gone on for many years,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared as he wound up a week-long visit to the region.

“The generosity of these host countries and host communities who are sharing meagre resources needs to be recognized. This generosity should not be taken for granted, these countries need support. What I have seen here is that still some very basic needs here are only partially met,” Grandi added.

During his visit Grandi met Congolese refugees in Rwanda and Burundi, Burundian refugees in DRC and Rwanda, and Rwandan refugees, preparing to go home after more than 20 years, in Congo. All told him similar things. They wanted peace and security so they could work and provide an education for their children.

Many spoke of the hardships caused by large population movements and insecurity – inadequate housing, insufficient food, overstretched educational and health facilities. Most said they wanted to work and be self-reliant.

In Burundi, he met a group of young refugees who referred to him as ‘Papa’ and asked him to try and provide them with more opportunities.

Grandi said their concerns pointed up the need for a more inclusive approach. Future support must include the refugee dimension until durable solutions are found.

“The future is theirs to build. And we need to help them to do that, not just hand out relief items and food. But also help them learn a trade, help them to have a better education, help them to have better mobility in the country so that they can go out and look for employment,” he said.

He added it was crucial to have an holistic approach and also provide development to the host communities.

“Humanitarian assistance continues to be important, but we really need to make a step change in the type of support that we provide. We need to encourage more self-reliance, more inclusion in the local communities,” he said.

“We have to also help the local community so that their own economy can absorb an additional number of people of people, and they too can benefit. These are poor areas and they are sharing meagre resources. We thank them for their hospitality,” he added.

Ruzigama Gentil, 22, who borrowed smart white pants and matching shirt, to meet the High Commissioner, said he had arrived in Burundi from Congo’s troubled South Kivu area more than a decade ago aged 11.

He said he had not lost hope, but was frustrated with the lack of opportunities facing him.

“Even if I succeed and get my High School diploma, I can’t find work and don’t have the means for more study. There is no work for us here, when you work it helps you in life,” he said.

All returns must be 'voluntary', says Grandi

In Goma, Grandi met Rwandan refugees waiting to return to a country they left more than 20 years ago, members of a total Rwandan refugee population in DRC of some 220,000.

They told how it was difficult to go to assembly points for onward transfer to the border crossing points without risking attack from “negative forces” opposed to peace.

Grandi welcomed news that some Burundian refugees were returning from Tanzania to Burundi, but underlined that all returns everywhere in the region must be voluntary.

“I met the president of Burundi and many of his officials and they said that everybody is welcome back. I told the president this is good, but what are needed are two things. One is security; people need to be confident that there is security. And two, a good programme of reintegration so that people can rebuild their lives in their own country,” he stressed.",UNHCR chief calls for increased support for Congolese refugees,http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2018/4/5ad07f294/unhcr-chief-calls-increased-support-congolese-refugees.html
8,burundi,"(Kinshasa, 10 April 2018) – CARE International is calling on donors to significantly increase their commitment to the humanitarian crisis in the DRC ahead of this week’s pledging conference taking place in Geneva.

Labelled a “silent humanitarian tsunami”, as the humanitarian situation in the DRC deteriorates dramatically, this week’s meeting will seek to raise $1.68 billion, nearly four times the amount secured in 2017.

“Every day, people across Congo are dying because of conflict and violence, and right now there’s not enough resources to help them all,” says David Bisimwa, CARE’s Emergency Coordinator in DRC. “This year, we’re expecting around 13 million Congolese will need humanitarian assistance, that’s one out of every six people. “

The scale of need in DRC is enormous. According to the United Nations, more than 7.5 million Congolese do not have enough food to eat, an increase of 30 per cent over 12 months, and more than 2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. Girls and women have suffered horrific sexual and gender-based violence, and outbreak of diseases, including cholera, measles and malaria, affect tens of thousands of people every year.

A surge in violent conflict and intercommunal tensions forced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them women and children, to flee their homes in 2017.

Escalating violence, particularly in the country’s east, has seen an exodus of Congolese seeking refugee in neighbouring countries in recent months. Refugees from DRC have sought shelter in Angola, Burundi, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

“DRC is a very complex humanitarian emergency, and more than anything people need peace. But for now we need to make sure people survive. Without sufficient funds it is impossible for us to reach all the people in need,” says Bisimwa. “Right now, aid agencies cannot reach all of the seven and a half million Congolese who don’t have enough food to eat.”

9,burundi,"“Dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi,” underscored the Security Council in a statement read-out by its President at a formal meeting Thursday afternoon.

In the statement, the Council also “strongly” condemned human rights violations committed in the country, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, forced disappearance, torture and harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and journalists.

The Security Council also reiterated its “regret” at the Government’s decision to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) and called for a swift solution through dialogue between the UN human rights arm and Burundi in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its mandated activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions.

Also in the statement, the 15-member Council voiced concerns over the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation in the country and, in the context of Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, called on those Governments to ensure that the return of the refugees is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

According to estimates, some 180,000 people remain displaced within Burundi and more than 429,000 have sought refuge across its borders.

10,burundi,"President Trump started dominating the American news cycle before he was even elected, and the soap opera that has unfolded from his twitter feed alone since then has kept headlines and newsrooms constantly focused on his unpredictable behavior. I assumed that a few months after the election, the drama would eventually subside and a new version of political normalcy would take place, making room for a wider variety of breaking news. It didn’t really.

A friend and colleague, Sulome Anderson, who has been covering the middle east as a foreign correspondent for the last seven years, told me that after the elections she began having so much trouble getting editors to accept pitches not directly related to Trump’s antics that she closed up shop all together and is focusing on writing her next book on domestic issues.

This anecdote speaks to a larger media trend. With a disproportionate amount of news squarely focused on one person in the United States, what stories are being pushed from the headlines?

A report from a major global NGO offers some insights into one area where important stories are being largely ignored: humanitarian crises.

Using the media monitoring services of Meltwater Group, the humanitarian group CARE analyzed global online news coverage (in English, French and German) of all 39 natural or manmade disaster affecting at least 1 million people in 2017, then listed the 10 disasters receiving the least media coverage.

According to that metric, these were the five most under-reported crises of 2017, and they are still happening right now.

1 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

North Korea has stayed in the global spotlight for increasing political tensions and weapons testing and has long been regarded as one of the repressive authoritarian states in the world. Kim Jong Un is known for his ability to generate fearful obedience from his citizens with a creative array of horrific threats; from forced labor in harsh and sometimes fatal conditions to executions. But what has been drastically underreported in the last year is that unprecedented number of people who are going hungry. The UN estimates that 70 percent of the population, or 18 million people, are food-insecure and reliant on government aid. To make things worse, last year North Korea experienced its worst drought in 16 years, exacerbating an already dire food shortage. With tight control of its borders keeping out aid organizations and journalists, it’s almost impossible to capture how many are actually receiving the urgent food aid they need.

2 Eritrea

Geographically isolated and bordered by two countries infamous for famine and conflict, the East African country of Eritrea rarely makes headlines. When it does, it’s commonly in relation to border tensions. What isn’t making headlines is that over 700,000 Eritreans are in crisis struggling to feed themselves and their families, marking the severity of a prolonged drought catalyzed by El Niño two years ago. Over half of all children in Eritrea today are stunted, a sign they are not getting the nutrients they need to cognitively and physically develop in order to live healthy and productive lives. Additionally, widespread gender-based violence including rape and female genital mutilation leaves women and girls disempowered and living in fear. Conscription into military service serves as a pretext for population control and enslavement. Because of the desperate state of the country, over 400,000 migrants have left their home country in the past decade, making Eritreans one of the largest groups of refugees in Europe and Africa.

3 Burundi

Struggling to emerge from a 12 year ethnic-based civil war, political unrest has sponsored sever economic instability devastating those living in the central African country. The future political state of Burundi as the current leader, President Nkurunziza, has indicated he intends to run again in 2020, potentially extending his term 14 years. Opposition forces and civilians are bracing for even more violence in response to this possibility. Over 2.2 million people currently are not able to sufficiently feed their families. The country is experiencing rising food prices resulting from economic and agricultural decline and disruption of markets and trade. The ripple effect of lack of basic services and food shortages extends into massive health issues, like the outbreak of malaria in 2017 that infected over 6.6 million people with 2,875 deaths reported in the first eight months of the epidemic. Persecution and violence have driven over 400,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Over 200,000 people remain displaced inside Burundi.

4 Sudan

The genocide in Darfur may be a historical event no longer worthy of headlines, but the impact of 13 years of war now leaves over 5 million people on the edge of survival. As climate change exacerbates agriculture conditions, the country also faces droughts and floods, making it even harder for people to feed their families. The current fuel crisis has driven the cost gallon of gasoline up to over 140 Sudanese pounds ($7.70) a diesel gallon on the black market, leaving farmers without fuel to power water pumps necessary for irrigation. Power outages from scarcity of fuel are paralyzing daily life in parts of the country as well.

5 Democratic Republic of Congo

With over 120 armed groups currently operated in Eastern DRC alone, recent reports state over 4.5 million people are currently displaced inside the Congo. Political instability and clashes between soldiers and militia continue to escalate, a result of presidential elections that were scheduled for November of 2017 have been repeatedly postponed. Like many humanitarian crises, this lack of stability burdens women and children most. Rape is often used as a weapon of war, and reports from the field show over 2 million children are suffering from acute malnutrition.

SECURITY COUNCIL

8223RD MEETING* (PM)

The Security Council today expressed deep concern over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue and the lack of engagement by the Government in that process.

In presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7, presented by Gustavo Meza‑Cuadra (Peru), Council President for April, the Security Council welcomed and supported the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue based on the Arusha Agreement.

Expressing deep concern over the slow progress of the dialogue and calling for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in that process, the Council said it was crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections.

The Security Council further stressed that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi and called upon the United Nations, the African Union and the East African Community, among others, to coordinate their efforts in assisting stakeholders in setting outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement.

Underscoring its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the Council commended the host countries for their efforts, and called upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

Further, the Council strongly condemned all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi and reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 3:08 p.m.

Presidential Statement

The full text of presidential statement S/PRST/2018/7 reads as follows:

“The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the political situation in Burundi, the slow progress of the inter‑Burundian dialogue led by the East African Community and the lack of engagement by the Government of Burundi in that regard. It recalls its statement S/PRST/2017/13.

“The Security Council welcomes and supports the renewed commitment by the African Union and the East African Community, expressed at the thirtieth African Union summit and the nineteenth East African Community summit, to a peaceful resolution of the political situation in Burundi through an inclusive dialogue on the basis of the Arusha Agreement of 28 August 2000 and the Constitution of Burundi, and reiterates its support to the facilitation led by former President B. Mkapa under the mediation of President Museveni. The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the slow progress of this dialogue and calls for all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in this process. It is crucial that all parties, most especially the Government, commit to the East African Community‑led process and reach an agreement ahead of the 2020 elections. The Security Council further stresses that the dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi.

“The Security Council underlines the utmost importance of respecting the letter and the spirit of the Arusha Agreement, which has helped to sustain a decade of peace in Burundi, and expresses concern that the situation prevailing in Burundi has seriously undermined the significant gains achieved through the Arusha Agreement, with devastating consequences for Burundi and the region. It urges the guarantors of the Agreement to meet their obligations in this regard, to ensure that the entirety of the Agreement is adhered to.

“The Security Council calls upon the United Nations, the African Union, East African Community, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the guarantors of the Arusha Agreement to coordinate their efforts of assisting Burundian stakeholders settle outstanding issues in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement. The Security Council notes with appreciation the readiness of the African Union to deploy the high‑level committee of Heads of State on Burundi.

“The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Burundi. The Security Council stresses the importance of implementation of the Arusha Agreement, calls upon the Burundian authorities to initiate all political initiatives through a broad consensus of all stakeholders, which requires a political and security environment that induces the confidence of all political actors and, in this regard, expresses its strong support for the African Union decision at its thirtieth summit. The Security Council expresses the need that these conditions be fully implemented in advance of planned political initiatives.

“The Security Council calls on States in the region to contribute to finding a political solution for the situation in Burundi, refrain from any interference, including through supporting the activities of armed movements in any way, and to respect their obligations under international law, and recalls in this regard commitments of the States in the region under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

“The Security Council notes its expectation that elections scheduled for 2020 in Burundi will be free, fair, transparent, peaceful, fully inclusive, with the participation of all political parties, and will ensure the full and equal participation of women throughout the process. It also underlines that considerable improvements to the political and human rights situation, in particular regarding fundamental freedoms, including for freedom of the press and of civil society actors such as human rights defenders, and progress on reconciliation are necessary to enable credible elections.

“The Security Council underscores its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 180,000 internally displaced persons, 3.6 million people in need and more than 429,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighboring countries, and commends the host countries for their efforts, and calls upon Governments in the region to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity.

“The Security Council notes that a number of bilateral and multilateral partners have suspended their financial and technical assistance to the Government of Burundi, in view of the situation in Burundi, and encourages bilateral and multilateral partners and the Government of Burundi to continue their dialogue with a view to the Government of Burundi creating conducive conditions for resumption of the assistance. The Security Council commends the assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral partners to alleviate the humanitarian situation and calls on Member States to continue to provide support to respond to the humanitarian needs in the country.

“The Security Council strongly condemns all violations and abuses of human rights in Burundi, whoever perpetrates them, including those involving extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including those concerning children, forced disappearances, acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment, harassment and intimidation of civil society, including human rights defenders, women’s organizations, and journalists, restriction of fundamental freedoms, as well as indiscriminate use of grenade attacks, including against civilians.

“The Security Council reaffirms the primary responsibility of the Government of Burundi for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable. It urges the Government of Burundi to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations, to adhere to the rule of law, to bring to justice and hold accountable all those responsible, including members of the security forces and violent actors affiliated to political parties, for crimes involving violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights, as applicable, including those involving sexual violence and all violations and abuses against children.

“The Security Council notes the steps taken by the Government to withdraw the bans of some civil society organizations, cancel some arrest warrants and release a number of detainees following the presidential pardon on 31 December 2017. The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to take further steps to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s Constitution and its international obligations.

“The Security Council reiterates its regret at the decision by the Government of Burundi to suspend all cooperation and collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has been present in the country since 1995 to strengthen Burundi’s rule of law institutions, and calls for a swift solution through dialogue between OHCHR and the Government in order to enable OHCHR to fully resume its activities, including its monitoring and reporting functions, and fulfill its mandate. The Security Council recalls the commitments the Government of Burundi undertook during the thirty‑sixth session of the Human Rights Council to re‑establish full mutual cooperation with the Human Rights Council and OHCHR, including full cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner in Bujumbura, and to accept the visit of a team of three experts from the Office of the High Commissioner to collect information on the human rights situation in Burundi. It notes that discussions regarding revisions to the draft memorandum of understanding between the Republic of Burundi and the United Nations concerning the updated terms for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi have been ongoing for over a year and urges the Government of Burundi to take steps to swiftly finalize the agreement with OHCHR without further delay.

“The Security Council reiterates its concern over the significant delays in the deployment of the African Union human rights observers and military experts. It supports the African Union call for the rapid signing of the memorandum of understanding relating to the activities of the human rights observers and the military experts of the African Union, which will allow the African Union human rights observers and military experts to fully operate in the country in fulfilment of their mandated responsibilities.

“The Security Council acknowledges the contribution of Burundian peacekeepers serving in United Nations- and African Union‑led peacekeeping operations and reiterates the importance of upholding the standards of the United Nations.

“The Security Council urges the Government of Burundi to reengage with international partners, especially the United Nations, in a constructive manner based on mutual trust. It reiterates its full support to the Secretary‑General and his Special Envoy in their efforts to engage and work with the Government of Burundi to help overcome the current political impasse and foster an inclusive reconciliation process. It further calls on the Secretary‑General and the Government of Burundi to expeditiously finalize and implement the status of the mission agreement for the Office of the Special Envoy, in order to work with the Government of Burundi and other concerned stakeholders to support the East African Community‑led inter‑Burundian dialogue and in the areas of security and rule of law, to engage with all stakeholders to the crisis, and work with all Burundian parties to develop confidence-building measures, to improve the human rights and security situation, and foster an environment conducive to political dialogue. The Security Council welcomes the active engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission Burundi Configuration as a viable platform for dialogue between Burundi and its partners, using a holistic approach to address the political and socioeconomic situation.

“The Security Council is determined to continue to closely follow the situation in Burundi.”

12,burundi,"Situation

Political crisis, alleged human rights abuses and civil insecurity since April 2015 have displaced hundreds of thousands of Burundians and caused a sharp decline in economic activity, living conditions and food security. One in four Burundians is food-insecure, and one in six children younger than 5 years of age suffers from chronic malnutrition.

As of March 2018, ongoing political unrest in Burundi had internally displaced more than 173,000 Burundians, while approximately 428,000 have fled as refugees into nearby countries, including Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda, according to the UN. Additionally, violence in eastern DRC has driven roughly 65,000 Congolese refugees into western Burundi. Following an agreement between Burundi, Tanzania, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in August 2017, more than 13,000 Burundian refugees have voluntarily returned to Burundi. The UN anticipates a further 54,000 will return by the end of 2018. Many displaced and returnee populations face challenges in accessing land to farm and other means of income generation; as a result, they continue to depend on external assistance.","Burundi: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - April 11, 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/burundi-food-assistance-fact-sheet-april-11-2018
13,burundi,"Background

In the evening of Wednesday the 24 January 2018, refugees fleeing fighting in South Kivu started streaming in Makamba and Rumonge Provinces aboard boats. Since August 2017, the security and humanitarian situation has significantly deteriorated in South Kivu, more specifically on the axis Sebele ‐Kikonde‐Kazimia, the southern coast of Kazimia (Yungu, Talama) and the coastal communities of Ubwari in the Fizi area. On-going clashes between the army FARDC (Democratic Republic of Congo Armed Forces) and the Mai Yakutumba rebel armed group—claiming to be from the National People's Coalition for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNSPC)—are behind this deterioration of the situation since January 2018. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is alarmed by a recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is driving large numbers of Congolese to flee eastwards to neighbouring Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. Thousands of children, women and men have abandoned their homes, in the midst of intensified military operations against Mai-Mai armed groups in South Kivu province. Almost 7,000 people have crossed to neighbouring Burundi and an additional 1,200 to Tanzania. It is believed that many more are displaced inside South Kivu in difficult conditions without shelter or food.

Refugees that ACT members have spoken to say they fled forced recruitment, direct violence and other abuses by armed groups. Others say they fled in anticipation of military operations and out of fear. It is imperative that people fleeing the violence are allowed safe passage, and that humanitarian access to the internally displaced is facilitated. Those refugees seeking to reach Burundi are mainly doing so by crossing Lake Tanganyika on small fishing boats. As of 28 January 2018, according to authorities in Burundi, 8,152 persons have crossed Lake Tanganyika and settled into Burundian provinces of Rumonge and Makamba (this includes 6,934 Congolese and 1,218 returning Burundians). On 29 January 2018, 823 additional persons arrived in Burundi. It is therefore estimated that a total of 9,078 people crossed to Burundi so far. The most probable scenario of the humanitarian community (confirmed by UNHCR) is a total number of 15,000 Congolese refugees and 2,000 Burundians fleeing DRC. The worst-case scenario is as high as 50,000 to 60,000 persons moving into Burundi due to the crisis in DRC.",ACT Alliance Concept Note BDI181: Emergency Assistance to Congolese Refugees in Burundi,https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/act-alliance-concept-note-bdi181-emergency-assistance-congolese-refugees-burundi
14,burundi,"RWANDA – Drive for half an hour by four-wheel drive down a crater-strewn red dirt track off the RN3 highway to Tanzania and you descend into a vast, flat valley.

Flowing north through this plain is the Kagera river, the natural boundary separating Rwanda from its eastern neighbour. On the western side of the river, the metal roofs of thousands of brick huts glint in the sun. In less than three years, the Mahama camp has mushroomed to accommodate people fleeing Burundi.

Rwanda’s southern neighbour is now the unhappiest place in the world, according to last month’s UN annual World Happiness listing of 156 nations.

Misery around Africa’s Great Lakes

Misery appears to have a permanent home in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. Rwanda might be on the road to an improbable recovery from the 1994 genocide. But the cruelly mis-named Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) lies directly to the west, where there is a surge in sexual and ethnic violence in its lawless eastern regions. Strife in this vast country has directly or indirectly claimed six million live in the past 20 years.

Tutsi-vs-Hutu ethnic violence in Burundi

Burundi has experienced the same Tutsi-vs-Hutu ethnic violence that consumed Rwanda, which probably explains the willingness of Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s government to help people fleeing its small southern neighbour. Some people mumble that Mr Kagame doesn’t show the same empathy for refugee camps bordering DRC, into which he has launched several heavy-handed incursions in search of genocide perpetrators, and in which Rwanda has participated in two devastating wars. Reports last month that Rwandan troops crossed the border and killed five Congolese soldiers highlighted the ongoing militaristic foreign policy of post-genocide Rwanda — President Paul Kagame’s response to what he sees as the utter failure of democracy and international law to save his people.

Mahama – a model refugee camp

Nonetheless, aid workers speak of Mahama, with a population of 64,000 and growing, as an example of how to plan refugee camps. There are no tents, only small brick houses. There are health centres and washing facilities powered by solar panels. Plans are afoot to install permanent electricity supplies. UNHCR and the World Food Programme have a large presence here. But there’s no doubt who’s really charge. Senior UNHCR officials keep schtum. “The Rwandan government decides what happens here. It sees this place as a model – more of a town than a refugee camp. Authorities always say that when they’re responsible for camps – but this one does seem to be better than others ones,” says one NGO worker.

“Refugees need something to do. They need employment”

In the oppressive heat, scores of young Burundians sing while they pass buckets of cement in a line and lay bricks in the construction of a large building, on the western edge of the camp, funded by the Maison Shalom charity that became available when it won the 2016 Aurora humanitarian prize. The building will be a workshop where refugees can make clothes and earn money. “These people need something to do. They need employment,” the charity’s founder, Marguerite “Maggy” Barankitse, 62, says. She supports Rwanda’s assertiveness with NGOs: “I wish Kagame were the President of Burundi. Here, he’s thrown out over 100 NGOs. We don’t need people simply buying cars and organising workshops. Kagame said: ‘If you can’t get real results, we don’t need you.’”

Telling NGOs how to spend the money

She sucks her teeth recalling how a Belgium NGO once expressed concern to her that by helping with the development of re-education unit of Burundian convicts she would be putting the staff of that legal charity “out of jobs”. Her colleague and adopted son, Richard Nijimbere, a Burundian orphan, notes that in Burundi 40 per cent of funding comes directly from the state. In Rwanda it’s 80 to 90 per cent. That means Rwanda has more control and is able to spend the money where it’s needed rather than have things decided by officials in Geneva, he says.

People’s lives can be changed for the better

The problems in this part of the world seem vast and sometimes in intractable. But people like Barankitse and her colleagues remind us that there is much good in the world. And that people’s lives can be changed for the better. Salvator Ndikumagenge, 21, and Eric Naacayisaba, 24, both fled to the camp after violence and death threats in Burundi in 2015. Now they’re studying civil engineering at the University of Kigali, thanks to Maison Shalom funding, that became available when it won the 2016 Aurora humanitarian prize. They sing the praises of the Maison Shalom charity. “It’s beyond my ability to express how grateful we are,” Ndikumagenge says.

Hope: something priceless

But Ndikumagenge can’t see himself returning to Burundi in the immediate future. Neither can his friend. Both have left their parents and siblings in their home country who they are unable to contact. When the term time ends, and students return to the Mahama camp, a three and half hour drive to the east from Kigali. Mahama is much safer place than where they’ve come from. But life here is hard. Up to 12 people share huts consisting of just two rooms. “We get 8 kg of maize and 2 kg of beans, says Ndikumagenge: “How is that supposed to last a month?” He’d love to get a job in Rwanda once he’s graduated. But he knows that will not be easy. “I’ll try. It’s difficult for Rwandans to find work so it’s going to be more difficult for me.” Most things we take for granted are absent, or in short supply, for Burundians here. But help from Rwanda, and Maison Shalom, has given them something priceless: hope.

Marguerite Barankitse

With a personality as bright as her traditional African clothing, Marguerite Barankitse is a luminary in humanitarian circles. In Burundi in 1993, Barankitse, a Tutsu, saw her family killed by Hutu extremists.

A day later she was made to watch the slaughter of 72 Hutu friends she had tried to shelter from revenge attacks. She managed to save 25 children and formed the Maison Shalom charity, dedicated to the protection of young Burundians. By 2015, her outspoken criticism of human rights abuses put her on the authorities’ hit list and she fled to Rwanda.

She is now supported by the Kigali government,in helping Burundian refugees. She won the inaugural Aurora Prize, in 2016. This humanitarian award, dedicated to the Armenian genocide, and promoted by celebrities such as George Clooney, gave her a $100,000 to help fellow Burundians fleeing violence in their country.

The money has been spent radically upgrading the Maison Shalom facilities in Kigali and paying the students university fees. Already the Aurora Prize money has enable 365 homeless Burundian refugees to graduate in the past two years. As the winner, Barankitse was able to distribute an additional $1 million to others charities working in Rwanda, DRC, Ethiopia and Brazil.","Rwanda might be healing after the 1994 genocide, but Biblical-scale catastrophes continue in the region",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/rwanda-might-be-healing-after-the-1994-genocide-but-biblical-scale-catastrophes-continue-in-the-region/
15,burundi,"Nairobi - Burundi police said on Tuesday they had arrested 21 people suspected of holding meetings to ""disrupt security"", while those close to the suspects claim they were merely gathering to play table tennis.

""Twenty-one people including an army officer, two police officers, a retired army officer and civilians were apprehended by police on (Monday) night at a house in the Carama district"" of the capital, police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye told state radio.

""The population alerted security forces that people were often meeting at this house and that they had plans to disrupt security,"" he said, adding that an investigation was under way that would allow him to elaborate on the charges against them.

Several people close to those arrested told AFP they belonged to a table tennis club, officially registered with the Bujumbura municipality, and met there several times a week to play.

A high-ranking security official told AFP on condition of anonymity that ""all those arrested have been placed in SNR (National Intelligence Services) cells and are being interrogated"".

The feared SNR, which falls directly under President Pierre Nkurunziza, is considered one of the main tools of repression in Burundi.

""The leader of this tennis club showed their authorisation to the agents but the Burundi secret service is very nervous with the upcoming constitutional referendum because they fear opponents will try disturb security,"" he said.

Nkurunziza, 54, has set May 17 as the date for a referendum on a controversial constitutional reform that could keep him in power until 2034.

Nkurunziza ran for a third five-year term and was re-elected in 2015 despite a two-term limit under the constitution, triggering violence that left at least 1 200 people dead and sent more than 400,000 Burundians fleeing abroad.

16,burundi,"Silvie Bugonza* was barely 16 when she became pregnant. A hardworking student at Budahunga communal school, in northern Burundi’s Kirundo Province, Bugonza had dreams of working with the United Nations to help children frequently displaced during war. Instead, she was expelled from school because of her pregnancy, her dreams crushed. Now 19, the young mother wakes up early to feed and bathe her daughter. Then she straps the girl onto her back as she marches through dew-laden grass to fetch water.

She isn’t alone. Bugonza is part of a largely ignored social epidemic wrecking the lives of young girls and women across Burundi. Perched on rolling mountains and plateaus, the Central African country slightly smaller than Maryland has one of the highest teen fertility rates in the region — 50 percent higher than neighboring Rwanda. That is translating into an increasing number of teenage pregnancies. Burundi’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed that 8 percent of adolescent girls were pregnant in 2017, up from 7 percent in 2010–11.

I wish I could go back to school. Silvie Bugonza, a teenage mother expelled from school

But that’s only part of the problem. Burundi’s high rate of teenage pregnancies is increasingly finding company in another disturbing trend — girls leaving school because of pregnancies. Across the country, more than 12,000 schoolgirls are estimated to have dropped out of school due to pregnancy between 2009 and 2015, according to data from Burundi’s Ministry of Education. Once out of school, they’re even more vulnerable. The teenage conception rate in Burundi among young uneducated girls (23 percent) is almost four times the number (6 percent) for those with secondary or higher education, the data shows. And the challenges aren’t a rural phenomenon. Bujumbura, the capital, has a teenage pregnancy rate of 12 percent — a figure that climbs further to 15 percent for Ngozi, the country’s second-largest city. Though some young mothers opt out of school simply to manage newborns, many others like Bugonza are expelled or suspended from school in a conservative nation where out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a social taboo. Either way, these pregnancies mean an early end to hopes and dreams of a better future.

“There’s nothing good about being a mother,” says Bugonza. “I wish I could go back to school.”

In Mpanda village, which neighbors Bugonza’s hamlet, 18-year-old Lydia Minani* is idly lying on an old mattress, cuddling her baby as mild rain sprinkles on the flimsy tin roof of her shack. On the walls, pieces of cardboard are tacked up on the crumbling mud wall to give the baby some warmth, as a torn curtain hanging over the window blows in the wind. Minani was suspended from Gahinga secondary school in 2015 after she became pregnant. Her father accuses her of compromising their family values.

Bugonza lives with a supportive aunt now — but she too believes family taboos were responsible for her predicament. Her mother, she says, never spoke to her openly about sex and protection. That lack of education about sex and reproductive health is a key contributor to the current crisis, suggests Georges Gahungu, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) agency representative in charge of programs in Burundi. “Many girls who become pregnant don’t know their menstrual cycles,” he says.

While limiting education and career prospects, teenage pregnancies also expose girls to often fatal childbirth complications, say health experts. “Underage girls who become pregnant in their teens are twice as likely to die during childbirth,” says Jeanne Niyongabo, a gynecologist and obstetrician based in Bujumbura.

At the root of the crisis is a deeply patriarchal social structure, where girls — like Minani — often face rejection from their families when they become pregnant, says local residents and experts. “Girls do not have the power to make decisions about their health and life,” says Philippe Ntahombaye, professor of anthropology at the University of Burundi. Many teenage mothers are often forced into marriage, especially in rural areas — suggesting a deeply ingrained stigma around early pregnancy, says Ntahombaye.

To curb spiraling teen pregnancies, Burundi’s government and international organizations have launched multiple initiatives to disseminate education on sex and reproductive health. In 2016, the country’s Ministry of Education launched a Zero Pregnancies at School campaign jointly with the UNFPA to ensure that “no girl gets pregnant.” But activists say the crisis continues to spiral, and won’t come under control until the use of contraceptives, including condoms, spreads widely among sexually active youth. “Parents should not be ashamed to openly talk with their children about sex and the use of contraceptives,” says Diane Alphonso, a women’s rights activist based in Bujumbura.

That remains a challenge, because of cultural taboos that surround acknowledging sexual activity. Many teenage boys shun condoms, calling them too much of a “hassle” — and there’s no social pressure on them. That’s restricted to girls. “When a girl becomes pregnant, she is expected to drop out of school due to the perception that schoolchildren are not supposed to have sex,” says Ntahombaye.

Many school officials remain hesitant about distributing free condoms in the classroom. “I don’t think a school is the right place for distributing condoms,” says Japhet Nyandwi, a teacher at Lycée Communal school in Bujumbura. “We don’t want to encourage students to have sex.” Even parents willing to let their children use condoms are ashamed to be seen getting them for their kids.

Systemic support for teenage mothers remains a distant illusion at the moment, though the start of a debate in Burundi could signal the first stirrings of change. For thousands of girls, that change can’t come too soon.

Rwanda Tuesday announced a ban on importation of sheep, goat and their products from neighbouring Burundi following reports of a viral disease outbreak.

The Minister of Agriculture, Gerardine Mukeshimana, in a statement said the Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) that primarily affects goats and sheep has been reported in Burundi’s provinces of Gitega, Mwaro, Kirundo and Karuzi.

“Movement of livestock including sheep and goat and their products; meat, hides and fertilizers from Burundi are hereby banned,” the minister said in the statement.

She appealed to livestock farmers, traders, veterinary officers and security agencies in the country and at the border points to be vigilant.

The ministry added that the ban was based on a report about the disease outbreak that was done earlier by Burundian veterinary services and sent to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

According to the FAO, PPR, also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants.

Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of an animal heard, and kill between from 30 and 70 per cent of infected animals.

The FAO said the virus does not infect humans.

My work focuses on the non-cases: armed political actors which have committed little sexual violence and have a history of disciplining their members' sexual behaviour.

This effort seems ridiculously extraneous in the current climate. Just in the last years, Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Daesh) in Syria and Iraq have systematically abducted and abused thousands of women and girls.

However, as researcher Elisabeth Jean Wood has demonstrated, sexual violence patterns vary because armed groups are different. And their diverse politics, strategies and institutional ""DNA"" is evident in their varied wartime conduct.

In another context, the #MeToo reckoning has uncovered the wide, wide array of sectors that have ignored complaints about perpetrators, while nurturing hostile and abusive climates of impunity. Humanitarian actors in particular, seem to be making innovative reforms. Even as new allegations arise, agencies of the United Nations (UN), for example, are establishing new measures. The UN has disseminated information about its zero-tolerance policy to its field personnel and established a task force to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. It has increased transparency, and we now know more about incidents inside the UN. In the last quarter of 2017, reporting mechanisms have received 40 allegations across the organisation.

But for all that to have an impact, the UN and other actors must also embrace fresh ideas about gender norms and sexuality, and translate these into behaviours that can be modelled and transmitted to new recruits, middle-managers and old hands. That's stopping sexual predation before it happens. That's prevention.

After all, ragtag rebel armies in poor countries, with unequal gender relations and limited resources, have done it.

During my research in Burundi and Uganda, I have learned that sometimes rebel and insurgent groups arise in societies with dreadful levels of gender inequality, and yet train their fighters to scorn sexual coercion. To them, rapists should be shunned or executed.

Learning from ragtag armies

In Burundi, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People–Forces for National Liberation (FNL) was rarely associated with wartime rape or similar abuses during or after the civil war. This is particularly striking if we consider that the coinciding and bordering genocide in Rwanda, between similar ""ethnic"" groups and with comparable causes of conflict, included widespread sexual violence against Tutsis committed by Hutus, by the then government-sponsored militia group known as Interahamwe. Palipehutu-FNL also attacked Tutsi civilians. However, its fighters did not permit or order sexual violence.

Civil war research contends that armed actors that do not rely on civilians for support are likelier to abuse them. This is an important clue, also demonstrated by scholars such as Jeremy Weinstein. Movements that prevent sexual violence may be motivated to ensure good relations with the local population for pragmatic, operational reasons. They need shelter, food, information and recruits. But going further, how do they achieve sexual discipline over their fighters?

In the 1980s, Uganda's National Resistance Army (NRA) launched a rebellion with a handful of weapons and very few men. It defined itself as a people's army, and depended heavily on support from the country's peasant population. It is believed to have committed little to no acts of sexual violence. Commanders and civilians I have interviewed tell me that the group's leaders presided over justice on behalf of civilians and exercised discipline against its fighters. The NRA code of conduct instructs members to refrain from shouting at, abusing or insulting the public, while also asserting that rape was punishable by death.

'Many women are wives or daughters of somebody, somewhere'

Over 30 years later, former NRA members have recited to me the saying they learned in the bush: ""Many women are wives or daughters of somebody, somewhere"".

Let's pause here. Other armed groups have allowed rape as a practice and/or committed it as a strategy for war purposes. Erin Baines has convincingly explained how another rebellion (also in Uganda), the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) used forced marriage and policed sexual relations by its members as a way to give birth to its own ethnically based nation. And other armed movements can be indiscriminate and opportunistic. They may not order sexual violence, but it is still a pronounced part of their conduct. For these types of rebel groups, women's bodies are the staging ground for advancing the insurgency, or just part of the spoils of war.

But according to the code of the NRA, all women deserved the same treatment as their own sisters or daughters or wives. The leadership sought to nurture a sense of empathy based on these roles, to get its fighters to relate to females through this lens. Rape would not only harm women and girls but rupture important relationships with the local population and the wider community. (This is not particularly empowering for women's sexual autonomy, since it still positions female bodily integrity in relation to kinship bonds. But that is another matter.) The emphasis on ""family"" makes sense across diverse cultural contexts in many parts of the world.

Indeed, this command had an important impact. It shaped minds and hearts and helped the men remain true to an ideal of sexual discipline not seen in everyday life. They could not engage in unsanctioned relationships or sexual predation. It was reinforced by specific notions of masculinity, particularly that a ""real man"" would not coerce sex, and in relation to a political ideology of liberation of Ugandans.

The NRA's war took place before the current existing data-collection efforts and parameters of the Sexual Violence in Conflict Dataset. Still, I doubt we would have been able to add it to today's list of armed actors with a pattern of sexual violence. Nevertheless, we can learn something about preventing sexual violence from such actors.

Religion as a preventive tool

Strikingly, the FNL fighters in Burundi also developed confessional practices. Cohorts would name and shame one another in group prayers, for instance.

Fighters who engaged in sexual activity were viewed as weak or opportunistic, and this coincided with a culture of Christian purity. The majority of Burundians practice some form of Christianity, and the political elite in the country often have been vocal proponents of this faith. The leaders of FNL were no different, and they and their followers were born-again Christians of one conviction or another. Its members referred to themselves as God's army. Commanders as well as foot soldiers were held equally accountable to values, often formulated and practised within a religious context.

Finally, in the hierarchy of the group's gender norms, the best men were those that could cast aside sexual conquest in the service of chivalry and their brotherly bond to the group. And a new ideal was born.

Stigmatizing sexual predation

My research shows that prevention is possible, even in the most startling contexts. The rebel armies I've examined have not had perfect track records. They used capital punishment and fell well short of my feminist standards. They promoted masculinities that continued to position women as dependant on male protection. Moreover, without active and persistent stigmatisation of sexual coercion, it seems that the longevity of prevention was short-term.

I do not doubt there are survivors of abuse by members of these groups. But the pattern is of institutional prevention, not predation. These insurgents crafted masculine norms of soldiering that emphasised empathy for women and girls, and respect for wider societal bonds. Life in these rebel armies included value-based measures for shaming and punishing predators, not promoting them.

Stopping sexual violence before it happens is possible. Despite other factors that could induce these armed groups to permit their fighters' assaulting civilians (and co-combatant females), they chose to invest in creating new norms and behaviours, and ultimately, preferences for sexual discipline. And it worked.

Imagine then, the depth of change that is possible elsewhere.
