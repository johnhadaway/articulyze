The ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front coalition on Tuesday voted in the 42-year-old, a retired lieutenant general from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, to take over the government.

Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country and has had the fastest growing economy on the continent for the past decade, but protests that began in 2015 have caused the biggest threat to the EPRDF since it took power in 1991.

“The House of People’s Representatives will hold an extraordinary session on April 2 to swear in Dr. Abiye Ahmed,” the body said in a statement.

His predecessor Hailemariam, from the small Wollayta ethnic group, resigned last month after sustained protests in the Oromiya and Ahmara regions where people say they are politically and economically marginalized.

Abiye will now face pressure to appeal to legions of disaffected youth and to push through promised reforms.

The event was initially scheduled for Saturday. The statement did not give a reason for the postponement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/ethiopia-to-swear-in-new-prime-minister-on-april-2-idUSKBN1H52A3
1,ethiopia,"On 13 March, the government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners officially released the Humanitarian and Disasters Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. Ethiopia is facing a third successive exceptional year of drought-related humanitarian crisis. Acute needs are expected to continue in areas assisted through the 2017 response. Most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities, compounded by the underperformance of the 2017 autumn rains; the prevalence of risk factors for communicable disease outbreaks such as AWD and measles; as well as large scale displacement due to drought and conflict. The Appeal seeks US$1.66 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash and non-food assistance, mainly in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country. Activities and requirements are presented against three pillars, reflective of a disaster risk management approach.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-2018-humanitarian-and-disaster-resilience-plan-hdrp-snapshot-march-2018
2,ethiopia,"The Advox Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world.

On March 26, Ethiopian authorities arrested journalists Eskinder Nega and Temesghen Desalegn, Zone 9 bloggers Befekadu Hailu and Mahlet Fantahun, and De Birhan Blog author Zelalem Workagegnehu. All have previously been jailed for their work as journalists or human rights activists.

They weren’t the only ones to be targeted during the week of March 26. A local source of Global Voices, who asked not to be named, estimated that more than 20 journalists, academicians, and prominent opposition figures were arrested. Civil society advocates from around the world called for the release of 11 journalists in a letter issued by the Association for Human Rights in Ethiopia.

Nega, who is a prominent political journalist, had previously spent nearly seven years behind bars on terrorism charges. He was released from prison several weeks ago, on February 14, only to be re-arrested this week.

Nega sent a message from prison describing the “inhumane” condition in which they are being held:

…our condition in prison is inhuman, to say the least. Better to call it jam-packed than imprisoned. About 200 of us are packed in a 5 by 8 meter room divided in three sections. Unable to sit or lay down comfortably, and with limited access to a toilet. Not a single human being deserves this, regardless of the crime, let alone us who are detained unjustly. The global community should be aware of such a case and use every possible means to bring an end to our suffering.

Temesghen was taken from the prison to Zewditu hospital “due to severe back pain he developed during his jail time in recent past.”

Hailu and Fantahun have both worked with the Global Voices community. In 2014, they were arrested along with seven of their blogger and journalist colleagues, all due to their participation in the Zone9 collective blog, where they wrote about their government's obligations to human rights and constitutional law.

After 12 weeks of arbitrary detention, the writers were charged under Ethiopia’s anti-terrorism proclamation and spent more than a year behind bars. Shortly before a state visit by then-US President Barack Obama in July 2015, some were released without explanation. The rest were acquitted and released in October 2015.

Since then, both bloggers have lived under close surveillance by state authorities.

All this has taken place in a tumultuous political environment. Since mid-2015, thousands of Ethiopians have begun to demand more political freedoms and social equality and a stop to government land grabs in the Oromia region, which is home to Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. The government response has been brutal: Hundreds have been killed, thousands have been arrested, and critical voices — both on and offline — have been systematically silenced.

In late 2017, Ethiopia’s ruling coalition began to splinter, resulting in political fallout and the January 2018 resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn as prime minister.

So far, 7,000 people have either had charges against them dropped or been pardoned — but as of this week, some of those released have been re-arrested. Their fate remains uncertain.

Next stop on the Cambridge Analytica fallout train: India

Data scientist-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie, the former head of research for Cambridge Analytica, told UK parliamentarians that the Indian National Congress, a prominent opposition party in India, was a client of the controversial data mining firm.

Allegations that other Indian political parties (including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party) had contracts with the UK company are also circulating.

In his deposition before a UK parliamentary committee on March 28, Wylie described various activities of the data mining firm, which has dominated headlines since mid-March, when journalists from The Observer and The New York Times revealed that the firm exploited Facebook users’ behavioral and psychographic data — without their knowledge — in service of the US presidential campaign of Donald Trump.

In his deposition, Wylie was critical of the company’s work in India and in Kenya, where Cambridge Analytica was hired by the ruling Jubilee party. In a tweet, he compared it to “modern-day colonialism.”

Cambridge Analytica was also involved in election data mining with the intent to undermine elections in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation.

Data doubts hit Japan

On the heels of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s chief cabinet secretary told reporters on March 27 that the Japanese government is investigating unlawful use of personal data gathered from Facebook. Japan’s Personal Information Protection Act prohibits companies from sharing user data with third parties without explicit consent from users.

Turkey tightens online video laws

Turkey’s parliament passed a new law that empowers the country’s broadcast regulator to impose a licensing scheme for online video platforms (such as YouTube, Periscope and likely Facebook) that will allow the regulator to monitor and sanction platforms that do not promptly comply with content removal requests from the government. All platforms will be required to obtain a license from the regulator — those that fail to do so will risk being blocked altogether.

Syria creates special courts for cybercrime

Syria’s Council of Ministers passed an amendment to Cybercrime Law 17/2012, which penalizes “anyone who incites or promotes crime through computer networks” with prison sentences ranging between one and three years and a fine of up to US$1,500. The amendment creates a specialized court of first instance for cybercrime cases, whose rulings can then be challenged at the Court of Appeal. Previously, individuals charged under the Cybercrime Law could be tried in any court, including military tribunals.

Myanmar activists push back against defamation law

Responding to Myanmar’s notorious criminal defamation law, local tech hub Phandeeyar has launched an online database called #SayNOto66d, in partnership with a coalition of 22 civil society organizations. Under Article 66D, a person can be fined and/or imprisoned for up to three years if they are found guilty of “extorting, coercing, restraining wrongfully, defaming, disturbing, causing undue influence or threatening to any person by using any Telecommunications Network.”

According to the database, 61% of those who have been prosecuted under the law were “raising awareness of issues and holding others to account.” Half of the cases involved criticism of the state. All those who have been charged under the law have also been convicted.

3,ethiopia,"Overview

Given the recurrent nature of climate-driven humanitarian crises in Ethiopia, Government and partners have agreed that a significant shift in approach is required.

This Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan(HDRP) represents a first step towards the development of a multiyear planning framework that will seek to: increase the quality and predictable delivery of required multi sectoral humanitarian response; mitigate future needs in areas that experience recurrent climate induced shock; support the strengthening of national service provision to address chronic and acute needs; and, the recovery of communities affected by drought and conflict.

The Government and partners are working to establish an overarching vision and strategy for resilience and recovery in many of the recurrently drought-prone areas.

Whilst this document focuses primarily on immediate response requirements for 2018, it also lays out the basis for a three-pillared model that will allow for further planning and development investments, in line with a disaster risk management approach.

Pillar 1 concerns prevention and mitigation: Some limited activities in this regard are already reflected here, particularly those that humanitarian partners believe to be immediately critical in the context of the required humanitarian response in 2018 – for support via humanitarian or development funding used flexibly. The need for broader, large-scale resilience-type investments are described in many of the sector chapters, though not yet presented in detail.

Pillar 2 concerns preparedness and response. Largely relief commodities and partners presence in hot-spot areas.

Pillar 3 concerns National System Strengthening and Recovery:

Practically all humanitarian assistance in Ethiopia is delivered with or through national systems at point of delivery; some activities to increase the capacity of these systems within Line Ministries at Federal and local levels (particularly that enable the overall response) are included here, along with some limited, sector-specific recovery activities. As with Pillar 1, major recovery investments are not yet presented in detail, though some early recovery activities are incorporated.

Ethiopia is entering a fourth year of exceptional drought emergency. In 2017, severe drought conditions continued in lowland, mostly pastoral areas, rendering hundreds of thousands destitute and displaced. The southern autumn rains again underperformed, though not at the level of ‘drought’, meaning that levels of food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the lowlands remain high. Meteorologists, including the National Meteorological Agency (NMA), are predicting that the current La Nina phenomenon may lead to reduced performance of spring rains, particularly over southern and eastern lowland areas.

The well-managed, Government-led, lifesaving response will need to be sustained across southern and eastern parts of the country through much of 2018. Across highland areas there was a generally strong meher harvest, with some pockets of poor performance. Disease outbreaks are further expected to continue in 2018.

Additional humanitarian needs have arisen due to conflict, with 857,000 Ethiopians displaced over the past year around the border areas of Oromia and Somali Regions. Many of those displaced over the course of 2017 are likely to require continuing relief assistance and recovery support in 2018.

Indicative modelling and projections show that humanitarian needs and financial requirements are likely to remain similarly high for the following two years (2019-2020), though could be mitigated through the introduction of some of the shifts in strategic and operational approach described here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-2018-humanitarian-and-disaster-resilience-plan

It was only a few days that Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation divulged that the recent devaluation of Birr by 15 percent is leading to increasing export and remittance earnings over the last few months. Particularly the latter has also increased as many people start sending money via formal channels.

Remittance is usually considered as low-hanging fruit for country's forex demands. The amount of remittance earning sometimes equates with and other times exceeds the country's export earnings.

But, still 70 percent of the total remittance transaction takes place via informal channels, as sources show.

And this would pose possible risks of foreign currency shortage to the country, making fierce fight against this channel a timely task.

Black market is even fomenting some of the main challenges of the country facing in terms of contraband. The government also stressed that illicit and black market has been source of rivalry and conflicts in some corridor of the country.

According to Developing Market Associates (DMA) Global Chief Executive, Leon Isaacs, sending money to the sub-Saharan Africa is too expensive compared to other parts of the world. Sending money to Ethiopia is still lower than other African countries but it is still higher than the average outside of the continent, he wrote.

If it is reduced less than 2 up to 3 percent from the average 10 percent, customers will start to use more formal way, according to him.

Informal ways still stands a prominent way for Ethiopians to send money back home, according to Isaacs. Informal flows not only present a loss of foreign exchange for the government, but also reduce the opportunities to encourage investment while complicating the effort of tackling money laundering and terrorist financing.

As it may seem rational for some reasons that the Ethiopian Diaspora tend to use informal channel due to lack of access to services in the sender and receiver markets. High direct and indirect costs associated with formal channels force people to send remittance informally in addition to the regulatory barriers for undocumented migrants to use formal ways.

Some countries do not allow undocumented people to send money formally even if they wish to. In case of Ethiopia, many Ethiopians could be face the same fate to send money legally. In this regard, Ethiopia, under many conditions can, negotiate agreements with other countries to find the means for its illegal migrants to be documented in the first place and then send money back home via formal channels.

To address the problem some banks including Commercial Bank of Ethiopia are trying to open agents oversees.

""In a move to discourage the use of informal channels and encourages formal ones and facilitates issues relating to money transfer cost, local banks are made to rule out commission payments. Remittance money service providers are also made to post their fees on the website of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) so that the senders could choose the best available option,"" NBE Senior Adviser Elias Loha told The Ethiopian Herald.

According to him access to bank is improving through time. The volume of remittance has already reached four billion USD. Diaspora's engagement in terms of investment and remittance is seeing upward trajectories as well.

NBE is making policy adjustments to encourage the use of formal channels of money transfer. Of course, the informal channel has significant share at this time. ""We need to improve accessibility and reliability of banking services there by increasing the number of people using informal ways to switch to formal ones.""

Introducing new methods of money transfer with the help of modern technology should be at the top of agenda of institutions working on the area, he added.

Diaspora Engagement Directorate Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Demeke Atenafu for his part stated, the move emboldens the Diaspora to send money through formal channel and increase the volume of remittance .

""One of the priorities of our embassies is to strengthen link between money transferring agents and Ethiopian banks. The competition will reduce transaction costs and the Diaspora can also have access to bank services easily,"" he said.

Conducting awareness raising works and showing the risks involving in using informal channels are also part of the objectives of the embassies in addition to effort of strengthening the link between the money transfer agents where the Diaspora reside and the local banks. This would widen alternative banking services for the Diaspora community, he indicated.

By strengthening the measures taken so far, there are more rooms to increase remittance income and use it for the socio-economic development of the country and its investment activities.",http://allafrica.com/stories/201803300424.html
5,ethiopia,"The United States Senator for Florida, Marco Rubio, has waded into the recent re-arrest of Ethiopian journalists and other political prisoners, urging the Ethiopian government to release them.

Tweeting the AP report on the re-arrest, Rubio’s PressShop wrote on Friday: “Ethiopian journalist Eskinder Nega, who was recently released after 7 years in prison on false charges, was just re-arrested.

“I urge the Ethiopian government to release him and other political prisoners. #expressionNOToppresion.” The Senator joins a long list of other rights groups – local and international, piling pressure on the regime to release the detainees.

I urge the Ethiopian government to release him and other political prisoners. #expressionNOToppresion.

They were arrested for attending an unauthorized gathering and use of a banned national flag. The gathering in question was a welcome party for recently released prisoners in the capital of Amhara regional state, Bahir Dar.

Aside Nega, others picked up during the gathering were, Andualem Aragie, leader of Ethiopian opposition UDJ party, journalist Temesgen Desalegn and bloggers Befeqadu Hailu and Zelalem Workagegnehu.

The multiple-award winning Nega who was jailed in 2011 on terrorism charges is on record to have said he was ready to return to jail if the democracy was not respected.

“I am prepared to go back to prison. What I am not prepared to do is give up. We will continue to press and struggle for freedom of expression and democracy,” the 47-year-old said in an interview days after he was freed.

According to regulations of the Command Post overseeing the latest state of emergency declared in mid-February, people are prohibited from gatherings that do not have the approval of relevant authorities.

On the subject of the flag, the gathering used the Ethiopian plain flag, which does not have the blue disc contrary to law.

A proclamation regarding the use of the Ethiopian flag prohibits the display of the flag without the emblem at its center and those contravening the law could be sentenced to up to a year and a half in prison.

Some Ethiopian opposition groups have on several occasions expressed their displeasure with the new flag arguing that the ruling coalition, EPRDF blue disc star symbolises ethnic division.

6,ethiopia,"An Ethiopian lawyer and lecturer with the Keele University in the United Kingdom says the re-arrest of journalists and politicians back home is a sign that the government was clueless about how to exit the current political crisis.

RFI

Awol Allo in an interview with Radio France International () held that the development which took place over the weekend was, however, not a surprise to most watchers of Ethiopian politics over the past few years.

He said for the government to order the fresh detention of these people was a sign that it lacked the ideas to steer the country away from the current crisis. Ethiopia is without a substantive Prime Minister and is currently under a six-month state of emergency imposed on February 16.

“… the fact that this is happening at a time that we have a state of emergency and these are highly popular individuals, very high profile politicians re-arrested again says very clearly (I think) to everyone that is watching that the government has no clear vision, clear policy to get out of the current crisis,” he said.

And they are taking such a long long time to appoint a new Prime Minister shows very clearly that the former Prime Minister wasn't really in control at the time and that there were other people who call the shots behind the scene.

About a dozen politicians and journalists were arrested during a gathering in the town of Bahir Dar in the Amhara regional state. A lawyer associated with some of them said they were held for displaying a banned national flag and meeting without permit contrary to state of emergency rules.

According to Allo, the conflicting and contradictory signals sent by the regime all but lacked logic given the basis for the release of the re-arrested group and the incidents that followed their release.

Commenting on the lack of a Prime Minsiter, he said it was indicative of the fact that outgoing Hailemariam Desalegn was not in control over the last five years. “The fact that the ruling establishment didn’t care much about the resignation of the Prime Minister, he added.

• The Government of Ethiopia and the UN presented the 2018 humanitarian and disaster resilience plan (HDRP) to member states.

• The HDRP seeks at least $1.6 billion to provide emergency and long-term assistance for 7.88 million people affected by drought, floods and conflict.

Gov’t and UN brief Member States on Ethiopia humanitarian situation

On 21 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and the UN presented the 2018 humanitarian and disaster resilience plan (HDRP) to member states in Geneva. The HDRP seeks US$1.6 billion to provide emergency and long-term assistance for 7.88 million people affected by drought, floods and conflict with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with non-food assistance. According to the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Ethiopia Mrs. Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, all the needs to be addressed through the HDRP are immediate, and acute and massive.

Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator. Ms. Ursula Mueller who chaired the briefing reaffirmed the Secretary-General’s remarks at the High-Level event held in Addis Ababa in January 2017 that ‘Solidarity is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of justice and self-interest.’ The ASG reminded member states of the need for early action as the alarm bells are ringing by the end of March. “Today, the World Food Program’s ability to cover the emergency food needs of 1.8 million people in the Somali Region is in peril. Some $50 million is required to cover the costs of two rounds of emergency food assistance for those affected by drought – and, increasingly – conflict along the Oromia-Somali regional border. Supplies to treat moderate acute malnutrition are also at risk should timely and adequate funding not be secured.” The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

Following the decision by the National Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group (DRMTWG) to re-activate the DRM Gender Working Group (DRMGWG), the DRMGWG held its first meeting on 20 March 2018. The group discussed and agreed on producing a draft action plan by 28 March 2018 that will help to facilitate, coordinate and advocate for gender mainstreaming throughout the entire humanitarian program cycle. The working group will support humanitarian actors to develop tools and systems for implementing gender dimensions while addressing the humanitarian needs of some 7.88 million people, including 1.2 million conflict-induced IDPs and close to 500,000 climate induced IDPs- most of whom are women and children. The group will work to ensure that the concerns of women and children are considered as an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs in the humanitarian sector.

On Tuesday, the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front voted Dr. Abiy Ahmed the new chairman of the four-party coalition, replacing Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn after his February resignation. Abiy, the 42-year-old leader of the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization and former lieutenant general, will officially be sworn in as prime minister on April 2.

Author Amy Copley Research Analyst and Project Coordinator - Africa Growth Initiative

The elevation of Abiy, who is largely viewed as a reformer, was greeted positively by many. Hopes are high that Abiy’s election will bring calm to increasing unrest across the country. He will be the first head of state in modern times from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, whose region has experienced major strikes, protests, and violence in recent years. According to Bloomberg, following the ruling party’s selection of Abiy, yields on the country’s eurobonds due 2024 fell markedly by 22 basis points to 6.31 percent, suggesting an increase in the bond’s value and a surge in investor demand for the asset compared to the previous week.

So far this year, Ethiopia has seen both progress and retreat in the protection of human and political rights. In January, in response to the unrest in the Oromia and Amhara regions, the government released 114 political prisoners as well as senior opposition leader Merera Gudina. Charges against another 414 people were also dropped. These releases were done “in order to improve the national consensus and widen the democratic platform,” according to then-Prime Minister Desalegn.

Then again, Ethiopia has been under a state of emergency since Desalegn’s resignation. Since then, the country has seen an increased crackdown on journalists and protesters, with 12 people arrested on just Monday, March 26, for violating a ban against using a prohibited national flag and illegally gathering without the knowledge of authorities.

MTN’s initial public offering is the largest ever in Ghana; Central Bank cuts rates

The upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of the Ghanaian unit of telecom service provider MTN is expected to become the largest listing on the Ghana Stock Exchange. According to Bloomberg, the company will be selling a 35 percent stake through the listing for about $787 million at an overall valuation of $2.2 billion. The listing is part of the firm’s 2015 agreement with the government signed when MTN won the right to use 4G spectrum to launch high-speed mobile data services in the country. The size of the IPO is 10 times the size of the previous largest IPO of the Agriculture Development Bank in December 2016. The IPO is expected to garner global interest and, according to Alex Boahen of Databank Group, “demand from foreign investors attracted by MTN’s profitability should ensure the IPO is a success.”

In other business news, the Bank of Ghana cut its policy rate from 20 to 18 percent this week. This represents a four-year low for the policy rate, which has been reduced by 8 percentage points since 2016 in line with the falling inflation, which has almost halved over the last two years to 10.6 percent in February. Current inflation levels are close to the central bank’s medium term target of 6-10 percent and could lead to further policy rate cuts according to an analyst interviewed by Bloomberg.

Angolan prosecutors accuse former president’s son of fraud

On Monday, the U.K.’s National Crime Agency stated that it had seized $500 million—transferred from the Angolan Central Bank to a corporate account at HSBC in the U.K.—on suspicions of fraud. Deputy Attorney General of Angola Luis Benza Zanga formally accused José Filomeno dos Santos, the son of Angola’s ex-president José Eduardo dos Santos and former head of Angola’s sovereign wealth fund, of involvement in the illegal transfer. The former central bank governor of Angola, Valter Filipe da Silva, has also been implicated. HSBC had frozen the U.K. account several weeks ago and reported the transaction to U.K. authorities due to the size and nature of the transfer. Although HSBC has come under fire in recent years for allegedly managing transactions for Mexican drug cartels, the company has invested heavily in upgrading its anti-money laundering compliance systems. The U.K. authorities announced that the $500 million would be returned to Angola through a process in the U.K. courts.

Notably, Filomino is not the only member of the dos Santos family who has come under investigation in recent months. Late last year, Filomino’s half-sister Isabel dos Santos was dismissed from her position as head of Sonangol, the state oil company, and this month authorities opened an inquiry into funds that went missing during her time leading the firm.",https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2018/03/30/africa-in-the-news-ethiopias-new-pm-ghanas-record-ipo-and-angola-and-uk-uncover-fraud/

According to Hassan Khannenje, the current state of affairs was just a matter of time after decades of iron fist rule by the Ethiopia Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

Speaking on a political talk show hosted by NTV Kenya channel he stressed that Ethiopia was nearing the end of authoritarian rule. “I don’t see the current Ethiopian crisis as the beginning of democracy (actually) I see it as the beginning of the end of autocracy.

Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state.

“Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state,” he stressed.

He averred that in the absence of a substantive head of government, i.e. a Prime Minister, the country was confused, adding that the state of emergency did not help matters because it is often used to repress opposition groups.

“And this is a culmination of many years of autocracy and authoritarianism. Now, in the absence of the Prime Minister at the moment or at least the state control of power in certain places, a lot of time the opposition tends to suffer, it gets scapegoated, it gets repressed.

“… the Oromo being the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and having been resistant to the status quo for many years, of course they are going kto get the first flak. Now, Kenya had seen this coming and we cannot pretend we were unaware of the goings on in Ethiopia.

Kenya until recently had not actively waded into the Ethiopian situation. The recent influx of thousands of refugees following a botched military operation in the border town of Moyale has forced the media to discuss Ethiopia.

“This was bound to happen sooner or later and what I am hoping is our Minister of Foreign Affairs or Interior have a moral bust approach both diplomatically with Ethiopia to make sure that thing does not overflow.

“But also to use its influence on the current rulers within at least on the Ethiopian circles, at least, to try and calm things down. Today Ethiopia needs help.

“Abiy’s election could herald a new dawn in Ethiopia if it is followed by concrete steps to implement far-reaching reforms towards respect for human rights in the country,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

“If approved as prime minister, Abiy and his government must take urgent measures to address the human rights crisis in Ethiopia, through concrete and genuine reforms.”

Abiy’s elevation to the helm of the ruling coalition comes at a time when the country has declared a state of emergency, the second of its kind in less than two years, imposing severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights and freedoms at a time when Ethiopians are demanding greater freedom and respect for human rights in their country.

In one of the most shocking incidents since the announcement of the state of emergency on 16 February, security forces killed at least 12 civilians and wounded many more in the southern town of Moyale. The Command Post for the state of emergency admitted wrongful killings of civilians in Moyale, alleging it was caused by “mistaken intelligence report”.

Over the weekend, 12 recently released political prisoners, including Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience Eskinder Nega, were re-arrested in Addis Ababa, barely a month after release. Another 19 people, including academics, were also arrested in Bahir Dar, in the Amhara region.

“The killings of civilians, re-arrest of recently released political prisoners and the new wave of arrests bodes ill for the long-promised reform agenda in Ethiopia,” said Salil Shetty.

“If endorsed by parliament, Abiy’s new government must start by releasing all prisoners of conscience and reforming or repealing all repressive laws, including the draconian Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and the Ethiopian Charities and Societies Proclamation, which have played a significant role in rolling back the human rights gains in the country.”",https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/incoming-ethiopia-prime-minister-must-address-deep-rooted-human-rights-crisis/

• The 2018 Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) identifies 7.88 million people in need of food assistance, and 8.49 million people in need of non-food assistance at a cost of $1.658 billion

• Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

• About 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semiurban sites across Oromia region

• 18,000 IDPs receiving vocational training

• In 2017 Fall armyworm infested some 692,963 hectares of land (22.16 per cent of the total maize area in the country) in 417 maize growing woredas/districts causing up to 73 per cent crop losses.

US$1.66 billion required for 7.88 million people in need of humanitarian aid in 2018

On 13 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners launched the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. The HDRP seeks US$1.66 billion to help 7.88 million people with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with nonfood assistance. Out of the $1.66 billion sought for the 2018 response, $1.036 billion is targeted for relief food, $198.3 million for nutrition, $99 million for WaSH needs, 94.9 million for shelter and non-food items, and $74 million for health response. The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

The HDRP is structured around three pillars: (i) Prevention and mitigation, (ii) Preparedness and response, and (iii) National systems strengthening and recovery. The plan represents a first step towards the development of a multi-year planning framework for the response in Ethiopia – with the aim of moving away from short-term response in a context of mainly predictable humanitarian needs. Prior to the launch of HDRP, Government and partners released an ‘Alert’ indicative of target and requirements for 2018 in December 2017.

$242.2 urgently required for top priority needs in the first half of 2018

Prior to the launch to the HRDP launch, and to ensure gaps in funding were being addressed while the HDRP was being finalized, a Humanitarian Prioritization Document for 2018 was released in February. This document indicated that $242.2 million is urgently required to address critical gaps for the coming six months.

The largest share of the immediate priority funding gap is with the nutrition sector, followed by the food and health sectors. The Nutrition Cluster requires $73.4 million by early March to ensure continued quality emergency nutrition response. The Food Cluster requires an immediate $50 million to prevent a food pipeline break for 1.8 million people in the Somali region at the end of March. The Health Cluster requires $9.7 million for urgent re-stocking of primary health care kits for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoae (AWD), severe malnutrition (SAM) management commodities, emergency reproductive health and GBV management kits and the expansion of Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams in IDP-hosting areas.

Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

The IDP Response and Rehabilitation Committee of the Oromia region have mobilized ETB1.7 billion (close to $62 million) from the federal government, private business and the community in the last 6 months to address critical life-saving, resettlement and rehabilitation needs of displaced Oromos. However, critical gaps including access to water in pastoralist areas, schools and health facilities remain high.

During the first phase of the regional resettlement plan, some 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semi-urban sites across Oromia region including in the vicinity of Addis Ababa where construction is nearing completion. As part of the rehabilitation programme, the region is providing vocational training to some 18,000 IDPs. The Federal Government will continue to provide food and non-food items and partners have been encouraged to step in and support the relocated people as they start new life.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-48-26-feb-11-march-2018

Ethiopia's new prime minister is the first Oromo to head the ruling EPRDF coalition in the country's 27-year history. Some observers believe he can bring about change in conflict-ridden regions.

After weeks of negotiations behind closed doors, Ethiopia finally has a new prime minister. 41-year-old Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali is set to be confirmed on Saturday, but he has already become something of a sensation. He is the first Oromo chairman of the ruling four-party coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Although the Oromo ethnic group makes up a third of the country's population of 105 million, so far they have always had a disadvantage against the older ruling Amhara group and the minority Tigre group. The latter have determined the country's political and economic fortunes for a quarter of a century and control both the military and intelligence services.

The multilingual Abiy was born in 1976 in the Jimma region of western Ethiopia, the son of a Muslim father and a Christian mother. When violent unrest broke out between the two religious communities he actively engaged in a peace forum for reconciliation.

'Charismatic and credible'

While still a teenager, Abiy reportedly joined the resistance movement against the ""Red Terror"" regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. After its demise he joined the Ethiopian army in 1993, where he first worked in the intelligence service and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the Rwandan genocide of 1994, he was deployed as a member of the United Nations peace mission and later served in the border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Seyum Teshome is an Ethiopian blogger and university lecturer who was arrested by security forces in early March. Shortly before, he told DW he had previously praised Abiy's qualities. ""He has been overwhelmingly accepted by members of the opposition parties. He has strong willpower, great charisma and great credibility.""

It was not until 2010, after heading the cyber-intelligence service INSA, that Abiy moved into politics and quickly rose within the ranks of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO). He was elected to the House of Representatives, and in 2016 he became the Federal Minister of Science and Technology in Addis Ababa. However, he soon returned to his native province of Oromia to take up the position of Head of the OPDO Secretariat.

At the end of 2015, Abiy found himself at the center of a violent dispute over illegal land-grabbing in the Oromia region. Although the controversial 'Addis Ababa Master Plan' was suspended in early 2016, the fallout continues to this day, with a death toll of thousands and many thousands injured. Abiy -- along with regional president Lemma Megerssa -- became one of the central figures of a newly awakened Oromo nationalism.

Ethiopia's youth want to see action

Together, Abiy and Megerssa tried to reassure young people in the Oromia region and listen to their concerns but in interviews with DW, representatives of the Qeerroo, which means youth in the Oromo language, call for action and no more delays.""We should not let ourselves be lulled by his appointment now,"" one of the Qeerroo told DW, ""It does not mean that we have now gained freedom, just because he is an Oromo, ""We young people want a fundamental change, and if that does not happen we Qeerroo will rise up again.""

Mulatu Gemechu, vice-president of the seven-party opposition coalition Medrek, told DW the path won't be easy for Abiy. ""There will certainly be many demands from the public now,"" he said, ""And we can only hope that the EPRDF is ready to fulfill them.""

Political commentator Mengistu Assefa expressed reservations about Abiy, saying: ""I do not think he can bring a big change."" What is needed, he said, is a change of government to bring about fundamental political change. ""I would like to ask him if he would lift the current state of emergency and bring to justice the brutal armed forces.""

Opposition politician from the Arena Tigray party, Abraha Desta, is a bit more optimistic. ""It could well be that the new leader [of the EPRDF] manages to expand the political space,"" he told DW, ""This would be very important for the political process in our country.""

A new approach

Human rights groups in Ethiopia and beyond are now calling for a swift national dialogue. Fisseha Tekle, an Ethiopia researcher at Amnesty International, told DW she welcomes Abiy's election, but there is still a lot of work to be done. ""The past three years have been marked by uprisings, serious human rights abuses and torture,"" she said, ""We expect the new prime minister to take steps to alleviate these violations.""

The fact that Abiy, a married father of three daughters, is an ardent visitor to fitness clubs in Addis Ababa, is likely to serve him in good stead in the coming weeks and months. His academic qualifications should also help -- Abiy holds a master's degree in transformational leadership and change and a PhD in conflict mediation.

In an interview in late 2017, the aspiring leader said he was convinced he would be able to win the support of Ethiopian citizens, but that they ""expect a different rhetoric from us."" According to Abiy, if there is to be political progress in Ethiopia, ""then we have to debate the issues openly and respectfully. It's easier to win people over to democracy than push them towards democracy. This can only succeed peacefully and through political participation.""",http://allafrica.com/stories/201803310066.html

According to HRW, Kenya especially and the entire East Africa region needed to encourage Ethiopia to undertake needed reforms and to halt its continued descent into chaos.

A March 24, 2018 statement ‘Why is Kenya’s Government Silent on Ethiopia Crackdown’ released by the group’s Senior Researcher for the Horn of Africa, Felix Horne read in part: “… Kenyan leaders should publicly voice their concern over the increased military aggression that causes Ethiopians to flee into Kenya. Kenya, and East Africa more broadly, need a stable and prosperous Ethiopia.

“Adding the voice of a trusted ally like Kenya to the many tens of millions of Ethiopians demanding change will be an important contribution toward stability in the region.”

HRW also stressed that on the humanitarian scale, Kenya stands to suffer if the situation in Ethiopia degenerates any further. With family ties connecting people on both sides of their common border, Ethiopians are likely to continue fleeing into Kenya.

“Over eight million Ethiopians are in need of food aid. Many of them live in southern Ethiopia, close to the Kenyan border. If conflict in Ethiopia increases, many of its most vulnerable citizens will be looking for safety.

“Kinship connections, established trafficking routes, and relatively stable security all make Kenya an attractive destination,” the statement added.

Over the last weeks, thousands of Ethiopians living in the border town of Moyale fled their homes into Kenya’s Marsabit County after a failed military operation by the army led to the deaths of nine people and injuries to others.

Confirming the incident, the Minister of Defense, admitted that the army had acted on failed intelligence as it sought to intercept members of a banned group – the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) – who were reportedly trying to enter the country.

HRW also reiterated how Ethiopian forces have in the past entered Kenya and perpetuated rights abuses in the name of counter-terrorism operations. They also accused the Kenyan authorities in part of complicity in helping Ethiopia arrest Ethiopians who had fled in Kenya.

“Ethiopia’s intolerance of dissent has also been exported across the border in the past. For years, Ethiopian intelligence officials, sometimes in cooperation with Kenyan police, have harassed, threatened, and on occasion kidnapped Ethiopian asylum seekers in Nairobi and elsewhere in Kenya,” the statement added.

Abiy’s elevation to the helm of the ruling coalition comes at a time when the country has declared a state of emergency, the second of its kind in less than two years, imposing severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights and freedoms.

If approved as prime minister, Abiy and his government must take urgent measures to address the human rights crisis in Ethiopia, through concrete and genuine reforms.

The state of emergency has met stiff resistance from the people in the Oromiya and Amhara regions and has been criticised by many of Ethiopia’s allies in the West.

In one of the most shocking incidents since the announcement of the state of emergency on 16 February, security forces killed at least 12 civilians and wounded many more in the southern town of Moyale.

The Command Post for the state of emergency admitted wrongful killings of civilians in Moyale, alleging it was caused by “mistaken intelligence report”.

Political prisoners including opposition leaders, bloggers and journalists who were recently released as part of reforms advanced by the former premier, have recently been arrested and detained without charges.

16,ethiopia,"The grazing regions of Oromia and Somali in southern and eastern Ethiopia have witnessed an escalation in inter-ethnic violence in recent months. Since last September, more than one million people have fled their villages and been displaced to hundreds of reception areas. HI is working to protect the most vulnerable individuals, primarily women and children. Fabrice Vandeputte, HI’s head of mission in Ethiopia, explains the causes of the crisis and how our team is responding.

How did the crisis begin?

For years, ethnic groups have been fighting over natural resources, especially water and pasture land in the regions of Somali and Oromia in southern and eastern Ethiopia. But the conflict has intensified due to long periods of drought and the famines that have followed them. A disagreement over where the border lies between the two regions also recently turned violent, when hundreds of thousands of people from Oromia living in Somali and even in neighboring Somaliland were forcibly removed to Oromia. The Oromia authorities expelled the Somali population in reprisal.

Where are the displaced people living?

More than one million displaced people, mostly women and children, are currently living in 400 reception areas, such as schools and public buildings, but also with families and the like, on a north-south line from the towns of Jigaga to Moyale, on the border between the Somali and Oromia regions. These population movements are putting a lot of pressure on host communities. For example, one woman we met recently has taken in 50 or so members of her close or extended family. You can imagine the day-to-day problems that causes in terms of sanitary facilities, food, and so on.

What are conditions like for displaced people?

They’re exhausted. Think about it: you’re walking down the street, minding your own business, when you’re suddenly surrounded by police who load you onto a vehicle, and transport you hundreds of miles away from your home region. That’s what’s happened to most displaced people. They’ve lost everything they own. A lot of children even get separated from their parents. Many suffer serious psychological distress.

What are NGOs doing?

Unfortunately, very few humanitarian actors are supported by funding bodies or are able to implement emergency programs. NGOs in the field are finding it hard to launch a response because displaced people are spread across lots of different sites, and you have to find them. Organizing aid for people scattered over a large area is not easy.

What is HI doing?

We’ve set up a program to protect women and children. When people are suddenly displaced in large numbers, and forced together in very poor conditions, it leads to tension and violence, and women and children are usually worst affected. There’s also a heightened risk of rape and child trafficking. In Babile and Kersaa, where we work, we’ve formed mobile teams whose job is to spot risky situations and vulnerable individuals and to refer them to the right services, such as health centers, social services, NGOs, and the like. We’re also opening areas for women and children where they can play or get psychosocial support.

How do you think the crisis will develop over the coming months?

Some observers estimate the number of people who could need humanitarian assistance, displaced people and host communities included, at five to seven million. Very few people are paying attention to this crisis and not enough money has been allocated to it. The basic need for water, food, hygiene and facilities are only just being met. The support provided by funding bodies falls short of what’s needed.

Humanity & Inclusion in Ethiopia

Climatic shocks, conflict, insecurity and political instability continue to drive humanitarian need in the Horn of Africa. While food insecurity increased by nearly 24 per cent in 2017, it decreased in the first month of 2018. In Somalia, famine risk declined, but needs remain high, with some 2.7 million severely food insecure people in need of assistance. In Kenya, the number of severely food insecure decreased from 2.6 million in December 2017 to 2.35 million by January 2018. Following the meher assessment in Ethiopia, 7.9 million people are severely food insecure and in need of assistance.

People continued to be displaced by drought and conict. Some 106,000 people were newly displaced in Somalia between 1 January and 28 February due to water shortages and some areas of the country are experiencing stress-induced migration of pastoralist communities in search of water and pasture. In Ethiopia, 47,441 people were displaced between 1 January and 28 February. The number of refugees hosted in the region increased by 11,397 between 1 January and 28 February.

Several disease outbreaks are ongoing in the Horn of Africa. Although the number of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/cholera cases tapered towards the end of 2017 outbreaks of AWD were ongoing in Dire Dawa and Somali regions in Ethiopia, and outbreaks of cholera were ongoing in Tana River, Garissa, Mombasa, Turkana, Siaya, Tharaka Nithi, Meru, Busia and West Pokot counties in Kenya and Banadir, Hiraan and Lower Jubba in Somalia, as at the end of February 2018. In Kenya, 1,476 cholera cases and 29 deaths were reported since January 2018, compared to 4,079 cases in 2017.

According to experts who spoke in the 48th Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum, La Niña could trigger severe hunger and lack of water for both humans and livestock, potentially increase conflict between communities over scarce resources and could increased migrations.

According to FSNAU/FEWSNET, over 2.7 million people in Somalia face crisis or emergency between February and June 2018. The National Disaster Preparedness and Food Authority declared a drought emergency in areas of Somaliland facing acute food crisis. Prior to the declaration, an appeal had been issued for urgent humanitarian assistance for over 600,000 drought affected people in Puntland.

A total of 8.3 million children (Somalia 2.8 million, Kenya 1.8 million and Ethiopia 3.7 million) are in need of humanitarian assistance. 1.2 million children, pregnant and lactating women are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition which has reached emergency levels in some locations with 656,614 children below the age of 5 suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).

In Ethiopia, renewed inter-communal fighting between the Oromos and Somalis along the borders of their two states, Oromia and Somali Region that started in August 2017 has displaced an estimated 1.1 million people to date. A flare-up in the fighting in January 2018 is likely to increase the number of displaced people.

Ethiopia is currently under a state of emergency imposed on February 16 this year, a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned his position to allow for political reforms.

The ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) is set to meet to elect his successor. The country is currently under a Command Post administering the state of emergency.

The latest accusation against Eritrea was by the federal police chief who whiles giving a briefing on the state of emergency late last week, reportedly cited Eritrean involvement in the crisis. The Eritrean Information minister dismissed the claims in an email exchange with Bloomberg.

“The regime is desperately trying to deflect attention from its intractable domestic crisis — of its own making — and find external scapegoats,” Yemane Ghebre Meskel said describing the claims as false and one that did not merit a serious response.

Protests in Ethiopia are the culmination of a long-simmering series of grievances and demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity.

After 3 years of relentless protests, Ethiopia started 2018 with rare good news. On January 3, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and his party pledged to release political prisoners and shut down the notorious Maekelawi detention center in Addis Ababa. In a 3-hour-long press conference, leaders of the ruling Ethiopian People‘s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) also took responsibility for the myriad of political challenges facing the country. The aim, EPRDF leaders said, was to foster national reconciliation and to widen democratic space. The announcement was roundly welcomed, including by a leery opposition, as a crucial step in the right direction.

A series of mixed signals followed. More than 6,000 political prisoners, including key opposition figures, journalists, and leaders of the country’s Muslim community, were released from prison. Not long after, on February 15, Hailemariam resigned saying he wanted to pave the way for reforms. It appeared that Africa’s second most populous nation was truly poised to turn a page on its repressive past. Not a day later, however, on February 16, authorities imposed a sweeping 6-month-long state of emergency. The decree was ratified by the EPRDF-controlled Parliament in a disputed vote on March 2.

More than 60 casualties have been reported since the state of emergency came into effect. In southern Ethiopia, thousands have fled violence and sought shelter and urgent humanitarian assistance in Kenya. The latest displacement is in addition to the more than 1.2 million people internally displaced, most of them in 2017, by a tit-for-tat border conflict between Oromia and Somali States, two of the largest of Ethiopia‘s nine linguistically based regional states. The humanitarian, security, and political crises are the most serious facing Ethiopia since 1991, when the communist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown.

To tackle these and other challenges, the 36-member executive leadership of the EPRDF held a series of high-stakes meetings. While they agree there is a problem, they are divided over how to respond to growing public pressure and ethnic discord. As a result, once a unified vanguard party, the EPRDF is now riven by a bitter power struggle. The heightened jostling for control of the party’s policy direction has brought to the fore long-suppressed questions of inequity in the EPRDF.

How Did Ethiopia Get to This Point?

To understand the current state of flux in Ethiopia, consider the EPRDF’s history. Founded in 1989, the EPRDF is, in theory, a coalition of four ethnically based political organizations: the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM).

At the time of the EPRDF’s founding, Mengistu Haile Mariam’s communist regime was on its last leg. The Cold War was coming to an end. Having set its sights on political power in Addis Ababa, the TPLF, which had led the armed insurgency against Mengistu, needed partners to cross into the vast region south of its base in northern Ethiopia. So it orchestrated the creation of the ANDM, the OPDO, and later the SEPDM.

Once the EPRDF came to power, a multinational federation, which promised self-determination for every nation, nationality, and people in Ethiopia, was forged as a compromise between ethnonationalists and unionists who favored a centralized Ethiopian polity. This approach, explicitly organizing the Ethiopian state along ethnic lines, was a stark departure from the emphasis on a single Ethiopian national identity promoted by the Mengistu regime and Emperor Haile Selassie before it. The 1995 Constitution called for decentralization and a significant degree of self-rule for states, promises that remained largely on paper.

From the beginning, the EPRDF proved to be a coalition of unequal partners. For example, each member party has 45 representatives in the powerful 180-member EPRDF Council, even though ethnic Tigrayans constitute just 6 percent of the country’s population. Moreover, the TPLF enjoys absolute control of the military and the security establishment as well as key economic sectors. The TPLF also controlled the office of Prime Minister until 2012, and the Foreign Ministry until 2015.

The power imbalance gave rise to charges of undue Tigrayan influence over the country’s political life. TPLF leaders vacillated between acknowledgement and entitlement, given the party’s outsized role in liberating Ethiopia from the tyranny of the Mengistu regime. The ascendancy of the minority Tigrayans displaced from power the more populous Amhara, who had played the dominant role in Ethiopian political life for most of the previous century.

This Tigrayan dominance was further fortified through strict party discipline known as democratic centralism, which encouraged constituent parties to engage in vigorous internal deliberations but mandated all to adhere to the ruling party’s policy direction once a vote was taken. Moreover, as EPRDF leaders have acknowledged, the TPLF maintained covert influence inside the EPRDF by propping up and empowering loyalists. These grievances gradually gave way to growing resentment against the TPLF and, more recently, ethnic Tigrayans.

The Context of Ongoing Protests

The Ethiopian protests are the culmination of a long-building series of grievances. After the disputed 2005 elections in which the EPRDF resorted to brutal violence to maintain power, the party embarked on a developmental state model, characterized by active state intervention in the economy as a way to boost its political legitimacy. But this effort was accompanied by a heightened muzzling of critics and the media as well as controlling access to information. It also meant the institutionalization of the instruments of repression.

While the EPRDF faced some level of opposition at every turn in its 25-year rule, the floodgates opened in 2014 when the Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, began protesting against the government’s land policy. The protests coalesced around a single Oromo axiom: “The matter of land is the matter of life.” The specific trigger was an urban master plan, which sought to expand Addis Ababa’s physical boundaries deep into the surrounding Oromia State. Surprisingly, the first sign of resistance came from within the OPDO, a one-time docile party seen among the Oromo as the TPLF’s puppet.

The EPRDF seemed to be caught off guard by the scale of the protests. Security forces responded to largely peaceful protests using disproportionate force. This engendered more outrage and protests. Many dozens of people were killed and thousands arrested.

Protests briefly subsided ahead of the May 2015 national elections, in which the EPRDF and its partners claimed 100 percent of the seats in Parliament. However, Oromo protests returned when authorities attempted to forge ahead with the Addis Ababa expansion plan. A massive security dragnet ensued, leading to the deaths of even more people and the arrest of tens of thousands. By then, the initial opposition to the “land grab” and concerns over the dispossession of Oromo farmers from Addis Ababa had grown to include protesting historic Oromo marginalization, the lack of freedom and economic opportunities, and demanding the release of political prisoners.

Under pressure, authorities shelved the urban master plan and made other cosmetic changes, including a cabinet reshuffle, which saw Tigrayans ceding control of the Foreign Ministry. But EPRDF leaders left popular demands for greater democratic rights, equal economic opportunities, and state autonomy virtually untouched.

In October 2016, the protests were curbed with the declaration of a state of emergency. When martial law was lifted 10 months later, the protests returned evermore vigorously. Crucially, the protests had by then spread to other regions, particularly Amhara State and a number of localities in the southern region.

Some of the grievances were localized but the overarching theme was the same: the gap between constitutional guarantees for democracy versus the existing centralized state and authoritarian party that controlled all aspects of life. For example, in Wolkait, an administrative district in Tigray State, ethnic Amharas wanted to be part of the Amhara State and send their children to school in Amharic. A two-decade effort to settle the matter through legal and political means was repeatedly frustrated. Those frustrations fed into wider resentment over Tigrayan hegemony.

In Oromia, the epicenter of the opposition, the OPDO faced a legitimacy crisis. It was buckling under the weight of protests and accusations of corruption and incompetence from other EPRDF partners. This pressure helped bring to power a new generation of OPDO party cadres who were not wedded to the legacy of armed struggle. They made bold overtures to Oromo nationalism and embraced most of the protesters’ grievances, vowing to reform their party and the EPRDF to address the Oromo question or to join the protesters if their reform efforts failed.

As the OPDO positioned itself as a quasi-opposition party, the TPLF was also trying to clean its own house. Facing inevitable decline and waning influence, the TPLF held a 35-day-long evaluation session in October 2017 that culminated in demotions of top party officials and a rare public display of self-criticism.

It is against this backdrop that EPRDF leaders, in large part to meet the OPDO’s demands, agreed to free political prisoners in January 2018. The freed prisoners were welcomed by a groundswell of public support and homecoming celebrations.

It is also important to recognize the leading role that youth, having come of age under the EPRDF’s one-party rule, have played in the protests. This underscores the major demographic transformations that have accompanied the calls for change. Ethiopia had an estimated total population of 52 million in 1990. It is now projected to be over 105 million with more than 70 percent of the population under the age of 30. Simultaneous to this was a rural-to-urban migration of young people. However, the pace of local job creation has not matched the number of college graduates. The influx in mobile phone usage and improved access to communications technology, meanwhile, means that this generation is far more connected to one another and to the outside world than any before it. These factors have all contributed to the resiliency of the protests.

The Way Forward

The EPRDF and, indeed, Ethiopia are at a crossroads. Resilient demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity indicate that the status quo is untenable. Reliance on military and security measures to quell opposition have proven futile. The EPRDF’s diagnosis of the problem in January was largely correct: the answer to Ethiopia’s malaise is greater democratic space and national reconciliation. This will require vacating the emergency decree, which has proven counterproductive to the party’s stated reform plans. It will also be necessary to address the root problems: the inequity within the governing coalition and the need for legitimacy.

A priority for reestablishing stability, therefore, should be to engage opposition parties in good faith negotiations setting forth a path for genuine popular dialogue and reconciliation. This process would entail freeing all political prisoners and setting in motion legal and political reforms to undo some of the most coercive measures that have brought the party and country to the precipice of collapse. These reforms would include the repeal of the Freedom of the Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation, the Charities and Societies Proclamation, and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. These sweeping pieces of legislation have been used to curtail opposition activities, muzzle independent journalists, and silence government critics.

Through heavy state involvement in the economy, Ethiopia has registered modest growth over the last decade. Events of the last several years illustrate that this authoritarian developmental model has backfired and is coming to a dead end. Continued efforts to subdue an increasingly restive population through repressive measures now risk unraveling the economy and the country‘s fragile federation.

It is remarkable that despite the mounting grievances, the protests have largely remained peaceful. This suggests the crisis can be resolved without widespread instability. However, the continued tug-of-war between protesters and the security sector is testing public patience. It will also embolden those who insist on armed rebellion as the only way to bring about change—a quintessential story for Ethiopia, which in its long history has never had a peaceful transfer of power.

All parties committed to Ethiopia’s stability should emphasize that only genuine dialogue and reform can avert a further deterioration.

22,ethiopia,"Malicha Doyo, a 36-year old mother of six from Ethiopia, cradles her five-day-old baby daughter Nuria in a temporary reception centre in Moyale, in northern Kenya on the border with Ethiopia.

Malicha arrived heavily pregnant and hungry from the town of Tuqa five days ago, after an outbreak of violence in Ethiopia. Refugees say several people were killed when Ethiopian troops attacked their villages in a raid on opposition areas.

The Ethiopian government said its soldiers mistakenly killed nine civilians and wounded a dozen others. The soldiers involved had been disarmed and a delegation had been sent to the region to investigate the killings, it added.

Forty-eight hours after arriving in Moyale with her husband and five children, Malicha went into labour with her sixth child.

She is emotional and a little tearful, delighted to have delivered baby Nuria safely, but worried about the situation at home and how long she might have to stay in Kenya.

“I was really afraid that the baby would come while she was on the way.""

Sitting right next to her is her mother, Darmigalma Boru, 55, who arrived a few days after her daughter.

“I was really afraid that the baby would come while she was on the way, but I just thank God that she waited until she arrived to safety,” she said.

They are among about 9,600 Ethiopians estimated to have crossed the border into Kenya in the past two weeks.

More than 80 per cent were women and children, nearly 1,500 of them children under five. The influx included more than 600 expectant mothers, as well as disabled and elderly people.

The identities of those who were killed in the attack are not known, or how they died. The Ethiopian authorities say they are taking steps to restore peace.

Families like Malicha’s are dependent on the Kenyan government and humanitarian agencies. UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency is working with other agencies sych as UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the Kenya Red Cross, Save the Children, World Vision, and Concern to meet the most urgent needs.

“We are grateful for the assistance we have received.""

Water, food, and shelter materials are being distributed, and medical care is being provided by humanitarian organizations. Sanitation and hygiene facilities are under construction to prevent disease.

“We left with nothing and ate nothing during the two days it took us to get to Moyale,” says Darmigalma. “We are grateful for the assistance we have received, the plastic sheeting which we used to make our house, food, and other basic items such as kitchen utensils.”

The Kenyan government, with the help of UNHCR, is carrying out biometric registration of those who have arrived. Registering the asylum seekers will help the government and humanitarian agencies cater for the displaced and identify those with specific needs that UNHCR and other agencies can help to meet.

Local people in Moyale have also proved to be a lifeline. Halakano Rare who lives nearby, offered Malicha’s family a place to stay after Nuria was born.

""Although they are living in another country, if they come to us for security, then we have to assist.”

“I told them that baby needs a safe environment,” he told UNHCR. “So I decided to help them with shelter until they can find a better place to live. We are neighbours and the same community. Although they are living in the other country, if they come to us for security, then we have to assist”

Malicha and Darmigalma say they are happy and feel safe Kenya. However, they hope to go back home once it is safe to do so.

“Ethiopia is our country and, as long as there is peace, we will go back.”",http://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2018/3/5abbbb404/thousands-flee-kenya-escape-ethiopia-violence.html
23,ethiopia,"UN Migration Agency Appeals for USD 88.5 million for Response to Ethiopian Crisis

IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has launched an appeal for USD 88,550,000 to help people in need of humanitarian assistance in Ethiopia. The appeal covers IOM’s activities under the humanitarian community and Government’s Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP), IOM’s assistance to Ethiopian migrant returnees from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and humanitarian support to refugees from neighbouring countries.

IOM’s appeal aims to support some of the 1.7 million Ethiopians displaced throughout the country, identified by IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Approximately 1.1 million people are displaced due to conflict, 857,000 of whom were displaced near the borders of the Oromia and Somalia Regions over the past year, and over 500,000 people due to climatic shocks. In addition, 47,600 Ethiopian migrant returnees and 87,000 South Sudanese and Somali refugees are planned to be reached with support detailed in the appeal. Under this appeal, IOM will also support empowerment of young people and the strengthening of institutions in Ethiopia working on counter trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.

“We need to rethink the way we work in countries like Ethiopia,” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM Director of Operations and Emergencies at the Organization’s headquarters in Geneva. “We want this appeal to mark the end of the “Band-Aid approach” and the start of longer term thinking. Millions of people are in dire need of our urgent support in Ethiopia, but we hope that the life-saving sustainable measures we put in place this year will mean that by next year more communities will be resilient to climate stresses like drought,” said Abdiker.

Ethiopia has had a fast-growing non-oil-related economy with double digit growth sustained over a decade. It has experienced massive investment in infrastructure and industry. However, in 2016, the worst El Niño induced drought in 50 years forced more than 10 million people to become depend on relief food assistance, while also eroding household and community resilience and increasing vulnerability nationwide. Last year, rains failed again, and, in south and south-eastern Ethiopia, 8.5 million Ethiopians were left in need of relief food assistance.

The 2018 Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan released by the Government of Ethiopia National Disaster Risk Management Commission and the UN Humanitarian Coordinator shows that this year 16.4 million people will need humanitarian assistance throughout the country.

Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians leave home to seek employment in the Gulf countries, most often KSA. On 29 March 2017, KSA issued a Note Verbal declaring that all irregular migrants should voluntarily leave the country, among them an estimated 500,000 Ethiopians. To date more than 140,000 Ethiopians have returned. Many returnees come back to little and the push factors that encouraged them to leave in the first place are still present. IOM’s appeal covers reintegration support, which is vital for returnees to sustain their livelihood.

Ethiopia remains the second largest refugee-hosting country in Africa hosting over 909,000 refugees. Of these registered refugees, more than 428,928 are South Sudanese and 254,274 are Somali.

Transportation of newly arrived refugees from border entry points to the refugee camps remains a critical to ensure that they can access aid. Shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and livelihood support in the context of the Comprehensive Refuge Response Framework (CRRF) remains critically under-funded and are included in IOM’s current appeal.

“Ethiopia has bravely endured these difficult situations but to sustain its growing economy, it needs urgent support from the global community,” said Maureen Achieng, IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission and Representative to the African Union (AU), United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

Amnesty International

Ethiopia’s incoming prime minister must prioritize addressing the deep-rooted human rights crisis in the country, said Amnesty International following the election of Abiy Ahmed as chairman of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party, paving the way for him to become the next premier.

If approved by parliament, Abiy Ahmed, who also currently heads the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) – an EPRDF member party – will replace Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who announced his resignation in February “in an effort to facilitate reforms.”

“Abiy’s election could herald a new dawn in Ethiopia if it is followed by concrete steps to implement far-reaching reforms towards respect for human rights in the country,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

“If approved as prime minister, Abiy and his government must take urgent measures to address the human rights crisis in Ethiopia, through concrete and genuine reforms.”

Abiy’s elevation to the helm of the ruling coalition comes at a time when the country has declared a state of emergency, the second of its kind in less than two years, imposing severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights and freedoms at a time when Ethiopians are demanding greater freedom and respect for human rights in their country.

In one of the most shocking incidents since the announcement of the state of emergency on 16 February, security forces killed at least 12 civilians and wounded many more in the southern town of Moyale. The Command Post for the state of emergency admitted wrongful killings of civilians in Moyale, alleging it was caused by “mistaken intelligence report”.

Over the weekend, 12 recently released political prisoners, including Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience Eskinder Nega, were re-arrested in Addis Ababa, barely a month after release. Another 19 people, including academics, were also arrested in Bahir Dar, in the Amhara region.

“The killings of civilians, re-arrest of recently released political prisoners and the new wave of arrests bodes ill for the long-promised reform agenda in Ethiopia,” said Salil Shetty.

“If endorsed by parliament, Abiy’s new government must start by releasing all prisoners of conscience and reforming or repealing all repressive laws, including the draconian Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and the Ethiopian Charities and Societies Proclamation, which have played a significant role in rolling back the human rights gains in the country.”

25,ethiopia,"Mr. Mekonnen said Mr. Abiy would face many challenges in unifying and leading the country.

“It will be a struggle to change the status quo,” he said. “He is energetic and reformist, but that could also shake the government.”

A movement for change began in 2015 with street protests in the Oromia region, which includes Addis Ababa, and spread to other regions unhappy with the dominant party’s grip on economic and political power. At least 700 people have died in the protests.

Earlier this year, Ethiopia’s governing coalition had made concessions to popular demands for change, releasing hundreds of political prisoners, a move championed by Oromo activists.

The resignation in February of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, was widely viewed as an acknowledgment that those concessions had not gone far enough — making it virtually inevitable, experts said, that the next prime minister would come from the Oromo group.

Although the country is led by a coalition of four parties, the minority Tigrayan party has long been seen as controlling the political and economic life of Ethiopia.

Mr. Abiy, 41, was named the leader of the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization, one of the four parties in the coalition just last month. Young and charismatic, he delivers public statements in multiple languages, including English, to appeal to people beyond his own ethnic group.

“Abiy was probably the most popular candidate, the most favored candidate, by the public, broadly speaking,” said Hallelujah Lulie, a political analyst in Addis Ababa.

That support has come in part because of the welcoming way in which Mr. Abiy has spoken about the street protests and demands for change, Mr. Hallelujah said — but he has always done so as a political insider, equally attuned to the demands of power inside the governing coalition.

Previously, Mr. Abiy has been a soldier, an intelligence officer and a minister of science and technology, as well as the vice president of the Oromia region.

The news was greeted with unexpected calm across Ethiopia, and with hope that life — and business — will go back to normal. Leaders of large companies have complained that foreign exchange has been difficult to come by, making business and investment difficult.

“Our businesses were crumbling,” said Daniel Gebre, who runs an electronics maintenance shop in Addis Ababa. “It was very difficult to do anything because the roads were blocked and there was a shortage of goods.”

Mr. Abiy’s appointment as prime minister will become official with the approval of Parliament, expected in the next two weeks.

Mr. Mekonnen said the first real signs of the new prime minister’s strength and intentions would come when he named his cabinet — and if he decided to lift the state of emergency.

His handling of the security agencies will be equally important. The intelligence and security services have a hand in the economy, Mr. Hallelujah, the analyst, said.

Many Ethiopians perceive the security services — and the money and power they control — as dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, a wealthy minority that also controlled the governing coalition, until the Oromia protests forced talk of political change.

But some people warn that the success of the street protests from Mr. Abiy’s region may also be his downfall, because sometimes violent protests can result in changes in power.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/world/africa/ethiopia-prime-minister-oromo.html
