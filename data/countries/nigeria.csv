0,nigeria,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

This report was jointly written by researchers from the Feinstein International Center and the Centre for Humanitarian Change in Nairobi.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

The reporting period witnessed high levels movement of IDPs, with a total of 16,542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa States.

A total of 35 new cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 3 deaths were reported in Yusufari and Bade LGAs, Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera.

A total of 195,804 medical consultations were supported by UNICEF in 2018, out of which 91,184 consultations were made within the reporting period.

UNICEF and its implementing partners have provided critical child protection services to 200,160 children and caregivers in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe since the start of 2018.

Though critically underfunded at 80% and 90%, WASH and Health reached a total 128,446 and 195,804 conflict-affected people respectively during the reporting period. Increased funding is urgently required in these Sectors for an integrated UNICEF response to crises-affected children in north east Nigeria.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno. The reporting period witnessed a high level of movement, with a total of 16, 542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements recorded across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa states. The main reasons for the returns are improved security and voluntary relocation, while new displacement is propelled by poor living conditions, fear of attack, ongoing conflict and military operations.



On 23rd March, the Nigerian Government announced its intention to facilitate the return of IDPs from Maiduguri to Bama LGA. Bama currently has the largest number of displaced people (203,374) still outside of the LGA, and at the same time also hosts the highest number of IDPs (49,139 persons DTM Round XXI) of all Borno LGAs. The first voluntary returns exercise, supported by a government package of 10,000 Naira cash, a 50kg bag of rice, and a bag of maize flour per family, was scheduled for 2nd April. Humanitarian actors have emphasized the importance of ensuring that all returns processes take place in a safe, voluntary, and dignified manner, and take into consideration the capacity of state and other actors to meet the needs of returnees.



As of 31st March, 133 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 12 deaths (a case fatality rate of 9%) were reported in Bade and Yusufari LGAs of Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera. WASH and health partners - including UNICEF, WHO, VCM, MSF Spain, State Ministry of Health (SMoH), State Primary Health Care Board (SPHCMB) and LGAs authorities - are responding in the affected areas. Meanwhile, the number of cholera cases in Kukawa LGA continues to decline following responses by UNICEF and partners. A total number of 639 cases and 3 deaths were reported at the end of March (resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.5%).



On 1st March, members of a non-state armed groups attacked the military camp in Rann, killing seven military personnel.



Hostilities also resulted in the deaths of three humanitarian workers (including a doctor working for a UNICEF contractor) and the abduction of three female health workers (including a nurse working for a UNICEF contractor). Humanitarian activities in Rann were suspended as a result of the attack, temporarily leaving the local population and an estimated 40,000 IDPs without life-saving assistance. The attack also resulted in the closure of the only school in Rann, thus halting learning opportunities for 7300 children (46% of whom are girls) and the destruction of 2,700 school bags with essential learning materials prepositioned in preparation for new enrolment. All teachers have moved to Maiduguri following the attack.

The Emergency Telecommunications Sector (ETS) deployed vital communications services at the humanitarian hub in Damasak.

The ETS prepositioned Internet and security telecommunications equipment in Banki, where the next humanitarian hub will be established.

The ETS is working with local Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to evaluate the technical feasibility of a Closed User Group (CUG) to enhance communication among humanitarians.

Situation Overview

In early April, a series of fires broke out in and near the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp in Borno’s Rann town, injuring 14 people and burning more than 1,000 shelters in the camp, according to local media. Relief agencies are erecting 500 emergency shelters to decongest affected areas and working to address persistent shelter gaps.

The Yobe State Commissioner for Health declared a cholera outbreak in Nigeria’s Bade Local Government Area (LGA) at the beginning of April. Health actors recorded more than 340 suspected cholera cases in the state, more than 95 percent of which were from Bade, between 28 March and 16 April.

In anticipation of increased access challenges during the upcoming May-to-October rainy season, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published the 2018 Rainy Season Contingency Planning for North-East Nigeria on 9 April. It highlights that 407,000 people will be potentially affected during the 2018 rainy season in the three states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.",Nigeria Crisis - ETS Situation Report #18 (Reporting period 1/04/18 to 30/04/18),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-crisis-ets-situation-report-18-reporting-period-10418-300418
3,nigeria,"The Federal Government could ignite a crisis, if its planned resumption of oil exploration in Ogoniland goes ahead without the resolution of key issues.The warning by stakeholders in the Niger Delta is coming on the heels of last weekend’s meeting between the leadership of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu. The meeting had sought to find solutions to the crisis in Ogoniland.

Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was forced to stop exploration and leave Ogoniland in 1993, following an upheaval that caused the death of several Ogoni persons.The President of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, told The Guardian that the meeting proves the Federal Government cares nothing about the tragic experiences the Ogoni people have gone through, including the murder of Ken Saro- Wiwa and other prominent Ogoni activists.

“Government has not learnt anything. What this means is that it values oil more than the Ogoni people and their lives. They are yet to clean the environment and they are talking about the resumption of oil production. I don’t think they will have an environment conducive to oil exploration in Ogoni,” said Omare.

South-South Zonal Director, Civil Liberty Organisation, Steven Obodoekwe, said since government and the oil companies have not shown commitment to cleaning up the devastated Ogoni environment, their desperation to resume oil production therefore amounts to callousness and “fresh corporate terrorism.”

The ideal thing would have been for the government to ensure the environment is completely restored before contemplating renewed exploration in the area, stressed Obodoekwe.A Shell spokesman, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that though the company’s lease for Oil Mining Leases (OML11) has been renewed, it does not cover the over 30 Ogoni oilfields.He explained that contrary to the allegation that Shell wants to return to Ogoni through the backdoor, the company which was forced out of Ogoni in 1993 following an uprising does not intend to resume oil production. Shell’s leases for OML 11 was expected to expire by June 2019.

There has been growing tension in Ogoni since the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) wrote to Shell last year that it had given preliminary approval to a RoboMichael Limited which had expressed interest in obtaining licensing rights of Ogoni oilfields. It was learnt that Shell had already given its approval to RoboMichael.

The endorsement of RoboMichael Limited by NAPIMS and Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers respectively had caused MOSOP and other groups to allege that RoboMichael was Shell’s proxy, an allegation which the oil major has denied.

Amnesty International’s Business and Human Rights Researcher, Mark Dummett, regretted failure by the government and Shell to implement recommendations by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

“Following its groundbreaking survey of 2011, UNEP clearly laid out the path by which the environment of Ogoniland could be made free of the contamination that has devastated it for so long. The government has created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) to organise the cleanup, but little has so far been achieved, and there is no transparency over its plans,” Amnesty’s Rights researcher Dummett said.

MOSOP had told Kachikwu it was not opposed to discussions on the resumption of oil production, but that the consent of the people must first be obtained.It stated “unequivocally” that the contentious issue involves three main parties – the Federal Government, the oil industry led by Shell, and the Ogoni people. “Any attempt to deal with any aspect of the issue must necessarily involve the three principal actors, as stakeholders in a joint project of finding a lasting solution to the Ogoni crisis,” it said.

MOSOP, therefore, warned it would “resist the present attempt by the Federal Government and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria to arbitrarily award the Ogoni fields in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11 without consultation with the Ogoni community.”

The President of the movement, Legborsi Pyagbara, stressed that besides the environmental damage that attended Shell’s operations, Ogoni people are distressed about their lack of participation in the value chain of the oil industry, including employment; the absence of well-defined Community Benefit Sharing Agreements (CBAs); and a sustainable development process that recognises the rights of the people to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), in accordance with global best practices.

Pyagbara described attempts in the last few years to use money to “buy support” from the people as “condemnable” and “reprehensible”. Such move, he said, is “against the spirit of transparency and accountability required in the extractive sector.”He cautioned: “Societies the world over have met this challenge through deliberate and clear actions, and the Federal Government should urgently look in this direction. For, if the Nigerian government fails to protect the Ogoni people, it certainly cannot protect itself. History is replete with the ruins of societies that were built on the sort of injustices that have pervaded Ogoniland over the years.”

The MOSOP President urged the government to set up a better framework of engagement under which the parties involved would have a level-playing field for discussions on the future of oil production in Ogoniland.

According to him, Nigeria will be judged, not by its false claims about developments in Ogoniland, but by how it actually protects the weak, the vulnerable and those whose lives have been imperiled by reckless oil exploration of multinationals.Pyagbara disclosed that the Ogoni people, at the behest of MOSOP, have set up a strategic committee representing the various interests in Ogoni, headed by Prof. Ben Naanen, an economic historian and resource governance expert. This will develop a template to harmonise existing positions and guide the people in engagements with the Federal Government and the oil industry. Once the people adopt the template, Ogoniland will be ready for engagement and consultation on oil exploration, he said.

Meanwhile, youths in the Niger Delta have been urged to create an enabling business environment to attract investors to the region.SPDC’s General Manager, External Relations and Social Investment, Mr. Igo Weli, disclosed this while delivering a public lecture organised by the Rivers State University’s Centre of Excellence in Marine Engineering and Offshore Technology.

Speaking on the theme, ‘An enabling Business Environment – Implication for Future Careers in Oil and Gas Industry’, Weli noted that unlike in past years, many companies have left the region due to its unfriendly business atmosphere.He stressed the need for proper conflict management to reverse the situation.","Again, stakeholders warn FG, oil firms on crisis in Ogoni",https://guardian.ng/news/again-stakeholders-warn-fg-oil-firms-on-crisis-in-ogoni/
4,nigeria,"Governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Ayo Arise, on Tuesday expressed optimism that the current crisis rocking the party, not withstanding, APC would still be victorious in the July 14 governorship election.

He said the party was determined more than ever to send out the governor Ayodele Fayose-led People’s Democratic Party in the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti State.

Arise, who represented Ekiti North at the Senate between 2007-2011, however described the May 5 botched governorship primary election as “unfortunate and total embarrassment,” adding that the party is conducting investigation and following up on what led to the disruption and would apportion appropriate sanction on those responsible for the fiasco.

Speaking with newsmen in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, the APC Chieftain said it was not true that hoodlums hijacked the process, but it was brought to a halt by aspirants agents and party members when irregularities and electoral malfeasance was noticed.

According to him, “I don’t think that those who participated can really be described as hoodlums, I think they were agents and party members, so I believe there are some irregularities that they noticed and that led to what we all saw as the effect of the outcome that were noticed and with some evidences that we have seen

“What happened was a shame because those who were supposed to conduct a free and fair election couldn’t do it, some people were allowed to be exchanging cards, money and promissory notes where being given for collection of cash after voting while the election was going on and I believe this is the immediate cause of the reactions that we have all seen that has put us in Ekiti in a very bad light.

“But I want to say that if such anomalies continue, it is very likely that we would still be getting the same result. We have asked for a free and fair election and that is the minimum that we expect from the party and that is the minimum that we would accept as the final outcome.

“We want a free and fair election , we do not want anybody throwing money around while election has started under any disguise, it is a total aberration , it is against the electoral law, anybody that is found culpable should excuse from this process.

On the alleged removal of the party chairman by a section of the party, Arise said, “ I don’t think that there is anybody who will support that, act of gangsterism would not be tolerated and should not be tolerated, there is a procedure to remove the party chairman, I’m not fully aware of what was responsible for that and I believe election of the state executives would be coming up very soon and their names are the name on the delegates list that we recognised. So a lot of complications has already set in there.

“But I don’t think any of the aspirants is in the know of the intention to remove the chairman of the party, Whatever we are going to do in this party must be a collective responsibility of every stakeholder

On whether he still has confidence on the Governor Tanko Almakura electoral Committee, Arise said, “I understand many of us have been shortchanged by the way and manner some members of the committee found their names in the committee and that have been expressed.

“Almakura went as far as changing the secretary, but there is general consensus of the participants of this election that, that committee is compromised because a particular aspirant has been fingered to be the one that nominated most of the members, in such a way that every other contestant is at disadvantage.

Commenting on the statement that the botched process will continue from where it stopped, Arise said that, “our discussion with governor Almakura is that he should come back, fix a date for a fresh election. It is clear to everyone that once a ballot escaped from the box, it becomes invalid, and I’m sure there are legal authorities to be cited to educate whoever is suggesting that we can start or continue with an election that has been botched somehow and when you look at it there are some ballot papers that were thrown around, while people were trying to salvage it, there is no doubt that the integrity of that has been compromised.

“A lot of information about that botched process are flying around that some people are leading, some have no votes, who counted it, where did they got those figures they are banding around, some of these information have been filtering out and it goes without being said that when a ballot is compromised, there is no room for you to substitute and say let me take that one out and start counting the rest, unless the election is finished and if there is any dispute about any ballot , it can be set aside.

“So we don’t know how many were destroyed, because it rained heavily and was in the wet situation that the boxes were scattered. I don’t think we need to beat about the bush about the next line of action, we are not interested in protracted legal tussle”.

Arise lamented that there is no doubt in any body’s mind that things are not going on well with the party, saying “The earlier we able to put our house in order the better the chances of our party in the election, the situation on the ground is very tense and I believe we are going to Abuja to meet our leader and found out the way forward. So that this problem would not drag for too long and things we have been fighting against which is the ground norm for corruption, when a person gets into office under questionable circumstances and we condone that , then we have no business complaining about corruption, if we can not do the very minimum that is expected of us as citizens to ensure that the process is fair to everyone, then you have given room for a lot of doubt, questions, misgivings. For us we want to see real change in our polity, our country and way of behaviours, that is the minimum standard”.

Calling on the leadership of the party not to delay in resolving the crisis, by ensuring that sanction is apportioned appropriately and as quickly as possible, Arise said,“ We have competitions in the incumbent Governor that we want to remove and which I believe by the special grace of God, we would remove him”, he said.

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains massive in scale due to ongoing hostilities: 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains concerning as conflict contin- ues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and some 3.0 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Large-scale displacements continue to take place every month with 21,807 new arrivals to various locations in March alone. In addition, close to 930,000 remain in areas hard to reach for international aid organisations, mostly in Borno State.",North-east Nigeria: Humanitarian Dashboard (January - March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-dashboard-january-march-2018
6,nigeria,"OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.6 million persons are internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security and nutrition situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and as the lean season (May through September) is about to kick off. The new Cadre Harmonisé analysis – which provides an updated understanding of the food security and nutrition situation – was issued, revealing that the number of people estimated to be facing critical and crisis food and nutrition insecurity levels (IPC 3 and 4) in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe stands at 2.3 million for March-May and up to 3 million projected for June-August.

In March, the operational environment deteriorated sharply with the killing of three aid workers in Rann, in Kala/Balge local government area (LGA) in Borno State, during an attack by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) against Nigerian armed forces.

Three female paramedical aid workers were also abducted during the attack and remain unaccounted for. This attack, which took place on 1 March, raised serious concerns regarding the preservation and expansion of the current humanitarian space and the dangers faced by aid workers as they attempt to access vulnerable persons in hard-to-reach areas. Following the attack, all relocatable humanitarian workers were evacuated out of Rann for close to three weeks and little to no assistance was delivered to people in need during that time. Although life-saving activities were able to resume in a progressive manner towards the end of the month, much time was lost in preparing for the rainy season (June through September) in a town that tends to become unreachable by road for months on end due to flooding. The construction of a humanitarian hub, a common storage site and a helipad were delayed pending a new security assessment of the chosen location. As time before the rains start is running out, it is crucial that work on these three projects resume as soon as possible.

Large-scale population movements, caused largely by insecurity, continued with 21,807 new arrivals in March alone. This represents a sharp increase of 75 per cent compared to February and poses major humanitarian challenges as resources are often already overstretched in the locations in which these civilians arrive. With hostilities ongoing, these trends are likely to continue at least until the rainy season starts in May/June. On 24 March, the Government of Nigeria opened the MaiduguriBama-Banki road, in Borno State, to civilian traffic, triggering thousands of population movements along this axis. In addition, the Government has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Maiduguri to Bama where rehabilitation of public and private infrastructure is underway. The UN and its partners are calling for close coordination with the federal and state authorities to ensure that any returns and relocations are carried out following internationally recognised standards of dignity, safety and voluntariness. The UN and partners are also calling for the return of civilian authorities to all return areas and the rebuilding of infrastructure and municipal services.

The north-east is also grappling with two new cholera outbreaks: one in Borno State (in Kukawa LGA), which broke out on 13 February and stands at 646 cases with three associated deaths; and one in Yobe State (in Bade, Karasuwa, Yusufari and Bursari LGAs) which started on 28 March, and stands at 44 cases with seven deaths (with a worrisome case fatality rate of 6.4 per cent). A timely and coordinated response by health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) partners has been put in place, including prevention measures, and the outbreaks are expected to be under control in the coming weeks. As the rainy season approaches, preparedness measures are being put in place to limit disease transmission.

Another challenge in March were the heavy winds which have caused repeated fire outbreaks in Borno State, destroying large numbers of shelters, food supplies and other critical items across camps in the state (in Mafa, Jere, Monguno and Kala/Balge LGAs). Although humanitarian organisations were able to respond rapidly with emergency shelter kits and distributions of other life-saving items, fires are creating major gaps in the affected locations. Fire sensitisation campaigns and other mitigation measures, such as fire stations in heavily congested camps, are ongoing or being rolled out.

Overall, the humanitarian response in north-east Nigeria is hampered by the lack of funding for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Currently, most activities can only be implemented thanks to carry-over funding from 2017 (US$196 million) which will soon run out. For the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be urgently received across all the sectors","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update - Progress on key activities from the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-progress-key-activities-2018

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

The humanitarian crisis in Nigeria’s north-east remains one of the most severe in the world today. In 2017, there were 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the worst conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The crisis is considered a protection crisis first and foremost, that is closely linked to food scarcity and insecurity and high levels of need for basic life-saving assistance and services. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of a conflict that has led to widespread forced displacement and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

In March 2017, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2349, strongly condemning all terrorist attacks, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses by Boko Haram and ISIL, and urged all parties to the conflict to ensure respect for and protection of humanitarian personnel, facilities, and their means of transport and equipment, and to facilitate safe, timely and unhindered access for humanitarian oganisations to deliver life-saving aid to affected people.

Protection concerns

Protection of civilians was a key priority for humanitarians in 2017. Women, men and children faced grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, over 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of women and girls abducted and, in 2017, over 110 children were used as so-called “suicide” bombers. Toward the latter half of 2017, a surge in attacks by non-state armed groups claimed dozens of lives and injured countless others.

Internal displacement and returns

In 2017, more than 1.6 million people were internally displaced in the three worst crisis-affected states – with 80 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Borno State, the epicentre of the crisis. Over half live outside of IDP camps in local communities. Freedom of movement of all IDPs, including refugee returnees, was limited by continued security threats in areas such as Banki, Pulka, Bama, Gwoza, Ngala and Damasak. Nonetheless, 1.3 million people returned home in 2017, indicating that conditions in some locations had improved. Meanwhile, an estimated 930,000 people remain in hard-to-reach areas and humanitarian actors were not able to assess their situation, or to provide them with aid.

Food insecurity and malnutrition

By the end of the year, the risk of famine had been averted in north-east Nigeria in locations where humanitarians had access. The number of people estimated to be facing food insecurity reduced from 5.2 million during June to August 2017 to 2.6 million during October to December 2017³. This improvement was due to (i) improved security conditions that allowed for farming activities in locations that were previously not safe and an upturn in market and trade activity; (ii) delivery of food and livelihood support to almost 3 million people every month (including 2 million per month with just food assistance) since the start of the year; and (iii) favourable climatic conditions for farming.

An estimated 450,000 children under the age of five suffered from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in 2017. SAM kits were provided to over 30 stabilisation centres to treat more than 7,000 children suffering from SAM with medical complications, and over 150 health professionals from the Health Ministry and NGOs were trained on in-patient management of SAM. The integration of the provision of safe drinking water, adequate sanitation services and safer food and hygiene practices into nutrition activities were required to improve the health of people in need and help combat malnutrition.

Disease outbreaks, including malaria and cholera

A highly vulnerable population, consisting largely of children (58 per cent), continued to be at high risk of disease outbreaks since routine vaccinations, e.g., polio and measles, had been interrupted for many years, . Two thirds of the health facilities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states were damaged by the conflict. The continuous influx of returnees and overcrowding of camps continued to increase the risk of outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than half of recorded deaths in Borno State were due to malaria, more than all other causes of death combined.

Finally, the cholera outbreak that was declared in mid-August 2017 in Borno State, was brought under control following a solid collaboration between health partners and water, sanitation and hygiene partners, and a cholera vaccination campaign in the most at-risk areas of Borno State which reached more than 900,000 people. By the time the epidemic was declared over in December 2017, there had been over 5,300 recorded cases and 61 deaths.

Access and security

The humanitarian access and security situation in the northeast remains challenging for humanitarian partners and has had significant implications on relief operations in 2017.

The north-east of Nigeria, especially Borno State, has experienced a significant increase in military operations in the second half of the year which have resulted in major civilian displacement, access restrictions along main routes and security incidents in previously secure areas.

The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) estimates that around 85 per cent of the target population (5.2 million people) can be reached with aid while an estimated 930,000 people remain in areas that are hard to reach for UN agencies and international NGOs. In Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, three local government areas (LGAs) are currently completely inaccessible for UN and international NGO humanitarian services, whereas 26 are partially accessible and 37 are fully accessible.

All of the three inaccessible and the majority of the partially accessible (19) LGAs are located in Borno State. Due to the lack of access of humanitarian partners to these areas, the identification of potential needs as well as independent context and security assessments have largely not been possible.",Nigeria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

The lingering crisis affecting the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) has taken a new dimension as the Nigerian Copyright Commission has suspended its operating licence.

Coson’s Head, Corporate Affairs, Chibueze Okereke, confirmed the development in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Friday.

According to him, COSON’s lawyers headed by Uche Val Obi (SAN) are challenging NCC’s ruling at the court of appeal.

An entertainment lawyer, Akinyemi Ayinoluwa, had earlier shared the news on his official Instagram page on Friday.

Mr Ayinoluwa posted a copy of the ruling, which was ‘authorised’ by the minister of justice, Abubakar Malami.

According to the new ruling, COSON is no longer authorised under law to collect royalties on behalf of and for musicians and other performing artists in Nigeria.

The Commission is the government agency empowered by law to oversee the affairs of COSON and other agencies under its supervision.

This comes after a petition written by artiste, 2face Idibia to the Commission asking it to wade into the crisis at COSON between its chairman Tony Okoroji and Efe Omorogbe.

Efe Omorogbe continues to insist that he is the recognised chairman of COSON.

Some members of the commission’s board installed Mr Omorogbe as the new chairman, having legally recalled Mr Okoroji from his position as chairman of COSON. This happened in December.

The former was replaced over allegations of impropriety.

It was alleged that Mr Okoroji collects 10 per cent commission on licensing income deemed to have been brought in by him and primarily, because he contracts COSON projects and events to his company, TOPS Limited.

Despite Mr Omorogbe’s election, Mr Okoroji was reinstated as the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting of COSON, held on December 19.

A faction of the board loyal to Mr Okoroji reinstated him and sacked those who voted for Mr Omorogbe.

The crisis got messier in April as police from Zone II Command Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, arraigned Mr Omorogbe before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for alleged impersonation and forgery.

According to the prosecuting officer, Friday Mameh, the defendants (Mr Omorogbe and others) had stormed the meeting of venue of the COSON chairman, with thugs on December 7, 2017 and conducted themselves (in a manner) likely to cause breach of peace.

Mr Mameh alleged that Mr Omorogbe and others forged the COSON letter-headed papers, “with intent to defraud, knowingly use the forged COSON letter headed with intent that it may in anyway be used or acted upon as genuine whether in Nigeria or elsewhere to the prejudice of COSON.”

Mr Omorogbe and others pleaded not guilty.

Their counsel, S. Ehiwelele and Chibuzor Nwankobi had prayed the court to admit them to bail on liberal terms.",COSON Crisis: NCC suspends copyright society’s operating license,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/267313-coson-crisis-ncc-suspends-copyright-societys-operating-license.html

12,nigeria,"Port Harcourt — The Federal Government could ignite a crisis, if its planned resumption of oil exploration in Ogoniland goes ahead without the resolution of key issues.The warning by stakeholders in the Niger Delta is coming on the heels of last weekend's meeting between the leadership of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu. The meeting had sought to find solutions to the crisis in Ogoniland.

Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was forced to stop exploration and leave Ogoniland in 1993, following an upheaval that caused the death of several Ogoni persons.The President of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, told The Guardian that the meeting proves the Federal Government cares nothing about the tragic experiences the Ogoni people have gone through, including the murder of Ken Saro- Wiwa and other prominent Ogoni activists.

""Government has not learnt anything. What this means is that it values oil more than the Ogoni people and their lives. They are yet to clean the environment and they are talking about the resumption of oil production. I don't think they will have an environment conducive to oil exploration in Ogoni,"" said Omare.

South-South Zonal Director, Civil Liberty Organisation, Steven Obodoekwe, said since government and the oil companies have not shown commitment to cleaning up the devastated Ogoni environment, their desperation to resume oil production therefore amounts to callousness and ""fresh corporate terrorism.""

The ideal thing would have been for the government to ensure the environment is completely restored before contemplating renewed exploration in the area, stressed Obodoekwe.A Shell spokesman, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that though the company's lease for Oil Mining Leases (OML11) has been renewed, it does not cover the over 30 Ogoni oilfields.He explained that contrary to the allegation that Shell wants to return to Ogoni through the backdoor, the company which was forced out of Ogoni in 1993 following an uprising does not intend to resume oil production. Shell's leases for OML 11 was expected to expire by June 2019.

There has been growing tension in Ogoni since the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) wrote to Shell last year that it had given preliminary approval to a RoboMichael Limited which had expressed interest in obtaining licensing rights of Ogoni oilfields. It was learnt that Shell had already given its approval to RoboMichael.

The endorsement of RoboMichael Limited by NAPIMS and Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers respectively had caused MOSOP and other groups to allege that RoboMichael was Shell's proxy, an allegation which the oil major has denied.

Amnesty International's Business and Human Rights Researcher, Mark Dummett, regretted failure by the government and Shell to implement recommendations by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

""Following its groundbreaking survey of 2011, UNEP clearly laid out the path by which the environment of Ogoniland could be made free of the contamination that has devastated it for so long. The government has created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) to organise the cleanup, but little has so far been achieved, and there is no transparency over its plans,"" Amnesty's Rights researcher Dummett said.

MOSOP had told Kachikwu it was not opposed to discussions on the resumption of oil production, but that the consent of the people must first be obtained.It stated ""unequivocally"" that the contentious issue involves three main parties - the Federal Government, the oil industry led by Shell, and the Ogoni people. ""Any attempt to deal with any aspect of the issue must necessarily involve the three principal actors, as stakeholders in a joint project of finding a lasting solution to the Ogoni crisis,"" it said.

MOSOP, therefore, warned it would ""resist the present attempt by the Federal Government and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria to arbitrarily award the Ogoni fields in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11 without consultation with the Ogoni community.""

The President of the movement, Legborsi Pyagbara, stressed that besides the environmental damage that attended Shell's operations, Ogoni people are distressed about their lack of participation in the value chain of the oil industry, including employment; the absence of well-defined Community Benefit Sharing Agreements (CBAs); and a sustainable development process that recognises the rights of the people to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), in accordance with global best practices.

Pyagbara described attempts in the last few years to use money to ""buy support"" from the people as ""condemnable"" and ""reprehensible"". Such move, he said, is ""against the spirit of transparency and accountability required in the extractive sector.""He cautioned: ""Societies the world over have met this challenge through deliberate and clear actions, and the Federal Government should urgently look in this direction. For, if the Nigerian government fails to protect the Ogoni people, it certainly cannot protect itself. History is replete with the ruins of societies that were built on the sort of injustices that have pervaded Ogoniland over the years.""

The MOSOP President urged the government to set up a better framework of engagement under which the parties involved would have a level-playing field for discussions on the future of oil production in Ogoniland.

According to him, Nigeria will be judged, not by its false claims about developments in Ogoniland, but by how it actually protects the weak, the vulnerable and those whose lives have been imperiled by reckless oil exploration of multinationals.Pyagbara disclosed that the Ogoni people, at the behest of MOSOP, have set up a strategic committee representing the various interests in Ogoni, headed by Prof. Ben Naanen, an economic historian and resource governance expert. This will develop a template to harmonise existing positions and guide the people in engagements with the Federal Government and the oil industry. Once the people adopt the template, Ogoniland will be ready for engagement and consultation on oil exploration, he said.

Meanwhile, youths in the Niger Delta have been urged to create an enabling business environment to attract investors to the region.SPDC's General Manager, External Relations and Social Investment, Mr. Igo Weli, disclosed this while delivering a public lecture organised by the Rivers State University's Centre of Excellence in Marine Engineering and Offshore Technology.

Speaking on the theme, 'An enabling Business Environment - Implication for Future Careers in Oil and Gas Industry', Weli noted that unlike in past years, many companies have left the region due to its unfriendly business atmosphere.He stressed the need for proper conflict management to reverse the situation.","Nigeria: Again, Stakeholders Warn Govt, Oil Firms On Crisis in Ogoni",http://allafrica.com/stories/201805080253.html

14,nigeria,"Introduction

Reflecting its responsibility and commitment to ensure that protection is central to all aspects of the humanitarian response in northeast Nigeria, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has developed this Centrality of Protection Strategy to provide vision, guidance and a basis for an operational approach. While acknowledging that the primary responsibility to protect civilian populations lies with the Government of Nigeria, the HCT commits to demonstrating the necessary leadership to fulfill the shared responsibility to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights.

Having this strategy recognizes the significance and overarching imperative to have a comprehensive approach to providing affected populations the means to live their lives in safety and dignity, especially in times of crisis or conflict. It also emphasizes the HCT’s accountability to affected populations when addressing identified protection risks or violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

Addressing the key protection concerns in northeast Nigeria is the joint responsibility of all partners and requires coherent and complementary approaches. The HCT in Nigeria, consisting of INGO, UN and donor representatives, aims to ensure a system-wide achievement of protection priorities in recognition of this. As this is the case, the HCT Centrality of Protection Strategy was developed through a consultative process with HCT and Operational HCT (OHCT) members, the Protection Sector and its AORs.

Through this shared vision, the HCT commits to three overall objectives in the Centrality of Protection Strategy: 1) To create and sustain a protective environment; 2) To enhance protection through freedom of movement and enhanced access; and 3) To ensure protection mainstreaming into the humanitarian response and decision-making.",Centrality of Protection Strategy - Humanitarian Country Team Nigeria December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/centrality-protection-strategy-humanitarian-country-team-nigeria-december-2017
15,nigeria,"Nigeria’s drug abuse problem has been put under the spotlight by a new investigative documentary.

Across several major Nigerian cities, many young adults are known to be addicted to several illicit drugs but, in recent years, opioid-based cough syrups in particular have become a serious menace.

In Sweet Sweet Codeine, an investigative documentary by the BBC, reporters secretly film staff of three major pharmaceutical companies offering to sell thousands of codeine-based cough syrup bottles in illicit deals. The complicity of these companies which produce cough syrups locally helps explain the widespread availability of the drugs despite a government ban on over-the-counter sales. The documentary is the first for BBC’s Africa Eye, a new TV investigations strand, the latest in BBC’s expansion across Africa.

With local pharmaceutical production unregulated by government, cough syrups are being produced on an industrial scale. While drug makers are legally bound to only supply to pharmacies which in turn sell to patients with prescriptions, corrupt staff are taking advantage of the high demand on the black market and running parallel drug syndicates. Following the BBC investigation, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, one of Nigeria’s largest, has suspended the distribution of codeine cough syrup. It came after an Emzor executive was filmed cutting a deal to illegally supply cough syrup bottles.

Nigeria’s health ministry has also announced a ban on importing and producing codeine-based cough syrups.

Catching them young

The target market in the illicit codeine trade typically consists of teenagers and young adults looking for a cheap high. At a price of around 1,000 naira ($3), codeine is exactly that. Even though it is illegal to sell codeine cough syrups without a doctor’s prescription, the drugs remain widely available. It is common to find them casually consumed, sometimes as part of mixtures, at local bars and parties.

Taking codeine has become “cool” as pop culture references about the opioid have proliferated, particularly in the booming Afrobeats scene . “Diet“, an Afrobeats song with the refrain, “on a Codeine diet” has become a big hit for three of Nigeria’s biggest pop stars while the risque music video for Science Student by Olamide was banned by Nigerian media regulators. Codeine references also litter American hip hop as several big name artists, including rapper Lil’ Wayne, have released codeine-inspired tracks.

The thousands of young Nigerians already addicted are at risk of suffering from effects of sustained opioid abuse ranging from schizophrenia to organ failure.

The problem is more acute in Nigeria’s vast north where millions of young adults are unemployed. Its prevalence is also rooted in cultural nuances: with the sale of alcohol banned across most northern states mainly for religious reasons, young adults and teenagers often turn to cheap opioid-based drugs, especially codeine cough syrups, as an alternative. Those who cannot afford codeine syrups turn to more extreme options including lizard dung and cobwebs.

Isa Mohammed, a Kano-based pharmacist attributes the rampant abuse in the north to “access and supply”. Last October, Nigeria’s senate claimed around three million bottles of codeine syrups were consumed daily in two northern states alone. A measure of the scale of the problem, last month, the anti-drug agency seized a truckload of 24,000 bottles of codeine cough syrups in a single incident. The effects of the access to the cheap opioid on a mostly Muslim youth in the wake of poverty and a lack of employment, Mohammed says, “is disastrous.”

Bureaucratic bottlenecks

Nigeria’s government made little progress in curbing the problem. A ban on over the counter sales hardly dented the problem as unregulated production and illicit trade ensure that the drug remains available. It’s unlikely that the ban on sales without prescriptions has been implemented at all of the thousands of drug stores across the country.

Beyond attempting to stop over the counter sales without prescriptions, the government had been slow to act until the ban yesterday (May 1). Indeed a committee was set up in January to look into codeine abuse but its findings and recommendation, initially expected six weeks later, have not been published by the health ministry.

Over Nigeria’s borders, neighboring countries face a similar opioid crisis with Tramadol, a cheap but addictive pain relief medicine. Benin, which borders Nigeria’s west, is the second largest destination for Indian Tramadol globally. Some of the worst affected countries in West Africa are yet to make significant progress in tackling the opioid abuse.

Local advocacy groups recommend regulating production and distribution of drugs as a better solution to the opioid abuse problem. Adeyemi Oluwatosin, editor-in-chief of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, says one way to do that is by finally adopting the national drug distribution guidelines—a policy to regulate the distribution of drugs and eliminate open drug markets as well fake drugs. Five years after it was first proposed however, the policy remains unimplemented.

As for Mohammed, an outright ban alone will only be a temporary fix if government does not take on the much tougher problem of regulation. Addicts, he says, will likely turn to abusing other drugs, some with worse effects. “Banning codeine is not the issue, regulation of drugs is what we need,” he tells Quartz. “If we’re not regulating, then we’re just wasting our time and people will keep dying.”

17,nigeria,"At the end of April 2018, President Trump met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. It was a very important meeting as President Buhari was the first president from sub-Saharan Africa to visit President Trump at the White House. President Trump was reportedly very interested in the conflict between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria’s Middle Belt. President Trump has caused outcry for the sympathy he has expressed for the Christian farmers targeted by the Fulani herdsmen. However, such criticism may have been ignorant. Indeed, President Trump may not be wrong on the Fulani herdsmen crisis in Nigeria.

The Fulani herdsmen, also known as the Fulani militia, are a semi-nomadic, pastoralist ethnic group living in the central regions of Nigeria, predominately in the Middle Belt. The majority of the Fulani herdsmen are Muslim. They have clashed with indigenous tribes and local, mainly Christian, farmers over grazing land over the centuries. However, as Open Doors explains, the clashes intensified around the time of the 2011 and 2015 elections, and again earlier this year. The regions most affected by the violence include the areas of Jama’a, Kachia, Kagarko, Kaura and Sanga in southern Kaduna.

The atrocities perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen include the destruction of houses and churches, as well as the seizure of land and properties belonging to Christian owners. Reports have also emerged of the Fulani herdsmen ‘kidnapping Christian schoolgirls to marry them to Muslim men.’ In its 2015 report, Open Doors lists detailed examples of such targeted attacks. The report rebuts the argument that the clashes were caused by environmental degradation and resulting migration. The report presents a more comprehensive picture incorporating some elements of religious persecution. Indeed, the conflict is extremely complex.

Despite this, according to BBC, President Buhari was reportedly quick to deflect the issues stating that ‘The problem of cattle herders is a very long historical problem. Before now, cattle herders were known to carry sticks and machetes… but these ones are carrying AK-47s.’ If this is the case, the question is then, what the Nigerian government is doing to resolve the ongoing conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers; investigate the crimes and prosecute the perpetrators; investigate the supply chain of AK-47s; consider the potential religious component to the conflict; and assist all victims of the conflict?

While President Buhari is often praised for his fight against deeply rooted corruption in Nigeria and his pro-active approach to the atrocities committed by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria (although some of these pro-active steps are currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court), the conflict in the Middle Belt does not appear to gain the government’s attention or trigger decisive actions. This is of particular importance because of the militarization of the Fulani herdsmen and because of similar violence against Christian minorities in northern Nigeria (although conducted by a different actor). Considering the widespread use of AK-47’s by Fulani herdsmen, greater action from the Nigerian government would be expected. This is of increased importance in light of yet more news that Nigeria is home to over 350 million illegal weapons. Furthermore, the religious component cannot be neglected. Open Doors reported that between 2006 and 2014, 9,000 - 11,500 Christians were killed and over 13,000 churches destroyed in northern Nigeria. Those numbers are not insignificant and the effect of such targeted atrocities cannot be ignored. Indeed, the destruction of 13,000 churches is likely to have affected close to 1.3 million Christians in the region and do adversely affected their right to practice their religion as well as marginalised the group as a whole.

Refreshing or ignorant, many may not agree with President Trump’s bold delivery of his opinions. In case of the issue of the Fulani herdsmen, their attacks on farmers in the Middle Belt and the continued ignorance of the Nigerian government, it is such controversial statements which may trigger the needed change (as per political pressure). The situation in the Middle Belt requires urgent attention and decisive actions. President Buhari’s dismissive approach is not justified.",Trump May Not Be Wrong On the Fulani Herdsmen Crisis In Nigeria,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/04/trump-may-not-be-wrong-on-the-fulani-herdsmen-crisis-in-nigeria/
