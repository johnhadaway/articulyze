0,nigeria,"…Reports el-Rufai to ILO

The employment crisis in Nigeria is a serious concerns to all well meaning Nigerians. This probably explains why the Kaduna State Government led by Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, has entered the bad books of Organised Labour in Nigeria as the only employer, whether public or private, that has sacked the highest number of workers in one swoop without caring about the social impacts and dislocations on workers and the lager society.

It was, therefore, no surprise that the plight of these workers and others in the state was one of the major issues raised in the May Day speech by the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba.

Under the sub-heading, Attack on Workers and Trade Union Rights by Kaduna State Government, Comrade Wabba informed that Congress has already reported the governor to the International Labour Organisation, ILO, for appropriate action among others.

He said: “We condemn in strong terms, the recent violation of workers’ and trade union rights by the Kaduna State Government where over 40,000 workers from various ministries, departments and agencies, tertiary institutions and the local government were issued sack letters without respect of labour laws and court pronouncements. This is with the intention of avoiding the payment of the terminal benefits of these workers. This is an act of cruelty and inhumanity to fellow humans and citizens.

“Also condemnable is the desperate attempt by the Kaduna State Government to deny the sacked workers and the trade unions their fundamental right to protest. The right of citizens to peaceful protest is a universal constitutional right that cannot be denied or wished away. The only requirement, according to our legal jurisprudence, is to inform the police for coverage.

No permission is required nor prior approval from the security services. The deployment of over 8,000 security agents to stop workers from protesting their illegal sack in Kaduna is an aberration and undemocratic especially in a situation where pro-government-sponsored protests in Kaduna are held regularly.

“Workers could recall that in 2012 when el-Rufai felt threatened by the policies of the then government, he wore NLC T-shirt and joined organised labour to protest from Berger Junction in Abuja. We wish to remind Governor el-Rufai that no condition is permanent. A day would come when he would once again need to gate-crash as a participant in workers’ protest. The Kaduna State Government has also refused to comply with Section 16A of the Trade Union Act. “

While noting that “as required by international conventions, a formal complaint has been filed at the ILO against the Kaduna State Government”, he called “on the governor to tread the path of honour and respect the rights of citizens.”

Challenge of Unemployment

On the ravaging employment crisis in the country, the NLC President said: “The unemployment rate in Nigeria increased to 18.80 per cent in the third quarter of 2017 from 16.20 per cent in the second quarter of 2017. Unemployment has remained high with an alarming proportion of our youths jobless.

The few that have a semblance of employment operate under very precarious conditions denoted by job insecurity, poor work conditions and gender discrimination. The trend of factory closures has continued to spiral out of control turning our once lively centres of economic productivity into worship and entertainment centres.

The crisis of widening unemployment in Nigeria has been exacerbated by indiscriminate sack and retrenchment of workers by some public and private employers. Unfortunately, the different levels of government that should be more concerned about protecting our people are the ones leading the campaign to push more Nigerians into the unemployment market.”","Labour no longer at ease with employment crisis, says NLC",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/labour-no-longer-ease-employment-crisis-says-nlc/

Reflecting its responsibility and commitment to ensure that protection is central to all aspects of the humanitarian response in northeast Nigeria, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has developed this Centrality of Protection Strategy to provide vision, guidance and a basis for an operational approach. While acknowledging that the primary responsibility to protect civilian populations lies with the Government of Nigeria, the HCT commits to demonstrating the necessary leadership to fulfill the shared responsibility to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights.

Having this strategy recognizes the significance and overarching imperative to have a comprehensive approach to providing affected populations the means to live their lives in safety and dignity, especially in times of crisis or conflict. It also emphasizes the HCT’s accountability to affected populations when addressing identified protection risks or violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

Addressing the key protection concerns in northeast Nigeria is the joint responsibility of all partners and requires coherent and complementary approaches. The HCT in Nigeria, consisting of INGO, UN and donor representatives, aims to ensure a system-wide achievement of protection priorities in recognition of this. As this is the case, the HCT Centrality of Protection Strategy was developed through a consultative process with HCT and Operational HCT (OHCT) members, the Protection Sector and its AORs.

Through this shared vision, the HCT commits to three overall objectives in the Centrality of Protection Strategy: 1) To create and sustain a protective environment; 2) To enhance protection through freedom of movement and enhanced access; and 3) To ensure protection mainstreaming into the humanitarian response and decision-making.",Centrality of Protection Strategy - Humanitarian Country Team Nigeria December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/centrality-protection-strategy-humanitarian-country-team-nigeria-december-2017
2,nigeria,"At the end of April 2018, President Trump met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. It was a very important meeting as President Buhari was the first president from sub-Saharan Africa to visit President Trump at the White House. President Trump was reportedly very interested in the conflict between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria’s Middle Belt. President Trump has caused outcry for the sympathy he has expressed for the Christian farmers targeted by the Fulani herdsmen. However, such criticism may have been ignorant. Indeed, President Trump may not be wrong on the Fulani herdsmen crisis in Nigeria.

The Fulani herdsmen, also known as the Fulani militia, are a semi-nomadic, pastoralist ethnic group living in the central regions of Nigeria, predominately in the Middle Belt. The majority of the Fulani herdsmen are Muslim. They have clashed with indigenous tribes and local, mainly Christian, farmers over grazing land over the centuries. However, as Open Doors explains, the clashes intensified around the time of the 2011 and 2015 elections, and again earlier this year. The regions most affected by the violence include the areas of Jama’a, Kachia, Kagarko, Kaura and Sanga in southern Kaduna.

The atrocities perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen include the destruction of houses and churches, as well as the seizure of land and properties belonging to Christian owners. Reports have also emerged of the Fulani herdsmen ‘kidnapping Christian schoolgirls to marry them to Muslim men.’ In its 2015 report, Open Doors lists detailed examples of such targeted attacks. The report rebuts the argument that the clashes were caused by environmental degradation and resulting migration. The report presents a more comprehensive picture incorporating some elements of religious persecution. Indeed, the conflict is extremely complex.

Despite this, according to BBC, President Buhari was reportedly quick to deflect the issues stating that ‘The problem of cattle herders is a very long historical problem. Before now, cattle herders were known to carry sticks and machetes… but these ones are carrying AK-47s.’ If this is the case, the question is then, what the Nigerian government is doing to resolve the ongoing conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers; investigate the crimes and prosecute the perpetrators; investigate the supply chain of AK-47s; consider the potential religious component to the conflict; and assist all victims of the conflict?

While President Buhari is often praised for his fight against deeply rooted corruption in Nigeria and his pro-active approach to the atrocities committed by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria (although some of these pro-active steps are currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court), the conflict in the Middle Belt does not appear to gain the government’s attention or trigger decisive actions. This is of particular importance because of the militarization of the Fulani herdsmen and because of similar violence against Christian minorities in northern Nigeria (although conducted by a different actor). Considering the widespread use of AK-47’s by Fulani herdsmen, greater action from the Nigerian government would be expected. This is of increased importance in light of yet more news that Nigeria is home to over 350 million illegal weapons. Furthermore, the religious component cannot be neglected. Open Doors reported that between 2006 and 2014, 9,000 - 11,500 Christians were killed and over 13,000 churches destroyed in northern Nigeria. Those numbers are not insignificant and the effect of such targeted atrocities cannot be ignored. Indeed, the destruction of 13,000 churches is likely to have affected close to 1.3 million Christians in the region and do adversely affected their right to practice their religion as well as marginalised the group as a whole.

Refreshing or ignorant, many may not agree with President Trump’s bold delivery of his opinions. In case of the issue of the Fulani herdsmen, their attacks on farmers in the Middle Belt and the continued ignorance of the Nigerian government, it is such controversial statements which may trigger the needed change (as per political pressure). The situation in the Middle Belt requires urgent attention and decisive actions. President Buhari’s dismissive approach is not justified.",Trump May Not Be Wrong On the Fulani Herdsmen Crisis In Nigeria,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/04/trump-may-not-be-wrong-on-the-fulani-herdsmen-crisis-in-nigeria/

A statement quoted the Nigerian partner, who is also the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Caritas Communications Limited, Adedayo Ojo, as saying, “This is a great opportunity for us and for Navigate Response.

“West Africa and especially the Gulf of Guinea, has seen more than its fair share of maritime incidents in recent years, not least with the rise in offshore piracy.

“Caritas can assist Navigate’s clients, who may be dealing with West Africa’s fragmented and often government-influenced media to help ensure accuracy and to protect the client’s licence to operate within the region.”

Along with Nigeria, the firm was said to have accepted Italy as a member of the crisis network.

The statement quoted the senior communications professional representing the Italian partner, Riccardo Masnata as saying, “I am delighted to be part of Navigate’s global network. I believe partnership is paramount in any crisis, when maritime stakeholders and media relations need to be managed.”

The Chief Operations Officer, Navigate Response, Dustin Eno, was quoted as saying, “We are delighted to bring two more communications specialists into our global response network. Their teams add both crisis management expertise and vital knowledge of regional media landscapes.”

“Our network of 42 offices in 28 countries provides our clients with unrivalled access to local experts backed up by the global experience necessary to respond effectively to any maritime incident.”

5,nigeria,"Nigeria’s drug abuse problem has been put under the spotlight by a new investigative documentary.

Across several major Nigerian cities, many young adults are known to be addicted to several illicit drugs but, in recent years, opioid-based cough syrups in particular have become a serious menace.

In Sweet Sweet Codeine, an investigative documentary by the BBC, reporters secretly film staff of three major pharmaceutical companies offering to sell thousands of codeine-based cough syrup bottles in illicit deals. The complicity of these companies which produce cough syrups locally helps explain the widespread availability of the drugs despite a government ban on over-the-counter sales. The documentary is the first for BBC’s Africa Eye, a new TV investigations strand, the latest in BBC’s expansion across Africa.

With local pharmaceutical production unregulated by government, cough syrups are being produced on an industrial scale. While drug makers are legally bound to only supply to pharmacies which in turn sell to patients with prescriptions, corrupt staff are taking advantage of the high demand on the black market and running parallel drug syndicates. Following the BBC investigation, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, one of Nigeria’s largest, has suspended the distribution of codeine cough syrup. It came after an Emzor executive was filmed cutting a deal to illegally supply cough syrup bottles.

Nigeria’s health ministry has also announced a ban on importing and producing codeine-based cough syrups.

Catching them young

The target market in the illicit codeine trade typically consists of teenagers and young adults looking for a cheap high. At a price of around 1,000 naira ($3), codeine is exactly that. Even though it is illegal to sell codeine cough syrups without a doctor’s prescription, the drugs remain widely available. It is common to find them casually consumed, sometimes as part of mixtures, at local bars and parties.

Taking codeine has become “cool” as pop culture references about the opioid have proliferated, particularly in the booming Afrobeats scene . “Diet“, an Afrobeats song with the refrain, “on a Codeine diet” has become a big hit for three of Nigeria’s biggest pop stars while the risque music video for Science Student by Olamide was banned by Nigerian media regulators. Codeine references also litter American hip hop as several big name artists, including rapper Lil’ Wayne, have released codeine-inspired tracks.

The thousands of young Nigerians already addicted are at risk of suffering from effects of sustained opioid abuse ranging from schizophrenia to organ failure.

The problem is more acute in Nigeria’s vast north where millions of young adults are unemployed. Its prevalence is also rooted in cultural nuances: with the sale of alcohol banned across most northern states mainly for religious reasons, young adults and teenagers often turn to cheap opioid-based drugs, especially codeine cough syrups, as an alternative. Those who cannot afford codeine syrups turn to more extreme options including lizard dung and cobwebs.

Isa Mohammed, a Kano-based pharmacist attributes the rampant abuse in the north to “access and supply”. Last October, Nigeria’s senate claimed around three million bottles of codeine syrups were consumed daily in two northern states alone. A measure of the scale of the problem, last month, the anti-drug agency seized a truckload of 24,000 bottles of codeine cough syrups in a single incident. The effects of the access to the cheap opioid on a mostly Muslim youth in the wake of poverty and a lack of employment, Mohammed says, “is disastrous.”

Bureaucratic bottlenecks

Nigeria’s government made little progress in curbing the problem. A ban on over the counter sales hardly dented the problem as unregulated production and illicit trade ensure that the drug remains available. It’s unlikely that the ban on sales without prescriptions has been implemented at all of the thousands of drug stores across the country.

Beyond attempting to stop over the counter sales without prescriptions, the government had been slow to act until the ban yesterday (May 1). Indeed a committee was set up in January to look into codeine abuse but its findings and recommendation, initially expected six weeks later, have not been published by the health ministry.

Over Nigeria’s borders, neighboring countries face a similar opioid crisis with Tramadol, a cheap but addictive pain relief medicine. Benin, which borders Nigeria’s west, is the second largest destination for Indian Tramadol globally. Some of the worst affected countries in West Africa are yet to make significant progress in tackling the opioid abuse.

Local advocacy groups recommend regulating production and distribution of drugs as a better solution to the opioid abuse problem. Adeyemi Oluwatosin, editor-in-chief of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, says one way to do that is by finally adopting the national drug distribution guidelines—a policy to regulate the distribution of drugs and eliminate open drug markets as well fake drugs. Five years after it was first proposed however, the policy remains unimplemented.

As for Mohammed, an outright ban alone will only be a temporary fix if government does not take on the much tougher problem of regulation. Addicts, he says, will likely turn to abusing other drugs, some with worse effects. “Banning codeine is not the issue, regulation of drugs is what we need,” he tells Quartz. “If we’re not regulating, then we’re just wasting our time and people will keep dying.”

6,nigeria,"I regret to inform you that president Buhari has done it again. Just over two years ago, I had cause to defend the constituency of which I am a part when he made remarks in London during a newspaper interview implying that Nigerians abroad have a single story of criminality. A few days ago during a Commonwealth Business Forum session, in London yet again (what is it about London that triggers the president one wonders), he made comments that kicked up an almighty firestorm among young Nigerians. His supporters will try to say it was a slip, but it’s a slip he keeps making.

In answering, or trying to answer, questions about Nigeria’s troubled north east, the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA)—which Nigeria pulled out of signing at the last minute—and Nigeria’s economy in general, he delivered a broadside at Nigeria’s young population saying they were lazy and entitled and perhaps deluded.

More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.

What was most amusing, for lack of a better word, was not whether young Nigerians are deluded. It was the idea that a Nigerian government has any of the above gifts in its power to dispense.

It is impossible to exaggerate the damage that has been done to Nigerian education over many years. It is the president’s comments about education that are most painful and downright cruel. It is impossible to exaggerate the damage that has been done to Nigerian education over many years. Routinely, at every stage, it fails young Nigerians and then delivers them into the job market with no skills or preparation to take on the world and make a success of their lives. And they are the lucky ones—UNICEF estimates that Nigeria has 10.5 million children of school age who do not get into school at all, the highest in the world.

Following the journey of children through the Nigerian education system, and the federal funding that follows them, is a traumatic exercise. At the primary school level (the responsibility of cash-strapped and hapless state governments) and secondary levels (where the federal government steps in with a relatively minor role), funding for education is terribly squeezed or even non-existent. Though many millions will drop off along the way, for the students who manage to make it to higher education the federal government then turns on the funding tap.

In the proposed 2018 budget (pdf, pg 1228) the federal government proposes to spend a total of 606 billion naira ($1.7 billion) on education. About 400 billion naira of this total (65%) goes directly to higher education. The federal government’s contribution to basic education gets 114 billion naira (96% of which goes to salaries) via the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). The over 100 secondary schools the federal government is responsible for, collectively known as ‘unity schools’, get a total of 32 billion naira to share among themselves, 8% of what goes to universities.

How Nigeria came to neglect and debase primary and secondary education and then dedicate the biggest chunk of its budget to tertiary education has many reasons but two in particular stand out.

If young Nigerians “haven’t been to school” as the president said, it is no accident—it is the outcome of a system designed to do just that. First, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is easily one of the most effective unions in Nigeria in terms of getting the government to bend to its will. It is impossible to write Nigeria’s history since 1978 when the union was formed without documenting the numerous strikes they have embarked on. As a victim of Nigerian universities myself, one year was added to my university education by ASUU strikes and I can be considered lucky, many others had more than a year added.

These strikes and ASUU’s relationship with the government are almost comical to observe. They demand money, government ignores them, they go on strike, the government agrees to their (impossible) demands, they go back to work. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief waiting for the inevitable accusations from ASUU that the government has reneged on its agreement. Most recently it claimed the government owes universities 800 billion naira, more than double what they are to receive in this year’s budget. At some point in the near future they will go on strike again and the government will pay up in some form.

Looking for something to do (Reuters/Afolabi Sotunde)

The second reason explains why ASUU’s strikes are so effective. As a result of the government absconding from the lower levels of education, more children are being educated privately at primary and secondary levels than in the public school system. A 2014 report by the World Bank (pdf, pg 9) showed that registered and unregistered private schools accounted for 75% of all school enrollment in Lagos state, the country’s most populous. A few days ago, the junior education minister disclosed that just 80,000 students wrote the entrance exams to get into one of the government’s unity schools. It is a sad testament to how far they have fallen that parents, who can afford better private schools for their wards, no longer bother to get them into what were once considered elite institutions. Nevertheless, over 1.7 million students wrote the university entrance exams last year, competing for around 500,000 university spaces.

Tying these two reasons together, a simple power dynamic emerges. The Nigerian middle class and the politically powerful elite who can cause the government a great deal of discomfort have long abandoned public education at the primary and secondary levels. Were primary and secondary teaching unions to go on strike demanding more money like ASUU, they might not make the news at all. But public universities continue to educate the vast majority of higher education students in the country. For the rich and powerful, the other options are the handful of private universities or sending their kids abroad (like president Buhari does). Both options are currently exercised by a minority of people, albeit a growing one. Thus, any hostage taking via strikes is very effective at getting the government to capitulate.

There is no sign that the government recognizes that the nation is in the grip of an education crisis at all levels. This power dynamic is best illustrated with the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND). In 1993, a decree, by the then military government, established the Education Tax Fund (ETF) which mandated a 2% tax on the profits of all companies in Nigeria. The fund was to help supplement government funding for all levels of education in Nigeria. Half of the ETF went to primary (30%) and secondary (20%) with universities getting 25%. Polytechnics and colleges of education got 12.5% each. But in 2011, ASUU successfully lobbied and forced the government to change the law which transformed the ETF into TETFUND. Today, the 2 % tax on companies only funds higher education with universities getting 50% and polytechnics and colleges of education getting 25% each. Primary and secondary education has been kicked out of it.

University lecturers in particular have since turned TETFUND into another source of funding for themselves. They now apply to the fund for grants to study abroad for masters and PhD programs (while they continue to earn their full pay). An official report by TETFUND for September 2017 showed that it approved funding for a total of 449 masters and PhDs in that month alone 106 of them outside Nigeria. It also approved 283 conference attendances for that month, 66 of them abroad. The most recent available audit of TETFUND in 2013 showed that it received 366 billion naira between 2007 and 2011, the last year before it was exclusively taken over by higher education. The report shows that a significant chunk of the money was going to state primary education boards where Nigeria’s education system is currently failing the most.

If young Nigerians “haven’t been to school” as the president said, it is no accident—it is the outcome of a system designed to do just that. Over many decades, the government has abdicated its most basic responsibility to set up children with a basic education at primary and secondary levels. Only by the time it is far too late does it then respond to hostage takers by handing over the chunk of its budget to them.

President Buhari has not shown even the slightest sign that he has thought about these problems let alone proffer solutions to them. He appointed a most disinterested minister of education who was hardly seen nor heard for the first two years of his government. There is no sign that the government recognizes that the nation is in the grip of an education crisis at all levels. It simply carries on as normal and, as the president even said at the Commonwealth Business Forum, it thinks it deserves some accolades for some imaginary achievements it has had.

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Former leaders of the PDP who defected to the APC in 2013 have written to the national chairman of the ruling party to demand an urgent meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari “within seven days”, TheCable can report.

They did not state their next line of action, although TheCable understands that they may pull out of the party which is already bedevilled by crisis following rancorous congresses nationwide last weekend.

The bloc, known then as the new PDP (nPDP), helped in dislodging the PDP from its 16-year rule in the 2015 general election.

They teamed up with the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), to form APC.

However, in a letter signed by Abubakar Kawu Baraje, former national chairman of nPDP and Olagunsoye Oyinlola, its former national secretary, and presented to John Odigie-Oyegun on Wednesday afternoon, the group listed several grievances and demanded an emergency meeting.

They complained that despite the role they played in bringing APC to power in 2015, they have been neglected in the scheme of things by the administration.

Some of the grievances listed by nPDP are:

No member was appointed into the federal executive council, expect one who did not deliver his state in 2015 (an obvious reference to Rotimi Amaechi, former governor of Rivers and minister of transportation)

No “significant patronage” and appointments to executive positions in various government agencies

When members showed interest in running for the offices of senate president and speaker, they were opposed by the APC hierarchy.

TheCable could not confirm when the seven days would start counting but the letter was dated May 7, 2018 — a day before Buhari travelled to the UK for medicals.

It is also not clear if his absence would affect the treatment of the letter.

The president is expected back in the country at the weekend.

We the members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who moved over from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to form the APC before the 2015 General Elections in Nigeria are desirous of strengthening our party especially now that new party Congresses have commenced and the Convention and another round of General Elections are imminent. Obviously, this cannot be achieved without addressing fundamental issues which we wish to raise in this letter.

We therefore wish, with due respect, to re-state our expectation then and now that the APC we all laboured to build would be one united, inclusive, cohesive and progressive party devoid of divisions, factions, cleavages and tendencies. We envisioned a political party promoting equal rights for all Nigerians and ensuring rapid and even development across the country. Of course there is no gainsaying the fact that the lofty ideals enumerated above cannot be attained without ensuring justice for party faithfuls and citizens.

2. Kindly indulge us to offer a brief reminder of the history of events that led to the victory of the APC in the 2015 General Elections and the presidential election in particular. It is an undeniable historical fact that the movement of the former New PDP block to form the APC contributed immensely to the victory of the APC in the elections. The former new PDP included five sitting Governors of Sokoto, Kano, Kwara, Adamawa and Rivers States and former Governors of Kebbi, Gombe, Osun, former Vice President of Nigeria, former acting National Chairman of PDP, sitting Speaker of the House of Representatives, many serving members of the National Assembly and many renowned politicians and PDP Elders. It was a watershed moment in Nigeria’s political History.

3. Most of these leaders not only DELIVERED their States to the APC at the elections, some of the Governors were also assigned specific responsibilities to ensure that other States were also delivered to the APC in the 2015 elections. The then Governor of Sokoto took charge of Kebbi and the then Governor of Kano State took responsibility for Kano, Kaduna and Jigawa States just to mention a few examples. There were also unprecedented efforts by many stakeholders such as Senator Bukola Saraki, in concert with others, to DELIVER the entire North Central to the APC.

4. These efforts, contributions and sacrifice were made in spite of the fact that the presidential ticket was taken by the erstwhile Congress for Progressive Change, (CPC) and the Action Congress of Nigeria, (ACN) blocks of the party. It is a matter for grave concern that His Excellency, Mr President, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has never publicly acknowledged our efforts in the face of clear evidence that the total number of votes scored by the APC in States where leaders and members of the then NEW PDP block held sway made the difference.

5. The stubborn facts are as follows: In Kano State APC scored 1,903,999 in 2015, and in Kwara 302,146. In Sokoto State it scored 671,926, and 374,701 in Adamawa. In Kebbi State, APC had 567,883 votes and 885,988 in Jigawa. It was the same story in Gombe (459,898), Kogi (264,851), and Benue (373,961) votes. These represented significant additions to the APC victory column. Indeed, the influence, activities, momentum and ripple effect generated by the former New PDP block was significant in the victory of APC in the entire elections in the whole country.

6. At this stage we would chronicle a few grievances which if addressed will lead to a harmonious APC where justice, equity, fairness and peace will reign and enable APC avoid rancour, reinvigorate the pace of national development and face the 2019 General Elections as one united party.

7. Our grievances include:

(a) In the constitution of the Federal Executive Council, (FEC) the New PDP block was generally sidelined as virtually no position was conceded to it. The only member of FEC that belonged to former New PDP block comes from a State that contributed virtually no vote to the APC in the 2015 presidential elections.

(b) There has been no significant patronage and appointments to executive positions in various government agencies such as Chief Executives and Executive Directors of government agencies and parastatals as members of our block of the party continue to helplessly watch as these positions are shared by the erstwhile CPC, ACN, ANPP and even APGA blocks of the party and those who have no party at all.

(c) In appointments into boards of various government agencies, very few former New PDP members were patronised. These are however not commensurate with our contributions to the growth and victory of the party.

(d) When members of the former New PDP block showed interest in running for the offices of President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives, they were subjected to a vicious and relentless political opposition as if they were not legitimate members of the APC family.

(e) During the party primaries preparatory to the 2015 General Elections, most of the promises made to sitting members of the National Assembly, who belonged to the former new PDP in terms of a level playing field were reneged upon or observed more in breach.

(f) There has been general lack of consultation, non recognition and even persecution of former New PDP members and leaders by the party and government. For example, some of our leaders are denied the security cover necessary to visit their constituencies even though they are elected representatives of the people in a government they sacrificed so much for.

(g) Harassment, intimidation and persecution of former New PDP leaders by the government, is still an ongoing affair. We do not want to overstate the obvious by cataloguing names of former new PDP stalwarts that are targets of this political pogrom.

(h) There is inadequate reflection of programme and policy contributions of members of the former New PDP block in the running of the government.

8. Our belief is that it does not augur well for our party if a section of it feels that it is being treated as outcasts and meddlesome interlopers in the party they rightly belong with the legitimate expectation to be treated with justice both in the running of the party and the government.

9. Arising from the issues outlined above, among others, we request for an urgent meeting with the Leader of the party, and the Party Executive leadership to find lasting solutions to the issues raised so as to prepare the party as a fighting force to deliver more pungently on its manifesto and face the 2019 General Elections with even greater commitment. The meeting will also enable us to work out modalities to ensure a level playing field for all in the Congresses and Convention of the APC.

10. Given the constraining factor of available time and in the interest of our great Party, it is strongly advised that the said urgent meeting be held not later than Seven (7) days from the date of the receipt of this letter.

11. In conclusion, we the members of the former New PDP block of the APC wish to reiterate that this letter is written patriotically with the best of intentions and the good of our party, the APC, and is issued to alert the leadership of the APC and in particular, the leader of our party, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who only recently indicated his intention to seek a second term as President, of grievances that exist within the party with a view to ensuring justice for all members of the APC family regardless of the blocks they came from prior to the formation of the APC.

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.6 million persons are internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security and nutrition situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and as the lean season (May through September) is about to kick off. The new Cadre Harmonisé analysis – which provides an updated understanding of the food security and nutrition situation – was issued, revealing that the number of people estimated to be facing critical and crisis food and nutrition insecurity levels (IPC 3 and 4) in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe stands at 2.3 million for March-May and up to 3 million projected for June-August.

In March, the operational environment deteriorated sharply with the killing of three aid workers in Rann, in Kala/Balge local government area (LGA) in Borno State, during an attack by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) against Nigerian armed forces.

Three female paramedical aid workers were also abducted during the attack and remain unaccounted for. This attack, which took place on 1 March, raised serious concerns regarding the preservation and expansion of the current humanitarian space and the dangers faced by aid workers as they attempt to access vulnerable persons in hard-to-reach areas. Following the attack, all relocatable humanitarian workers were evacuated out of Rann for close to three weeks and little to no assistance was delivered to people in need during that time. Although life-saving activities were able to resume in a progressive manner towards the end of the month, much time was lost in preparing for the rainy season (June through September) in a town that tends to become unreachable by road for months on end due to flooding. The construction of a humanitarian hub, a common storage site and a helipad were delayed pending a new security assessment of the chosen location. As time before the rains start is running out, it is crucial that work on these three projects resume as soon as possible.

Large-scale population movements, caused largely by insecurity, continued with 21,807 new arrivals in March alone. This represents a sharp increase of 75 per cent compared to February and poses major humanitarian challenges as resources are often already overstretched in the locations in which these civilians arrive. With hostilities ongoing, these trends are likely to continue at least until the rainy season starts in May/June. On 24 March, the Government of Nigeria opened the MaiduguriBama-Banki road, in Borno State, to civilian traffic, triggering thousands of population movements along this axis. In addition, the Government has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Maiduguri to Bama where rehabilitation of public and private infrastructure is underway. The UN and its partners are calling for close coordination with the federal and state authorities to ensure that any returns and relocations are carried out following internationally recognised standards of dignity, safety and voluntariness. The UN and partners are also calling for the return of civilian authorities to all return areas and the rebuilding of infrastructure and municipal services.

The north-east is also grappling with two new cholera outbreaks: one in Borno State (in Kukawa LGA), which broke out on 13 February and stands at 646 cases with three associated deaths; and one in Yobe State (in Bade, Karasuwa, Yusufari and Bursari LGAs) which started on 28 March, and stands at 44 cases with seven deaths (with a worrisome case fatality rate of 6.4 per cent). A timely and coordinated response by health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) partners has been put in place, including prevention measures, and the outbreaks are expected to be under control in the coming weeks. As the rainy season approaches, preparedness measures are being put in place to limit disease transmission.

Another challenge in March were the heavy winds which have caused repeated fire outbreaks in Borno State, destroying large numbers of shelters, food supplies and other critical items across camps in the state (in Mafa, Jere, Monguno and Kala/Balge LGAs). Although humanitarian organisations were able to respond rapidly with emergency shelter kits and distributions of other life-saving items, fires are creating major gaps in the affected locations. Fire sensitisation campaigns and other mitigation measures, such as fire stations in heavily congested camps, are ongoing or being rolled out.

Overall, the humanitarian response in north-east Nigeria is hampered by the lack of funding for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Currently, most activities can only be implemented thanks to carry-over funding from 2017 (US$196 million) which will soon run out. For the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be urgently received across all the sectors","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update - Progress on key activities from the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-progress-key-activities-2018

The Emergency Telecommunications Sector (ETS) deployed vital communications services at the humanitarian hub in Damasak.

The ETS prepositioned Internet and security telecommunications equipment in Banki, where the next humanitarian hub will be established.

The ETS is working with local Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to evaluate the technical feasibility of a Closed User Group (CUG) to enhance communication among humanitarians.

Situation Overview

In early April, a series of fires broke out in and near the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp in Borno’s Rann town, injuring 14 people and burning more than 1,000 shelters in the camp, according to local media. Relief agencies are erecting 500 emergency shelters to decongest affected areas and working to address persistent shelter gaps.

The Yobe State Commissioner for Health declared a cholera outbreak in Nigeria’s Bade Local Government Area (LGA) at the beginning of April. Health actors recorded more than 340 suspected cholera cases in the state, more than 95 percent of which were from Bade, between 28 March and 16 April.

In anticipation of increased access challenges during the upcoming May-to-October rainy season, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published the 2018 Rainy Season Contingency Planning for North-East Nigeria on 9 April. It highlights that 407,000 people will be potentially affected during the 2018 rainy season in the three states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.",Nigeria Crisis - ETS Situation Report #18 (Reporting period 1/04/18 to 30/04/18),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-crisis-ets-situation-report-18-reporting-period-10418-300418
12,nigeria,"Highlights

The reporting period witnessed high levels movement of IDPs, with a total of 16,542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa States.

A total of 35 new cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 3 deaths were reported in Yusufari and Bade LGAs, Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera.

A total of 195,804 medical consultations were supported by UNICEF in 2018, out of which 91,184 consultations were made within the reporting period.

UNICEF and its implementing partners have provided critical child protection services to 200,160 children and caregivers in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe since the start of 2018.

Though critically underfunded at 80% and 90%, WASH and Health reached a total 128,446 and 195,804 conflict-affected people respectively during the reporting period. Increased funding is urgently required in these Sectors for an integrated UNICEF response to crises-affected children in north east Nigeria.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno. The reporting period witnessed a high level of movement, with a total of 16, 542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements recorded across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa states. The main reasons for the returns are improved security and voluntary relocation, while new displacement is propelled by poor living conditions, fear of attack, ongoing conflict and military operations.



On 23rd March, the Nigerian Government announced its intention to facilitate the return of IDPs from Maiduguri to Bama LGA. Bama currently has the largest number of displaced people (203,374) still outside of the LGA, and at the same time also hosts the highest number of IDPs (49,139 persons DTM Round XXI) of all Borno LGAs. The first voluntary returns exercise, supported by a government package of 10,000 Naira cash, a 50kg bag of rice, and a bag of maize flour per family, was scheduled for 2nd April. Humanitarian actors have emphasized the importance of ensuring that all returns processes take place in a safe, voluntary, and dignified manner, and take into consideration the capacity of state and other actors to meet the needs of returnees.



As of 31st March, 133 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 12 deaths (a case fatality rate of 9%) were reported in Bade and Yusufari LGAs of Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera. WASH and health partners - including UNICEF, WHO, VCM, MSF Spain, State Ministry of Health (SMoH), State Primary Health Care Board (SPHCMB) and LGAs authorities - are responding in the affected areas. Meanwhile, the number of cholera cases in Kukawa LGA continues to decline following responses by UNICEF and partners. A total number of 639 cases and 3 deaths were reported at the end of March (resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.5%).



On 1st March, members of a non-state armed groups attacked the military camp in Rann, killing seven military personnel.



Hostilities also resulted in the deaths of three humanitarian workers (including a doctor working for a UNICEF contractor) and the abduction of three female health workers (including a nurse working for a UNICEF contractor). Humanitarian activities in Rann were suspended as a result of the attack, temporarily leaving the local population and an estimated 40,000 IDPs without life-saving assistance. The attack also resulted in the closure of the only school in Rann, thus halting learning opportunities for 7300 children (46% of whom are girls) and the destruction of 2,700 school bags with essential learning materials prepositioned in preparation for new enrolment. All teachers have moved to Maiduguri following the attack.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

The humanitarian crisis in Nigeria’s north-east remains one of the most severe in the world today. In 2017, there were 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the worst conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The crisis is considered a protection crisis first and foremost, that is closely linked to food scarcity and insecurity and high levels of need for basic life-saving assistance and services. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of a conflict that has led to widespread forced displacement and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

In March 2017, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2349, strongly condemning all terrorist attacks, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses by Boko Haram and ISIL, and urged all parties to the conflict to ensure respect for and protection of humanitarian personnel, facilities, and their means of transport and equipment, and to facilitate safe, timely and unhindered access for humanitarian oganisations to deliver life-saving aid to affected people.

Protection concerns

Protection of civilians was a key priority for humanitarians in 2017. Women, men and children faced grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, over 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of women and girls abducted and, in 2017, over 110 children were used as so-called “suicide” bombers. Toward the latter half of 2017, a surge in attacks by non-state armed groups claimed dozens of lives and injured countless others.

Internal displacement and returns

In 2017, more than 1.6 million people were internally displaced in the three worst crisis-affected states – with 80 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Borno State, the epicentre of the crisis. Over half live outside of IDP camps in local communities. Freedom of movement of all IDPs, including refugee returnees, was limited by continued security threats in areas such as Banki, Pulka, Bama, Gwoza, Ngala and Damasak. Nonetheless, 1.3 million people returned home in 2017, indicating that conditions in some locations had improved. Meanwhile, an estimated 930,000 people remain in hard-to-reach areas and humanitarian actors were not able to assess their situation, or to provide them with aid.

Food insecurity and malnutrition

By the end of the year, the risk of famine had been averted in north-east Nigeria in locations where humanitarians had access. The number of people estimated to be facing food insecurity reduced from 5.2 million during June to August 2017 to 2.6 million during October to December 2017³. This improvement was due to (i) improved security conditions that allowed for farming activities in locations that were previously not safe and an upturn in market and trade activity; (ii) delivery of food and livelihood support to almost 3 million people every month (including 2 million per month with just food assistance) since the start of the year; and (iii) favourable climatic conditions for farming.

An estimated 450,000 children under the age of five suffered from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in 2017. SAM kits were provided to over 30 stabilisation centres to treat more than 7,000 children suffering from SAM with medical complications, and over 150 health professionals from the Health Ministry and NGOs were trained on in-patient management of SAM. The integration of the provision of safe drinking water, adequate sanitation services and safer food and hygiene practices into nutrition activities were required to improve the health of people in need and help combat malnutrition.

Disease outbreaks, including malaria and cholera

A highly vulnerable population, consisting largely of children (58 per cent), continued to be at high risk of disease outbreaks since routine vaccinations, e.g., polio and measles, had been interrupted for many years, . Two thirds of the health facilities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states were damaged by the conflict. The continuous influx of returnees and overcrowding of camps continued to increase the risk of outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than half of recorded deaths in Borno State were due to malaria, more than all other causes of death combined.

Finally, the cholera outbreak that was declared in mid-August 2017 in Borno State, was brought under control following a solid collaboration between health partners and water, sanitation and hygiene partners, and a cholera vaccination campaign in the most at-risk areas of Borno State which reached more than 900,000 people. By the time the epidemic was declared over in December 2017, there had been over 5,300 recorded cases and 61 deaths.

Access and security

The humanitarian access and security situation in the northeast remains challenging for humanitarian partners and has had significant implications on relief operations in 2017.

The north-east of Nigeria, especially Borno State, has experienced a significant increase in military operations in the second half of the year which have resulted in major civilian displacement, access restrictions along main routes and security incidents in previously secure areas.

The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) estimates that around 85 per cent of the target population (5.2 million people) can be reached with aid while an estimated 930,000 people remain in areas that are hard to reach for UN agencies and international NGOs. In Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, three local government areas (LGAs) are currently completely inaccessible for UN and international NGO humanitarian services, whereas 26 are partially accessible and 37 are fully accessible.

All of the three inaccessible and the majority of the partially accessible (19) LGAs are located in Borno State. Due to the lack of access of humanitarian partners to these areas, the identification of potential needs as well as independent context and security assessments have largely not been possible.",Nigeria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
16,nigeria,"An investigation by The Guardian in the affected areas reveal that at least about 20,000 school pupils are currently out of school in Awe, Keana, Obi and Doma local government areas of the state.

Majority of the victims are Tivs, who are predominantly farmers on border communities of Benue and Taraba, the two states adversely affected by the militia herdsmen.

Further investigation also show that the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps located in some towns of the southern senatorial zone are in shambles as adequate attention is not given to them let alone the educational needs of the children.

Some of the primary school teachers in Kadarko town, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government instructed all primary and secondary schools in the town, either privately or government-owned, to shut down since the crisis persisted.

When contacted, the Nasarawa State chairman of Universal Basic Education Board, Mohammed Dan’azumi, said the board was still taking statistics in order to ascertain the exact number of pupils forced out of school at the wake of the attacks.

Dan’azumi, who ordered the Permanent Secretary, Hadiza Alakayi, to speak on his behalf, said: “the board has sent its instructors and headmasters to collect statistics in the five local councils, and they are yet to submit their report.

“The situation is under control. We summoned education secretaries, supervisors and headmasters to ensure that all schools should resume. The board is going to monitor and supervise the situation based on the report received. The IDPs children shall be taken care of,” he said.","20,000 pupils forced to abandon school in Nasarawa over herdsmen crisis",https://guardian.ng/news/20000-pupils-forced-to-abandon-school-in-nasarawa-over-herdsmen-crisis/
