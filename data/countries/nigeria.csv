0,nigeria,"The Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, Abuja chapter has called for the setting up of a public relations roadmap for reputation managers at various levels of governance to stem the rising cases of negative publicity against the country.



Chief Press Secretary to the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Mr. Cosmas Uzodinma, stated this on Thursday during his presentation at the monthly meeting of the chapter in Abuja, a statement by the chapters public relations officer, Stanley Ogadigo said.





Uzodinma who stated Nigeria is not as bad as it is being portrayed, stressed that the barrage of negative publicity targeted at Nigeria by both the domestic and foreign media has called for a Public Relations roadmap for Nigeria’s reputation managers at various levels of governance.





He also called on media organizations to adopt organizing principles in their narrative and portrayal of Nigeria.





""This is with a view to stemming the current volley of negative media that demonizes Nigeria far beyond what it truly is"" he said.





Uzodinma who regretted that the country already has enough adversaries prayed that the reputation managers at various levels of governance must be weaned from the current strategy of conducting public relations project on adhoc, episodic and fire brigade manner.





""We must adopt organizing principles to which we can hold the media, film and tourism industries as well as other national social mobilization institutions accountable. We must evolve a framework to measure our PR strategies. Such parameters must provide answers to such questions as to whether such materials could lead to a better image for Nigeria; spotlight the positives about our nation; bolster our economic credentials; respect and not pull down our leaders - who are the physical embodiment of our sovereignty and appeal to our cherished values"" he adds.





Speaking in the same vein, Chairman of the FCT Chapter of the NIPR, Mr Tayo Haastrup advised Nigerians to support the country's growth by emphasizing on its strength, achievements and various innovations.





Haastrup who lamented the negative publicity the country is suffering, said the NIPR is set to partner with Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the rebranding Nigeria project.

More than 10 million people would require aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger as a result of the security challenges in the countries, the UN said on Thursday.

Its Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, who stated this at the end of her visit to Chad, called for urgent support for the countries, especially Chad.

Mueller said the humanitarian emergency across the Lake Chad basin was among the most severe in the world.

She said: “Persistent insecurity and Boko Haram operations mean that more than 10 million people in four countries – Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria – will need aid assistance this year just to survive.”

She called for urgent funding to support 4.4 million people in Chad, including refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons, as well as the communities hosting them.

Mueller underscored the need for durable solutions to the crisis in the Lake Chad region, as noted by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

OCHA said the closure of Chad’s border with Nigeria from the beginning of the crisis in the region in 2015, together with the continued implementation of emergency measures, have also had an impact on local populations who already face poor regional development.

“The activities of the extremist group Boko Haram, as well as violence in Sudan and the Central African Republic, have affected 500,000 people there, including 137,000 people the UN has deemed particularly vulnerable.

“During my visit to displacement sites, I saw the difficult living conditions and lack of means displaced communities face.

“It is unacceptable that these men, women and children who have lost everything, their home, belonging, livelihood and very often family members, continue to live in fear and uncertainty.”

Mueller was on a 10-day Chad mission to the Central African Republic (CAR) and Cameroon, where she saw first-hand the devastating humanitarian consequences of ongoing violence.

The UN official said she was moved by the solidarity of host communities who are sharing the little they have with those forced to run for their lives.

“It is essential to strengthen the livelihoods of these communities who are the first lifeline for those fleeing violence and insecurity,” she stated.

According to her, the crisis is taking place against a wider backdrop of recurrent food shortages and entrenched poverty across Chad, where nearly four million people require emergency food assistance and more than 200,000 children under five are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition.

However, funding for humanitarian operations there has not kept pace with increased needs, she regretted.

Mueller urged countries to step up their support to Chad, which requires $544 million in humanitarian funding in 2018, which so far, was less than four per cent funded.","Over 10 million in need of humanitarian aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, others – UN – tv360",http://tv360nigeria.com/2018/03/01/over-10-million-in-need-of-humanitarian-aid-in-nigeria-cameroon-others-un/

The revival of Nigeria’s economy has gained momentum under the guidance of President Buhari’s ERGP programme; its ambitious targets yield results that seem to indicate that they will soon be superseded.

In spite of difficult times, Nigeria has been rated as the top 10 most improved economies in 2016/2017.

“Nigeria is a very resilient country in terms of economy,” states Mr. Venkatapathy Venkataraman Group MD at NIPCO.

This has been a result of the ERPG programme and its emphasis on industrialisation and diversification policies which boost capital inflows and encourages ease of doing business.

In November 2017 Godwin Emefiele Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN’s presented Nigeria’s economic outlook for 2018, predicting that national forex reserves will hit US$ 40bn in 2018. In introducing I&E forex the improvement in the ease of doing business is guaranteed.

“The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) played an extensive role in ensuring relative price stability and in managing the dearth of foreign exchange,” declares Mr Obeahon Ohiwerei, Managing Director at Keystone Bank.

“If the tight monetary policy continues, and the Central Bank continues to manage the liquidity that makes FX, the economy may grow more than the 1.8% projected,” claims Mr Abubakar Jimoh, CEO at Coronation Merchant Bank.

Although energy sales in Nigeria account for up to 80 percent of all government revenue and more than 90 percent of the country’s exports, Agriculture and ICT sectors have flourished, providing steady growth, employment and investment opportunities.

The ERGP’s shift towards becoming import dependent has been particularly successful in Agriculture. Proforce MD, Mr Ade Ogundeyin declares, “the government is serious and committed about made-in-Nigeria goods. They are saying that if it can be produced in Nigeria you don’t import it.”

The government’s intention to use telecoms and ICT for economic development and financial inclusion is auspicious for the industry. Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Mr Umar Danbatta states that “telecoms contribution to GDP is now close to 10% and has been contributing 1.4 trillion naira to the economy.”

Minister of Power, Works and Housing Hon. Fashola confirms the commitment to IT, “We’re installing more broadband and connectivity across the country,” which in turn enhances a definite entrepreneurial spirit at play amongst the people.

The government has made it extremely clear that it will be pouring funding into infrastructure. Minister of Power, Works and Housing Hon. Fashola declares, “the investment in infrastructure is driving the value chain of the economic diversification.”

The government’s plans to modernise and restructure the country’s public transport system has proved a great opportunity for investors and the economy.

Nigeria remains a highly appealing destination for investors. Mr Tunde Fowler, Chairman at FIRS elaborates, “Nigeria is an investor’s heaven with so much potential; from industry to agriculture to telecommunications. There’s so much room for expansion and the ease of doing business ensures that anyone who has a business, or who intends to start a business, will not have to face any bureaucracy, roadblocks or hindrance.

Nigeria’s government is determined to provide profound and long-term change in economic prosperity and stability; there remains little doubt that it is Nigeria’s destiny to uphold the title of largest economy in Africa for a long time yet.",Making Nigeria - Forbes Africa,https://www.forbesafrica.com/economy/2018/04/09/making-nigeria/
3,nigeria,"The Nigerian military says it has rescued 149 women and children abducted by the armed group Boko Haram in the country's northeast.

Onyema Nwachuku, army spokesman, said on Sunday the freed captives included 54 women and 95 children, according to the NAN news agency.

""The rescued hostages are currently receiving medical attention,"" he said in a statement, adding that they would be ""profiled after the medical screening"".

The rescues took place during a raid on a Boko Haram hideout in the community of Yerimari Kura on Saturday. Soldiers killed three fighters during the operation and captured five others suspected of belonging to the group, Nwachuku said.

His statement did not specify when the women and children had been abducted.

Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from Abuja, capital of Nigeria, said the number of people Boko Haram had kidnapped in Yerimari Kura ""demonstrated the group's resilience"", despite losing significant swaths of territory to the Nigerian army in recent years.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is forbidden"", has waged a nearly 10-year armed campaign to create an Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria.

The conflict has left at least 20,000 people dead and displaced more than 2.6 million.

At its peak, the group effectively controlled large areas in the Lake Chad region, but the Nigerian military, with assistance from Chad, Cameroon and Niger, has pushed Boko Haram fighters out of a number of provinces.

However, ""Boko Haram has adapted by splitting into smaller groups, infiltrating communities, launching attacks here and there and continuing to make statements that they are very much around"", said Idris.

In March, a Boko Haram attack on the northeastern town of Rann left at least two aid workers, a doctor and eight soldiers dead.

In February, Nigerian and Cameroonian troops freed 1,130 civilians kidnapped by the group in the Lake Chad region.

Boko Haram gained international notoriety after its fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok in April 2014. About 100 girls are still missing.

In February, the group's fighters attacked another school in the northeastern state of Yobe and seized more than 110 schoolgirls.

By Kelechukwu Iruoma

MANAGEMENT of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPRe, Effurun, has said that the institution has the potentials to solve Nigeria’s fuel crisis, but noted that lack of funds was destroying the institution’s vision of being one of the best universities in the world.

The institution’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Akaehomen Ibhadode, who said this when he and his team paid a courtesy visit to Vanguard headquarters in Lagos, however, called on the Federal Government to turn its attention to the institution to help solve the infrastructure and other funding challenges limiting its advancement.

He said: “As a petroleum university, we have a stake in solving this problem (petrol crisis). We have been toying with the idea of mini refineries and you find out that even now, we have shortage of petroleum products. With our little resources, we have been able to come up with designs and at this point, we are looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to actualise the designs in physical form.”

He noted that the institution was trying to work with the marginal field operators, but because of financial challenges, the institution has not been able to come up with something workable. “We want to be challenged as a petroleum university to build mini refineries and we are ready for that, and if we are able to create mini refineries, we can replicate it all over the country and beyond, especially in Africa. It will create employment and change the economic face of the country.”

FUPRE, a specialised petroleum university, was established by the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 to train high level manpower for the oil and gas industry, with a take-off grant of N500 million. Since then, no other grant has been given to the institution.

He said other new universities receive N6 billion take-off grant. “Unfortunately, not enough resources are put in place to achieve that mandate. It’s the first petroleum university in Africa and the sixth in the world. We need to draw the attention of the government that set it up as the proprietor and the sector (education), that we are operating in a situation where we can be of value to the industry (petroleum) and also to the nation,” he added.

Ibhadode said that as giant of Africa and showing by Nigeria’s resources in terms of population and landmass, Nigeria has everything. “These are things that can make us really tick. Attention has to be drawn to the university. We can draw resources from the government that will be able to make us to achieve more. Unfortunately, that has not been so. It is after 10 years of establishing the university that we now have an act which was signed by the National Assembly and signed into law last year by the president.

“Every university is shouting we do not have money but we want to go beyond that. What we want to establish is that we have potentials that we can deploy to be able to leverage on them and attract more resources. We want to announce to the world that we have done quite a couple of things and as a specialised university, we can commercialise or partner with organisations to be able to bring solution to the oil industry and the allied industries such that we make life better for Nigerians.”

He said that the institution is looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to be able to actualise the design of the refineries in the physical form, including production and drilling platforms. “FUPRE is a specialized university with some special funding for infrastructural development and research purposes.”",We have stake in solving Nigeria’s petroleum crisis — FUPRE VC,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/stake-solving-nigerias-petroleum-crisis-fupre-vc-3/

The Indians were unstoppable.

As defending champions Singapore in the semifinals and Nigeria in the final, later in the day, found out.

They were hardly able to put out any sort of resistance and India won the men’s table tennis team event of the XXI Commonwealth Games here on Monday.

The final against Nigeria was one-sided as Indians won easily at 3-0. But what had helped them gain momentum and confidence was the hard-fought 3-2 win over Singapore in the semifinals in the morning.

Singapore relied heavily on Gao Ning and though he did deliver, winning both his singles matches, the Indians kept up pressure thanks to Sharath Kamal whose superbly put it past Shao Feng Ethan Poh and Xu Jie Pang in the singles.

Marathon tie

The second semifinal between Nigeria and England had turned out to be a marathon affair before the Africans put it across the latter at 3-2. That probably left them exhausted.

Bode Abiodun got off to a good start against Sharath by sewing up the opening set at 11-4, but as the Indian pushed hard and the Nigerian just failed to cope.

Sharath continued on with his attacking game and breezed through next three sets, winning the tie 4-11, 11-5, 11-4, 11-9.

In the second singles, G. Sathiyan was given a tough fight by Segun Toriola. But Sathiyan, who has had a great week, was quick to overcome the loss of the first set, to cruise to a memorable 10-12, 11-3, 11-3, 11-4 victory.

Sathiyan was quickly back on court, this time in the company of Harmeet Desai, for the doubles against Okagide Omotayo and Bode Abiodun and it was easy sailing for the Indian pair, which won 11-8, 11-5, 11-3.

The results:

7,nigeria,"In January, Orange prize-winning author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reacted angrily to a question about the presence of bookshops in Nigeria. Here, eight Nigerian writers give their own response to the query

Text Will Bedingfield

Today we explore Nigeria’s youth culture community, through the lens of some of the country’s most influential young thinkers. Late last January, during a Q&A at La Nuit des Idées, a Parisian cultural festival, the Nigerian author and guest of honour Chimamanda Adichie was asked by a French journalist, Catherine Broue, whether Nigeria “had any bookshops”. The audience gasped; Broue tried to clarify: “When people talk about Nigeria it’s about Boko Haram, it’s about violence, it’s about security. I should like you to tell us something about Nigeria which is different…and that is why I’m saying are there bookshops? Of course I imagine there are.” Adichie’s response was blunt: “You know I think it reflects very poorly on French people”, (the audience cheered), “that you’ve had to ask me that question...surely, it’s 2018. I mean, come on. My books are read in Nigeria. They’re studied in schools, not just in Nigeria but across Africa and it means a lot to me”. After the interview, and after a nightmarish social media pummeling, Broue would counter that her question was an attempt to “impersonate the ignorant” in order to enlighten them. Why knowing that Nigeria had bookshops would disabuse anyone of the belief it was perpetually overrun by frightening militias, or why the responsibility lay with Adichie to disabuse this group at all, were flaws in this enterprise pointed out by other commentators. More seriously, Broue’s statement still didn’t explain why she felt such a question needed to be answered. Nigeria’s literary tradition is more than slightly prestigious, and Adichie is a MacArthur Genius Grant recipient and a past member of the Time 100. She has been granted the recognition from Western editors and publishers that “African literature” must (historically) rely on for success in Western markets; on these terms alone, it would appear self-evident that she had somewhere in the country found access to the means for developing her art. Why, then, did the presence of a Nigerian author, on stage in Paris, answering questions about her prize-winning books, still not verify the presence of a Nigerian reading culture?

Later, on Facebook, Adichie offered her take on the logic, conscious or not, permitting Broue’s question. It was the same, persistent logic that reduces an entire continent to a few exotic fears and exhilarations (“Boko Haram, violence, security”). The question derived from “a deliberate, entitled, tiresome, sweeping, base ignorance about Africa”. “I do not expect a French person to know almost everything about Nigeria,” Adichie wrote, “I don’t know almost everything about France. But to be asked to ‘tell French people that you have bookshops in Nigeria because they don’t know’ is to cater to a wilfully retrograde idea — that Africa is so apart, so pathologically ‘different,’ that a non-African cannot make reasonable assumptions about life there.” The online ire generated by the moment has produced different reactions. Sede Alonge, writing in The Guardian, called for a sense of perspective. He acknowledged that Broue was “tactless”, and that she asked a “very silly question”. But outrage, he argued, would be better directed towards Nigeria’s graver troubles, like: “the failings of successive governments who have reduced the country to an easy target for ridicule” and “the (in)accessibility of books for millions of children growing up in Africa’s most populous country”. Continuing Dazed’s Nigeria Day series, we asked eight of the country’s most exciting young writers to offer their own reactions to the interview question. Their answers, which follow below, are insightful, measured and conflicting.

OTOSIRIEZE OBI-YOUNG Otosirieze Obi-Young’s fiction appears in The Threepenny Review and Transition, and has been shortlisted for the Miles Morland Scholarship and the Gerald Kraak Award. He is Deputy Editor of the African literary culture platform Brittle Paper. He has completed a collection of stories, You Sing of a Longing, and is working on a novel. Mine was not an upbringing filled with choice books. But there were thriving bookstores. However, the bookstores did not thrive because they were stocked with serious literature books by Africans — and a good number of them had books required for O Level examinations — they thrived because they stocked and sold mainly textbooks and romance novels by Westerners. I was in secondary school, having found Ngugi’s Weep Not, Child and reading Isidore Okpewho’s The Last Duty and J.P. Clark’s poetry, when I began thinking of becoming a writer. A pondering solidified by Half of a Yellow Sun in university. Walk into the average Nigerian bookstore, walk to a roadside bookseller, and ask for a novel by an African, and you would be offered Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s books first. Our bookstores lack needed books due to the defunding of public education, but a milder response would be an endorsement of cultural condescension.

SIBBYL WHYTE Sibbyl Whyte is a writer whose work has appeared in Gypsiana, Naijastories and the Brittle Paper. She is curating a forthcoming anthology called Erotic Africa: The Sex Anthology. Growing up, reading was a ritual and my father was proud of this ability of mine to shut out the world and fall into books, so he supplied me with them. Bearing that in mind, bookstores have always existed alongside me. However, the bookstores my reading history is most intimate with, are not buildings, they are the tarpaulins spread on the ground by the roadside or in markets upon which hundreds of books lie, drawing book-lovers in, causing them to pause, change direction, and pick a book or more. In 2012, I got connected with kindred spirits who shared my love for literature. Not only did I find that the internet possessed an inexhaustible supply of books, I found a new pathway to stories – writing. For that question to be asked in this age where books are made available following mouse-clicks on a webpage, is to expose oneself as being unaware of the direction the world is headed in, digitally speaking.

ARINZE IFEAKANDU Arinze Ifeakandu was shortlisted for the Caine Prize in 2017 and was a 2015 A Public Space Emerging Writer Fellow. His fiction appears in A Public Space and is forthcoming in One Story. He is working on a book of short stories. Chimamanda has clarified that the interviewer was being sarcastic when she asked the question, still the fact that a lot of French people would assume that there are no bookshops in Nigeria shocks me. But it shouldn’t. Recently, a young Nigerian man sent me a message, bristling at what he called my “Gay agenda”. Making Facebook posts about gay life, he reasoned, was “hypocritical”, considering the fact that “normal straight people” do not rub their “experiences in everyone’s faces”, which is such utter bullshit because everywhere I turn to, a man is telling me about his girlfriend. I write fiction with queer characters living normal lives, and I get this sort of backlash often. Just like the assumption that Nigeria has no bookshops, the backlash is borne out of arrogance and a cultivated blindness to one’s privilege.

JK ANOWE JK Anowe is the recipient of the inaugural Brittle Paper Award for Poetry in 2017 for his poem “Credo to Leave,” published in Expound. He is Associate Poetry Editor at Praxis Magazine Online and lives, teaches and writes in Nigeria. Developing as a writer in Nigeria might not be the most promising scenario considering the lack of infrastructure, the dependence on Western institutions to validate our works, or the fact that certain subjects are overlooked, deemed un-African or un-Nigerian, or not urgent enough to be written about ― like my own poetry, which interrogates the self and the psyche through mental illness. Despite this, I do come from a rich reading tradition. I have memories of skipping class to frequent our secondary school library, well-equipped with all manner of books, African or otherwise. In university, studying French and German, I was exposed to works by W.G Sebald, Gustave Flaubert, Charles Baudelaire, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Guillaume Apollinaire, Ahmadou Kourouma, Camara Laye, David Diop, etc. So, while bookstores are not central to my relationship with books in Nigeria, I find the question quite ridiculous, and Adichie’s response, to put it mildly, generously considerate.

KELECHI NJOKU Kelechi Njoku is an editor at Kachifo. He was shortlisted for the 2017 Commonwealth Short Story Prize and his work appears in Adda, Litro and on several other platforms. If a society is home to 65 million non-literate persons and 10 million children who are out of school, then the most elementary questions may be asked of its culture. Broue comes from a country where a book can sell 600,000 copies in one year — whereas it has taken the Nigerian publisher of a popular African author seven years to move a mere 1,000 copies of his book. What we have as “bookstores” here would often not stock literary books because no-one is buying them. Adichie is one of maybe three writers whose names are recognisable on the streets. All over the world, literature struggles to stay culturally relevant alongside TV — with all the PC writing going on there now — and social media. If developed societies (with their half-million-copy sales) are having it bad, it makes sense to wonder how worse-developing countries like Nigeria are faring.

IFE OLUJUYIGBE Ife Olujuyigbe is a writer, freelance editor and film critic. She has been published in a number of literary platforms and anthologies, won two short story prizes and was longlisted for the 2017 Writivism Short Story Prize. Her collection of short stories is set to be published in 2018. I was eight when I came upon my father’s incredible stack of neat old books, and this was where my journey as a reader, and eventually, a writer, began. I still have vivid memories of reading Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again. The bookstores I was exposed to before then were mostly school-centred, with options so homogeneous, you had to learn to make do. Roadside kiosks of motivational books, foreign romance novels, and from time to time, books by the all-too-familiar Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe are a common sight, but the occasional bookstore is filled with an assortment that includes more African literature by the day. Book festivals and readings are further helping curious readers like me get acquainted with brilliant African writing. And of course, there is the blessing of the internet which now brings books to you in only a few clicks.

PRINCE JACON OSINACHI Osinachi is a writer, visual artist and academic librarian in one of the universities in south-east Nigeria. His work has appeared on African Writer, Cultural Weekly, Brittle Paper, The Muse and other titles. He has a short fiction upcoming on Megacity Fictions. In junior secondary school, I was the tight-belted teenager unofficially referred to as “the class reader”. It was there that my love for literature written in Igbo and English started. Unsatisfied with just what we were given in class, I started looking out for where I could get other books, to discover what they contained. As a young boy hawking on the roads of Aba, I encountered a secondhand bookshop in “Shopping Centre”. I got most of the books there almost for nothing, and within months I had evacuated my mother’s cupboard and turned it into a personal library — a library full of books by only white authors. Today, there are still second-hand bookshops in Aba, but they exist side-by-side with new and modern ones. In addition to that, the booming publishing industry in Nigeria and the whole of Africa has led to an abundant availability of books by African writers which are also being sold in these bookshops. As a millennial, I know how much education one can get from the internet. Therefore, I was shocked by Caroline Broue’s question to Chimamanda Adichie. Generally, getting a bookshop here isn’t as hard as finding an iyi uwa. And you don’t need to give an arm and a leg to buy one. Some books sold in Nigerian bookshops can cost as little as N3,600 ($10), and that is what most Nigerians spend on data subscriptions every month. Broue should have paused to consider if it makes sense to ask that question when a Google search of “bookshops in Nigeria” brings up a map of bookshop locations across the country, including their phone numbers for contact. She should have paused to ask instead, “Do Nigerians read?” That is another thing altogether, and that is the right question she failed to fire.",Eight Nigerian authors discuss Nigeria’s literary culture,http://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/39595/1/literature-nigeria-chimamanda-adichie-libraries
8,nigeria,"After the death of its founder last month, Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM), the decades-old Russian Ponzi scheme operational across Africa will officially shut down.

A statement on its Nigerian website says continuing without Sergey Mavrodi, who passed away last month following a heart attack, “is impossible and makes no sense.” In truth, the “investment” scheme has been dead for a while.

At its peak, MMM had around three million users in Nigeria but, in December 2016, after a rumored slowdown following increased scrutiny from the government, it suspended operations and never resumed. Beyond Nigeria, MMM has popped up in other African countries, including Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ghana with some of its operations based on bitcoin rather than cash.

While fully operational, MMM described itself as a “mutual aid fund” and based its racket on its users “helping” and sending each other money, and promised 30% monthly interest rates. Analysts say MMM, like most Ponzi schemes, mainly thrived given the difficult economic times amid Nigeria’s first recession in decades with many wooed by its tantalizing interest rates. But even though pyramid schemes are not new in Nigeria, the scale of MMM’s growth has signaled other similar multi-level marketing schemes to the potential ubiquity of Ponzi schemes in Nigeria, particularly as internet penetration and social media usage spreads.

Since MMM’s slowdown in 2016, several other multi-level marketing schemes promising irrationally high returns and exploiting regulatory grey lines have emerged. One such scheme currently asks users to “invest” $1,200 in gold and promises more than 100% returns after a month on the condition that users get seven other people to pony up the same amount. But typically, after early adoption and quick payouts, the schemes struggle to stay afloat when people stop joining. A Lagos-based accountant who did not want to be named told Quartz he’s still waiting on his payout after investing $1,200 in a gold-based scheme last June.

Mavrodi’s death has been met with mixed reactions in Nigeria but, more than anything else, the government will likely be hoping that the lessons learned by Nigerians who lost around $50 million when MMM collapsed serves as a strong enough cautionary tale.

iMMAP is implementing the information management training and capacity building program in north eastern Nigeria with support from the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).

The purpose is to facilitate capacity building, capacity strengthening and to empower humanitarian partners to leverage and optimize information management tools, technologies, plaforms and best practices to effectively respond to the humanitarian crisis in the north east.

About the Capacity Building Program Contents The program started in January 2018, with a participatory assessment of the information management and capacity building gaps and priorities amongst the humanitarian partners. iMMAP engages with humanitarian sectors and state level government authorities to identify the participants, and with the Information Management Unit of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Maiduguri, to deliver and facilitate capacity building activities.","Humanitarian Information Management Training and Capacity Building - Round 1, 26-30 March 2018 Maiduguri, Nigeria",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/humanitarian-information-management-training-and-capacity-building-round-1-26-30

The Coalition on Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Nigeria has released a complete review of incidents of farmers/herders crisis in Nigeria, lauding the neutral conduct of the Nigerian Army as patriotic and professional.

It however cautioned that situations where political office holders fail to take appropriate actions to maintain peace in their domain only to start inviting the military and at the same throwing tantrums at such institution is not only callous, wicked and senseless but should be stopped with immediate effect to enable genuine stakeholders work together for the peace and unity of the country.

The Coalition at a joint parley between online newspapers and social media influencers held in Abuja on Monday, said it had tracked violence related to herdsmen/farmers clashes across Nigeria and is of the opinion that the crisis was left to escalate because Governors ot Benue and Taraba States have decided to play politics with human lives using armed militias and warlords to escalate the crisis unabated.

The gathering also noted some politicians found wanting in their obligations to their citizens have seen the situation as a cash cow to further exploit the people rather than take steps to mitigate the crisis in order to derive both political and financial benefits.

According to the human rights group, this much was derived after a careful analysis of the situation using surveys, questionnaires and interviews with critical stakeholders, as well as victims.

Barrister Maxwell Gowon, leader of the coalition in the report said it was observed that the dynamics of this crisis are poorly understood by a wider spectrum of stakeholders, which has impacted support for initiatives aimed at solving the problem.

His words, “The Coalition therefore embarked on a review of the clashes with a view to making interventions that will spur rapid resolution of the crisis so that life can again return to normal for the millions of people that have been negatively affected.

“In the course of this review, the Coalition’s researchers visited some selected affected communities in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, Kogi and Nasarawa states. These states were selected using heat maps developed from interactively plotting reported incidents against locations on the map. The selected states, with the exception of Nasarawa, were chosen because they recorded the highest number and most intense level of violence in the 18 months that were assessed.

“Researchers also polled officers of the military and security agencies that have been deployed in the crisis areas. Questionnaires were distributed; interviews were conducted, as well as surveys.

From its findings, the group said the outcome of the review revealed that since its deployment to address the crisis, the military has made commendable efforts at restoring order as it has arrested and neutralized some of the criminal elements unleashing mayhem on affected communities.

The report says, “This is being carried out without any sentiment by the Nigerian military and in a few instances the government forces were not spared by criminal elements. For example, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Tukur Buratai at an address on the deployment of troops to crisis areas said “We have deployed officers across Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states where to ensure peace and stability for the development and betterment of our country.”

On the allegation that troops were conniving with criminal elements and the presidency has refused to act was investigated, the coalition said its finding revealed that only criminal elements and their agents in power who nurse the ambition of using the military for personal duties and were rebuffed nurse such conspiracy theories in their reasoning.

“This is not only worrisome but must be discarded to avoid returning to the military to its old nature where some highly placed citizens could press the trigger from the comfort of their homes.

“The deployment of the military to these troubled zones has helped to restore normalcy to most of the affected communities even though the question of armed militias is yet to be addressed with the needed political will and courage from actors within this locality.

Our investigations also noted that most of these militias had been armed by some highly placed individuals and efforts by the Nigerian Army to mop up these arms from them have not received the needed cooperation.

“The crisis between herdsmen and Farmers in some instances is instigated by persons without stakes on either side of the divide between herders and farmers. Unrelated hostilities between warring communities are also passed off as attacks by armed herdsmen. There was an instance in Benue State at Omusu where a clear case of conflict between Omusus and Okana communities in Okpokwu Local Government Area was reported as “armed herdsmen attack” even when it has nothing to do with an existing conflict between Omusu community and herdsmen.

“There are active attempts to mislead Nigerians, the Federal Government and the international community into believing that “killer” herdsmen are out to wipe out other ethnic groups when in some cases ethnic warlords are instigating militias to carry out attacks on their perceived enemies and make same look like the work of armed herdsmen. These actors in their desperate outings have gone further to link the Nigerian military with such heinous actions. However, our investigations have confirmed otherwise and it’s imperative for Nigerians and the world to take note. “

The group further commended the Army for extending the exercise in some states however added that such extension should be granted in more states until ethnic warlords and criminal elements decide to embrace peaceful approaches towards resolving the crisis.

The Coalition also warned that some actors have taken undue advantage of the situation to further their ethnic interest above the national interest which citizens should pursue, urging such persons to retrace their steps if not be ready to face the appropriate international instruments.",Human rights coalition releases report on herdsmen/farmers crises in Nigeria,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/human-rights-coalition-releases-report-on-herdsmen-farmers-crises-in-nigeria/
12,nigeria,"Healing the mental scars of violence in northeastern Nigeria

Umar Musami, Psychiatrist, Federal Neuro Psychiatric Hospital looking at medication for mental disorders in Bakass Camp in early March 2018 WHO/C. Onuekwe

It began as a hot autumn day like any other for Aisha (pseudonym). The girl with big eyes was looking out of the window of her house, watching a group of men approach her brothers who were harvesting crops. Aisha thought they were family friends because they came up close to her siblings.

Her mother Gaji was doing her household chores when she heard her 13-year-old daughter let out a piercing scream.

""Mother, they are killing my brothers!"" cried out Aisha.

After that, Gaji doesn’t remember much except that somehow she fled with her daughter to the surrounding countryside. They returned later to bury the young men who, like so many others, were murdered by insurgents.

The killings which Aisha witnessed aggravated her already fragile mental state.

“She became violent, kicking and fighting everyone,” said Gaiji. “I couldn’t control her.”

Initially the mother and daughter returned to their home in northeastern Nigeria, but the armed rebels made forays into that community as well. So Gaji moved with Aisha to Bakass, a camp for internally displaced people on the outskirts of Maiduguri in Borno state.

Gaji worried about her daughter, who had trouble communicating and would often disappear.

“I couldn’t leave her alone, because I wasn’t sure what she would do,” said Gaji.

Nearly 7 million people are living in camps for internally displaced people (IDP) in northeastern Nigeria.

In emergency settings, the rate of common mental disorders can double. Gender based violence, abductions, and gross atrocities can trigger psychological problems which take years to heal.

WHO estimates that as many as 1 in 5 people in IDP camps may need mental health care.

Despite this huge and urgent demand for care, there is only one specialized mental health facility in the whole region. The Federal Neuro-Psychiatric hospital of Maiduguri has seen the number of its patients increase significantly.

“In a humanitarian crisis, mental health is often neglected because the focus is on saving lives due to preventable infectious diseases such as diarrhea, respiratory tract infections and malaria,” said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative to Nigeria. “But WHO has made mental healthcare one of its top priorities in northeastern Nigeria.”

In September 2017, WHO, Borno state authorities and the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric hospital teamed up to launch the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The partners trained 64 primary healthcare workers in IDP camps and other humanitarian facilities to recognize and treat mental disorders which are common in emergency settings.

Aisha was one of the first beneficiaries of the programme. She began her treatment in October 2017 in the Bakass camp. Falmata Muhammed is a primary healthcare worker who provides psychosocial support to Aisha once a week.

If Falmata has questions over how to handle difficult cases she can turn to her supervisor, Umar Musami, Psychiatrist, Federal Neuro Psychiatric Hospital. Umar visits Bakass camp every two weeks to also treat patients and observe Falmata.

“I either supervise her in person or she calls me on the phone and tells me the patient’s symptoms and I will advise her on what to do,” said Umar.

In the first five months of the programme, 5 000 people accessed mental healthcare in 36 primary healthcare facilities. In 2018, WHO is scaling up the pilot intervention and training 70 additional health workers across northeastern Nigeria.

For Aisha, her treatment is helping her to overcome the scars left behind by that autumn day when her world broke apart.

“Aisha has improved remarkably,” said Umar. “When she came she was having severe psychological issues, but she is now doing better.”

Aisha can now help her mother with household chores.

“I don’t fight with people anymore and I can go on errands,” said Aisha. She now dreams of becoming a civil servant.",Healing the mental scars of violence in northeastern Nigeria,http://www.who.int/features/2018/mental-violence-nigeria/en/
13,nigeria,"As the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), decides today on the tenure elongation it earlier proposed for the National Working Committee (NWC)-led by the National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun on February 27, the question is what are the concern of those in support of the extension, if it is eventually reversed?

Although, President Muhammadu Buhari, who was present at the meeting where the tenure extension was decided, made a u-turn on March 27, members remain divided on the subject.

The President cited legal implications as his reason for changing his mind, agreeing with others who think the decision did only contradict the APC Constitution, but also the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He reasoned that the outcome of the decision might destroy the party, if allowed to stay.

The argument that the party does not have sufficient time to manage congresses between now and next general election was dismissed on the basis that it is not the business of law if any political party fails to manage its time appropriately. “The law would not take that as an excuse.”

He, therefore, urged the NEC to reconsider the decision, which already has started generating controversies among the party leaders.

Some stakeholders, including governors, had bought into Buhari’s suggestion, which led to the setting up of a technical committee, headed by the Governor of Plateau State, Simenon Lalong.

The committee was mandated to offer advise on the decision. On Friday, the committed submitted the report, which is scheduled for presentation today.

From feelers, it appears the group has suggested that the congresses should be organized instead of extending the tenure of the present executives.

Notwithstanding, some members remain convinced that tenure extension is a wiser decision.

This group holds the views that the party may not be able to handle the fallout of crises that will follow the congress, and that the time may be too short to manage it.

Apart from timing, The Guardian also gathered that the ‘apostles of tenure extension’ were also concerned about their political future in the party, particularly those governors nursing re-election ambition in 2019 and the outgoing ones, who have chosen their successors in office. Some of these governors are also nursing ambition of running for the senate.

These ‘apostles tenure of extension’ might wear two colors today during the NEC meeting, The Guardian learnt.

One, they may not want to be seen as opposing President Buhari’s position on the matter due to the respect they have for him, though they are jittery over the outcome of election should the party holds the congress.

Part of the fears is that loyalist of Tinubu, whom they consider dangerous to their personal ambition, may emerge as executives that would midwife the party’s primaries for the coming elections.

The group is not persuaded by the explanation that the extension of tenure for Odigie-Oyegun and other NWC members has nothing to do with the subtle war between the incumbent national chairman and Tinubu.

A party insider told The Guardian that if Tinubu by error of omission or commission allow the tenure extension to scale through, “he is bound to experience worse things in the party than what he faced in the last three years under the leadership of Odigie-Oyegun.”

According to the source, “If you follow the arguments, you will understand where those that were against the tenure extension belong and the other faction, who have chosen to maintain silence since Buhari voiced out belong.”

The source also said that Mr. Buhari must have realized his mistake of nonchalant attitude to take control of the party machinery from day one and his error of not showing interest in who controls the leadership of the National Assembly. The consequences of his action are the series of face-off between the presidency and the legislative arms since the beginning of this administration.

If the party eventually opted for congresses, fresh executive members emerge and this would subsequently allow the true ownership of the APC take control of the party and the machinery of government. With this development, some of the governors seeking reelection, members of the State Executive Council, lawmakers and others may not make it beyond next year in government if fresh executive comes up after the congress.

The source said the intention of President Buhari’s wife; Aisha should be scrutinized when she said that those who helped her husband to become president have been sidelined.

Tinubu’s wife, Senator Oluremi also made similar outburst recently when she said her husband was “trashed” after the party won the 2015 election.

The deciding factor would definitely be the congress as it is near certain the NEC would reverse itself on extension of tenure today.

However would the newfound romance between Buhari and Tinubu and their loyalists be able to distabilise the machinery of the rival faction at the congress to bring in new executives with godfathers? Or will the NEC come out today with a different alternative? Clues to the answer may emerge today.

The humanitarian crisis in the region remains one of the most severe in the world today, with at least 7.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. About 80 per cent of them, 6.1 million, are targeted for humanitarian assistance. This $9 million allocation will help fund 15 projects.

16,nigeria,"OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

In February 2018, humanitarian partners and the Government of Nigeria officially launched the Humanitarian Response Plan, based on priorities and vulnerabilities identified in the Humanitarian Needs Overview. A total of 60 organisations have committed to implementing 173 projects aimed at providing in life-saving assistance to 6.1 million women, children and men in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. The total funding requirements for 2018 stand at US$1.05 billion. This year the response will also focus on durable solutions, early recovery, livelihoods and basic services rehabilitation, across all sectors, to support a multi-year vision that goes beyond saving lives today.

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.7 million persons remain internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and 3.7 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). The Food Security and Nutrition needs are expected to be revised in March with the publication of the new Cadre Harmonisé analysis.

Large-scale population movements, triggered largely by insecurity, continue with 12,500 new arrivals in February alone, especially in Gwoza, Mobbar, Bama, Nganzai, Kukawa, Magumeri among others. Additional IDP influxes were also recorded from neighbouring countries, including Cameroon and Niger, into IDP camps and return areas in Ngala and Mobbar. Since late October 2017, over 60,000 vulnerable persons have been on the move for various reasons including insecurity, improved security in certain areas and poor living conditions. While assessments are still ongoing in these hotspot areas, rapid assessments and gap analyses have been developed and initial findings show that thousands, including host communities, are in dire need of food, water, shelter, blankets and clothes, and medical care. A multi-sectoral response has been possible through the rapid response mechanism and humanitarian organisations have scaled up their advocacy and resource mobilisation activities in order to meet the needs of the affected people. Additional displacements are expected for as long as hostilities will continue as newly arrived persons report that many more families remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian workers.

A suspected cholera epidemic broke out in Kukawa LGA, Borno State, in the towns of Baga and Doro. Since 13 February, close to 500 acute watery diarrhoea cases, suspected to actually be cholera cases, have been reported by the Borno State Ministry of Health.

A timely and coordinated response has been put in place and the outbreak should be under control in the coming weeks.

Humanitarian access continues to present major challenges, especially in Borno State. It is estimated that some 926,000 persons remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian organisations. Through civil-military coordination and community engagement, aid workers are working to expand the humanitarian space in north-east Nigeria. In addition, to improve local coordination and last-mile assistance, and increase the presence of humanitarians where vulnerable populations are living, to date, five ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza) offering secure accommodation and Internet connectivity have been made operational. Another three (Monguno, Damasak and Banki) are expected to be fully operational in the coming weeks and another one, in Rann, is also planned, bringing the total to nine.

Although funds received in 2018 are extremely low for most sectors as of 28 February 2018, with only 2.4 per cent ($25.6 million) of the requirements met, most partners are able to continue to provide life-saving assistance thanks to about $196 million carryover funding from 2017. However, for the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be received across all the sectors.","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-february-2018
17,nigeria,"The crisis rocking the Ohanaeze Ndigbo took a turn for the worst on Sunday as the Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, and the Women Wing of the group have announced the suspension of the President-General, Chief John Nnia Nwodo.

This came seven days after the groups passed a vote of no confidence on the Nwodo-led Ohanaeze.

Nwodo’s loyalists had fired back immediately, calling the bluff of the youth and the women groups, whose tenures they said had ended a year ago.

But in a statement jointly signed by leaders of the two wings, after their meeting, and emailed to DAILY POST, they said Nwodo had now been suspended for refusing to appear before a disciplinary committee set up to investigate allegations against his leadership.

It was signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, President, Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, Secretary General, Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Engr Obinna Adibe, National PRO, Ohanaeze Youth wing and Chief Hon. (Mrs) Calista N. Adimachukwu, President General, Ohanaeze Igbo Women Organisation.

The statement read: “With the 7-Day ultimatum given to the embattled President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Dr. Nnia Nwodo, having expired, and having had him instead of clearing his sullen hands from the weighty allegations of highhandedness and turning Ohanaeze Ndigbo into a political appendage party for those that could pay and pick his greedy bills – the main issue why he was asked to clear his names, to start ordering for termination of leadership and calling for elections into the Youth and women wings for querying him for his gross antisocial behaviours;

“We, the well meaning and rightly focused Ohanaeze Youth Wing, OYW, under the President General, Mazi Okechukwu Isisguzoro, having earlier-on reaffirmed our confidence in our present Executives, hereby, in a joint meeting with Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women Wing, therefore, we will no longer have Dr. Nnia Nwodo to continue doing his businesses with Igbo identity and political interests, and hereby arrive at the following decisions, as advised by the 7-man Investigation committee that Nnia Nwodo failed to appear before, to clear his names:

“That, we the Ohanaeze Youth Wing, OYW and Ohanaeze Women Wing had for so long tolerated the shameful and debased politics of Chief Nnia Nwodo led Ohanaeze Ndigbo, while he sidelines the various organs of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, including Ime Obi and his 24 – man led EXCOS that are there to represent their various localities and States and having relegated them to the backgrounds to getting little or no attention from their respective state, socio-cultural and political constituencies; and charters of offices and demands.

“We hereby find Nwodo loathsome and guilty of anti-Igbo politicking and badly moneyed-Igbo polity killer-character that in the first circumstance had no role for political and social services not just Ndigbo’s. Having failed to appear before the 7-man panel to clear himself of all the weighty gross breaches of office and constitution of Ohanaaeze Ndigbo, we take the Investigative Panel’s submission that by so doing he seems to have nothing to deny the wrongs as catalogued against him by Ohanaeze Youth Wing; Chief Nnia Nwodo is hereby suspended and should not be seen around Ohanaeze Ndigbo secretariat nor operate by proxy! He remains suspended!

“Holding vital evidences on how he has been collecting and hunting for monies at the expense of the Igbo nation, Biafra and Nigeria plights, from one government house to another and as well with Nwodo been at the becks and calls of the money-bags/politicians doing errand boy Ohanaeze Presidency. Nwodo remains suspended!

“That Nnia Nwodo occupies the vintage Ohanaeze Ndigbo presidency and still talking from both sides of his mouth to soiling the preeminent Ohanaeze concept, not just Ohanaeze Ndigbo, leading to our earlier calls for him to give accounts of his stewardship but he, instead of taking the ample opportunity to clear his mess, took to media charades announcing that Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings, were long suspended and there would be elections for the new leadership to pilot their affairs. Nwodo, remains suspended!

“Assuming without conceding that there are no functional Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings while we have Nwodo’s almighty Ohanaeze Ndigbo as made known to the media by the non-functional, but now politically romanced and activated, Secretary General Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Uche Okwukwu, whose names have been missing in Ohanaeze records of Secretary general duties courtesy of Nwodo, to now alleging that Ohanaeze Youth Wing and Women wing have respectively ceased to exist nor have leadership since 2016 and 2017, is a bad tale in their mouth. Nwodo remains suspended!

“That Nwodo’s Ohanaeze Ndigbo are now calling for elections in both Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings, with promises of selling forms to gullible aspirants is another political mischief showing gross case of maladministration and intolerance of opposing views with the sole intent to dismember the youth and women wings, more. While this remains condemnable, we shall resist this Nwodo’s sham with the last drops of our bloods till Ohanaeze Ndigbo is rescued and reorganized with a National Acting Steering Committee in-charge and we call upon the Igbo leaders of thoughts, especially the mature minds and notable Ime Obi, Ohanaeze leaders namely Prof Ben Nwabueze, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, Dr. Dozie Ikedife, Prof Amuche Azi, Dr. Kate Onwe, Chief Ralph Obiaoha, Chief Obi Nwaka, Engr. Isaac Wowu, Richard Ozobu, Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu to come to Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s rescue.

“That Nnia Nwodo speaks from both sides of his mouth while at the same time claiming to represent the pan social ideals of Ohanaeze, leading to Ohanaeze Ndigbo organizational frameworks, is verily worrisome and too poor expected of any person that occupies such vintage post of Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership. That Nwodo speaks differently in different foras on Igbo politics, Biafra restoration and inequalities in Nigerian nationality to now conscripted himself “minister of restructuring” without consulting his Igbo people because a Northeast presidential aspirant now picks his bills and any Igbo not thinking in the same direction with him is in his Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s Black book. This has been the plight of the Ohanaeze youth and women wings. For this, Nwodo remains suspended and ceases to represent Ohanaeze Ndgbo and Igbo nation in any capacity!

18,nigeria,"Within hours of announcing his intention to run, the president traveled to London to attend a meeting of Commonwealth leaders. His office did not give a date for his return, leading to renewed rumors in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, that Mr. Buhari would once again be receiving medical attention in London.

Mr. Buhari enjoyed widespread support after winning the election in 2015, but it dissipated as Nigeria suffered through a recession in 2016 and 2017, and new attacks from Boko Haram, the Islamist rebel group.

“Security and the economy are the two main areas of disillusionment,” said Sola Tayo, a fellow at Chatham House, a British foreign affairs think tank. “Whilst the economy has picked up since the recession, the security situation appears to be deteriorating.”

“The herder-farmer conflict, rural banditry and the increase in kidnapping are being discussed more openly and government performance being judged more critically,” she said.

It was predictable that Mr. Buhari would run again, said Ayisha Osori, a Nigerian author, lawyer and political activist. As for whether he would win, “it is too early to say,” she said. “A lot will depend on the other candidates.”

The highest-profile challenger to emerge so far is Atiku Abubakar, 71, a former vice president and wealthy businessman who has said he will run in 2019. The election is expected to be held in February.

To remind Nigerians of Mr. Buhari’s appeal, his office has released pictures of crowds warmly greeting the president in several visits to mostly northern cities, his base of support.

Nigeria has an unofficial practice of alternating the presidency between the mostly Christian south and the predominantly Muslim north. Ms. Osori said that ambitious southern contenders might decide that it makes more sense to wait until the president has served two terms — the maximum allowed by law — and it is clearly the south’s “turn.”

Mr. Buhari's return to Nigeria last August only partially eased the fevered speculation about his health. When Mr. Buhari worked from home for several weeks, his spokesman explained it was because of the presence of rats in the president’s office. He became the subject of widespread ridicule in Nigeria.

That ridicule turned to anger in February, when Boko Haram abducted 110 schoolgirls in Dapchi, in the northeast. The president had insisted for nearly two years that the group had been defeated, and the abductions led to new questions about the government’s security strategy and its response to the kidnappings.

In March, 104 of the girls were returned to the town after successful negotiations between Boko Haram and the government. The militants drove the girls back into the town, preaching to locals against enrolling their children to school in an unprecedented propaganda effort.

Under Mr. Buhari, the government has also negotiated the release of more than 100 of the girls Boko Haram captured in Chibok in 2014, before he took office.

As a general, Mr. Buhari headed the Nigerian government from 1983 to 1985, following a military coup. Years later, he ran for president several times before being elected.","Nigeria’s President, Facing Calls to Step Aside, Says He Will Run Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/world/africa/nigeria-president-election.html

• The Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2018 was launched on February 8th to serve as the annual plan for the humanitarian community’s programming in the 3 most crisis-affected States in North East Nigeria.

• More than 1,634,000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, according to IOM DTM Round XXI (February 2018). This represents a 4.6% increase to the December round. Eight out of ten IDPs are in Borno state.

• As of February 28th, WASH sector partners reported 794 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) in northern Borno state (Kukawa LGA). Laboratory tests carried out confirmed some of the cases as cholera.

• With 60%funding gap, health, WASH, and child protection remain the most critically underfunded sectors.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno1 . This represents an increase of 4.6% since December 2017, due to both improved access to Konduga LGA (Tungushe ward) and new arrivals from areas experiencing conflict. The Borno State capital Maiduguri, however, recorded a decrease in new arrivals, highlighting that returns to areas of origin continues where security permits.

In order to meet new humanitarian needs, the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) has released a reserve allocation of $8.9 million for interventions focused on the Monguno and Pulka axes. The increase in new arrivals continues to put pressure on the delivery of humanitarian services in the IDP settlements in terms of shelter, NFIs, health and nutrition, provision of food and access to water and sanitation. Water shortages in Pulka remain a cause for concern, and are predicted to worsen due to the recent and ongoing increase in the population. Humanitarian actors continue to advocate with the Nigerian security forces on the possibility of drilling outside of the security perimeter to relieve the pressure on the town.

Humanitarian actors are also preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Marte LGA and areas around Gudumbali, where Nigerian Security Forces have announced planned military operations. Responses to meet the needs of these populations (47,000 and 135,000, respectively, of which approximately half are estimated to displace if hostilities take place) are likely to require additional resources.

On February 19, an attack on a Girls Science Secondary School in Dapchi, Yobe State, resulted in the abduction of more than 100 girls. UNICEF provided psychosocial support to the children who escaped the abduction.

As of February 28, WASH sector partners reported a total 794 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) in Kukawa LGA.

Laboratory tests confirmed some of these to be cholera. Lack of access to safe drinking water has been identified as the key problem. An integrated cholera response is ongoing, with strong support from the UNICEF WASH, health, education and Communication for Development (C4D) sections, in collaboration with partners. Additionally, within the reporting period, a Hepatitis E outbreak was reported in Rann (Kala-Balge LGA) on February 1. By February 15, a total of 31 cases had been reported in the LGA.","Nigeria Humanitarian SitRep No. 2, 01-28 February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-sitrep-no-2-01-28-february-2018
20,nigeria,"(Maiduguri, 2 April 2018): The UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Yassine Gaba, currently Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim, strongly condemns the deadly combined attack which took place near Belle Village, in the outskirts of Borno State’s capital, Maiduguri, on Sunday 1 April. According to local sources, at least 34 civilians lost their lives in this attack and some 90 others were injured.

The recent weeks have seen a steady continuation of attacks on civilians in the three most conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, in the north-east of Nigeria. Since the beginning of the year, reportedly, at least 120 civilian women, children and men were killed and over 210 sustained serious injuries, in over 22 attacks allegedly by non-state armed groups directly targeting civilians. Civilians are also regularly abducted, as in Dapchi, Yobe State, where 110 school girls were taken on 19 February.

“Innocent civilians continue to suffer daily from direct and indiscriminate attacks in the north-east of Nigeria,” said Mr. Gaba. “Endless numbers of explosions, brutal killings, abductions and lootings continue to uproot the lives of women, children and men daily. I call on all parties to the conflict to end this violence and to respect human life and dignity.”

The protection of civilians is a major focus of the ongoing humanitarian response in the north-east of Nigeria, where 7.7 million people remain in dire need of humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, water and health care, in the most conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe.

Women, children and men face daily grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of girls, women, boys and men have been abducted and children continue to be used routinely as so-called “suicide” bombers.

21,nigeria,"A nongovernmental organization, the Coalition on Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Nigeria said over 2000 lives have been lost to violent activities and clashes between herdsmen and farmers in the country.

The group also said thousands of Nigerians have been displaced by the conflict in a report read by Barrister Maxwell Gowon, the leader of the coalition during a media conference in Abuja on Monday.

The coalition said the figure was derived from its tracking of loss of lives, properties and other consequences of the clashes between the herdsmen and farmers Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, Kogi and Nasarawa states and careful analysis of the situation using surveys, questionnaires and interviews with critical stakeholders as well as victims. Armed Fulani herdsmen

He said, “The Coalition, therefore, embarked on a review of the clashes with a view to making interventions that will spur rapid resolution of the crisis so that life can again return to normal for the millions of people that have been negatively affected. In the course of this review, the Coalition’s researchers visited some selected affected communities in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, Kogi and Nasarawa states.

“These states were selected using heat maps developed from interactively plotting reported incidents against locations on the map. The selected states, with the exception of Nasarawa, were chosen because they recorded the highest number and most intense level of violence in the 18 months that were assessed.

“Researchers also polled officers of the military and security agencies that have been deployed in the crisis areas. Questionnaires were distributed; interviews were conducted, as well as surveys.”

The group also said its findings revealed that some governors had turn the situation into a cash cow to further exploit their people for political and financial benefits rather than taking rigorous steps to fight the calamities.

It added that it also observed that the changing aspects of these crises were poorly understood by a wider spectrum of stakeholders, which has impacted support for initiatives aimed at solving the problem.

Contrary to popular opinion, the group claims the outcome of the review has revealed that the military has been effective in returning peace and order to the affected areas through the arrests it has made.

The report says, “This is being carried out without any sentiment by the Nigerian military and in a few instances the government forces were not spared by criminal elements. For example, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Tukur Buratai at an address on the deployment of troops to crisis areas said: “We have deployed officers across Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states where to ensure peace and stability for the development and betterment of our country.”

The report continues, “The crisis between herdsmen and Farmers in some instances is instigated by persons without stakes on either side of the divide between herders and farmers. Unrelated hostilities between warring communities are also passed off as attacks by armed herdsmen. There was an instance in Benue State at Omusu where a clear case of conflict between Omusus and Okana communities in Okpokwu Local Government Area was reported as “armed herdsmen attack” even when it has nothing to do with an existing conflict between Omusu community and herdsmen.”

The group also called for the extension of the Exercise Ayem Akpatuma in Taraba state to more states affected by the herdsmen clashes with the farmers.",Over 2000 Nigerians Killed In Farmers-Herdsmen Clashes Across Nigeria- Group,http://saharareporters.com/2018/04/09/over-2000-nigerians-killed-farmers-herdsmen-clashes-across-nigeria-group
22,nigeria,"Widespread violence has plagued Nigeria over the years, with an epicenter of activity in northeast parts of the country. Much of this violence is related to the Boko Haram insurgency, although other battles between ethnic groups have also intensified, largely over land and partly due to a growing drought. Despite some success by Nigerian security forces in tamping down violence, lives continue to be lost and communities displaced. All of this is ongoing as the country prepares to hold elections next year.

On March 26, the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a discussion on the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. Panelists included Alexandra Lamarche and Mark Yarnell of Refugees International, authors of the recent report “Political Pressure to Return: Putting Northeast Nigeria’s Displaced Citizens at Risk.” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at Brookings, briefed the findings from her January fieldwork in northeastern Nigeria on the state of counterinsurgency, security, and reconstruction efforts.

23,nigeria,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents arrived in the northeastern Nigerian town of Rann on March 1. Ignoring the camp for 55,000 people displaced by the region’s conflict, they stormed the nearby military base.

Inside, the gunmen executed eight security personnel and three aid staff working for the United Nations, according to security sources and photos seen by Reuters.

It was the first publicly-acknowledged killing of aid staff by Boko Haram insurgents, but for humanitarians struggling to reach millions of people in need of aid it was a realization of a long-held fear and another setback for a crisis response that has been criticized for being too slow.

Given the precarious situation in the region bordering Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the aid workers in many areas use military escorts and stay on or by bases.

For years, some aid workers had objected to such practices, saying they undermined humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and put staff at risk.

“We are caught in a situation where humanitarian aid is part of a larger security and political agenda and that challenges the delivery of aid according to humanitarian principles,” said Hugues Robert, program manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Nigeria.

Zainab Ahmed, the Nigerian minister of state for budget and national planning who is responsible for coordinating the government relief efforts, did not respond to a request for comment about the attack on Rann.

The United Nations, which describes the situation as one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, said in February that 7.7 million people in the three most affected states depended on aid for survival.

Since Boko Haram first launched attacks in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, over 4,000 abducted and 1.6 million were still displaced in Nigeria at the end of 2017, according to the United Nations. (tmsnrt.rs/2CsEQGH)

WAR CRIME

While attacks on aid workers constitute a war crime, the perceived politicization and militarization of aid in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria has led to a growing number of attacks on humanitarian staff in war zones.

In Nigeria, even though the army launched an offensive against Boko Haram in 2015 with the help of forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, much of the northeast outside cities such as Borno state capital Maiduguri remains a no-go zone. (tmsnrt.rs/2DjT88r)

“International humanitarian law is designed to prevent incidents like the Rann attack. By militarizing humanitarian sites - yet failing to protect them - the Nigerian military is putting vulnerable civilians in harm’s way,” said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House’s Africa Programme.

“Worried that the Nigerian government could obstruct their work, international entities have turned a blind eye to the militarization of internally displaced persons’ camps and official corruption in the humanitarian space that puts civilians at even greater risk,” he said.

The Nigerian military did not respond to request for comment.

In the wake of the Rann attack, some humanitarian groups are pushing for a reassessment of relations with the military, particularly the U.N.’s, according to people familiar with the discussions this month.

“There were definitely questions being asked,” said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president at InterAction, an alliance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world.

“There was a feeling, from some NGOs that I spoke with but also some U.N. actors, that we kind of just went along with what the government was proposing,” said McIlreavy, one of the authors of a U.N. report about the crisis response.

Asked whether working in close proximity with the military put aid staff at risk, a U.N. spokeswoman said the international community in Nigeria upheld the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity.

“In the context of northeast Nigeria, military escorts are used as a last resort, in areas where security risks are very high,” she said.

SLOW RESPONSE

Aid agencies have now pulled out of Rann, leaving tens of thousands uprooted by the fighting living again in parlous conditions with little or no international humanitarian support.

Problems with the response to the crisis, including how closely humanitarians were working with the military, had been identified long before the attack.

As early as 2013, there were warnings of a food crisis in the region, from the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and others. In 2015, the United Nations and other NGOs said more than 50,000 people faced famine.

Yet, for many, the crisis response only really began in June 2016 after MSF visited Bama town and discovered 24,000 people, including 4,500 children under five, living in catastrophic conditions which the agency said were “beyond critical”.

Near the camp MSF found a field of evenly-spaced indentations in the earth, marked only by the occasional scrap of metal: 1,233 graves, 480 for children.

When MSF’s news of Bama spread, Nigeria declared a “nutrition emergency” in Borno state and U.N. agencies started to ramp up the humanitarian response.

Disputes within the United Nations and aid groups, tense relations with the government and a slow response both internationally and by Nigerian politicians over the preceding years had all helped make a desperate situation catastrophic, said aid workers, diplomats, politicians and security personnel.

“We all recognize that the international response here was in general very slow at the beginning,” said Peter Lundberg, who was head of the U.N.’s response in the northeast until December.

Many of the people involved with the crisis response interviewed by Reuters said Nigeria had been reluctant to accept food aid over concern it would harm the image of the country, the biggest economy in Africa. They also said some international groups held back from speaking out about the crisis for fear it would damage their relations with Abuja.

“To be fair to the international community, I think that there was also from the government side a reluctance to perhaps fully acknowledge not only that it was a conflict but it was actually turning into a humanitarian crisis. And unfortunately that’s not uncommon,” Lundberg told Reuters in November.

In 2016, MSF said it had been raising the alarm with U.N. agencies for two years but they had failed to respond.

A spokesman for WFP said it could only operate in a country at the request of the government and in Nigeria that didn’t happen until March 2016.

He said WFP’s response was one of its “most significant and swift expansions ever”, adding that it planned to deliver aid to 1.5 million people a month by June, from 1 million now.

‘TOXIC NARRATIVE’

Despite a massive increase in budgets and humanitarian staff working in the region over the past two years, the response was still wracked with problems holding back aid as recently as June, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters.

It described a “toxic narrative” between the Nigerian government and the humanitarian community, an “us and them” divide between the United Nations and other NGOs and a relief effort that failed to adhere to international humanitarian law.

The report also warned that the Nigerian government had failed to grasp the reality of the situation on the ground.

“Arguably the most critical factor in scaling up in a manner commensurate to the massive needs, is to orient the attention of the government of Nigeria to commit more of their own resources to humanitarian and recovery efforts in the northeast,” it said.

A U.N. spokeswoman said the assessment was “quite dated” and a task force including representatives from the United Nations, international NGOs and donor countries was expected to issue an internal report on progress this month.

Even at the start of 2018, issues described in the report still threatened to undermine the response.

In a Jan. 2 letter to the government seen by Reuters, Edward Kallon, the U.N.’s top humanitarian official in Nigeria, said tensions with the government were delaying a fund-raising appeal.

While the disagreements were resolved in time for the February launch of the 2018 humanitarian response plan, letters sent by both sides highlight a fraught relationship.

“Time is not on our side,” Kallon wrote to Ahmed.

In a Jan. 5 reply, also seen by Reuters, Ahmed said Kallon had been “extremely disrespectful ... we are concerned that this situation is becoming untenable and therefore unacceptable to us.”

The U.N. and Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment on the letters.",Killing of aid workers in Nigeria a setback for troubled crisis response,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/killing-of-aid-workers-in-nigeria-a-setback-for-troubled-crisis-response-idUSKBN1GY0LN
