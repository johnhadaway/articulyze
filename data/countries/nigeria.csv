0,nigeria,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents arrived in the northeastern Nigerian town of Rann on March 1. Ignoring the camp for 55,000 people displaced by the region’s conflict, they stormed the nearby military base.

Inside, the gunmen executed eight security personnel and three aid staff working for the United Nations, according to security sources and photos seen by Reuters.

It was the first publicly-acknowledged killing of aid staff by Boko Haram insurgents, but for humanitarians struggling to reach millions of people in need of aid it was a realization of a long-held fear and another setback for a crisis response that has been criticized for being too slow.

Given the precarious situation in the region bordering Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the aid workers in many areas use military escorts and stay on or by bases.

For years, some aid workers had objected to such practices, saying they undermined humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and put staff at risk.

“We are caught in a situation where humanitarian aid is part of a larger security and political agenda and that challenges the delivery of aid according to humanitarian principles,” said Hugues Robert, program manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Nigeria.

Zainab Ahmed, the Nigerian minister of state for budget and national planning who is responsible for coordinating the government relief efforts, did not respond to a request for comment about the attack on Rann.

The United Nations, which describes the situation as one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, said in February that 7.7 million people in the three most affected states depended on aid for survival.

Since Boko Haram first launched attacks in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, over 4,000 abducted and 1.6 million were still displaced in Nigeria at the end of 2017, according to the United Nations. (tmsnrt.rs/2CsEQGH)

WAR CRIME

While attacks on aid workers constitute a war crime, the perceived politicization and militarization of aid in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria has led to a growing number of attacks on humanitarian staff in war zones.

In Nigeria, even though the army launched an offensive against Boko Haram in 2015 with the help of forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, much of the northeast outside cities such as Borno state capital Maiduguri remains a no-go zone. (tmsnrt.rs/2DjT88r)

“International humanitarian law is designed to prevent incidents like the Rann attack. By militarizing humanitarian sites - yet failing to protect them - the Nigerian military is putting vulnerable civilians in harm’s way,” said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House’s Africa Programme.

“Worried that the Nigerian government could obstruct their work, international entities have turned a blind eye to the militarization of internally displaced persons’ camps and official corruption in the humanitarian space that puts civilians at even greater risk,” he said.

The Nigerian military did not respond to request for comment.

In the wake of the Rann attack, some humanitarian groups are pushing for a reassessment of relations with the military, particularly the U.N.’s, according to people familiar with the discussions this month.

“There were definitely questions being asked,” said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president at InterAction, an alliance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world.

“There was a feeling, from some NGOs that I spoke with but also some U.N. actors, that we kind of just went along with what the government was proposing,” said McIlreavy, one of the authors of a U.N. report about the crisis response.

Asked whether working in close proximity with the military put aid staff at risk, a U.N. spokeswoman said the international community in Nigeria upheld the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity.

“In the context of northeast Nigeria, military escorts are used as a last resort, in areas where security risks are very high,” she said.

SLOW RESPONSE

Aid agencies have now pulled out of Rann, leaving tens of thousands uprooted by the fighting living again in parlous conditions with little or no international humanitarian support.

Problems with the response to the crisis, including how closely humanitarians were working with the military, had been identified long before the attack.

As early as 2013, there were warnings of a food crisis in the region, from the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and others. In 2015, the United Nations and other NGOs said more than 50,000 people faced famine.

Yet, for many, the crisis response only really began in June 2016 after MSF visited Bama town and discovered 24,000 people, including 4,500 children under five, living in catastrophic conditions which the agency said were “beyond critical”.

Near the camp MSF found a field of evenly-spaced indentations in the earth, marked only by the occasional scrap of metal: 1,233 graves, 480 for children.

When MSF’s news of Bama spread, Nigeria declared a “nutrition emergency” in Borno state and U.N. agencies started to ramp up the humanitarian response.

Disputes within the United Nations and aid groups, tense relations with the government and a slow response both internationally and by Nigerian politicians over the preceding years had all helped make a desperate situation catastrophic, said aid workers, diplomats, politicians and security personnel.

“We all recognize that the international response here was in general very slow at the beginning,” said Peter Lundberg, who was head of the U.N.’s response in the northeast until December.

Many of the people involved with the crisis response interviewed by Reuters said Nigeria had been reluctant to accept food aid over concern it would harm the image of the country, the biggest economy in Africa. They also said some international groups held back from speaking out about the crisis for fear it would damage their relations with Abuja.

“To be fair to the international community, I think that there was also from the government side a reluctance to perhaps fully acknowledge not only that it was a conflict but it was actually turning into a humanitarian crisis. And unfortunately that’s not uncommon,” Lundberg told Reuters in November.

In 2016, MSF said it had been raising the alarm with U.N. agencies for two years but they had failed to respond.

A spokesman for WFP said it could only operate in a country at the request of the government and in Nigeria that didn’t happen until March 2016.

He said WFP’s response was one of its “most significant and swift expansions ever”, adding that it planned to deliver aid to 1.5 million people a month by June, from 1 million now.

‘TOXIC NARRATIVE’

Despite a massive increase in budgets and humanitarian staff working in the region over the past two years, the response was still wracked with problems holding back aid as recently as June, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters.

It described a “toxic narrative” between the Nigerian government and the humanitarian community, an “us and them” divide between the United Nations and other NGOs and a relief effort that failed to adhere to international humanitarian law.

The report also warned that the Nigerian government had failed to grasp the reality of the situation on the ground.

“Arguably the most critical factor in scaling up in a manner commensurate to the massive needs, is to orient the attention of the government of Nigeria to commit more of their own resources to humanitarian and recovery efforts in the northeast,” it said.

A U.N. spokeswoman said the assessment was “quite dated” and a task force including representatives from the United Nations, international NGOs and donor countries was expected to issue an internal report on progress this month.

Even at the start of 2018, issues described in the report still threatened to undermine the response.

In a Jan. 2 letter to the government seen by Reuters, Edward Kallon, the U.N.’s top humanitarian official in Nigeria, said tensions with the government were delaying a fund-raising appeal.

While the disagreements were resolved in time for the February launch of the 2018 humanitarian response plan, letters sent by both sides highlight a fraught relationship.

“Time is not on our side,” Kallon wrote to Ahmed.

In a Jan. 5 reply, also seen by Reuters, Ahmed said Kallon had been “extremely disrespectful ... we are concerned that this situation is becoming untenable and therefore unacceptable to us.”

The U.N. and Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment on the letters.",Killing of aid workers in Nigeria a setback for troubled crisis response,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/killing-of-aid-workers-in-nigeria-a-setback-for-troubled-crisis-response-idUSKBN1GY0LN
1,nigeria,"Widespread violence has plagued Nigeria over the years, with an epicenter of activity in northeast parts of the country. Much of this violence is related to the Boko Haram insurgency, although other battles between ethnic groups have also intensified, largely over land and partly due to a growing drought. Despite some success by Nigerian security forces in tamping down violence, lives continue to be lost and communities displaced. All of this is ongoing as the country prepares to hold elections next year.

On March 26, the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a discussion on the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. Panelists included Alexandra Lamarche and Mark Yarnell of Refugees International, authors of the recent report “Political Pressure to Return: Putting Northeast Nigeria’s Displaced Citizens at Risk.” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at Brookings, briefed the findings from her January fieldwork in northeastern Nigeria on the state of counterinsurgency, security, and reconstruction efforts.

2,nigeria,"Royal Dutch Shell Plc has said it paid $4.32 billion to the Nigerian Government in 2017, representing an increase of 19 per cent from the $3.64 billion the oil giant paid in 2016.

The Shell's Sustainability Report 2017, which was released yesterday, showed that the $4.32 billion paid to Nigeria was the highest paid by the oil giant to any government in the 29 countries covered by the report.

By the report, government includes any national, regional or local authorities of a country, and includes a department, agency or entity that is a subsidiary of a government, which includes a national oil company.

Shell said it prepared the report in accordance with The Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 as enacted in the UK in December 2014 and as amended in December 2015.

The oil giant said the report includes payments to governments made by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiary undertakings.

The company however, added that payments made by entities over which Shell has joint control are excluded from this report.

According to the company, payments made to governments arising from activities involving the exploration, prospection, discovery, development and extraction of minerals, oil and natural gas deposits or other materials (extractive activities) are disclosed in this report.

The report, however, excludes payments related to refining, natural gas liquefaction or gas-to -liquids activities.

The multinational oil firm said in its yearly sustainability report that out of the $4.32 billion paid in 2017, $3.197 billion was paid to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for production entitlement.

The payments include production entitlements, which are the host government's share of production in the reporting period derived from projects operated by Shell.

Production entitlements also include the government's share as a sovereign entity or through its participation as an equity or interest holder in projects within its sovereign jurisdiction (home country).

The payments also include taxes paid by Shell on its income, profits or production, which include resource severance tax, and petroleum resource rent tax, including those settled by a government on behalf of Shell under a tax-paid concession.

The report also showed that crude oil theft from pipelines of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) increased by 50 per cent, to roughly 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 from 6,000 bpd in 2016.

While sabotage-related oil spill incidents rose to 62, from 48 in 2016, the report however indicates that the volume of crude oil spilled fell to 1,400 tones, from 3,900 tones in 2016

Also, Shell's operational spills in Nigeria rose by one to nine in 2017, but the volume of oil spilled fell to 100 tones from 300 tones in 2016, according to the report.

The report further revealed that theft and sabotage account for 90 per cent of the oil spills in the Niger Delta.

However, the report added that the shutdown of the Forcados export terminal for much of 2016 ""reduced opportunities for third-party interference""

The report further added that SPDC also ""made $10 million available"" in 2017 to help set up the Hydrocarbon Pollution and Remediation Project (HYPREP), a government-led body to clean up contaminated sites

Shell said it had also developed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) a new framework for remediation of soil and groundwater that it will begin testing in 2018","Nigeria: Shell Paid U.S.$4.32 Billion to Govt in 2017, Says Oil Giant",https://allafrica.com/stories/201804100086.html
3,nigeria,"The crisis rocking the Ohanaeze Ndigbo took a turn for the worst on Sunday as the Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, and the Women Wing of the group have announced the suspension of the President-General, Chief John Nnia Nwodo.

This came seven days after the groups passed a vote of no confidence on the Nwodo-led Ohanaeze.

Nwodo’s loyalists had fired back immediately, calling the bluff of the youth and the women groups, whose tenures they said had ended a year ago.

But in a statement jointly signed by leaders of the two wings, after their meeting, and emailed to DAILY POST, they said Nwodo had now been suspended for refusing to appear before a disciplinary committee set up to investigate allegations against his leadership.

It was signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, President, Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, Secretary General, Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Engr Obinna Adibe, National PRO, Ohanaeze Youth wing and Chief Hon. (Mrs) Calista N. Adimachukwu, President General, Ohanaeze Igbo Women Organisation.

The statement read: “With the 7-Day ultimatum given to the embattled President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Dr. Nnia Nwodo, having expired, and having had him instead of clearing his sullen hands from the weighty allegations of highhandedness and turning Ohanaeze Ndigbo into a political appendage party for those that could pay and pick his greedy bills – the main issue why he was asked to clear his names, to start ordering for termination of leadership and calling for elections into the Youth and women wings for querying him for his gross antisocial behaviours;

“We, the well meaning and rightly focused Ohanaeze Youth Wing, OYW, under the President General, Mazi Okechukwu Isisguzoro, having earlier-on reaffirmed our confidence in our present Executives, hereby, in a joint meeting with Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women Wing, therefore, we will no longer have Dr. Nnia Nwodo to continue doing his businesses with Igbo identity and political interests, and hereby arrive at the following decisions, as advised by the 7-man Investigation committee that Nnia Nwodo failed to appear before, to clear his names:

“That, we the Ohanaeze Youth Wing, OYW and Ohanaeze Women Wing had for so long tolerated the shameful and debased politics of Chief Nnia Nwodo led Ohanaeze Ndigbo, while he sidelines the various organs of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, including Ime Obi and his 24 – man led EXCOS that are there to represent their various localities and States and having relegated them to the backgrounds to getting little or no attention from their respective state, socio-cultural and political constituencies; and charters of offices and demands.

“We hereby find Nwodo loathsome and guilty of anti-Igbo politicking and badly moneyed-Igbo polity killer-character that in the first circumstance had no role for political and social services not just Ndigbo’s. Having failed to appear before the 7-man panel to clear himself of all the weighty gross breaches of office and constitution of Ohanaaeze Ndigbo, we take the Investigative Panel’s submission that by so doing he seems to have nothing to deny the wrongs as catalogued against him by Ohanaeze Youth Wing; Chief Nnia Nwodo is hereby suspended and should not be seen around Ohanaeze Ndigbo secretariat nor operate by proxy! He remains suspended!

“Holding vital evidences on how he has been collecting and hunting for monies at the expense of the Igbo nation, Biafra and Nigeria plights, from one government house to another and as well with Nwodo been at the becks and calls of the money-bags/politicians doing errand boy Ohanaeze Presidency. Nwodo remains suspended!

“That Nnia Nwodo occupies the vintage Ohanaeze Ndigbo presidency and still talking from both sides of his mouth to soiling the preeminent Ohanaeze concept, not just Ohanaeze Ndigbo, leading to our earlier calls for him to give accounts of his stewardship but he, instead of taking the ample opportunity to clear his mess, took to media charades announcing that Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings, were long suspended and there would be elections for the new leadership to pilot their affairs. Nwodo, remains suspended!

“Assuming without conceding that there are no functional Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings while we have Nwodo’s almighty Ohanaeze Ndigbo as made known to the media by the non-functional, but now politically romanced and activated, Secretary General Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Uche Okwukwu, whose names have been missing in Ohanaeze records of Secretary general duties courtesy of Nwodo, to now alleging that Ohanaeze Youth Wing and Women wing have respectively ceased to exist nor have leadership since 2016 and 2017, is a bad tale in their mouth. Nwodo remains suspended!

“That Nwodo’s Ohanaeze Ndigbo are now calling for elections in both Ohanaeze Youth and Women wings, with promises of selling forms to gullible aspirants is another political mischief showing gross case of maladministration and intolerance of opposing views with the sole intent to dismember the youth and women wings, more. While this remains condemnable, we shall resist this Nwodo’s sham with the last drops of our bloods till Ohanaeze Ndigbo is rescued and reorganized with a National Acting Steering Committee in-charge and we call upon the Igbo leaders of thoughts, especially the mature minds and notable Ime Obi, Ohanaeze leaders namely Prof Ben Nwabueze, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, Dr. Dozie Ikedife, Prof Amuche Azi, Dr. Kate Onwe, Chief Ralph Obiaoha, Chief Obi Nwaka, Engr. Isaac Wowu, Richard Ozobu, Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu to come to Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s rescue.

“That Nnia Nwodo speaks from both sides of his mouth while at the same time claiming to represent the pan social ideals of Ohanaeze, leading to Ohanaeze Ndigbo organizational frameworks, is verily worrisome and too poor expected of any person that occupies such vintage post of Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership. That Nwodo speaks differently in different foras on Igbo politics, Biafra restoration and inequalities in Nigerian nationality to now conscripted himself “minister of restructuring” without consulting his Igbo people because a Northeast presidential aspirant now picks his bills and any Igbo not thinking in the same direction with him is in his Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s Black book. This has been the plight of the Ohanaeze youth and women wings. For this, Nwodo remains suspended and ceases to represent Ohanaeze Ndgbo and Igbo nation in any capacity!

“Having had him instead of responding to the weighty allegations of shortchanging Igbo nation and running Ohanaeze Ndigbo as a generalissimo to even messing up the Igbo nation saying that he has been comfortable without Ohanaeze youth and women wings to even attempting the impossible throwing the youths and women into a disarray, saying they do not exist nor have a leadership, we the youth and Women Wings in this joint meeting hereby disassociate ourselves from whatever Chief Nnia Nwodo is doing, be it his sham Ohanaeze presidency or call for change of leadership.

“He is no longer to us President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and we bid every other Igbo national to so consider him same for he is no longer the president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and he stands suspended and by extension, his political brigade-boys, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Executives till peace and mutual respects for institutional order, measures and respects is returned to Ohanaeze Ndigbo.”

About the Capacity Building Program Contents The program started in January 2018, with a participatory assessment of the information management and capacity building gaps and priorities amongst the humanitarian partners. iMMAP engages with humanitarian sectors and state level government authorities to identify the participants, and with the Information Management Unit of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Maiduguri, to deliver and facilitate capacity building activities.","Humanitarian Information Management Training and Capacity Building - Round 1, 26-30 March 2018 Maiduguri, Nigeria",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/humanitarian-information-management-training-and-capacity-building-round-1-26-30
5,nigeria,"Justice Abba-Bello Muhammad of the FCT High Court, Jabi, on Tuesday dismissed the suit filed by the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Ibrahim Idris, alleging violation of his fundamental human rights by the Senate.

The judge said that the suit lacked merit as Section 88 and 89 of the Nigeria’s Constitution empowered the lawmakers to carry out investigations on issues of public interest.

Joined in the suit are the Senate President, Sen. Isah Misau and members of the ad-hoc committee that heard complaints of financial misappropriation leveled against the Police.

The judge said that the I-G failed to establish the element that constituted infringement on his fundamental human rights as he alleged against the Senate.

“His right has not been infringed to require the court’s intervention, inviting the applicant is a mere invitation to shed more light on the allegations leveled against him.

“More so, the Police Act also empowers the Police to carry out investigation about itself which the Police was already doing as at the time the allegations were raised,” the judge said.

The I-G had approached the court seeking a declaration that the investigative activities of the Senate Ad-Hoc Committee breached his rights as the Head of the Police Force.

He also sought for a declaration that his invitation to appear before the ad-hoc committee based on Sen. Misau’s petition was also a violation of his rights.

6,nigeria,"As the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), decides today on the tenure elongation it earlier proposed for the National Working Committee (NWC)-led by the National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun on February 27, the question is what are the concern of those in support of the extension, if it is eventually reversed?

Although, President Muhammadu Buhari, who was present at the meeting where the tenure extension was decided, made a u-turn on March 27, members remain divided on the subject.

The President cited legal implications as his reason for changing his mind, agreeing with others who think the decision did only contradict the APC Constitution, but also the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He reasoned that the outcome of the decision might destroy the party, if allowed to stay.

The argument that the party does not have sufficient time to manage congresses between now and next general election was dismissed on the basis that it is not the business of law if any political party fails to manage its time appropriately. “The law would not take that as an excuse.”

He, therefore, urged the NEC to reconsider the decision, which already has started generating controversies among the party leaders.

Some stakeholders, including governors, had bought into Buhari’s suggestion, which led to the setting up of a technical committee, headed by the Governor of Plateau State, Simenon Lalong.

The committee was mandated to offer advise on the decision. On Friday, the committed submitted the report, which is scheduled for presentation today.

From feelers, it appears the group has suggested that the congresses should be organized instead of extending the tenure of the present executives.

Notwithstanding, some members remain convinced that tenure extension is a wiser decision.

This group holds the views that the party may not be able to handle the fallout of crises that will follow the congress, and that the time may be too short to manage it.

Apart from timing, The Guardian also gathered that the ‘apostles of tenure extension’ were also concerned about their political future in the party, particularly those governors nursing re-election ambition in 2019 and the outgoing ones, who have chosen their successors in office. Some of these governors are also nursing ambition of running for the senate.

These ‘apostles tenure of extension’ might wear two colors today during the NEC meeting, The Guardian learnt.

One, they may not want to be seen as opposing President Buhari’s position on the matter due to the respect they have for him, though they are jittery over the outcome of election should the party holds the congress.

Part of the fears is that loyalist of Tinubu, whom they consider dangerous to their personal ambition, may emerge as executives that would midwife the party’s primaries for the coming elections.

The group is not persuaded by the explanation that the extension of tenure for Odigie-Oyegun and other NWC members has nothing to do with the subtle war between the incumbent national chairman and Tinubu.

A party insider told The Guardian that if Tinubu by error of omission or commission allow the tenure extension to scale through, “he is bound to experience worse things in the party than what he faced in the last three years under the leadership of Odigie-Oyegun.”

According to the source, “If you follow the arguments, you will understand where those that were against the tenure extension belong and the other faction, who have chosen to maintain silence since Buhari voiced out belong.”

The source also said that Mr. Buhari must have realized his mistake of nonchalant attitude to take control of the party machinery from day one and his error of not showing interest in who controls the leadership of the National Assembly. The consequences of his action are the series of face-off between the presidency and the legislative arms since the beginning of this administration.

If the party eventually opted for congresses, fresh executive members emerge and this would subsequently allow the true ownership of the APC take control of the party and the machinery of government. With this development, some of the governors seeking reelection, members of the State Executive Council, lawmakers and others may not make it beyond next year in government if fresh executive comes up after the congress.

The source said the intention of President Buhari’s wife; Aisha should be scrutinized when she said that those who helped her husband to become president have been sidelined.

Tinubu’s wife, Senator Oluremi also made similar outburst recently when she said her husband was “trashed” after the party won the 2015 election.

The deciding factor would definitely be the congress as it is near certain the NEC would reverse itself on extension of tenure today.

However would the newfound romance between Buhari and Tinubu and their loyalists be able to distabilise the machinery of the rival faction at the congress to bring in new executives with godfathers? Or will the NEC come out today with a different alternative? Clues to the answer may emerge today.

7,nigeria,"OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

In February 2018, humanitarian partners and the Government of Nigeria officially launched the Humanitarian Response Plan, based on priorities and vulnerabilities identified in the Humanitarian Needs Overview. A total of 60 organisations have committed to implementing 173 projects aimed at providing in life-saving assistance to 6.1 million women, children and men in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. The total funding requirements for 2018 stand at US$1.05 billion. This year the response will also focus on durable solutions, early recovery, livelihoods and basic services rehabilitation, across all sectors, to support a multi-year vision that goes beyond saving lives today.

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.7 million persons remain internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and 3.7 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). The Food Security and Nutrition needs are expected to be revised in March with the publication of the new Cadre Harmonisé analysis.

Large-scale population movements, triggered largely by insecurity, continue with 12,500 new arrivals in February alone, especially in Gwoza, Mobbar, Bama, Nganzai, Kukawa, Magumeri among others. Additional IDP influxes were also recorded from neighbouring countries, including Cameroon and Niger, into IDP camps and return areas in Ngala and Mobbar. Since late October 2017, over 60,000 vulnerable persons have been on the move for various reasons including insecurity, improved security in certain areas and poor living conditions. While assessments are still ongoing in these hotspot areas, rapid assessments and gap analyses have been developed and initial findings show that thousands, including host communities, are in dire need of food, water, shelter, blankets and clothes, and medical care. A multi-sectoral response has been possible through the rapid response mechanism and humanitarian organisations have scaled up their advocacy and resource mobilisation activities in order to meet the needs of the affected people. Additional displacements are expected for as long as hostilities will continue as newly arrived persons report that many more families remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian workers.

A suspected cholera epidemic broke out in Kukawa LGA, Borno State, in the towns of Baga and Doro. Since 13 February, close to 500 acute watery diarrhoea cases, suspected to actually be cholera cases, have been reported by the Borno State Ministry of Health.

A timely and coordinated response has been put in place and the outbreak should be under control in the coming weeks.

Humanitarian access continues to present major challenges, especially in Borno State. It is estimated that some 926,000 persons remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian organisations. Through civil-military coordination and community engagement, aid workers are working to expand the humanitarian space in north-east Nigeria. In addition, to improve local coordination and last-mile assistance, and increase the presence of humanitarians where vulnerable populations are living, to date, five ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza) offering secure accommodation and Internet connectivity have been made operational. Another three (Monguno, Damasak and Banki) are expected to be fully operational in the coming weeks and another one, in Rann, is also planned, bringing the total to nine.

Although funds received in 2018 are extremely low for most sectors as of 28 February 2018, with only 2.4 per cent ($25.6 million) of the requirements met, most partners are able to continue to provide life-saving assistance thanks to about $196 million carryover funding from 2017. However, for the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be received across all the sectors.","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-february-2018

A Nigerian lawmaker, Foster Ogola, has taken his spot on the infamous list of prominent Nigerians with certificate scandals attached to their names.

A few weeks ago, a confidential report was made using the Leaks.NG platform hinting that the senator, currently representing Bayelsa West senatorial district, has fake credentials from an unaccredited university in Nigeria.

“Sen. Foster Ogola has a fake PhD. His official profile on the NASS Website says he has a PhD from GMF Christian University. There is no official site for the university and it is not accredited by the NUC. There is also no research paper or thesis to his name online. Although he got the degree in 2012,” the report alerted.

On his official National Assembly profile, the senator is credited with having a PhD in Christian Leadership from the GMF Christian University Lagos, the same course he reportedly has an MSc. in from the Imo State University, Owerri.

Upon enquiry by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), it was revealed that the federal government has not licenced the GMF Christian University, Lagos, where Mr Ogola claims to have earned his PhD from in 2012.

NUC reacts

The Director of Corporate Communications of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Ibrahim Yakasai, was contacted on the validity of the institution.

“We have never heard of that name,” he said.

A copy of the commission’s weekly bulletin provided by Mr Yakasai showed a list of 57 illegal universities operating in the country; GMF Christian University was not among, buttressing the fact that the commission is even not aware of its existence.

The director also said that since 1999, the NUC has approved 74 private universities in the country and ‘’any certificate obtained from the GMF Christian University or any other degree mill will not be recognised by their authority.”

Other discoveries made by Leaks.NG coalition informed that the GMF Christian University still has no website offering information on the institution or its courses and there is no information on the Christian Leadership course the embattled senator purports to have a PhD in.

PREMIUM TIMES reached out to Mr Ogola, who is the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Information Communication Technology and Cybercrime, to speak on the allegations levelled against him including attending an illegal university and obtaining a fake certificate.

In response, he said: “Kindly clarify for me if Premium Times does exist, to entertain allegations from third parties, whose identities are not mentioned, especially, when they are criminal in nature.”

Rather than answer the questions raised, the lawmaker stated that the allegations could be a product of “mischief makers with a potential to foment distraction from weighty matters of state.”

On the unaccredited GMF Christian University, the senator was asked if there was an exemption from the NUC on the Christian Leadership course which Mr Ogola purportedly has a doctorate degree in.

“When did students or products of universities become accrediting bodies?,” the lawmaker said obviously not addressing the question.

In an attempt to verify GMF Christian University’s existence and understand how it operates in Nigeria, a member of the Leaks.NG coalition, TheCable, paid the academy a visit.

TheCable traced the Gospel Missionary Foundation (GMF) Theological University to 165 Isolo road, Cele bus stop, Egbe-Ikotun, Lagos.

It was revealed that the controversial university lies on the first floor of a two-storey building. Besides the one and only lecture room, which was empty at the time of visit, there are about three other rooms serving as offices.

Hope Obioha, the registrar and wife of the president of the university, Daniel Obioha, who claimed to be a professor, received the reporter who went there under the guise of a prospective student.

She took the reporter to her office where she introduced him to the university and the courses it offers.

According to the materials given, GMF Christian Theological University was established on May 4, 1988 and is registered by the Federal Government of Nigeria.

It says it seeks to fulfil its commitment to ‘‘individual special ministry calling, through graduate education, professional development and spiritual formation in all its activities including teaching, nurturing, worship, service, research, publication and missions.”

Mr Obioha and his wife established the university. When asked if the NUC has accredited the university, the registrar said that they do not operate like a secular university, hence, the university is not registered under NUC.

She presented the “accreditation certificate” of the university by some international bodies. Checks revealed that all the bodies that gave the debatable accreditation do not have an online presence.

However, one of the materials she released contains the graduating list from 2013 to 2016.

It is worthy to note that 2012 is the year Mr Ogola claims to have obtained his PhD in Christian Leadership.

Additionally, the Christian Leadership course was not reflected in the list of courses offered by the illegal university at doctorate level.

On a second visit to the GMF Christian University on March 13, the centre was empty again as the man who introduced himself as a lecturer said it was examination time.

He said while the full-time students attend lectures on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the part-time students go on Saturdays alone.

He was reluctant to release the list of those who graduated in 2012, but the reporter obtained a Skye bank account of the university in order to pay for the admission process for a “diploma in theology.”

At the end of both visits, TheCable was still unable to establish the veracity of the senator’s claim that he attended the school and has a PhD. in the Christian Leadership.

The Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) was unable to find any Christian Leadership course offered by any school in Nigeria.

However, a university in Boston, U.S. explained that the course teaches how to apply biblical and theological principles to leadership situations. Courses may cover topics such as, cultural diversity, Christian ethics and Church history. Students may need to complete an internship or field experience amongst other things.

In an attempt to verify the senator’s contribution to legislative activities, OrderPaper NG also reached out to his office in the National Assembly to enquire about bills he has sponsored or motions he has raised.

His legislative aides proved highly unhelpful, claiming they could not divulge any information without Mr Ogola’s approval.

A quick search through National Assembly archives shows that the senator has sponsored two bills. One of them was stood down.

Although credited with contributing to motions and debates on the floor, there is nothing exclusive Mr Ogola has spearheaded during his tenure.

Not the first time

Nigerian lawmakers have come under fire for a barrage of reasons lately. From their gargantuan salaries to unproductive and unsatisfactory representation, especially in the implementation of constituency projects, the National Assembly has had a tumultuous journey so far.

In addition to the above, lawmakers who reportedly own false academic certificates from questionable institutions are now being discovered. However, it is important to note that this did not start with the 8th Assembly. Since the inception of the recent democracy in Nigeria, lawmakers have been exposed for this wrongdoing.

In 1999, for example, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Salisu Buhari, was entangled in several lies that led him into the Hollowed Chambers. The disgraced lawmaker had falsified his age and academic endowments, claiming he had attended the University of Toronto, Canada. This was refuted by the academy, while the Ahmadu Bello University, Kaduna State, had expelled him for using fake credentials to gain admission.

The embattled lawmaker eventually came out to apologise to the country.

Also, a serving senator, Dino Melaye, included Harvard University and the London School of Economics and Political Science as some of the schools he attended. This turned out to be false, as both institutions denied his studentship.

Dino Melaye

On March 30, a member of the House of Representatives, Nse Ekpenyong, was arraigned at the Federal High Court, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, for the alleged forgery of a polytechnic diploma.

This report was put together by Leaks.NG, a coalition of news and civil society organisations, which provides a platform for Nigerians to submit evidence of wrongdoing by public office holders in Nigeria.

Egalement disponible en Français

YAOUNDE, Cameroon, April 10, 2018/APO Group/ –On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

Quotes

“Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. Canada is proud to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. This support will save lives and help to alleviate the suffering of people living in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

– Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs

Quick facts

In 2018, 3.3 million people will need life-saving assistance in Cameroon to meet their basic needs. This represents an increase of approximately 14% since 2017.

The funding announced today is in addition to the nearly $20 million in humanitarian assistance already announced in 2018. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s total contribution this year for Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria to over $47 million.

In February 2018, Minister Bibeau visited Maiduguri and Bama, in northeast Nigeria, where she met with members of communities affected by the Lake Chad Basin crisis, including survivors of gender-based violence, children and new mothers, as well as representatives of key humanitarian organizations.

12,nigeria,"(Maiduguri, 2 April 2018): The UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Yassine Gaba, currently Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim, strongly condemns the deadly combined attack which took place near Belle Village, in the outskirts of Borno State’s capital, Maiduguri, on Sunday 1 April. According to local sources, at least 34 civilians lost their lives in this attack and some 90 others were injured.

The recent weeks have seen a steady continuation of attacks on civilians in the three most conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, in the north-east of Nigeria. Since the beginning of the year, reportedly, at least 120 civilian women, children and men were killed and over 210 sustained serious injuries, in over 22 attacks allegedly by non-state armed groups directly targeting civilians. Civilians are also regularly abducted, as in Dapchi, Yobe State, where 110 school girls were taken on 19 February.

“Innocent civilians continue to suffer daily from direct and indiscriminate attacks in the north-east of Nigeria,” said Mr. Gaba. “Endless numbers of explosions, brutal killings, abductions and lootings continue to uproot the lives of women, children and men daily. I call on all parties to the conflict to end this violence and to respect human life and dignity.”

The protection of civilians is a major focus of the ongoing humanitarian response in the north-east of Nigeria, where 7.7 million people remain in dire need of humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, water and health care, in the most conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe.

Women, children and men face daily grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of girls, women, boys and men have been abducted and children continue to be used routinely as so-called “suicide” bombers.

13,nigeria,"…lauds Army’s neutrality

The Coalition on Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Nigeria has released a complete review of incidents of farmers/herders crisis in Nigeria, lauding the neutral conduct of the Nigerian Army as patriotic and professional.

It however cautioned that situations where political office holders fail to take appropriate actions to maintain peace in their domain only to start inviting the military and at the same throwing tantrums at such institution is not only callous, wicked and senseless but should be stopped with immediate effect to enable genuine stakeholders work together for the peace and unity of the country.

The Coalition at a joint parley between online newspapers and social media influencers held in Abuja on Monday, said it had tracked violence related to herdsmen/farmers clashes across Nigeria and is of the opinion that the crisis was left to escalate because Governors ot Benue and Taraba States have decided to play politics with human lives using armed militias and warlords to escalate the crisis unabated.

The gathering also noted some politicians found wanting in their obligations to their citizens have seen the situation as a cash cow to further exploit the people rather than take steps to mitigate the crisis in order to derive both political and financial benefits.

According to the human rights group, this much was derived after a careful analysis of the situation using surveys, questionnaires and interviews with critical stakeholders, as well as victims.

Barrister Maxwell Gowon, leader of the coalition in the report said it was observed that the dynamics of this crisis are poorly understood by a wider spectrum of stakeholders, which has impacted support for initiatives aimed at solving the problem.

His words, “The Coalition therefore embarked on a review of the clashes with a view to making interventions that will spur rapid resolution of the crisis so that life can again return to normal for the millions of people that have been negatively affected.

“In the course of this review, the Coalition’s researchers visited some selected affected communities in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, Kogi and Nasarawa states. These states were selected using heat maps developed from interactively plotting reported incidents against locations on the map. The selected states, with the exception of Nasarawa, were chosen because they recorded the highest number and most intense level of violence in the 18 months that were assessed.

“Researchers also polled officers of the military and security agencies that have been deployed in the crisis areas. Questionnaires were distributed; interviews were conducted, as well as surveys.

From its findings, the group said the outcome of the review revealed that since its deployment to address the crisis, the military has made commendable efforts at restoring order as it has arrested and neutralized some of the criminal elements unleashing mayhem on affected communities.

The report says, “This is being carried out without any sentiment by the Nigerian military and in a few instances the government forces were not spared by criminal elements. For example, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Tukur Buratai at an address on the deployment of troops to crisis areas said “We have deployed officers across Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states where to ensure peace and stability for the development and betterment of our country.”

On the allegation that troops were conniving with criminal elements and the presidency has refused to act was investigated, the coalition said its finding revealed that only criminal elements and their agents in power who nurse the ambition of using the military for personal duties and were rebuffed nurse such conspiracy theories in their reasoning.

“This is not only worrisome but must be discarded to avoid returning to the military to its old nature where some highly placed citizens could press the trigger from the comfort of their homes.

“The deployment of the military to these troubled zones has helped to restore normalcy to most of the affected communities even though the question of armed militias is yet to be addressed with the needed political will and courage from actors within this locality.

Our investigations also noted that most of these militias had been armed by some highly placed individuals and efforts by the Nigerian Army to mop up these arms from them have not received the needed cooperation.

“The crisis between herdsmen and Farmers in some instances is instigated by persons without stakes on either side of the divide between herders and farmers. Unrelated hostilities between warring communities are also passed off as attacks by armed herdsmen. There was an instance in Benue State at Omusu where a clear case of conflict between Omusus and Okana communities in Okpokwu Local Government Area was reported as “armed herdsmen attack” even when it has nothing to do with an existing conflict between Omusu community and herdsmen.

“There are active attempts to mislead Nigerians, the Federal Government and the international community into believing that “killer” herdsmen are out to wipe out other ethnic groups when in some cases ethnic warlords are instigating militias to carry out attacks on their perceived enemies and make same look like the work of armed herdsmen. These actors in their desperate outings have gone further to link the Nigerian military with such heinous actions. However, our investigations have confirmed otherwise and it’s imperative for Nigerians and the world to take note. “

The group further commended the Army for extending the exercise in some states however added that such extension should be granted in more states until ethnic warlords and criminal elements decide to embrace peaceful approaches towards resolving the crisis.

The Coalition also warned that some actors have taken undue advantage of the situation to further their ethnic interest above the national interest which citizens should pursue, urging such persons to retrace their steps if not be ready to face the appropriate international instruments.",Human rights coalition releases report on herdsmen/farmers crises in Nigeria,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/human-rights-coalition-releases-report-on-herdsmen-farmers-crises-in-nigeria/
14,nigeria,"Executive Director, National Film and Video Censors Board, Mr. Adedayo Thomas, says the next edition of Big Brother Nigeria reality show should be hosted in the country.

Thomas, in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja, said this while expressing displeasure on why a Nigerian show was being held in South Africa.

NAN reports that the BBNaija, which was introduced in 2006, is a special Nigerian version of the continental show Big Brother Africa.

The 2018 edition is its second consecutive running year, as it had previously suffered a 10-year hiatus after holding its first edition in 2006.

Thomas said: “If it is Big Brother Africa, they can host that anywhere; but the one for Nigeria should be hosted in Nigeria.

“Nigeria has what it takes to host the show; after all, there are many multinational/telecommunication companies hitherto operating hitch-free in the country.

“If the organisers are talking about lack of available infrastructure as an excuse, then how is MTN operating successfully 24/7 in this same country?

“If MTN, a similar South African company, has been surviving in this country, then I don’t think anybody has an excuse for not hosting BBNaija in Nigeria.

“They are making a lot of money from Nigerians here, so, we want them to host it here.”

On the criticism in some quarters that the show is not healthy for young viewers, Thomas said it was the responsibility of parents to check what their children watch.

He said the programme was rated 18+, adding, “a couple of the scenes are adult content and that is where parental guidance comes in.

“Parents can always block the watching of some scenes within a particular period or in totality.

“It is not government’s responsibility to assume the parental roles of moral upbringing of children in their homes,’’ he said.

17,nigeria,"“Health is a human right. No one should get sick and die just because they are poor, or because they cannot access the health services they need”

–Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

Health is wealth, so says the golden adage. A healthy nation is said to be a wealthy nation. The World Health Day is celebrated every year on April 7, under the sponsorship of the World Health Organisation. Last Saturday marked the 70th anniversary of the World Health Day. The theme of this year’s World Health Day is “Universal health coverage: Everyone, everywhere”, and the slogan for the 2018 campaign is “Health for All”. Incidentally, every December 12 is celebrated as the Universal Health Coverage Day under the auspices of the WHO.

According to the WHO, data shows that despite some progress, too many people are still missing out on health coverage. According to the international organisation, “At least, half of the world’s people are currently unable to obtain essential health services. Almost 100 million people are being pushed into extreme poverty, forced to survive on just $1.90 or less a day, because they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets; over 800 million people (almost 12 per cent of the world’s population) spend at least 10 per cent of their household budgets on health expenses for themselves, a sick child or other family member. They incur the so-called ‘catastrophic expenditures.’ Incurring catastrophic expenditures for health care is a global problem.”

Universal Health Coverage refers to a system that provides healthcare and financial protection to all citizens of a particular country. It is organised around providing a specified package of benefits to all members of a society with the end goal of providing financial risk protection, improved access to health services, and improved health outcomes.

In Nigeria, like other countries of the world, health insurance is the fastest way to achieve Universal Health Coverage. Unfortunately, the National Health Insurance Scheme established in 2005 has achieved only about three per cent coverage. According to a ThisDay report of December 21, 2017, Ghana which started its health insurance scheme the same year with Nigeria in 2005 has grown its scheme to more than 50 per cent. Statistics have shown that the level of out-of-pocket expenditure as a share of total health expenditure in Nigeria is still placed at 72 per cent, the highest on the continent and one of the highest in the world. Even poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa like Kenya (26 per cent), Gabon (22 per cent), among others are doing better. Research also shows that countries afflicted with conflict and post-conflict like South Sudan (54 per cent) and Sierra Leone (61 per cent) are still better than Nigeria.

In order to speed up the attainment of Universal Health Coverage, the Nigerian National Council on Health a few years ago gave approval for states to create their own health insurance schemes through legislation. Many states have taken advantage of this opportunity. States that have set up health insurance schemes include Lagos, Oyo, Ekiti, Delta, Bayelsa, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Kwara, Abia, Adamawa, Kano, Anambra, Sokoto, and Enugu. How much successes have these 14 states achieved in terms of health coverage in their states? Can this health coverage be extended to local government employees as well as made mandatory for the organised private sector workers? To further smoothen the pace for a universal coverage for Nigerians and increase the percentage of Nigerians in the scheme, stakeholders, including the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, are pushing for policy change to make the scheme mandatory for Nigerians, just as it applies in most countries where it has worked.

In the words of Tejuoso, “We are proposing that if every Nigerian, whether an ‘okada’ rider, barber, tomato seller, or recharge card seller, contributes N200 monthly towards their health insurance, the pool will significantly change healthcare for good in his country. For instance, assuming 100 million Nigerians pay N200 monthly, that will amount to N20 billion, and with this, poor Nigerians needing healthcare access will get it without them paying money from their pocket for it. Once you are a contributor to this pool, you will have access to any of our health facilities. This will significantly settle some basic healthcare issues in the country”.

Well said! However, it will be good to quicken the passage of the amendment to the Act setting up the National Health Insurance Scheme to make it mandatory for all Nigerians to contribute a token to enrol on the health insurance scheme. Desirable as it is, it may not work perfectly as many poor citizens may be unable to pay the premium. Government should therefore make health services free for certain categories of vulnerable Nigerians such as senior citizens who are 60 years and above, pregnant women and poor people who are suffering from terminal sicknesses and ailments.

Some experts have also called on government to subsidise community-based health insurance. My worry with the issue of subsidy is its propensity to being abused. Experience from subsidy regime in the oil and agricultural sector where government decided to subsidise petroleum products such as petrol and kerosene and fertiliser does not inspire confidence.

The entire health insurance scheme needs to be overhauled for better service delivery. Many enrolees currently under the scheme are complaining of inefficient and ineffective services by the Health Maintenance Organisations. There is also the bigger issue of funding of health sector. Some years ago, all African countries met, and agreed in Abuja to give at least 15 per cent of their entire national budget to health. Unfortunately, Nigeria’s health budget is hovering between five and nine per cent annually.

About two weeks ago, American billionaire, Bill Gates, was in Nigeria and called for greater investment in education, health and human capital development. In a recent exclusive interview on the Cable News Network, Gates was quoted as saying, “The current quality and quantity of investment in this young generation in health and education just isn’t good enough.”

The philanthropist had at a special session of the National Economic Council on Thursday, March 22, 2018 said Nigeria would do better with strong investments in health and education, rather than concentrate on physical infrastructure to the detriment of human capital development. He noted that “Nigeria is one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth, with the fourth worst maternal mortality rate in the world ahead of only Sierra Leone, Central African Republic and Chad. One in three Nigerian children is chronically malnourished.” If we intend to change the heartrending narrative and ensure the Universal Health Coverage, government at all levels in Nigeria needs to earmark more resources to the ailing health sector of the country. A stitch in time saves nine!”

MANAGEMENT of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPRe, Effurun, has said that the institution has the potentials to solve Nigeria’s fuel crisis, but noted that lack of funds was destroying the institution’s vision of being one of the best universities in the world.

The institution’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Akaehomen Ibhadode, who said this when he and his team paid a courtesy visit to Vanguard headquarters in Lagos, however, called on the Federal Government to turn its attention to the institution to help solve the infrastructure and other funding challenges limiting its advancement.

He said: “As a petroleum university, we have a stake in solving this problem (petrol crisis). We have been toying with the idea of mini refineries and you find out that even now, we have shortage of petroleum products. With our little resources, we have been able to come up with designs and at this point, we are looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to actualise the designs in physical form.”

He noted that the institution was trying to work with the marginal field operators, but because of financial challenges, the institution has not been able to come up with something workable. “We want to be challenged as a petroleum university to build mini refineries and we are ready for that, and if we are able to create mini refineries, we can replicate it all over the country and beyond, especially in Africa. It will create employment and change the economic face of the country.”

FUPRE, a specialised petroleum university, was established by the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 to train high level manpower for the oil and gas industry, with a take-off grant of N500 million. Since then, no other grant has been given to the institution.

He said other new universities receive N6 billion take-off grant. “Unfortunately, not enough resources are put in place to achieve that mandate. It’s the first petroleum university in Africa and the sixth in the world. We need to draw the attention of the government that set it up as the proprietor and the sector (education), that we are operating in a situation where we can be of value to the industry (petroleum) and also to the nation,” he added.

Ibhadode said that as giant of Africa and showing by Nigeria’s resources in terms of population and landmass, Nigeria has everything. “These are things that can make us really tick. Attention has to be drawn to the university. We can draw resources from the government that will be able to make us to achieve more. Unfortunately, that has not been so. It is after 10 years of establishing the university that we now have an act which was signed by the National Assembly and signed into law last year by the president.

“Every university is shouting we do not have money but we want to go beyond that. What we want to establish is that we have potentials that we can deploy to be able to leverage on them and attract more resources. We want to announce to the world that we have done quite a couple of things and as a specialised university, we can commercialise or partner with organisations to be able to bring solution to the oil industry and the allied industries such that we make life better for Nigerians.”

He said that the institution is looking for partnership and sponsorship from government or the private sector to be able to actualise the design of the refineries in the physical form, including production and drilling platforms. “FUPRE is a specialized university with some special funding for infrastructural development and research purposes.”",We have stake in solving Nigeria’s petroleum crisis — FUPRE VC,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/stake-solving-nigerias-petroleum-crisis-fupre-vc-3/
20,nigeria,"The Youth Wing of the apex-Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Tuesday hinted that a replacement for the embattled President-General of the group, Chief John Nnia Nwodo is on the way.

DAILY POST recalls that the Youth Wing and the Women wings of the Ohanaeze had on Sunday announced Nwodo’s suspension as the President-General. Nwodo had also said the two wings lacked the powers to suspend him.

But in another statement made available to DAILY POST, which was signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, President, Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, Secretary General, and Comrade Achuonye Obinna, Vice President, they said there was no going back on Nwodo’s suspension.

While hailing intervention of prominent Igbo leaders over the crisis rocking the Igbo group, they, however, said for the Ohanaeze to move forward, Nwodo should remain suspended, while an acting President-General should be appointed from Enugu State to complete his term.

The statement reads in part, “we, the leadership and members of the Ohanaeze Youth Wing, OYW, hereby wish to inform our teeming members, supporters and reading public that the war declared against our fold and freedom of thought and association by the self-estranged and suspended President, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo who wanted to force the Ohanaeze youth and women wings into his political lobby camp for the actualization of his Northeast anointed presidential candidate and for our vehement opposition to one person lording it over on Igbo nation just to make a living, has finally yielded fruits.

“Some respectable Igbo elders, leaders of thought, captains of industries and intelligentsias have not only intervened but agreed to convene and as well invited us to this weekend’s “SAVE OHANAEZE NDIGBO” meeting in Owerri, Imo State, with the intent to strategize and reposition Ohanaeze Ndigbo, for the return of Igbo cultural nationalism, pan social order and rule of sensible leadership cum mutual respects for the integral organs and compact leadership in Ohanaeze Ndigbo. We will attend, to brief them more on Nwodo’s charades in veil of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.

“We are also made to know that there would be likely change of guards in the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and election of a national Acting Steering Committee of Ohanaeze Ndigbo with a vibrant and good headed Enugu state citizen, to complete the tenure of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo presidency presently zoned to Enugu state.

“It may also be interesting to inform the Igbo nation and the reading public that we have been receiving extra-intimidating concerns through calls and direct body contacts lauding our bold moves and struggles to reset Ohanaeze Ndigbo guiding principles and philosophy and rescue it from Nnia Nwodo’s one man show for the popular good and growth of peaceable and sociable behaviour and integrative leadership.

“Therefore, we confidently tell the unsuspecting public and readers to discountenance faith in Nwodo self-effacing and diminishing politics since the leaders, movers and shakers of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Igbo nation have moved-in to salvage Ohanaeze Ndigbo from his greedy self-aggrandizement, power drunkenness and misinformation – thereby, speaking from both sides of his mouth to making disgusting misrepresentation of Igbo interests and Ohanaeze Ideology.”

They added that “to this breakthrough, having teeming supporters, home and diasporas decrying Nnia Nwodo’s Ohanaeze Ndigbo arbitrary leadership, we say, yes, Ohanaeze Ndigbo afresh in our minds.

“Meanwhile, we are waiting for Nnia Nwodo and his so-called cash and carry elections into the Youth and Women wings of Ohanaeze Ndigbo for resisting his authoritarian rule.

“We advise well meaning and good thinking Igbo youths and women to ignore Nwodo’s antics of a drowning man because whatever he does is without authority. We will not rest on our oars till freedom is spelt in Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s spheres of holding charge.”

21,nigeria,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari is to contest his party's nomination for next February's presidential election, leading to a rather downbeat reaction on the Nigerian stock exchange.

Stocks in Lagos dropped over 1 percent after his announcement Monday, Reuters reported, hitting a three-month low. Sentiment remained subdued Tuesday as stocks hovered around the flatline.

In fact, Nigeria's stocks have been on a downwards trajectory for over a month.

Buhari's leadership of late has been subject to speculation over his health, for which he sought treatment in London for several months last year. The president, 75, has not disclosed the reason for the treatment.

He is currently in the U.K. for talks with Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in London next week.

In 2015, Buhari was the first Nigerian opposition leader to win an election. Representing the center-left All Progressives Congress (APC), he beat then-incumbent Goodluck Jonathan. Buhari previously ruled Nigeria in the 1980s as head of a military regime.

But, Nigeria has struggled on both its economic and security fronts since Buhari's landmark election victory.

In late March, it emerged that Nigeria's national budget announcement, initially planned for January, had been pushed back to the end of May.

The country experienced its first full-year recession in 25 years in 2016, with its economy hit by low oil prices. Economic growth remains sluggish, expected by the International Monetary Fund to be 1.9 percent for 2018, well below the emerging market average of 4.9 percent.

But, there has been some economic positive news. Nigeria's state revenue for February edged up by 19 billion naira ($53 million), thanks to higher crude oil exports and prices.

Nigeria is one of the largest economies in Africa, and with over 180 million inhabitants is the continent's largest population. In its manifesto, the APC pledged to create 1 million new jobs per year.

Islamist militant group Boko Haram continues to threaten the security of civilians in the northeast of the country. Meanwhile, militant attacks also continue in the Niger delta region, the country's oil production hub.","Nigeria President Buhari to run for election next year, markets aren't so happy",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/nigeria-president-buhari-to-run-for-election-next-year-markets-arent-so-happy.html
22,nigeria,"Greece, in recent time, has reneged on the repayment of its national debt on many occasions. For instance, in 2017, Greece was embarrassed by her inability to meet debt obligations and was bailed out by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The debt crisis has even cost top Greece leaders their political careers. In most cases, the Greek government spent beyond its means – i.e. sustained deficit spending and corresponding nasty outcomes. Unfortunately, the Nigerian government is neck deep in debt recklessness and faces the Greece-like crisis in the near term if the current trend persists.

With the Nigerian debt, both the Federal Government and states, now exceeding $71bn and N14tn for external and domestic debt respectively, debt service costs alone gulping about 66 per cent of government’s revenue in 2017, lenders and taxpayers are questioning the country’s ability to sustain the payment of interest and principal on the debt. The Federal Ministry of Finance recently raised concern when it revealed that the Federal Government currently spends about N700bn on a monthly basis on wage and debt servicing. This figure is higher than the average monthly FAAC shared between states and the Federal Government over the last 12 months. This also builds on the recent red flag raised by the International Monetary Fund which reiterated that debt servicing costs were becoming stubborn and a heavy burden on Nigerians.

Adding to the potential crisis is the alarming growth rate of government debt over that last few years. For instance, Nigeria’s external debt grew by 41 per cent over the last three years from $10.7tn in 2015 to N15.1tn in 2017. Domestic debt seems to have grown even faster during the three-year period by 52 per cent. At the current growth rate, it is projected that Nigerian debt stock will keep rising by more than 20 per cent annually in the next decade. Unfortunately, the people do not see good measures to pay back the debt such as infrastructure build-up, institutional reforms or fiscal discipline among the authorities.

Taxpayers and investors are beginning to ask; Is Nigeria the next Greece? The quick, short and emotional answer is NO! But why not?

First, the Nigerian currency, naira, is not and will not be the global reserve currency. This means that foreign investors remain willing to lend to Nigeria despite the heavy debt load provided we are pumping crude oil and maintaining the current regime of high and attractive interest rate.

Second, Nigeria’s Debt-to-Gross Domestic Product remains low at 20 per cent which makes it easy to convince the National Assembly and other academic-minded experts that Nigeria is “good to go” for more debt. This is called “shallow thinking” because for a developing country like Nigeria, what matters is the debt service- to-revenue ratio, which currently too is high at 66 per cent.

Three, unlike other parts of the world where the government can raise taxes to cover government spending surge, tax administration and tax proceeds remain sticky in Nigeria making debt an easier and lazier source of money to state governments and the Federal Government.

Unlike Greece, Nigeria may be standing far from that point where debt crisis will begin to consume the political career of her leaders. However, the youths are increasingly becoming unsettled about rising debt stock and fiscal rascality of the government. Thus, it is our hope that authorities at both the Federal and state levels will find new and more creative ways other than borrowing to fund their budgets especially, the non-capital expenditures.

23,nigeria,"Highlights

• The Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2018 was launched on February 8th to serve as the annual plan for the humanitarian community’s programming in the 3 most crisis-affected States in North East Nigeria.

• More than 1,634,000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, according to IOM DTM Round XXI (February 2018). This represents a 4.6% increase to the December round. Eight out of ten IDPs are in Borno state.

• As of February 28th, WASH sector partners reported 794 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) in northern Borno state (Kukawa LGA). Laboratory tests carried out confirmed some of the cases as cholera.

• With 60%funding gap, health, WASH, and child protection remain the most critically underfunded sectors.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno1 . This represents an increase of 4.6% since December 2017, due to both improved access to Konduga LGA (Tungushe ward) and new arrivals from areas experiencing conflict. The Borno State capital Maiduguri, however, recorded a decrease in new arrivals, highlighting that returns to areas of origin continues where security permits.

In order to meet new humanitarian needs, the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) has released a reserve allocation of $8.9 million for interventions focused on the Monguno and Pulka axes. The increase in new arrivals continues to put pressure on the delivery of humanitarian services in the IDP settlements in terms of shelter, NFIs, health and nutrition, provision of food and access to water and sanitation. Water shortages in Pulka remain a cause for concern, and are predicted to worsen due to the recent and ongoing increase in the population. Humanitarian actors continue to advocate with the Nigerian security forces on the possibility of drilling outside of the security perimeter to relieve the pressure on the town.

Humanitarian actors are also preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Marte LGA and areas around Gudumbali, where Nigerian Security Forces have announced planned military operations. Responses to meet the needs of these populations (47,000 and 135,000, respectively, of which approximately half are estimated to displace if hostilities take place) are likely to require additional resources.

On February 19, an attack on a Girls Science Secondary School in Dapchi, Yobe State, resulted in the abduction of more than 100 girls. UNICEF provided psychosocial support to the children who escaped the abduction.

As of February 28, WASH sector partners reported a total 794 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) in Kukawa LGA.

Laboratory tests confirmed some of these to be cholera. Lack of access to safe drinking water has been identified as the key problem. An integrated cholera response is ongoing, with strong support from the UNICEF WASH, health, education and Communication for Development (C4D) sections, in collaboration with partners. Additionally, within the reporting period, a Hepatitis E outbreak was reported in Rann (Kala-Balge LGA) on February 1. By February 15, a total of 31 cases had been reported in the LGA.","Nigeria Humanitarian SitRep No. 2, 01-28 February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-sitrep-no-2-01-28-february-2018
