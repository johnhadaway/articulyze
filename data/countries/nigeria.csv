0,nigeria,"ABUJA (Reuters) - At least 45 people died in an attack on a village in northern Nigeria, a police official told Reuters on Sunday, the latest in a string of incidents underscoring insecurity in parts of the country.

President Muhammadu Buhari won Nigeria’s 2015 elections partly on promises to bring security to Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation, but has struggled to fulfill those pledges. He is now seeking a second term in February 2019.

His critics and opponents question his track record tackling the multitude of conflicts that plague Nigeria, from Boko Haram and a thriving Islamic State West Africa insurgency in the northeast, to clashes between farmers and herders in the hinterlands that have left hundreds dead.

It was not immediately clear why the Gwaska village in the northern state of Kaduna was attacked on Saturday.

“Yesterday we recovered 12 corpses and today we retrieved 33,” Austin Iwar, Kaduna’s commissioner of police, told Reuters by phone.

The village, in the Birnin-Gwari area of Kaduna, lies near an area known for banditry, where thick forests provide remote hideouts from law enforcement.

Those groups of bandits have for years frustrated authorities’ attempts to apprehend them, and in some cases have amassed thousands of stolen cattle and fought off security agent task forces sent to deal with them.","At least 45 dead in attack on Nigerian village, police say",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/at-least-45-dead-in-attack-on-nigerian-village-police-say-idUSKBN1I70U5
1,nigeria,"Voodoo, juju, magic and witchcraft are synonymous with the negative supernatural. Most Nigerians believe in the existence of God, the Almighty Creator. The converse is that we as a people also believe in the existence of Satan. To believe in God omnipotent and deny the existence of devils is incomplete belief.

When Dr. Reuben Abati, a celebrated Nigerian newspaper writer and former media adviser to the past government of President Goodluck Jonathan, wrote about his experience with demons in the Aso Rock presidential villa, many of us were not surprised.

The seat of government anywhere in the world is a major force-field for contention of powers both spiritual and temporal. The forces of good and evil will always collide to determine the outcome of government decisions and actions.

These spiritual powers will also try to influence the occupants of the exalted office for good or evil. Those in established faith bodies call these forces principalities and powers, this also include the rulers of darkness and spiritual host of wickedness. Far from the realm of superstition these powers come in diverse manifestations and seek to control people in powerful positions.

Different operations of demonic powers will be in the form of extreme wickedness being perpetrated by those in positions of power and influence, manipulation and control of the economy for personal gain, corruption, rigging of election outcomes etc.

Corruption is demonic in nature as it tries to appropriate to a few individuals that which rightly belongs to many, thereby depriving millions including women and children access to healthcare, maternal care, affordable housing and potable water.

Many of our country men and women die annually due to road transport accidents. Most times a few individuals embezzle funds meant for road infrastructure, when people die on these roads are the embezzlers not delving into witchcraft?

Witchcraft is simply manifested in oppression, intimidation and manipulation. This is exactly what leaders grapple with as they abuse positions of influence and power to manipulate or oppress the populace.

Until our leaders decide to do things differently and become more accountable to the people they represent, we will yet see stronger manifestation of these demonic powers in our seat of government.

Some years ago, a prominent government appointee to the NDDC board had a highly publicised rift with his ‘juju-man’ the top brass gave some millions of naira to this juju-man to burn as sacrifice and part of a ritual required for influence and control over people in government.

Dr. Abati proffered solutions to overcome this demon invasion of the nation’s seat of power. He included building a ‘new’ presidential villa. I strongly disagree with him, because the trouble is not in the structure but in the people who occupy the edifice. Where have they been to? What did they collect? Who did they deprive of life? Who do they believe in? These are pertinent questions.

In the recent past, a certain governor in Anambra State was taken to a particular shrine to swear allegiance to particular individuals. Same scenario played out in Ogun State where another group of individuals danced naked before shrines. These ones came to light for obvious reasons.

The presidential villa and by inference most state governor’s lodges across the country will only be exorcised of demons when the men in those fortified spaces decide to embrace the Almighty Supreme God.

The Master speaking says He does not occupy buildings built with men’s hands. He desires to reside in their hearts; taking charge of their passion and attitudes. A changed attitude will bring about our desired transformation.

Love for our fellow country men and women will be the proper motivation to seek public office not self-aggrandizement.

2,nigeria,"OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.6 million persons are internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security and nutrition situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and as the lean season (May through September) is about to kick off. The new Cadre Harmonisé analysis – which provides an updated understanding of the food security and nutrition situation – was issued, revealing that the number of people estimated to be facing critical and crisis food and nutrition insecurity levels (IPC 3 and 4) in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe stands at 2.3 million for March-May and up to 3 million projected for June-August.

In March, the operational environment deteriorated sharply with the killing of three aid workers in Rann, in Kala/Balge local government area (LGA) in Borno State, during an attack by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) against Nigerian armed forces.

Three female paramedical aid workers were also abducted during the attack and remain unaccounted for. This attack, which took place on 1 March, raised serious concerns regarding the preservation and expansion of the current humanitarian space and the dangers faced by aid workers as they attempt to access vulnerable persons in hard-to-reach areas. Following the attack, all relocatable humanitarian workers were evacuated out of Rann for close to three weeks and little to no assistance was delivered to people in need during that time. Although life-saving activities were able to resume in a progressive manner towards the end of the month, much time was lost in preparing for the rainy season (June through September) in a town that tends to become unreachable by road for months on end due to flooding. The construction of a humanitarian hub, a common storage site and a helipad were delayed pending a new security assessment of the chosen location. As time before the rains start is running out, it is crucial that work on these three projects resume as soon as possible.

Large-scale population movements, caused largely by insecurity, continued with 21,807 new arrivals in March alone. This represents a sharp increase of 75 per cent compared to February and poses major humanitarian challenges as resources are often already overstretched in the locations in which these civilians arrive. With hostilities ongoing, these trends are likely to continue at least until the rainy season starts in May/June. On 24 March, the Government of Nigeria opened the MaiduguriBama-Banki road, in Borno State, to civilian traffic, triggering thousands of population movements along this axis. In addition, the Government has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Maiduguri to Bama where rehabilitation of public and private infrastructure is underway. The UN and its partners are calling for close coordination with the federal and state authorities to ensure that any returns and relocations are carried out following internationally recognised standards of dignity, safety and voluntariness. The UN and partners are also calling for the return of civilian authorities to all return areas and the rebuilding of infrastructure and municipal services.

The north-east is also grappling with two new cholera outbreaks: one in Borno State (in Kukawa LGA), which broke out on 13 February and stands at 646 cases with three associated deaths; and one in Yobe State (in Bade, Karasuwa, Yusufari and Bursari LGAs) which started on 28 March, and stands at 44 cases with seven deaths (with a worrisome case fatality rate of 6.4 per cent). A timely and coordinated response by health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) partners has been put in place, including prevention measures, and the outbreaks are expected to be under control in the coming weeks. As the rainy season approaches, preparedness measures are being put in place to limit disease transmission.

Another challenge in March were the heavy winds which have caused repeated fire outbreaks in Borno State, destroying large numbers of shelters, food supplies and other critical items across camps in the state (in Mafa, Jere, Monguno and Kala/Balge LGAs). Although humanitarian organisations were able to respond rapidly with emergency shelter kits and distributions of other life-saving items, fires are creating major gaps in the affected locations. Fire sensitisation campaigns and other mitigation measures, such as fire stations in heavily congested camps, are ongoing or being rolled out.

Overall, the humanitarian response in north-east Nigeria is hampered by the lack of funding for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Currently, most activities can only be implemented thanks to carry-over funding from 2017 (US$196 million) which will soon run out. For the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be urgently received across all the sectors","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update - Progress on key activities from the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-progress-key-activities-2018

The Emergency Telecommunications Sector (ETS) deployed vital communications services at the humanitarian hub in Damasak.

The ETS prepositioned Internet and security telecommunications equipment in Banki, where the next humanitarian hub will be established.

The ETS is working with local Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to evaluate the technical feasibility of a Closed User Group (CUG) to enhance communication among humanitarians.

Situation Overview

In early April, a series of fires broke out in and near the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp in Borno’s Rann town, injuring 14 people and burning more than 1,000 shelters in the camp, according to local media. Relief agencies are erecting 500 emergency shelters to decongest affected areas and working to address persistent shelter gaps.

The Yobe State Commissioner for Health declared a cholera outbreak in Nigeria’s Bade Local Government Area (LGA) at the beginning of April. Health actors recorded more than 340 suspected cholera cases in the state, more than 95 percent of which were from Bade, between 28 March and 16 April.

In anticipation of increased access challenges during the upcoming May-to-October rainy season, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published the 2018 Rainy Season Contingency Planning for North-East Nigeria on 9 April. It highlights that 407,000 people will be potentially affected during the 2018 rainy season in the three states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.",Nigeria Crisis - ETS Situation Report #18 (Reporting period 1/04/18 to 30/04/18),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-crisis-ets-situation-report-18-reporting-period-10418-300418

The reporting period witnessed high levels movement of IDPs, with a total of 16,542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa States.

A total of 35 new cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 3 deaths were reported in Yusufari and Bade LGAs, Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera.

A total of 195,804 medical consultations were supported by UNICEF in 2018, out of which 91,184 consultations were made within the reporting period.

UNICEF and its implementing partners have provided critical child protection services to 200,160 children and caregivers in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe since the start of 2018.

Though critically underfunded at 80% and 90%, WASH and Health reached a total 128,446 and 195,804 conflict-affected people respectively during the reporting period. Increased funding is urgently required in these Sectors for an integrated UNICEF response to crises-affected children in north east Nigeria.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno. The reporting period witnessed a high level of movement, with a total of 16, 542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements recorded across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa states. The main reasons for the returns are improved security and voluntary relocation, while new displacement is propelled by poor living conditions, fear of attack, ongoing conflict and military operations.



On 23rd March, the Nigerian Government announced its intention to facilitate the return of IDPs from Maiduguri to Bama LGA. Bama currently has the largest number of displaced people (203,374) still outside of the LGA, and at the same time also hosts the highest number of IDPs (49,139 persons DTM Round XXI) of all Borno LGAs. The first voluntary returns exercise, supported by a government package of 10,000 Naira cash, a 50kg bag of rice, and a bag of maize flour per family, was scheduled for 2nd April. Humanitarian actors have emphasized the importance of ensuring that all returns processes take place in a safe, voluntary, and dignified manner, and take into consideration the capacity of state and other actors to meet the needs of returnees.



As of 31st March, 133 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 12 deaths (a case fatality rate of 9%) were reported in Bade and Yusufari LGAs of Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera. WASH and health partners - including UNICEF, WHO, VCM, MSF Spain, State Ministry of Health (SMoH), State Primary Health Care Board (SPHCMB) and LGAs authorities - are responding in the affected areas. Meanwhile, the number of cholera cases in Kukawa LGA continues to decline following responses by UNICEF and partners. A total number of 639 cases and 3 deaths were reported at the end of March (resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.5%).



On 1st March, members of a non-state armed groups attacked the military camp in Rann, killing seven military personnel.



Hostilities also resulted in the deaths of three humanitarian workers (including a doctor working for a UNICEF contractor) and the abduction of three female health workers (including a nurse working for a UNICEF contractor). Humanitarian activities in Rann were suspended as a result of the attack, temporarily leaving the local population and an estimated 40,000 IDPs without life-saving assistance. The attack also resulted in the closure of the only school in Rann, thus halting learning opportunities for 7300 children (46% of whom are girls) and the destruction of 2,700 school bags with essential learning materials prepositioned in preparation for new enrolment. All teachers have moved to Maiduguri following the attack.

5,nigeria,"At the end of April 2018, President Trump met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. It was a very important meeting as President Buhari was the first president from sub-Saharan Africa to visit President Trump at the White House. President Trump was reportedly very interested in the conflict between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria’s Middle Belt. President Trump has caused outcry for the sympathy he has expressed for the Christian farmers targeted by the Fulani herdsmen. However, such criticism may have been ignorant. Indeed, President Trump may not be wrong on the Fulani herdsmen crisis in Nigeria.

The Fulani herdsmen, also known as the Fulani militia, are a semi-nomadic, pastoralist ethnic group living in the central regions of Nigeria, predominately in the Middle Belt. The majority of the Fulani herdsmen are Muslim. They have clashed with indigenous tribes and local, mainly Christian, farmers over grazing land over the centuries. However, as Open Doors explains, the clashes intensified around the time of the 2011 and 2015 elections, and again earlier this year. The regions most affected by the violence include the areas of Jama’a, Kachia, Kagarko, Kaura and Sanga in southern Kaduna.

The atrocities perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen include the destruction of houses and churches, as well as the seizure of land and properties belonging to Christian owners. Reports have also emerged of the Fulani herdsmen ‘kidnapping Christian schoolgirls to marry them to Muslim men.’ In its 2015 report, Open Doors lists detailed examples of such targeted attacks. The report rebuts the argument that the clashes were caused by environmental degradation and resulting migration. The report presents a more comprehensive picture incorporating some elements of religious persecution. Indeed, the conflict is extremely complex.

Despite this, according to BBC, President Buhari was reportedly quick to deflect the issues stating that ‘The problem of cattle herders is a very long historical problem. Before now, cattle herders were known to carry sticks and machetes… but these ones are carrying AK-47s.’ If this is the case, the question is then, what the Nigerian government is doing to resolve the ongoing conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers; investigate the crimes and prosecute the perpetrators; investigate the supply chain of AK-47s; consider the potential religious component to the conflict; and assist all victims of the conflict?

While President Buhari is often praised for his fight against deeply rooted corruption in Nigeria and his pro-active approach to the atrocities committed by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria (although some of these pro-active steps are currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court), the conflict in the Middle Belt does not appear to gain the government’s attention or trigger decisive actions. This is of particular importance because of the militarization of the Fulani herdsmen and because of similar violence against Christian minorities in northern Nigeria (although conducted by a different actor). Considering the widespread use of AK-47’s by Fulani herdsmen, greater action from the Nigerian government would be expected. This is of increased importance in light of yet more news that Nigeria is home to over 350 million illegal weapons. Furthermore, the religious component cannot be neglected. Open Doors reported that between 2006 and 2014, 9,000 - 11,500 Christians were killed and over 13,000 churches destroyed in northern Nigeria. Those numbers are not insignificant and the effect of such targeted atrocities cannot be ignored. Indeed, the destruction of 13,000 churches is likely to have affected close to 1.3 million Christians in the region and do adversely affected their right to practice their religion as well as marginalised the group as a whole.

Refreshing or ignorant, many may not agree with President Trump’s bold delivery of his opinions. In case of the issue of the Fulani herdsmen, their attacks on farmers in the Middle Belt and the continued ignorance of the Nigerian government, it is such controversial statements which may trigger the needed change (as per political pressure). The situation in the Middle Belt requires urgent attention and decisive actions. President Buhari’s dismissive approach is not justified.",Trump May Not Be Wrong On the Fulani Herdsmen Crisis In Nigeria,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/04/trump-may-not-be-wrong-on-the-fulani-herdsmen-crisis-in-nigeria/
6,nigeria,"Nigeria’s elections are among the most expensive in the world, with the cost soaring from a little above N1 billion in 1999 to over N100 billion in 2015, investigations by Daily Trust have shown.



The country’s huge cost of elections has surpassed that of the world’s largest democracy, India, with a population six times bigger than Nigeria’s.

Nigeria, with 67 million registered voters, spent $625 million during the 2015 elections, translating into $9.33 per voter, according to data prepared by the National Institute for Legislative Studies (NILS) in 2015.



This figure is higher than the $600 million the Electoral Commission of India (ECI) said it spent during the 2014 general elections in which 553.8 million people voted out of 815 million registered voters.



Nigeria’s $625 million was spent in funding expenditure that included information technology systems and infrastructure; maps and voter lists preparation; training for returning officers and field and special events staff, the NILS data said.



This huge expenditure did not include expenses incurred by other stakeholders such as security agencies that participated in the elections.



It also did include the huge expenses of candidates, political parties, advertisements, and support groups.



A top official at INEC told Daily Trust that security agencies receive huge amounts in the name of providing security during elections.



The official who declined being named said “aside from the costs we have, security is one of the big money guzzlers where police and other security services use to budget and demand big amounts.”



“An example is the last Anambra governorship elections where the security requested N1 billion that was cut down to N300 million but someone insisted that the one billion be given and that was given,” he said.



The official said that is why the police usually claim to have deployed thousands of policemen for an election but you will find many polling centres without any policeman.



Other security agencies, according to the INEC official, equally make similar demands.



Nigeria’s cost higher than UK, Canada, Australia



The cost of conducting elections in Nigeria is also higher than those of bigger economies such as Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.



Canada, for instance, spent $375 million on electoral expenditure where 17.5 million voted. The United Kingdom spent £113 million during its 2010 parliamentary elections in which 45.6 million voted. £28.6 million was the cost of distributing candidates’ mailings, and £84.6 million for the conduct of the poll.



Kenya, with 14.3 million registered voters, spent $427 million during its general elections in 2012. In 2017 elections, the Kenya’s budgetary allocation was $499 million; $429 million went to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), with the rest being distributed to the judiciary, National Intelligence Service and the Registrar of Political Parties.



Australia, with 14.7 million voters, spent $197.6 million for the House of Representatives and half of senate elections in 2013. During its last general elections, Benin Republic, with N2.7 million voters, spent $15 million.



Rising cost of Nigeria’s elections



Analysis of official documents of INEC’s budgetary allocations have shown that the elections cost have been soaring since the country’s return to democracy in 1999.



From 1999 to 2018, INEC had received N730.99 billion as budgetary allocations from the federal government, according to official documents reviewed by Daily Trust.



Of this sum, N450 billion was captured under ‘electoral expenditure,’ while N191.8 billion was ‘personnel cost,’ N36.9 billion ‘overhead cost,’ and N54.7 billion was ‘capital expenditure projects.’



The electoral expenditure started with N1.5 billion in 1999 to N29 billion in 2002, N45.5 billion in 2006, N111 billion in 2010, and down to N87.8 billion in 2014.



Ahead of next year’s general elections, INEC had submitted a budget of N300 billion for the conduct of 2019 elections. But less than 300 days to the poll, the money has not been approved yet by the parliament.



Questionable electoral expenses



Pervasive corruption that marred Nigeria’s public procurement process is largely responsible for the high cost of elections in Nigeria.



In 2011 for instance, according to a report published by African Journal of Elections, INEC received N87.7 billion ($576.9 million) for the registration of about 70 million voters over a period of three weeks using biometric devices, while Bangladesh, a developing country like Nigeria and one of the most populous countries in the world, spent about $65 million (N9.7 billion) on a biometric voter registration exercise conducted over a period of 11 months in 2008.



Even the Afghanistan voter registration exercise, which, in 2009, was labelled the single most expensive component of the electoral process because it cost a whopping $74 million (N11.25 billion), turned out to be cheaper or more cost effective than that of Nigeria, the report said.



It cost Canada $19.2 million (N2.8 billion) to register a total of 17.5 million voters in 2010.



Unregulated campaign funding



Though India has the second most expensive elections at $4.9 billion in 2014 after the United States’ $7 billion in 2012, Nigeria’s expenditure by candidates, parties and support groups is equally skyrocketing.



The Chief Technical Adviser to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Bolade Eyinla said cost of 2015 elections including expenses by political parties and their candidates, was between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.



He said this during a conference organised by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy in February last year in Abuja.



“In the last general elections in Benin Republic, the core cost was $15 million, and then you had a candidate who, alone, spent about $32 million.



“In Nigeria, our core cost was $547 million. It is perhaps the most expensive elections that we have ever seen. I have seen figures somewhere of between $1.5 billion to $2 billion and believe me; it is true if we knew what happened. In one scandal, we heard of $115 million”, he said.



Country Representative of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adebowale Olorunmola, said the cost of the 2015 election was higher than that of 2011.



“In 2011, all the opposition parties put together spent N2.04 billion in traceable expenditure, while the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party PDP spent N5.01 billion. In 2015, all the opposition parties spent N2.91 billion while PDP spent N8.74 billion,” he said.



According to him, these are traceable expenses which were spent on media advertisements, campaign materials among others, to the exclusion of money spent in underhand dealings and the use of state-owned facilities including stadia for campaigns and other political activities.

Mubi, the second largest town in the state with approximately 175,000 inhabitants, is a major market town in the region with close trading ties to neighboring Cameroon. Six international non-profit organisations are providing humanitarian aid, including food, safe water and sanitation facilities, to over 10,000 internally displaced persons and thousands of other vulnerable people in and around the town. Aid organisations also use Mubi as an operational centre to deliver aid in the northern parts of Adamawa State and the southern parts of adjacent Borno State. The town was briefly taken over by a non-state armed group in October 2014.

In this interview, he spoke on why he is joining the race. Excerpts:

By Peter Duru

Why do you think you can be president of Nigeria next year?

I will be president next year because Nigerians are sick of being tired and the status quo. They want a change. Nigeria has been ruled all these years by pre-modernity. People sit there, they don’t look at the future, they don’t plan on the youths. They do not plan on succession. They do not plan on legacy. They plan on eating, capturing treasury and looting. Nigerians are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the trajectory that our nation has arrived at today. God has not hated Nigeria so much that he will allow Nigeria to degenerate and collapse and totally become a failed country, broken into pieces. We Nigerians are so God-fearing, we pray a lot and some of us believe God has heard our prayers.

Why I think I will win the presidential election is that most of the aspirants on the ground do not share my passion for this country, my love for this country, my zeal for this country. And the places I have served this country, as a university professor who has watched my young people grow up to make something of themselves and still watch young people today grow up, graduate, don’t have jobs. Because they don’t have jobs, they are not married and they are watching the young men who graduate don’t have jobs become a risk to themselves. I am watching these young people flee this country into slavery in Libya and die on the seas. As a university professor and somebody who has all his life mentored, taught and trained youths, it breaks my heart.

So, to me, it is not even about winning because I know I have already won in the hearts of Nigerians. It is the struggle to change the status quo that it will never be like this again. It can be done because the issue with Nigeria is poor leadership, bad leadership, people who are fixed in the ways of yesterday, people who don’t have a clear idea about where Nigeria should go. Nigeria has a critical advantage over other countries because we have the fastest growing population of young people who are intelligent, so our entire lives should be focused on educating these young people on skills and ways that they will become significant. Countries like Germany and Japan have no raw materials, yet, they have developed education, employment and productivity.

This is what this presidency is about. It is to give Nigerians the ability to rise above mediocrity to be giants in the international community because we have more young people than other countries, that is our critical advantage. I am seizing the opportunity to turn this around and it will be done because I have taken too much shame looking at my young graduates without jobs. In my house, there are graduates that I trained that have no jobs, and they cry to me as a senator seeking my endorsement to get a job.

This will not happen, this is the worst form of corruption, bureaucratic corruption, corruption in government, corruption in the university system, corruption everywhere. We have become endemically corrupt and the country is not looking at the fundamentals of fighting corruption. We are dealing with the surface symbolism of corruption and we are pursuing people and raiding people’s homes without dealing with the fundamentals. That is why I am different, I am going to win because Nigerians don’t have a choice because it is me and others.

There is the problem of insecurity in Nigeria. In Benue, your state, herdsmen are killing farmers, in the North-East, Boko Haram insurgents are killing and in the South, militants are there with their problems. How will you solve these multifaceted problems if elected president of the country?

We are in a state of total collapse in this country. There is nowhere in this country, no state where you do not have armed robbery, and kidnapping on the increase. People are killed at will and there is no solution to the murders taking place and nobody is held accountable. Our security agencies are compromised and criminals work in tandem with our security agents. We have reached a state of paralysis.

When I become president, it is not just me, it is a mind revolution. Everybody will be a security officer. That is what is done everywhere in the world. We have the technology today that can effectively map out and secure our areas but nobody is using them. More importantly, the things that are making people criminals are unemployment, lack of education, where people in the 21st Century are animists, who believe that if you kill a young woman and take out her private part or parts of her body, you can make money out of that. Why should such barbarity continue? And we are not unaware of the modern slavery that is taking place where young people are being hunted to harvest their parts for use in other countries for kidney and heart transplants, etc.

So people who are vicious and wicked come to Nigeria and look at you that you are a very strong young man, kill you and end up harvesting your parts for their benefit. With modern technology and everybody getting involved in security, we can solve this problem. Now, nobody really cares if we involve the local communities. I can secure Benue State within a month.

One laptop can capture an entire population in a local government area, and village by village. If everybody is everybody’s security, the day a strange face appears in the local government from bicycle to motorcycle, we can log in that a strange person has come into village A, what is he doing? The following day somebody else reports, we saw strange movement of people. You then monitor it immediately, using information system. You can monitor security, it has reached advanced stage. It is so easy to be done but nobody wants to do it because people are benefiting from the insecurity.

Look at the present insecurity in the country. The President asked for $1billion, why is terrorism not being crushed? It is lasting longer than the Nigerian civil war. Why? It is not a problem to me, I will finish it. All it takes is political will. If they are ready to finish it, they will finish it but because they are benefiting from it, they will not.

The Agric sector is in dire need of intervention, what are your plans for that sector?

Agriculture via education is how I am going to turn this country around. With education, you don’t need oil. With agriculture, you don’t need oil. The monies that we got from oil have been stolen. And the oil is going down. If you live in the first world, you will be surprised how much research is going on. There is a car called Tesller that is already being driven in US and Canada, which does not use fuel at all. They are also experimenting with cars that drive themselves. You sit in the car and sleep, it takes you anywhere you want. Primitive agriculture will not work, educate the people and also improve the agricultural product.

I am going to do one thing that no other president has done in this country. I am going to take education so seriously that every university will be actively involved in research, development and innovation. That is what has not happened in this country. Professors are promoted in our universities, go and ask them what they did before they were promoted, basic research that has no relevance in the environment. We have a university of agriculture, what do we do with it? They should be on the farms teaching new methods, giving us new seeds. Have they ever given us a new species of oranges? No!

Our people are innovative, our people are creative, every year, you see different names of new mangoes that they have on their own experimented. They research on their own, work and had successful products. That is research taking place outside the university system. Now, I am not speaking out of a vacuum. I have built a new University called Afe Babalola University. I have been Pro-Chancellor in charge of the university for eight years. And that is what we have been doing. We have won many international prizes in science and technology.

I am going to replicate that in every university and I am going to establish research centres in every university across the country. Two days ago, I was so angry to see that bitterleaf has been commodified and have been put in capsule form and they are selling it in America as one of the cures for cancer. If that is a fortune, it should have been discovered here in Nigeria, there should have been a centre for it. The intellectual property would have been beneficial to Nigerians and not the international community. And since we are not doing this, our universities are not counted among the best 1000 universities in the world. It is a shame; that is why I am going to be a university president, the education president.

What’s your take on the raging herdsmen/farmers crisis that has brought the country to its knees?

My answer is simple. Buhari has been a very incompetent president and the fact that he has declared that he wants to run again after I, Obasanjo, Babangida and a host of others, including Danjuma had advised him not to contest and leave a legacy. I told him you have to choose between leaving a legacy and a peaceful society or be regarded as somebody who killed democracy and promoted genocide. Apparently, he has chosen the latter.

I consider his declaration to run for a second term as an act of political terrorism. When you have failed all your campaign promises, the first promise was that he will be here for one term, he has failed that by declaring that he will contest for a second term. He promised that he will eliminate corruption, but the Transparency International told us that Nigeria has never been so corrupt as it is today. How many people have his system jailed? He is fighting corruption in a wrong way. And most pathetically, he does not have the disposition, the willpower, nor the kind of empathy which a president should have. He is behaving as if it does not matter what the people are saying. He is behaving like a civilian dictator. We know that he is still a general in his mind so, maybe he is leading us to full military dictatorship.

We elected him in 2015, if he makes himself elected again, by hook or crook, it is an imposition. Right now, it is an imposition. He went into the NEC meeting of his APC and announced himself that he is running, which is an act of intimidation. It is like, oh whether you like it or not, I am going to run. So I feel deeply concerned that our president is out of touch with the reality in his country.

When I am a Nigerian president, I will make sure that every ethnic group in this country is respected. There will be no favoured ethnic group, no master ethnic group. There will be no slave ethnic group that has to give up everything so that other ethnic groups must live. And you have the Tiv as the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the rest of the country. I say this with very serious concern because each time I see people eat pounded yam in the town and I look back how that pounded yam was produced, and see one poor farmer’s child deprived of school, and see his educated people eating pounded yam, and I see that they are doing it at the back of the young people that have been deprived of education, I cry.

As I drive along the road and see people selling mangoes, fish, even rats and crickets along Abinsi Road, they don’t eat those things, they need that protein but they also need to pay hospital bills. They also need to pay their children’s school fees. So, fundamentally, I am going to restructure Nigeria to work in such a way that people will be happy. I will give the young people the kind of infrastructure they will be happy with. I will set up internet infrastructure in every city. I will give roads that work, it is a shame that no single federal road is working in this country. I am going to make sure that there are roads. I am coming up with a master plan which you will all see. It is doable and I will do it.

I will give Nigerians brand new fantastic infrastructure befitting a 21st-Century country, which by 2050, will be the third largest country on earth. It’s not too far from now, we should start planning for that. We are not, we are having a youth bulge which could lead to a revolution, or it will lead to a war and we are not ready for that. We don’t want a breakdown or a chaotic scenario. We want a determined leadership that will construct, and be involved in nation-building. Our leaders are not engaged in nation- building, that is why they are engaged in ethnicity, nepotism, corruption, preaching primordial mindset of personal aggrandisement and and riding roughshod over the sensibilities of Nigerians. So I will be a different president.

Most of our leaders are known for running overseas for medical attention despite repeated campaign promises to end the practice given its implication on the nation’s resources. Will your presidency be different?

I will go to the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital. As an ordinary pro-chancellor in the university, I built the most modern university teaching hospital in this country. If I need a new heart, I can have transplant right in that hospital in Nigeria. And besides, with money, how long would it have taken Buhari to have assembled the best team, pay them whatever money they needed to have him treated here in Nigeria? If it requires time, the three years he has been going abroad for medical treatment would have been enough to build a hospital, even if it is a hospital that was just about his sickness. Just one hospital, bring all the experts, bring all the equipment. Don’t we have the money to pay for that? I think it is medical tourism.",2019: Nigerians can’t afford to elect a bad president – Hagher,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/2019-nigerians-cant-afford-elect-bad-president-hagher/
9,nigeria,"At least 45 people were killed after armed bandits attacked a village in northern Nigeria, officials said Sunday, the latest in a series of attacks in the country’s rural areas.

Fighting between militiamen and the bandits erupted after the raid on the village of Gwaska, in northwestern Kaduna state, on Saturday, according to Agence France-Press.

“There was violence between the militias, who are very powerful, and bandits,” said Kaduna’s state police chief, Austin Iwar.

An unnamed vigilante told AFP that he believed the bandits to be from neighboring Zamfara state. “The 45 bodies were found scattered in the bush. The bandits pursued residents who mobilized to defend the village after overpowering them,” he said, adding that children were among those killed. “They burnt down many homes,” he said.

Thirteen people were killed last week in Zamfara in fighting between cattle thieves and local civilian militia. Cattle rustlers and kidnapping gangs have long plagued rural herding communities in the state with killings, robberies, and arson.

11,nigeria,"I regret to inform you that president Buhari has done it again. Just over two years ago, I had cause to defend the constituency of which I am a part when he made remarks in London during a newspaper interview implying that Nigerians abroad have a single story of criminality. A few days ago during a Commonwealth Business Forum session, in London yet again (what is it about London that triggers the president one wonders), he made comments that kicked up an almighty firestorm among young Nigerians. His supporters will try to say it was a slip, but it’s a slip he keeps making.

In answering, or trying to answer, questions about Nigeria’s troubled north east, the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA)—which Nigeria pulled out of signing at the last minute—and Nigeria’s economy in general, he delivered a broadside at Nigeria’s young population saying they were lazy and entitled and perhaps deluded.

More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.

What was most amusing, for lack of a better word, was not whether young Nigerians are deluded. It was the idea that a Nigerian government has any of the above gifts in its power to dispense.

It is impossible to exaggerate the damage that has been done to Nigerian education over many years. It is the president’s comments about education that are most painful and downright cruel. It is impossible to exaggerate the damage that has been done to Nigerian education over many years. Routinely, at every stage, it fails young Nigerians and then delivers them into the job market with no skills or preparation to take on the world and make a success of their lives. And they are the lucky ones—UNICEF estimates that Nigeria has 10.5 million children of school age who do not get into school at all, the highest in the world.

Following the journey of children through the Nigerian education system, and the federal funding that follows them, is a traumatic exercise. At the primary school level (the responsibility of cash-strapped and hapless state governments) and secondary levels (where the federal government steps in with a relatively minor role), funding for education is terribly squeezed or even non-existent. Though many millions will drop off along the way, for the students who manage to make it to higher education the federal government then turns on the funding tap.

In the proposed 2018 budget (pdf, pg 1228) the federal government proposes to spend a total of 606 billion naira ($1.7 billion) on education. About 400 billion naira of this total (65%) goes directly to higher education. The federal government’s contribution to basic education gets 114 billion naira (96% of which goes to salaries) via the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). The over 100 secondary schools the federal government is responsible for, collectively known as ‘unity schools’, get a total of 32 billion naira to share among themselves, 8% of what goes to universities.

How Nigeria came to neglect and debase primary and secondary education and then dedicate the biggest chunk of its budget to tertiary education has many reasons but two in particular stand out.

If young Nigerians “haven’t been to school” as the president said, it is no accident—it is the outcome of a system designed to do just that. First, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is easily one of the most effective unions in Nigeria in terms of getting the government to bend to its will. It is impossible to write Nigeria’s history since 1978 when the union was formed without documenting the numerous strikes they have embarked on. As a victim of Nigerian universities myself, one year was added to my university education by ASUU strikes and I can be considered lucky, many others had more than a year added.

These strikes and ASUU’s relationship with the government are almost comical to observe. They demand money, government ignores them, they go on strike, the government agrees to their (impossible) demands, they go back to work. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief waiting for the inevitable accusations from ASUU that the government has reneged on its agreement. Most recently it claimed the government owes universities 800 billion naira, more than double what they are to receive in this year’s budget. At some point in the near future they will go on strike again and the government will pay up in some form.

Looking for something to do (Reuters/Afolabi Sotunde)

The second reason explains why ASUU’s strikes are so effective. As a result of the government absconding from the lower levels of education, more children are being educated privately at primary and secondary levels than in the public school system. A 2014 report by the World Bank (pdf, pg 9) showed that registered and unregistered private schools accounted for 75% of all school enrollment in Lagos state, the country’s most populous. A few days ago, the junior education minister disclosed that just 80,000 students wrote the entrance exams to get into one of the government’s unity schools. It is a sad testament to how far they have fallen that parents, who can afford better private schools for their wards, no longer bother to get them into what were once considered elite institutions. Nevertheless, over 1.7 million students wrote the university entrance exams last year, competing for around 500,000 university spaces.

Tying these two reasons together, a simple power dynamic emerges. The Nigerian middle class and the politically powerful elite who can cause the government a great deal of discomfort have long abandoned public education at the primary and secondary levels. Were primary and secondary teaching unions to go on strike demanding more money like ASUU, they might not make the news at all. But public universities continue to educate the vast majority of higher education students in the country. For the rich and powerful, the other options are the handful of private universities or sending their kids abroad (like president Buhari does). Both options are currently exercised by a minority of people, albeit a growing one. Thus, any hostage taking via strikes is very effective at getting the government to capitulate.

There is no sign that the government recognizes that the nation is in the grip of an education crisis at all levels. This power dynamic is best illustrated with the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND). In 1993, a decree, by the then military government, established the Education Tax Fund (ETF) which mandated a 2% tax on the profits of all companies in Nigeria. The fund was to help supplement government funding for all levels of education in Nigeria. Half of the ETF went to primary (30%) and secondary (20%) with universities getting 25%. Polytechnics and colleges of education got 12.5% each. But in 2011, ASUU successfully lobbied and forced the government to change the law which transformed the ETF into TETFUND. Today, the 2 % tax on companies only funds higher education with universities getting 50% and polytechnics and colleges of education getting 25% each. Primary and secondary education has been kicked out of it.

University lecturers in particular have since turned TETFUND into another source of funding for themselves. They now apply to the fund for grants to study abroad for masters and PhD programs (while they continue to earn their full pay). An official report by TETFUND for September 2017 showed that it approved funding for a total of 449 masters and PhDs in that month alone 106 of them outside Nigeria. It also approved 283 conference attendances for that month, 66 of them abroad. The most recent available audit of TETFUND in 2013 showed that it received 366 billion naira between 2007 and 2011, the last year before it was exclusively taken over by higher education. The report shows that a significant chunk of the money was going to state primary education boards where Nigeria’s education system is currently failing the most.

If young Nigerians “haven’t been to school” as the president said, it is no accident—it is the outcome of a system designed to do just that. Over many decades, the government has abdicated its most basic responsibility to set up children with a basic education at primary and secondary levels. Only by the time it is far too late does it then respond to hostage takers by handing over the chunk of its budget to them.

President Buhari has not shown even the slightest sign that he has thought about these problems let alone proffer solutions to them. He appointed a most disinterested minister of education who was hardly seen nor heard for the first two years of his government. There is no sign that the government recognizes that the nation is in the grip of an education crisis at all levels. It simply carries on as normal and, as the president even said at the Commonwealth Business Forum, it thinks it deserves some accolades for some imaginary achievements it has had.

Reflecting its responsibility and commitment to ensure that protection is central to all aspects of the humanitarian response in northeast Nigeria, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has developed this Centrality of Protection Strategy to provide vision, guidance and a basis for an operational approach. While acknowledging that the primary responsibility to protect civilian populations lies with the Government of Nigeria, the HCT commits to demonstrating the necessary leadership to fulfill the shared responsibility to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights.

Having this strategy recognizes the significance and overarching imperative to have a comprehensive approach to providing affected populations the means to live their lives in safety and dignity, especially in times of crisis or conflict. It also emphasizes the HCT’s accountability to affected populations when addressing identified protection risks or violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

Addressing the key protection concerns in northeast Nigeria is the joint responsibility of all partners and requires coherent and complementary approaches. The HCT in Nigeria, consisting of INGO, UN and donor representatives, aims to ensure a system-wide achievement of protection priorities in recognition of this. As this is the case, the HCT Centrality of Protection Strategy was developed through a consultative process with HCT and Operational HCT (OHCT) members, the Protection Sector and its AORs.

Through this shared vision, the HCT commits to three overall objectives in the Centrality of Protection Strategy: 1) To create and sustain a protective environment; 2) To enhance protection through freedom of movement and enhanced access; and 3) To ensure protection mainstreaming into the humanitarian response and decision-making.",Centrality of Protection Strategy - Humanitarian Country Team Nigeria December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/centrality-protection-strategy-humanitarian-country-team-nigeria-december-2017

The 50 million doses of polio vaccine stored in laboratory refrigerators all over Nigeria had a big weekend planned for them. If things had gone as intended, on Saturday morning, May 5, all of the little vials would have been trucked, flown, biked, walked around the all 36 states of the nation – to be delivered to every single one of the 49,882,036 known Nigerian children under 5 years old. But, as things developed, an outbreak of circulating virus in one region of the country upended those plans for routine immunization, replacing them for now with a crisis response in the affected area. The 50 million doses will instead remain on ice until some time late in June.

That is the start-stop way polio surveillance and immunization works—indeed, is supposed to work. And that’s what has allowed Nigeria to go a full 20 months without a single case of paralytic polio. If the country can make it to three years, plus a few extra months as an epidemiological cushion, it will be certified polio-free, which will also mean that the entire continent of Africa is clear of the disease. That will leave Afghanistan and Pakistan as the only nations on Earth where polio is endemic.

“Certification will be an achievement,” says Dr. Tunji Funsho, a former cardiologist who is now the chair of Rotary International’s Polio-Plus Committee in Nigeria. ”But we’re not in a hurry for that. We’re in a hurry to make sure no child is paralyzed.”

Dr. Funsho would have been one of the ranking officials overseeing this weekend’s planned National Immunization Day (NID), which actually would have spanned four days. NIDs are held twice a year in Nigeria, always from Saturday to Wednesday, to help ensure that field workers have two days to visit families when children are home from school. In addition to the semi-annual NIDs, a sub-NID covering nearly 23 million children is held annually in 13 northern states, which are considered high-risk areas.

The current NID was suspended when routine surveillance of sewage detected traces of live poliovirus in the northern states of Jigawa, Sokoto and Gombe, meaning somewhere in those states at least a few children were carrying the virus — perhaps asymptomatically. It had already passed through their bodies and into the environment. Bauchi state, which lies between Jigawa and Gombe, was also likely contaminated.

“When the geneticists sequenced the virus from Jigawa and Gombe they found they were identical,” says Dr. Mohammed Soghair, UNICEF’s polio field coordinator in Nigeria. “Somebody traveled from one state and shed the virus in the other, and that means it could have been shed in Bauchi too.”

In response, vaccine teams scrambled to the affected states to administer 2.4 million vaccine doses, hoping to cauterize the epidemiological wound before any cases of actual paralysis could turn up. Only when that situation is stabilized will the NID get underway.

In some ways, the weekend’s developments in Nigeria capture the devilishly tricky business of polio eradication overall. There are two types of vaccine used to prevent the disease: the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the injected polio vaccine (IPV). OPV is easier and less expensive to administer and so that’s the kind that is used in mass-scale immunizations. The problem is, OPV uses a live, weakened form of the poliovirus to confer immunity, and on extremely rare occasions, that virus can mutate and actually cause the disease. The IPV, which is preferred in the developed world for routine childhood immunizations, uses a killed virus.

The viral samples found in the affected northern states were this vaccine-derived form of the virus—specifically Type 2. Originally, there were three types of wild poliovirus. Types 2 and 3 have been vaccinated into extinction; Type 1 remains at large. The vaccines used in NIDs include protection against both 1 and 3—since 3 was wiped out only recently. Vaccinations against Type 2 were discontinued in 2016, which made it vexing that it was that type that turned up in the northern-state sewage.

“The vaccines might simply have been discarded when they were no longer needed,” says Dr. Funsho. “Even when a vial looks empty, there can be some traces of virus left.”

To prevent this kind of careless contamination, doctors and other caregivers are cautioned to dispose of vaccine leftovers much more carefully. Vials that are returned to labs can be handled and destroyed like any other medical waste. In villages, empty vials are given something akin to the nuclear waste treatment, boiled and then buried five meters, or about 15 feet, underground. The burial site is then covered with a slab of concrete. In Bauchi state, used vials are taken to the local Ashaka Cement Factory and incinerated in an industrial oven.

It says something about Nigeria that so many of its institutions—political, medical, industrial, to say nothing of the volunteer community—are engaged in the eradication campaign. But it says something about the particular cruelty polio too—a disease that steals the happy, kinetic activity that is supposed to define childhood—that it inspires such immovable human resolve. The virus has no mind. Humans have both minds and hearts. The contest, in the end, isn’t even close.",How Nigeria Is Winning the War to Eradicate Polio in Africa,http://time.com/5266882/nigeria-polio-eradication-vaccination/
14,nigeria,"Nigeria’s drug abuse problem has been put under the spotlight by a new investigative documentary.

Across several major Nigerian cities, many young adults are known to be addicted to several illicit drugs but, in recent years, opioid-based cough syrups in particular have become a serious menace.

In Sweet Sweet Codeine, an investigative documentary by the BBC, reporters secretly film staff of three major pharmaceutical companies offering to sell thousands of codeine-based cough syrup bottles in illicit deals. The complicity of these companies which produce cough syrups locally helps explain the widespread availability of the drugs despite a government ban on over-the-counter sales. The documentary is the first for BBC’s Africa Eye, a new TV investigations strand, the latest in BBC’s expansion across Africa.

With local pharmaceutical production unregulated by government, cough syrups are being produced on an industrial scale. While drug makers are legally bound to only supply to pharmacies which in turn sell to patients with prescriptions, corrupt staff are taking advantage of the high demand on the black market and running parallel drug syndicates. Following the BBC investigation, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, one of Nigeria’s largest, has suspended the distribution of codeine cough syrup. It came after an Emzor executive was filmed cutting a deal to illegally supply cough syrup bottles.

Nigeria’s health ministry has also announced a ban on importing and producing codeine-based cough syrups.

Catching them young

The target market in the illicit codeine trade typically consists of teenagers and young adults looking for a cheap high. At a price of around 1,000 naira ($3), codeine is exactly that. Even though it is illegal to sell codeine cough syrups without a doctor’s prescription, the drugs remain widely available. It is common to find them casually consumed, sometimes as part of mixtures, at local bars and parties.

Taking codeine has become “cool” as pop culture references about the opioid have proliferated, particularly in the booming Afrobeats scene . “Diet“, an Afrobeats song with the refrain, “on a Codeine diet” has become a big hit for three of Nigeria’s biggest pop stars while the risque music video for Science Student by Olamide was banned by Nigerian media regulators. Codeine references also litter American hip hop as several big name artists, including rapper Lil’ Wayne, have released codeine-inspired tracks.

The thousands of young Nigerians already addicted are at risk of suffering from effects of sustained opioid abuse ranging from schizophrenia to organ failure.

The problem is more acute in Nigeria’s vast north where millions of young adults are unemployed. Its prevalence is also rooted in cultural nuances: with the sale of alcohol banned across most northern states mainly for religious reasons, young adults and teenagers often turn to cheap opioid-based drugs, especially codeine cough syrups, as an alternative. Those who cannot afford codeine syrups turn to more extreme options including lizard dung and cobwebs.

Isa Mohammed, a Kano-based pharmacist attributes the rampant abuse in the north to “access and supply”. Last October, Nigeria’s senate claimed around three million bottles of codeine syrups were consumed daily in two northern states alone. A measure of the scale of the problem, last month, the anti-drug agency seized a truckload of 24,000 bottles of codeine cough syrups in a single incident. The effects of the access to the cheap opioid on a mostly Muslim youth in the wake of poverty and a lack of employment, Mohammed says, “is disastrous.”

Bureaucratic bottlenecks

Nigeria’s government made little progress in curbing the problem. A ban on over the counter sales hardly dented the problem as unregulated production and illicit trade ensure that the drug remains available. It’s unlikely that the ban on sales without prescriptions has been implemented at all of the thousands of drug stores across the country.

Beyond attempting to stop over the counter sales without prescriptions, the government had been slow to act until the ban yesterday (May 1). Indeed a committee was set up in January to look into codeine abuse but its findings and recommendation, initially expected six weeks later, have not been published by the health ministry.

Over Nigeria’s borders, neighboring countries face a similar opioid crisis with Tramadol, a cheap but addictive pain relief medicine. Benin, which borders Nigeria’s west, is the second largest destination for Indian Tramadol globally. Some of the worst affected countries in West Africa are yet to make significant progress in tackling the opioid abuse.

Local advocacy groups recommend regulating production and distribution of drugs as a better solution to the opioid abuse problem. Adeyemi Oluwatosin, editor-in-chief of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, says one way to do that is by finally adopting the national drug distribution guidelines—a policy to regulate the distribution of drugs and eliminate open drug markets as well fake drugs. Five years after it was first proposed however, the policy remains unimplemented.

As for Mohammed, an outright ban alone will only be a temporary fix if government does not take on the much tougher problem of regulation. Addicts, he says, will likely turn to abusing other drugs, some with worse effects. “Banning codeine is not the issue, regulation of drugs is what we need,” he tells Quartz. “If we’re not regulating, then we’re just wasting our time and people will keep dying.”

The lingering crisis affecting the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) has taken a new dimension as the Nigerian Copyright Commission has suspended its operating licence.

Coson’s Head, Corporate Affairs, Chibueze Okereke, confirmed the development in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Friday.

According to him, COSON’s lawyers headed by Uche Val Obi (SAN) are challenging NCC’s ruling at the court of appeal.

An entertainment lawyer, Akinyemi Ayinoluwa, had earlier shared the news on his official Instagram page on Friday.

Mr Ayinoluwa posted a copy of the ruling, which was ‘authorised’ by the minister of justice, Abubakar Malami.

According to the new ruling, COSON is no longer authorised under law to collect royalties on behalf of and for musicians and other performing artists in Nigeria.

The Commission is the government agency empowered by law to oversee the affairs of COSON and other agencies under its supervision.

This comes after a petition written by artiste, 2face Idibia to the Commission asking it to wade into the crisis at COSON between its chairman Tony Okoroji and Efe Omorogbe.

Efe Omorogbe continues to insist that he is the recognised chairman of COSON.

Some members of the commission’s board installed Mr Omorogbe as the new chairman, having legally recalled Mr Okoroji from his position as chairman of COSON. This happened in December.

The former was replaced over allegations of impropriety.

It was alleged that Mr Okoroji collects 10 per cent commission on licensing income deemed to have been brought in by him and primarily, because he contracts COSON projects and events to his company, TOPS Limited.

Despite Mr Omorogbe’s election, Mr Okoroji was reinstated as the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting of COSON, held on December 19.

A faction of the board loyal to Mr Okoroji reinstated him and sacked those who voted for Mr Omorogbe.

The crisis got messier in April as police from Zone II Command Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, arraigned Mr Omorogbe before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for alleged impersonation and forgery.

According to the prosecuting officer, Friday Mameh, the defendants (Mr Omorogbe and others) had stormed the meeting of venue of the COSON chairman, with thugs on December 7, 2017 and conducted themselves (in a manner) likely to cause breach of peace.

Mr Mameh alleged that Mr Omorogbe and others forged the COSON letter-headed papers, “with intent to defraud, knowingly use the forged COSON letter headed with intent that it may in anyway be used or acted upon as genuine whether in Nigeria or elsewhere to the prejudice of COSON.”

Mr Omorogbe and others pleaded not guilty.

16,nigeria,"Mainz defender Leon Balogun, 29, has been called up 14 times by Nigeria

Nigeria defender Leon Balogun says it is crucial his fellow international team-mates stay injury-free ahead of the 2018 World Cup.

Nigeria, the first side from Africa to seal a spot in Russia, have been drawn in Group D alongside Argentina, Croatia and Iceland.

Unbeaten in qualifying and with impressive friendly victories against Argentina and Poland, Balogun says the fitness of players will be key to having a successful campaign this summer.

""Some so-called big teams will also miss players due to injuries but we can only hope for the best and go to Russia with the same spirit we have now Leon Balogun Mainz and Nigeria defender

""We have a team capable of doing well in Russia and this team can perform to expectations if we have everyone in great shape,"" Mainz defender Balogun told BBC Sport.

""As a professional you don't think so much about getting injured or avoiding it, you just give everything on the pitch for club and country.

""I know injuries come with football and if we are very lucky not have it, then all the players in Nigerian colours have the spirit to fight for success until the end.""

Three-time African Champions Nigeria continue their impressive run of appearances at the finals, having missed only one tournament - Germany 2006 - since qualifying for their debut in 1994.

At their last appearance, the experienced Super Eagles led by Joseph Yobo and Vincent Enyeama reached the second round in Brazil before losing to France, and Balogun says the current team is focussed on success.

""I was very unlucky to miss the last tournament in Brazil and we've seen changes since then (managers and players), but we now have a good spirit going into the World Cup,"" the Germany-born player added.

""Many players will be going for the first time and ready to shine on the biggest stage for football. It's the dedication and passion that drives us as a team.

""Some so-called big teams will also miss players due to injuries but we can only hope for the best and go to Russia with the same spirit we have now,"" said Balogun.

Already sweating over the fitness of Wilfred Ndidi and Joel Obi, Gernot Rohr's side will face DR Congo in a friendly in Port Harcourt on 28 May.

World Cup-bound England will be Nigeria's opponents on 2 June at Wembley ahead of the final warm-up fixture against Czech Republic on 6 June.

""We've enjoyed a good preparation so far and learning from our mistakes as well,"" said Balogun.

""These last three matches will give us a chance to get in the right place for the World Cup.""

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
19,nigeria,"Fighting between armed bandits and militiamen left 45 dead in northern Nigeria, police and a local militia said Sunday, amid escalating rural violence often involving cattle rustling, robbery and kidnappings.

""The 45 bodies were found scattered in the bush. The bandits pursued residents who mobilised to defend the village after overpowering them,"" said a vigilante who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.

""The dead included children abandoned by their parents during the attack"" in the village of Gwaska, in Kaduna state.

""The attackers were obviously armed bandits from neighbouring Zamfara state who have been terrorising Birnin Gwari area,"" he added.

The Kaduna state police chief, Austin Iwar, confirmed the attack, saying: ""There was violence between the militias, who are very powerful, and bandits.""

He could not break down the casualties, saying only: ""For now all we know is that 12 people were buried yesterday and 33 today.""

The vigilante said the bandits struck at about 2:30 pm (1330 GMT) Saturday and stayed for three hours before retreating to their base in the forest in Zamfara.

""They burnt down many homes,"" he said.

The killings follow the death of 13 people in prolonged clashes between cattle thieves and local civilian militia in Zamfara last week.

The attacks underlined the diversity of Nigeria's security threats that persist because of an overstretched army and security forces.

Rural communities in Zamfara have been under siege for several years from cattle rustlers and kidnapping gangs, who have raided herding communities, killing, looting and burning homes.

To defend themselves, villages and herdsmen form vigilante groups, but they too are often accused of extra-judicial killings, provoking a bloody cycle of retaliatory attacks.

Adding to the proliferation of violence due to these criminal groups, Nigeria is in the grip of a security crisis as nomadic herders and sedentary farmers fight over land in an increasingly bloody battle for resources.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has been criticised for failing to curb the violence, which is becoming a key election issue ahead of presidential polls in 2019.

The military and police are fighting Boko Haram jihadists in the north, militants and pirates in the oil-rich south, a simmering separatist movement in the east as well as the bloody conflict between herdsmen and farmers spanning the vast central region.

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.

…Appeal panels meet tomorrow

By our reporters

THE crises ravaging the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, deepened at the weekend as the nationwide ward congresses ended on a mixed note.

The party’s governorship primary in Ekiti State ended in chaos after thugs destroyed election materials and delegates loyal to some aspirants for the ticket of the party ahead of the July election in the state disagreed.

Some notable APC leaders, such as the embattled National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, boycotted the ward congresses in Edo; so also were Speaker Yakubu Dogara in Bauchi and Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso in Kano, whose loyalists held parallel congresses.

While the ward congresses were peaceful in a couple of states such as Edo, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kwara, and Katsina, among others, it was not so in Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, and Delta where violence and aparthy marred the exercise.

In Delta, one of the party’s ward chairmanship aspirants, Mr. Jeremiah Oghoveta, in Ward 10, Otu-Jeremi, Ughelli South Local Government Area, was stabbed to death during the violence that trailed the congress.

In Akwa Ibom, no fewer than 10 persons, including the Etim Ekpo Local Government Chairman of the APC, Mr. Iniobong Akan, were beaten up by aggrieved youths.

The youths allegedly blocked the gates of the state secretariat, along Atiku Abubakar Avenue, where the exercise held, preventing party members from entering the premises. However, the congress proceeded after the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Senate Matters and leader of the APC in Akwa Ibom State, Senator Ita Enang, met with the aggrieved members.

In Rivers, APC chieftains, continued to accuse one another of sponsoring the youths who invaded the state secretariat of the party in Port Harcourt on eve of the Ward Congress.

While feuding Rivers APC Leader and Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, and 2019 governorship aspirant, Senator Magnus Abe, accused each other of masterminding the violence, another chieftain of the party, Duke Alamboye Kirchner, indicated that the incident was instigated by non-APC forces.

There were parallel congresses in Imo State where the Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere, and Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, escaped attacks from thugs at the APC secretariat following the confusion and angst that hallmarked the parallel congresses in the state.

President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo took part in the congresses. While Osinbajo attended the exercise in Agungi in Eti-Osa LGA of Lagos State, where he was received by party leaders, Buhari participated in the congress in his Sarkin Yara A Ward, Daura in Katsina State, where he urged elected ward executives to discharge their responsibilities with fear of God and in accordance with the party’s constitution.

Be diligent, decent, decorous, Buhari urges ward excos

Buhari, who spoke after participating in the APC Ward Congress in his constituency, said throughout his political career, he had been a loyal party member who respected the rules and the regulations, assuring that his administration was determined to uphold the provisions of the constitution and the rule of law.

Stressing the need to play politics with decency and decorum, he said: “I call on you to fear God in whatever you do as we would transit to the next world and account for our deeds before our creator.”

Chairmanship candidate killed

Jeremiah Jacob Ogboveta, the APC chairmanship candidate in Jeremi Ward 3/10, Ughelli South Local Government Area, Delta State, was stabbed in the violence that broke out during the exercise in the area.

Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka said: “At about12:30pm, one Jeremiah Jacob was stabbed to death by a member of the APC (names withheld) who is currently on the run.

“Though there are no details for now, we know that the suspect immediately fled after the incident and efforts are currently on to apprehend him.”

Meanwhile, Board of Trustees, BoT, member of the APC, Chief Frank Kokori, said the congress went smoothly in his Ovu Ward 5, Ethiope East local government area.

Parallel congresses in Imo

Parallel congresses were held in various wards of the 27 local council areas of Imo State.

In Azuzii Ward 2, Owerri Municipal, while loyalists of Governor Rochas Okorocha held their congress in Emmanuel College premises, officials of the party moved theirs to Umuodu village.

Some APC members, suspected to be Okorocha loyalists, clustered at the state Police Headquarters, chanting war songs and clamouring for the cancellation of the ward congresses in the 305 wards of Imo.

Speaking to Sunday Vanguard in a telephone interview, the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Chief Nwabueze Oguchienti, said that the parallel congresses were not unexpected.

“The party saw as it coming. We are aware that those loyal to the governor are responsible for the parallel congress. I must tell you that those who engaged in the shameful act are not party loyalists”, Oguchienti said.

The state Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere, escaped attack from thugs at the state secretariat as Okorocha’s son-in-law, Mr Uche Nwosu, said that there was a swap of congress committee that was supposed to conduct the exercise.

Among those who escaped the attack were Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, a former Secretary to the State Government, Mr Jude Ejiogu and others.

Sunday Vanguard was told that Madumere and others were at the APC state Secretariat as part of the preparation for the party’s congress.

But with the intervention of the security agencies, a peaceful atmosphere was restored.

It was claimed that the congress committee that was supposed to conduct congress in the state were moved to Anambra State.

Nwosu, who briefly spoke at the state Police Command, said: We are trying to sort out some issues. There was a swap. The people that were supposed to conduct the congress in Imo were moved to Anambra and Anambra people moved to Imo. And we want them to properly hand over.”

Odigie-Oyegun absent as Edo hold peaceful congresses

The congresses were peaceful across the 192 wards of Edo after the state harmonized the list of aspirants to avoid a rancorous exercise.

However, there was tension in Egor Local Government Area as it was alleged that the council chairperson, Eghe Ogbemudia, held a parallel congress after the leaders of the council including former Deputy Governor of the state, Lucky Imasuen, and the leader of the party in the council, Crosby Eribo, had agreed on the list of ward executives.

Party members adopted the consensus method through affirmation and the exercise started at about 10am to elect the ward chairmen, secretaries, treasurer and other party executives at that level across the state.

At Ikpoba Okha, home town of the Secretary to Edo state Government, Osarodion Ogie, and the member representing Ikpoba Okhai/ Egor Federal Constituency, Mr Johnson Agbonayinma, the leaders described the exercise as ¨very peaceful and orderly and we hope those we have elected will ensure the progress of the party at that level”. They added: “We are very optimistic as we head towards 2019¨.

Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu said: ¨Edo is a role model and we are very organized and peaceful. Our eyes are all on the ball and it is that spirit that is pushing all of us. We did it under peaceful atmosphere, it is a family meeting to choose one of us. We came out in that spirit of a family and had a family meeting and it worked out as a family under the able leadership of Mr Governor and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.

And that is why we want Comrade to go and replicate what we have in Edo state to other parts of the country as national chairman of the APC. We have leaders in the person of Governor Obaseki and Comrade Oshiomhole and that is the secret of the peaceful congresses we are having.”

Odigie-Oyegun’s absence

In Ward 2 Oredo, the Local Government Area of the National Chairman of the APC, Odigie-Oyegun, the APC boss was conspicuously absent in the exercise which was conducted by the Minister of State, Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, and monitored by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.

Hon. Patrick Obahiagbon, Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on National Assembly Matters and former Chief of Staff to the immediate past governor of the state, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who participated in the process at Ward 3 (Oredo council), said “We have long finished; the exercise went on peacefully and we adopted the consensus option, except in some areas where the process was contentious and they adopted full contest.”

Chairman of the party in the state, Anselm Ojezua, described the exercise as peaceful and ¨ very democratic.

Amaechi, Abe, others trade blames over secretariat invasion

Speaking on the invasion of the party secretariat in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, on Friday evening, Amaechi said: “What a governorship aspirant wants to do is that there should not be any congress. He took over the party secretariat with his loyalists till about 3pm that the police had to force themselves in for people to purchase forms for tomorrow’s congress”

The Transport Minister, apparently referring to Senator Magnus Abe, the only aspirant to have declared his governorship ambition under Rivers APC, added: “If that aspirant is popular, why not tell his supporters to go and purchase that form and go and contest the congress? I am grateful that people bought forms and I hope his supporters also bought forms, because tomorrow, ward congresses will hold.

“They say police were there when the offices of the APC were destroyed. It is not true there were policemen sent anywhere, rather it was the police that were invited by the party for protection of the party secretariat and to disperse the people brought to disrupt the purchase of forms”.

Responding on the allegation, Abe said: “It is Amaechi that is afraid of election. That is why he is causing problems. I did not mobilise thugs to Rivers State secretariat of APC. The people at APC’s secretariat were Amaechi’s miscreants. I am a man of integrity”.

The senator called on President Buhari and other leaders of APC to ensure free, fair and credible congresses in the party.

Parallel congress in Kano

Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and his supporters held parallel ward congresses across Kano State.

Media aide to the senator, Hajiya Binta Spikin, told Sunday Vanguard that the group had purchased forms in line with the directives of the national leadership of the party and subsequently conducted it’s ward congress.

The development followed a similar congress conducted by the mainstream All Progressives Congress (APC) across the 484 wards of the 44 local government area of the state that led to the emergence of 1188 delegates.

Acting Chairman of APC in Kano, Engr. Bashir Yahaya Karaye, told journalists at the party secretariat that the exercise monitored by national officer was free and fair .

No imposition of candidates in Katsina – C’ttee Chair

Chairman, Ward Congress Committee in Katsina State and the Deputy National Treasurer of the APC, Mohammed Tanko Zakari, said no candidate was imposed in the state adding that all candidates in the 361 wards across the 34 local government areas were given a level-playing ground and in areas “where there are no contest, we had the permission of the national headquarters to conduct our congress via consensus”.

Peaceful conduct in Bayelsa

A former governor of Bayelsa State and leader of the APC in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, commended party faithful for their peaceful conduct during the ward congresses in the state.

Sylva, who stated this during a brief interaction with newsmen in Yenagoa, said the party in the state has disappointed many who had hoped that the congresses would be marred by violence.

Loyalists of Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun who were elected in 2014, were unanimously returned unopposed as elected chairmen in the 236 wards of the state.

All Progressives Congress (APC) ward congresses held in the 236 wards across Ogun State .

Sunday Vanguard learned that Governor Ibikunle Amosun had directed that where there is consensus among party leaders about candidates seeking election into party executive offices, the affected candidates should be returned in a unanimous decision instead of resorting to time -consuming voting process.

The Ward Congress Committee Chairman, Alhaji Bashir Sheriff, who coordinated the exercise expressed satisfaction with the outcome.

Controversy in Kaduna

The ward congresses were mirred in controversy in Kaduns as the absence of party officials and unilateral conduct of ward elections by non party officials held sway.

Sunday Vanguard’s checks indicated that election did not take place in I2 wards in Igabi. The wards are Kwarau, Turunku, igabi, Fanshanu, Gwaraji, Zango Aya, Afaka, Kirawa, Birnin Yero, Rigassa, Sabon Birnin.

Parallel exercise in Enugu

Chieftains of the APC, in Enugu State, yesterday, hailed the peaceful and hitch-free conduct of ward congresses of the party in the 260 political wards of the state. Those who hailed the exercise included former governor of old Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo and former Senate President, Senator Ken Nnamani.

However, there were parallel congresses in most of the areas monitored by newsmen.

At Eke Ward in Udi local government area, the parallel congresses were peaceful, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama leading the majority, while the Director General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, Mr. Osita Okechukwu led the parallel faction.

In most of the wards elections were based on consensus while in others, they were unable to reach compromise, even as Option A4 type of open balloting was adopted for the polls.

The Foreign Affairs Minister, Onyeama who spoke to newsmen, described the congress as peaceful and transparent just as he remarked that the process as the national congress officials from Abuja absconded with electoral materials.

Bloody clash in Oyo

The crisis started during the preparation for the conduct of the party’s ward congress.

While the crisis lasted, dangerous weapons like bottles were freely used as supporters of the Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi and the Minister of Communication, Mr Adebayo Shittu clashed.

There has been cold war between the governor and the minister over who controls the party.

It took prompt intervention of heavily armed security agencies to prevent the crisis from escalating.

Expectedly, there were accusations and counter accusations on which of the factions that triggered the quarrel.

According to information gathered, supporters of Adebayo Shitu and some aggrieved party members who had been seated at the venue were reportedly forced to vacate their seats. This led to some rowdy situation.

Shortly after, dangerous weapons were flying in the air and sporadic gunshots rent the atmosphere.

After sometime, the committee later succeeded in bringing all the factions together and after consultation with them, it was resolved that the ward congress be postponed to today.

Congresses hitch-free, Appeal Panels Report in states Monday – APC

Meanwhile, the National hierarchy of the APC, yesterday said the ward congresses were hitch-free but in line with its guidelines, its appeal committees would report in all the states tomorrow.

Speaking on the exercise, he said: “Generally, everything went on fine. We did not have a situation or any report from any part of the country that there was a problem. Where any of our guidelines have been infringed on, the aggrieved candidate would send a petition to the appeal committee in that state, because we cannot be everywhere.

The committees will report in the states on Monday. It is the appeal committees that would now sit on the petitions and submit their findings or recommendations to the National Working Committee NWC”, he said.","APC crises fester: One killed; Oyegun, Dogara, Kwankwaso boycott ward congresses",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/apc-crises-fester-one-killed-oyegun-dogara-kwankwaso-boycott-ward-congresses/
23,nigeria,"Nollywood actress, Genevieve Nnaji, says Nigerians who criticize Alex for her relationship with former housemate, Tobi were responsible for her popularity.

Genevieve, who seems to be in support of Alex, took to her Instagram to describe the ex-BBNaija housemate as ‘a queen.’

She further called on her followers to watch out for Alex and urged them to learn how to love and accept other people the way they are.

The actress, who posted a picture of Alex on her Instagram page, wrote thus, “Tag her if you know her. The more you criticize her, the more popular you make her. Ask the disciples; the more the Jews criticized them the more people followed them.

“Learn how to love people the way they are. She is a queen! Watch the space #genevievennaji.”

The Tolex pair had been seen at different events lately with matching outfits since they got out of the reality show.

24,nigeria,"At a time Nigeria’s total non-oil export is less than $2 billion, Bangladesh, once among the poorest countries in the world, is raking in $28 billion just from textile export.

Bangladesh’s oil is the textile industry, which accounts for over 70 percent of export revenue and 13 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.

One big reason why Bangladesh got its textile industry right was policy.

Bangladesh is reputed for having more investor-friendly policies than many of its neighbours and has cheaper skilled labour. According to Reuters, the country has tax-free access to 37 countries, including the European Union, Canada and Australia. This is different from Nigeria, which has continued to get its trade polices wrong and serially adopts protectionist policies that make free trade hard.

In fact, around 2011, Bangladesh wooed some investors in Pakistan, who discovered that it was easier to do business in the country.

After liberation in 1972, Bangladesh had opted for a socialistic economic policy by nationalising all big industries, including large textile mills, according to Mazharul Islam Kiron, textile consultant and researcher.

However, the country took a more capitalistic view of development by not only opting for a market-oriented economic policy but also handing over these mills to the private sector in phases.

This signalled a breakthrough in the industry, which today provides 4.5 to five million jobs for the people of the country.

The country today is an export-oriented economy, thriving on cotton and ready-made garments.

Last year, Bangladesh came up with a textile policy, targeted at expanding the export market.

One of the focal points of the policy is to strengthen the primary textile sector to fulfil the local demand of textiles and promote a medium and high value added export oriented garments industry.

Knitting industries in the country are self-sufficient. Bangladesh and Nigeria have things in common. The country has 163 million people and Nigeria’s population is 193 million. Two, both countries have energy challenges, with shortage of gas hurting many factories in Bangladesh. Nigeria too is hard hit by high energy cost, which raises expenditure of many manufacturers. However, Bangladesh has found a better way to manage its gas and electricity shortages.

More so, some raw materials needed by the textile industry are still imported, just like in Nigeria. This is draining the country’s foreign exchange just as it does in Nigeria. Local manufacturers in Nigeria constantly scramble for dollars with which to import inputs.

Both are also low middle-income countries.

However, the big difference is in the area of policy and business environment.

Bangladesh has a strong spinning, weaving, power loom, knitting, dyeing and finishing industries. Today, many factories are drooling to set up plants in the country to enjoy economies of scale.

Nigeria was a hub of textile manufacturing in 1970s and 1980s with companies such as Asaba Textile Mills, Aba Textile Mills, Kaduna Textile Mills, Afprint Nigeria Plc and Enpee Industries, among others, now rested, owing to unbridled smuggling of Asian textiles, high cost of energy, poor patronage, as well as lack of cotton to feed the mills.

There is a N100 billion Cotton, Textile and Garment Fund by government but players say funding is not the major challenge. Much of this fund has been disbursed yet the industry is at its lowest ebb.

According to the Textile Manufacturers Association, about 85 percent of the $1.4 billion worth of textiles that flood the country’s market is smuggled, mainly from neighbouring countries.

“What we need is the enabling environment. We cannot compete with the level of smuggling and counterfeiting going on now. We used to have about 127 textile firms in Nigeria but that has come down to two or three now,” said Grace Adereti, president of the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA) in Lagos, at a Made-in-Nigeria stakeholders’ meeting recently.

“We had the revival loans but this didn’t work because our biggest problem has never been money,” Adereti said.

About 60 percent capacity utilisation was achieved in Nigeria’s textile industry in 1996, but this deteriorated to 28 percent in 2002.

The textile industry today is worse than it was in 2002 as only African Textile Manufacturers (ATM) Limited, Angel Spinning and Dyeing Limited, and Spinners and Dyers Nigeria Limited can be called textile firms. In fact, industry sources say only two are in operation. Even at that, fabrics production makes up less than 30 percent of their business. Most of what is called textile firms today are fashion designers. This does not constitute full-fledged manufacturing.

“It is inconceivable how a textile sector that is so viciously exposed to smuggling hawks can survive and grow, unless there are deliberately put-in-place measures to protect the industry,” a research report conducted by Martin Ike-Muonso, a professor, on ‘Discriminatory Margins of Preferences for Selected Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) Sectors’ said.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

The humanitarian crisis in Nigeria’s north-east remains one of the most severe in the world today. In 2017, there were 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the worst conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The crisis is considered a protection crisis first and foremost, that is closely linked to food scarcity and insecurity and high levels of need for basic life-saving assistance and services. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of a conflict that has led to widespread forced displacement and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

In March 2017, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2349, strongly condemning all terrorist attacks, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses by Boko Haram and ISIL, and urged all parties to the conflict to ensure respect for and protection of humanitarian personnel, facilities, and their means of transport and equipment, and to facilitate safe, timely and unhindered access for humanitarian oganisations to deliver life-saving aid to affected people.

Protection concerns

Protection of civilians was a key priority for humanitarians in 2017. Women, men and children faced grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, over 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of women and girls abducted and, in 2017, over 110 children were used as so-called “suicide” bombers. Toward the latter half of 2017, a surge in attacks by non-state armed groups claimed dozens of lives and injured countless others.

Internal displacement and returns

In 2017, more than 1.6 million people were internally displaced in the three worst crisis-affected states – with 80 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Borno State, the epicentre of the crisis. Over half live outside of IDP camps in local communities. Freedom of movement of all IDPs, including refugee returnees, was limited by continued security threats in areas such as Banki, Pulka, Bama, Gwoza, Ngala and Damasak. Nonetheless, 1.3 million people returned home in 2017, indicating that conditions in some locations had improved. Meanwhile, an estimated 930,000 people remain in hard-to-reach areas and humanitarian actors were not able to assess their situation, or to provide them with aid.

Food insecurity and malnutrition

By the end of the year, the risk of famine had been averted in north-east Nigeria in locations where humanitarians had access. The number of people estimated to be facing food insecurity reduced from 5.2 million during June to August 2017 to 2.6 million during October to December 2017³. This improvement was due to (i) improved security conditions that allowed for farming activities in locations that were previously not safe and an upturn in market and trade activity; (ii) delivery of food and livelihood support to almost 3 million people every month (including 2 million per month with just food assistance) since the start of the year; and (iii) favourable climatic conditions for farming.

An estimated 450,000 children under the age of five suffered from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in 2017. SAM kits were provided to over 30 stabilisation centres to treat more than 7,000 children suffering from SAM with medical complications, and over 150 health professionals from the Health Ministry and NGOs were trained on in-patient management of SAM. The integration of the provision of safe drinking water, adequate sanitation services and safer food and hygiene practices into nutrition activities were required to improve the health of people in need and help combat malnutrition.

Disease outbreaks, including malaria and cholera

A highly vulnerable population, consisting largely of children (58 per cent), continued to be at high risk of disease outbreaks since routine vaccinations, e.g., polio and measles, had been interrupted for many years, . Two thirds of the health facilities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states were damaged by the conflict. The continuous influx of returnees and overcrowding of camps continued to increase the risk of outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than half of recorded deaths in Borno State were due to malaria, more than all other causes of death combined.

Finally, the cholera outbreak that was declared in mid-August 2017 in Borno State, was brought under control following a solid collaboration between health partners and water, sanitation and hygiene partners, and a cholera vaccination campaign in the most at-risk areas of Borno State which reached more than 900,000 people. By the time the epidemic was declared over in December 2017, there had been over 5,300 recorded cases and 61 deaths.

Access and security

The humanitarian access and security situation in the northeast remains challenging for humanitarian partners and has had significant implications on relief operations in 2017.

The north-east of Nigeria, especially Borno State, has experienced a significant increase in military operations in the second half of the year which have resulted in major civilian displacement, access restrictions along main routes and security incidents in previously secure areas.

The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) estimates that around 85 per cent of the target population (5.2 million people) can be reached with aid while an estimated 930,000 people remain in areas that are hard to reach for UN agencies and international NGOs. In Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, three local government areas (LGAs) are currently completely inaccessible for UN and international NGO humanitarian services, whereas 26 are partially accessible and 37 are fully accessible.

All of the three inaccessible and the majority of the partially accessible (19) LGAs are located in Borno State. Due to the lack of access of humanitarian partners to these areas, the identification of potential needs as well as independent context and security assessments have largely not been possible.",Nigeria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
26,nigeria,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains massive in scale due to ongoing hostilities: 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains concerning as conflict contin- ues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and some 3.0 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Large-scale displacements continue to take place every month with 21,807 new arrivals to various locations in March alone. In addition, close to 930,000 remain in areas hard to reach for international aid organisations, mostly in Borno State.",North-east Nigeria: Humanitarian Dashboard (January - March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-dashboard-january-march-2018
