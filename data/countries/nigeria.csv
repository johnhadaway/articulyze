The lingering crisis affecting the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) has taken a new dimension as the Nigerian Copyright Commission has suspended its operating licence.

Coson’s Head, Corporate Affairs, Chibueze Okereke, confirmed the development in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Friday.

According to him, COSON’s lawyers headed by Uche Val Obi (SAN) are challenging NCC’s ruling at the court of appeal.

An entertainment lawyer, Akinyemi Ayinoluwa, had earlier shared the news on his official Instagram page on Friday.

Mr Ayinoluwa posted a copy of the ruling, which was ‘authorised’ by the minister of justice, Abubakar Malami.

According to the new ruling, COSON is no longer authorised under law to collect royalties on behalf of and for musicians and other performing artists in Nigeria.

The Commission is the government agency empowered by law to oversee the affairs of COSON and other agencies under its supervision.

This comes after a petition written by artiste, 2face Idibia to the Commission asking it to wade into the crisis at COSON between its chairman Tony Okoroji and Efe Omorogbe.

Efe Omorogbe continues to insist that he is the recognised chairman of COSON.

Some members of the commission’s board installed Mr Omorogbe as the new chairman, having legally recalled Mr Okoroji from his position as chairman of COSON. This happened in December.

The former was replaced over allegations of impropriety.

It was alleged that Mr Okoroji collects 10 per cent commission on licensing income deemed to have been brought in by him and primarily, because he contracts COSON projects and events to his company, TOPS Limited.

Despite Mr Omorogbe’s election, Mr Okoroji was reinstated as the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting of COSON, held on December 19.

A faction of the board loyal to Mr Okoroji reinstated him and sacked those who voted for Mr Omorogbe.

The crisis got messier in April as police from Zone II Command Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, arraigned Mr Omorogbe before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for alleged impersonation and forgery.

According to the prosecuting officer, Friday Mameh, the defendants (Mr Omorogbe and others) had stormed the meeting of venue of the COSON chairman, with thugs on December 7, 2017 and conducted themselves (in a manner) likely to cause breach of peace.

Mr Mameh alleged that Mr Omorogbe and others forged the COSON letter-headed papers, “with intent to defraud, knowingly use the forged COSON letter headed with intent that it may in anyway be used or acted upon as genuine whether in Nigeria or elsewhere to the prejudice of COSON.”

Mr Omorogbe and others pleaded not guilty.

Their counsel, S. Ehiwelele and Chibuzor Nwankobi had prayed the court to admit them to bail on liberal terms.",COSON Crisis: NCC suspends copyright society’s operating license,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/267313-coson-crisis-ncc-suspends-copyright-societys-operating-license.html
1,nigeria,"At the end of April 2018, President Trump met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. It was a very important meeting as President Buhari was the first president from sub-Saharan Africa to visit President Trump at the White House. President Trump was reportedly very interested in the conflict between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria’s Middle Belt. President Trump has caused outcry for the sympathy he has expressed for the Christian farmers targeted by the Fulani herdsmen. However, such criticism may have been ignorant. Indeed, President Trump may not be wrong on the Fulani herdsmen crisis in Nigeria.

The Fulani herdsmen, also known as the Fulani militia, are a semi-nomadic, pastoralist ethnic group living in the central regions of Nigeria, predominately in the Middle Belt. The majority of the Fulani herdsmen are Muslim. They have clashed with indigenous tribes and local, mainly Christian, farmers over grazing land over the centuries. However, as Open Doors explains, the clashes intensified around the time of the 2011 and 2015 elections, and again earlier this year. The regions most affected by the violence include the areas of Jama’a, Kachia, Kagarko, Kaura and Sanga in southern Kaduna.

The atrocities perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen include the destruction of houses and churches, as well as the seizure of land and properties belonging to Christian owners. Reports have also emerged of the Fulani herdsmen ‘kidnapping Christian schoolgirls to marry them to Muslim men.’ In its 2015 report, Open Doors lists detailed examples of such targeted attacks. The report rebuts the argument that the clashes were caused by environmental degradation and resulting migration. The report presents a more comprehensive picture incorporating some elements of religious persecution. Indeed, the conflict is extremely complex.

Despite this, according to BBC, President Buhari was reportedly quick to deflect the issues stating that ‘The problem of cattle herders is a very long historical problem. Before now, cattle herders were known to carry sticks and machetes… but these ones are carrying AK-47s.’ If this is the case, the question is then, what the Nigerian government is doing to resolve the ongoing conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers; investigate the crimes and prosecute the perpetrators; investigate the supply chain of AK-47s; consider the potential religious component to the conflict; and assist all victims of the conflict?

While President Buhari is often praised for his fight against deeply rooted corruption in Nigeria and his pro-active approach to the atrocities committed by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria (although some of these pro-active steps are currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court), the conflict in the Middle Belt does not appear to gain the government’s attention or trigger decisive actions. This is of particular importance because of the militarization of the Fulani herdsmen and because of similar violence against Christian minorities in northern Nigeria (although conducted by a different actor). Considering the widespread use of AK-47’s by Fulani herdsmen, greater action from the Nigerian government would be expected. This is of increased importance in light of yet more news that Nigeria is home to over 350 million illegal weapons. Furthermore, the religious component cannot be neglected. Open Doors reported that between 2006 and 2014, 9,000 - 11,500 Christians were killed and over 13,000 churches destroyed in northern Nigeria. Those numbers are not insignificant and the effect of such targeted atrocities cannot be ignored. Indeed, the destruction of 13,000 churches is likely to have affected close to 1.3 million Christians in the region and do adversely affected their right to practice their religion as well as marginalised the group as a whole.

Refreshing or ignorant, many may not agree with President Trump’s bold delivery of his opinions. In case of the issue of the Fulani herdsmen, their attacks on farmers in the Middle Belt and the continued ignorance of the Nigerian government, it is such controversial statements which may trigger the needed change (as per political pressure). The situation in the Middle Belt requires urgent attention and decisive actions. President Buhari’s dismissive approach is not justified.",Trump May Not Be Wrong On the Fulani Herdsmen Crisis In Nigeria,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/04/trump-may-not-be-wrong-on-the-fulani-herdsmen-crisis-in-nigeria/
2,nigeria,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains massive in scale due to ongoing hostilities: 1.6 million persons remain internally displaced in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains concerning as conflict contin- ues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and some 3.0 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). Insecurity continues to pose major challenges in delivering assistance, especially with the dry season enabling an intensification of hostilities between the Nigerian armed forces and non-state armed groups. Large-scale displacements continue to take place every month with 21,807 new arrivals to various locations in March alone. In addition, close to 930,000 remain in areas hard to reach for international aid organisations, mostly in Borno State.",North-east Nigeria: Humanitarian Dashboard (January - March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-dashboard-january-march-2018
3,nigeria,"Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, who just returned from a vacation abroad, interacted with some journalists at the Banquet Hall of the Benue Peoples House. He spoke on various issues affecting the state, including the killings, salary concerns and privatisation process in the state. HEMBADOON ORSAR was there for LEADERSHIP Sunday.

While you were away, the coordinator of the Livestock Guards was arrested by security agents over his suspicious links with the Boko Haram insurgent group allegedly carrying out killings in Benue State. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the arrest of the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore for making threats to attack the state and carrying out same, what’s your take on this?

I believe that what has a beginning must also have an end, so I believe that very soon, we will have cause to smile because the Federal Government too is deeply concerned about what is happening and the steps it has taken in the last few days will definitely bring an end to this siege that we are in. Now to your question, let me say that as a law abiding governor and someone who believes in the rule of law, I will always support due process. Security agencies are at liberty to arrest, detain and investigate anyone, who they may suspect to be involved in security breach or perpetuating insecurity. The arrest of Tershaku is one of such and as for me as I always do, and you are all witnesses to the fact that when it comes to issues of security and prosecution, I don’t interfere. I have made a statement through my assistant after his arrest that due process should be followed; he should not be victimized but security men should be fair to him. He should be investigated and if at the end he is found culpable, he should be prosecuted. When my adviser was suspected of murder and a commissioner was also a suspect in a murder case I asked them to resign. Although they were not convicted, I said for the purpose of credibility of this government they needed to give way and they gave way. They had to resign. You are also aware that even when one of my appointees was convicted, I asked him to resign. Later though, he appealed the decision of the lower court and was exonerated and is now a free man. If I have another opportunity I will appoint him again. So I don’t want to talk about the arrest other than to say let the needful be done; let there be no victimization. If at the end, an investigation is carried out and he is culpable, let that be.

On Miyetti Allah, I am also dumbfounded. I have said it repeatedly; I have written and will continue to write and continue to raise alarm that the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore are responsible for the killings; for the mercenary work that is going on in Benue State. I still want to repeat that they are responsible. There are evidences; they are on tape, they have done press conferences and none of them have come out to refute what was credited to them in the media. They have said it is about Jihad; it is not about grazing. They said it is about occupation; about taking over the land. They have said it and the evidences are there. I have presented this to security agencies and I want to believe that it is a whole process; they are still working on it and at the appropriate time, these people will be apprehended because they cannot go free. After killing my people, they wll not be allowed to go free. I will continue to say it that these people must be arrested because they are responsible for killings in the state. The evidences are there; very clear for anyone who may wants to see . Beside that what we have decided to do as a government since there is no response yet, to initiate criminal proceedings against the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore in court. I have been briefed that the case is coming up on Thursday at a High Court in Makurdi. We are beginning with the 73 victims of the New Year day attacks and several others will follow. I believe that the court will definitely give us justice. These people are not going to be allowed to go free; justice must be served to us. Those people who think that Ortom is making too much noise should please help me so that justice will be given to me and my people. That is all that I seek and nothing more than that. By the time you do that I will keep quiet, I will not say anything again.

While you were away, some of your security aides were transferred. But prior to their transfer, you alleged that there were threats to your life. Do you agree with those who are already linking this action to a plot to eliminate you?

Now, about the transfer of my immediate security personnel attached to me by the Police. Of course, I was on vacation and I also heard and saw it, but I did complain through the Commissioner of Police here in Makurdi that this was not right. In the whole country, you have the right, as governor, to select your immediate security personnel that work with you, and I think the attention of the authority of the Nigerian Police was drawn to this and it was corrected the following day. So to me, whether it was made in error or by mischief or whatever means, the important thing is that it was corrected and today, all my aides are with me because I also saw the letter that was written that cases of transfer of Police officers, as far as Benue State was concerned, should be suspended indefinitely and I have all my aides. So I don’t want to read meanings into that for now. As you’re aware, I have to cut my leave short and come back and I resumed today, so if there are any other things, I wll still let you know but for now, an error was done which I drew the attention of the management of the Nigerian Police to and it has been corrected. So that is where we are.

We want to know the steps the state government is taking to prevent further attacks on Benue communities by the invaders.

Since the invasion from January, we’ve not rested. As governor, my deputy and members of the executive council and of course, as members of the security council in Benue State, we have been working very hard; we have been very proactive because we have agents in the 276 council wards, in the 23 local governments and we have been meeting very frequently to assess and analyse the situation with security agencies in the state. And to complement the security agencies, we have also empowered the Vigilante and Livestock Guards to complement what they do. And we have identified all those flash points that these invaders come and attack our people and we have adequately made presentations to the Federal Government and as I speak to you, there is already a reinforcement going on by all security agencies to ensure that we are able to surmount this challenges especially of attacking our people because Mr President, in my last discussion with him, was deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis that we are facing today in Benue State. A committee was set up to assess the damage and to see how these IDPs can be rehabilitated to go back to their various communities. But one thing that was identified was that areas that were attacked were not yet safe and while the committee was going round, despite the fact that they had adequate security personnel with them, they were also attacked in several places and thank God, the security personnel were able to repel all the attacks that came upon them and no one was hurt till they finished their assignment and went back.

So Mr President had indicated that he wants a rehabilitation of these homes because even when they go back, how are they going to stay in these places?

So we raised the issue of security in these areas and he did assure us and I have seen the sign. As at today, some of the personnel, the top senior people are already in the state and the Chief of Army Staff is visiting himself just to try to also address this matter. All the security apparatus are augmenting their personnel to help curtail these attacks and I believe that within the shortest possible time, it will be done. Of course, you know that though I am “Chief Security Officer,” of the state I don’t have the authority backing me to order the police or soldiers, that is why we will continue to ask for state police to ensure they are adequately trained and equipped to have the capacity to take care of the security of the state. But for now, it is the responsibility of the federal government. They too, they have their deficiencies in terms of capacity, numbers, equipment, funding and this is why I will continue to call on my people to continue to support them because the insurgency that is going on, as at today, out of the 23 local governments, you hardly count five local governments that are not under siege. So you can see the enormous challenges. So there are several ways that individuals, groups, communities can come in to support. We have the Vigilante Group, we have Livestock Guards but these are not armed people so it becomes very difficult and when it comes to funding, you discover that the security personnel in the state are grossly underfunded and ill equipped. We need to support them. Where individuals or groups or corporate organisations have that kind of support, you can pass through government, you can pass through anybody or to them directly by way of mobility, funding or whatever that can be available to support the security agents to work. On our part, we’re working very hard and that is why I had to reschedule my trip to come back earlier than I had planned because of the continued attacks. So I’m here putting heads with the deputy governor and other members of council and security agencies and I believe that this will definitely have an end. The efforts of the security agencies looking beyond the issue of grazing is also a welcome development. I think by the grace of God, we will soon surmount this challenges.

What’s your reaction to the military invasion in Naka. Will Benue seek redress?

I condemn the invasion in its totality, it is unwarranted. I must also condemn the killing of the army personnel in Naka and that was why my deputy who was then the acting governor, swiftly took action by directing the chairman of the local government and the traditional rulers of the Gwer West Local Government to ensure that the perpetrators were arrested and brought to justice. And this was done. Even while I was away, I was keenly following up until these suspects were handed over to the Commanding Officer of 72 battalion; and so the action of government was very clear. Five people were arrested and brought, it was not the military that arrested them or police. The chairman of the Local Government and the traditional council came together and arrested these people and handed them over. And so there was no basis whatsoever for an invasion.

We have reported this to the Chief of Army Staff and he has already directed an inquiry to be made and they assured me that anyone found wanting will be dealt with according to the laws and so I am waiting for the outcome. I don’t want to preempt what will be but this is not right and I will continue to tell our people that criminality in all its forms is not allowed. Reprisal or revenge of any kind will not be accepted by this government. We are a government that believes in the fear of God and God respects human sanctity and it is important that whatever happens, blood should not be shed even when you are attacked, reprisal is not the solution, it is not the answer. The answer is the rule of law. That is the only thing that can guarantee safety for all. When you allow lawlessness to prevail you are calling for anarchy; and when there is anarchy no one will ever be safe. And you don’t know the extent that will take us to. So at all times we must be law abiding. The security agencies are there, don’t think that they are slow. Justice may not be gotten that same day but if you follow due process, justice will definitely be gotten. And I want to encourage our people to at all times appreciate this. And so until we have the report of the Chief of Army Staff then we will know exactly what other steps we are going to take.

The National Economic Council (NEC) prohibited open grazing in only five states including Benue. Don’t you think the Benue Anti-open grazing law should be adopted and enforced nationwide?

You know that Nigeria is a federation comprising of 36 states and Abuja. And of course, the 36 states are federating units and these units are independent of each other. The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandated each federating unit to make laws for good governance of their citizens. This is what we did as far as this law is concerned. You’re aware that this challenge between herdsmen and farmers in Benue State and other parts of the country preceded the current administration whether at the federal level or in Benue State. The steps we took were to forestall crisis finally for farmers and herdsmen and we remain committed to this in Benue State. We cannot talk about any other state. But I must congratulate the Benue people, I must congratulate all of you – the media for standing with us in defence of this law. You appreciate the fact that since May 22, 2017 when we signed the bill into law, it became so contentious. There were several schools of thought and several agitations from several quarters.

So for the NEC, coming to adopt that, truly, ranching is the right way to go, for us in Benue State, it is congratulations to all of us and we appreciate God. And for other states adopting this, it is left for them to decide. There are various Houses of Assembly, there are various governors and the processes of making laws for their good governance. Mind you, out of the 36 states, we have our peculiarities. What is peculiar to me here may be different from my colleague here in Nasarawa, Ebonyi and other states. So it is now left for them to decide if they so wish. We have always said that the prohibition of open grazing in Benue State is a product of the people themselves. You were all here and you saw that in the process of making this law, the people were in a hurry to the extent that Benue State House of Assembly was occupied more than three times. And you had people coming, old women, young and so on coming in, to protest and ensure that this law was enacted. So the Assembly was not spared. Several times, the people came and occupied the Assembly. So even as I speak to you today, before I went on vacation, I had cause to tour the IDP camps. I visited the eight of them and in spite of the hardship and the pains that the IDPs were going through, in each of the camps, I did pose a question “do we find a way of repealing this law?” and unanimously they said no, they believe that this is the way to go. From the old women, the old men, the young men and girls and even children.

They were all unanimous, so for me, it is a plus to us for NEC to have taken that decision. I commend the wisdom of the Vice President by setting up that committee that went out to assess the situation and the entire members of NEC coming to adopt this. Like the northern Governors, some weeks ago met in Kaduna and adopted that ranching remains the only option to stop the challenges of herdsmen, farmers crisis. Like they did say, by 2050, the total population of Nigeria by projection would be 415 million and if we have approximately, 200 million and we are having this challenge, by the time we double that population, where are we going to be? Where would you have the land for open grazing? So I commend NEC for taking this bold decision. Individual states are at liberty to decide what is good for them. I am aware that sometime ago, my colleague in Kano State called on all herdsmen to go to Kano that they have enough land for them to do open grazing. That is the kind of thing that I am talking about. For us here, it is impossible because we don’t have the land; our land is for crop production, which is the main occupation of our people. Even within our population here, that land is not enough for farming. So I appreciate God that ranching remains the best global practice It is what is obtainable in India and other parts of Asia, in Europe and in America. In fact, it may interest you to know that the total herd of cattle we have in Nigeria is estimated to be less than 20 million. But you have over 200 million in India; you have over 250 million in Brazil; you have over 300 million in America and they all ranch and you don’t hear about farmers, herdsmen clashing at any time. So, ranching is the right way to go. I commend NEC and I believe that with this position of NEC we will finally have peace. Those insurgents that are still going about killing our people are not out for cattle business or cattle rearing. They are out for a different agenda and we are not going to allow that agenda manifest in Benue State.

How did you spend your leave?

It wasn’t a pleasant leave because travelling to far away China where you have seven hours ahead of Nigerian time I had jetlag. So it was difficult to sleep and you dose when you are not expected. There was a lot of distortion in my sleep. To follow that was the continued attacks and invasion of our land. With the advent of the internet and the social media whatever was happening here I was also following up. Those horrific pictures and those scenes and the news about the killings; it was no longer leave and I wished I had not gone on leave because there was no more leave. Again following up with the Acting Governor and security agents to ensure that we do not reduce the state into a state of anarchy where restive youths were ready to take laws into their own hands. It was not an easy task. And so even while on leave, I could not sleep with my two eyes closed. Even when I slept, instead of having sweet dreams, there were bad dreams. The picture of what will happen and what had happened. It was not a pleasant one but I pray that this matter will be put behind us so that we can go about our normal businesses.

What decisions did your party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, reach at caucus meeting yesterday? How are you responding to alleged moves by some people to stop you and your supporters from influencing the party’s structure in the forthcoming congresses?

The decision at the caucus meeting was very simple because the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party has made things easier for all members of APC in Benue State. There is the guide that was given by the NEC of the party that congresses should be conducted which are elective from ward to local government and then state. Early June, we will be conducting the national convention where we will elect new set of party officers to man the party from the ward to the national level. So there is no cause for alarm. The caucus of yesterday was briefed on this development and the change in date. Instead of the earlier May 2, slated for starting the congresses, it will start on the 5th at the ward to be followed on the 12th with local government and state on the 19th.

Then it will be followed by the convention in early June. So the guidelines are very clear. It is an elective congress that will be conducted but the current officers were given waiver by NEC to be allowed, instead of resigning 30 days to the day of those Congresses if they wished to re-contest, they are free to remain in such offices until Congresses are done. And through consensus, we can arrive at these officers but where a consensus can not be reached, there is going to be an election which will usher in new set of leaders. But where we have challenges, we will revert to the original arrangement of the extension of such offices for members of the executive within that ward, local government, state or at the national level until further notice and so this was what was resolved. The second question as to my people being shut out of participating in the Congresses. It’s just an insinuation, it has no basis, we are working together as a party. APC is one party in Benue State. We have no factions. We discuss as a family and we have resolved all issues that emanated as a result of some agitations from some members which is normal. Politics is about interest, so when you are two, you may have diverse interests so when you are more than two, when you have over four million people putting their heads together, there will always be differences but we can always find a way of resolving it. Where we cannot, the constitution of the party is there and it will strictly be followed. One thing that we also resolved was that we will allow the constitution of the party to prevail on our activities. So there is no cause for alarm. I came into this party without structures and today I see no reason why I should be afraid after serving as governor for three years under this platform and every other person that has interest, if you follow due process, you will get there and of course you are aware that the electoral law has been reviewed in such a manner that except the constitution of the party is followed otherwise you are at risk. So there is no cause for alarm whatsoever, we are working together and the caucus meeting came out very well. We are going to discuss at various levels to ensure that either we retain the current leadership or we make some adjustments where necessary to strengthen the party and ensure that we are stronger as we march towards 2019.

There were rumours that the state government intends to sell some of the state industries to fund your reelection campaign, how true is it? And why do you want to sell moribund industries at this time?

The first question is how many moribund industries did I sell before becoming governor? I did not sell any industry but I became governor. Of course, you know that there’s a privatization law in place which mandates the government to look at these issues whether leasing or privatizing or outrightly selling them . This is a matter of the law. I did not initiate that law. It is a law that has been in place. What government is trying to do is to follow due process and follow the law. That is what we did and we decided that for a government that is transparent, there was need to allow the general public to know what we are doing that was why we went ahead and did that advertisement. This has been going on, it was done before. You know that Plastic Industry was concessioned to Oracle Business Ltd in 2013. Taraku Mills was concessioned to Growrich Nigeria Ltd and the other ones nobody came. Wannune Tomato factory, Benco Roof Tiles, Otukpo Burnt Bricks, and of course Teragro Company was also leased to Transcorp.

These were things that were done without even advertising them. So what is wrong in our decision to advertise it for people to know and also to participate?

Today as an industrialist I can tell you that technology has fast overgrown what you have in Taraku Mills. There are smaller automated industries that can produce the same quantity of what the present Taraku Mills can produce and you spend less in terms of cost of production than what you have. Technology of the 1970s, now we are in 2018. There’s no way you can compare the technology of 1970 to that of 2018 and since we came here, we have brought in about eight different companies both within the country and outside the country that indicated interest that they wanted to take over Taraku Mills but after due diligence, it is either they do not come back or indicated to us that it will be a waste of their resources to put into Taraku Mills. We know that the worth of the Tomato factory in Wannune is over N3 billion but because it was being wasted we decided to give it to an investor who came from the original manufacturer of the industry equipment in the sum of N600 million. Unfortunately, after one year the man did not show up again and so for us our intention is to ensure that we have functional industries not just keeping industries that are not adding value but rather are draining on the purse of government. We made it public for any person, whether you are an indigene, you can bid for it and we are going to give that at a concessionary rate so that our target is to ensure that we have people working in those factories. If you go to the Plastic industry today, because it was concessioned you have more than 400 people working in that place. This means 400 people have been taken off the streets. If you get Taraku Mills working, I believe that you will have more than 1000 people working in that place and you will be taking them off the streets of Benue State. If you have the Tomato factory working you will be taking over 100 people off the street. When Teragro was working though they have shut down for now, they are no longer producing, they took away more than 100 people off the streets of this state. The same thing with the other ones. Talk about Cassava Flour Mills, that one too is not working and so on. So the whole idea is to get investors who can inject new blood and resources to generate jobs, to create opportunities and wealth for our people so that we can process our primary products. All these industries are meant to generate their raw materials from local sources and of course I did not mention the yam plant in Katsina-Ala.

So these are the issues. We have every good intention and of course this government has no room for diverting government funds and so it can never be done. This is a privatization council that is manned by very reputable Nigerians and we are ready to account for anything when it comes. But you see, in Benue State whatever you do, politics comes in and so I am going to invite stakeholders to come and discuss the issue since it has generated a lot of issues out of nothing. But the truth is that the law on privatization was not initiated or enacted by me. I inherited it and we thought it is a good thing to allow these companies work, we will be better for it. So that is where we are, there is no point of diverting money, I don’t need fraudulent money to win election. I did not use such money to win in 2015. I will use the same strategy of trusting in God. I have always said that it is God that crowns, John 3:27 says a man can receive nothing if it is not given to him from above. I came here with no money but I got the victory and I believe that the second term will not be an exception. We will continue to work hard and we will also let the people know the facts as they are. Issues of salaries, I believe that a lot of things are hidden.

By the time the people of Benue State know the truth, they will appreciate better. Let me use this opportunity, and you can find out from your colleagues in other states, even the issue of salaries we have done our best. We know we have challenges but like I did promise since January, 2018 we have been able to pay salaries, February, March, even this April we will do everything under the sun to pay. The arrears at the state level of seven months, we will definitely pay and at the Local Government of 10 months we are also sourcing funds to pay. But it is also important to appreciate the fact that Benue State is paying the third highest salary in Nigeria. you will agree wit me that this is not sustainable for a state that depends on the civil service, for a state that the IGR is still low. How can, for God’s sake, Lagos that its budget is over a trillion naira, a director is receiving N320,000.

And Rivers, their budget is in billions more than triple what we get in Benue state, a director is receiving N285,000 and then how can Benue State be paying N280,000 to a director when in Kaduna, in Kano, in other states that are more viable than Benue State are receiving around N150,000 or less, when in Borno a director is receiving N75,000. Then Benue State is paying a director N280,00 and its goes down the line to the deputy director, assistant director to the least staff. So this is the challenge we have. It is not that we have diverted any money and so on. It is a challenge, we are aware of but we will continue to explain to the people and I believe that by the time they know the truth they will appreciate our position but we will do everything, whatever that has accumulated it is our desire that we make sure we pay so that no one will feel short changed. That is where we are. So there is no diversion of money anywhere. Whether we sell the industries or not it doesn’t matter, we will go ahead to prosecute our election. Because of the heat and the blackmail that the advert generated, we are going to call a stakeholders meeting to explain further and if the stakeholders decide to say that just leave the industries to die we are ready to do it. We are a democratically elected government and we must work with the people.

While you were on leave, were you able to strategize on new ways of improving your administration? What are you doing about the names of genuine staff which were removed by the Abounu salary verification committee?

Definitely the process of reorganising, re-strategizing and ensuring that you have better ways of operation is something that is continuous in government. We have done it before and we will continue to do it. We are assessing it and if the need arises, we will definitely do some reorganization to fit in with the challenges. There is no doubt about that. As for the staff who were omitted by the Engineer Abounu’s committee, I have already given a directive. Even as we sit here I have seen some of them so this will serve as an answer because if I leave here they may not see me. Some of them are here they want to see me. Some of my friends were also affected in the course of that screening but I have already given a directive that all the people that were omitted in the course of that assignment should be reinstated and their arrears paid to them . So all those whose names were omitted are also free to make their presentation to the committee and I can assure you that justice will be done. But like I said last year and I’m still emphasizing that the Bible says a worker deserves his wages.

That is why I did promise that 2018, whatever happens I will do everything possible under the sun to ensure that people receive their pay because I am also pained when people are crying out that there are no salaries. But at the same time those who do not work should also not eat. And so if you are not a worker and you are feeding fat on government you will not be allowed. It is better we conserve that fund and pay to genuine workers who are working. So it’s a continuous process. We have done the first phase, we are still going to look deeper and see those who are shortchanging government. There are people who are having multiple pay at the end of every month. There are people who are not working at all, but are receiving salaries at the end of every month. This kind of people we will still fish them out. There are people who are supposed to have retired but they are still collecting salaries . I will continue to fish them out. And of course bad eggs in the service, we are also going to identify them and flush them out so that we have a manageable wage bill that at the end of every month the local governments are able to get their pay, the state are also able to get their pay. This is what we are trying to do. If at the end of the day we are able to have a wage bill that is around a maximum of N4.5 billion for local governments and state, it will be manageable and at least every month we should have some resources to take care of some basic needs of government and even try to clear the arrears that we are already owing. So this is where we are.","Buhari, Deeply Concerned About Humanitarian Crisis In Benue – Ortom",https://leadership.ng/2018/05/06/buhari-deeply-concerned-about-humanitarian-crisis-in-benue-ortom/
4,nigeria,"Poverty is the greatest enemy of children in the northern Nigeria. It deprives them the opportunity of acquiring basic education. In a bid to turn the tide, development partners and some state governments have adopted an unconditional cash transfer scheme to woo girls to school. REGINA OTOKPA reports

From childhood, Aisha Mande has been living with a disability arising from an ailment suspected to be polio. From a tender age, her parents sent her unto the streets to join the league of beggars, an occupation predominantly found amongst most people living with disability in the Northern part of Nigeria.

Indigenes of Sokoto State specifically under Bodinga Local Government Area, Aisha’s family inclusive, can be categorised among poor families in the region.

They depend solely on the proceeds generated from the begging activities of the entire family on a daily basis. However, in 2014, fate took a different turn when the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), introduced the Cash Transfer Programme (CTP), an initiative geared towards increasing child school enrolment and attendance, especially among girls, in Sokoto and Niger states.

Captured in the CTP, Aisha and two other siblings of hers, were pencilled down to receive a minimum stipend of N5,000 (US $31) each, per term (3 terms per year) to pay for textbooks and other school-related costs to keep their children in school.

This intervention did not only remove Aisha and her siblings from the streets, they are presently attaining quality education and the socio-economic status of her family has changed forever, as begging has become a thing of the past.

Standing proudly to tell her story recently in Abuja and answering some basic academic questions put to her, Aisha now a Primary four pupil, told INSIDE ABUJA she is nursing a dream to become a health worker.

Aisha’s dream is already programmed for reality. She has received an all expenses paid scholarship to cover her education through to the tertiary level. “I used to use my disability to beg money from people.

The money I realise each day along with my siblings is what we use for our survival. One day, some people came to our house and said they will be giving my mother money for us to go to school.

That was how I stopped begging. “I am happy I am in school and I don’t have to beg anymore. Any day I don’t go to my grandmother’s house after school, I look after my mother’s shop where she sells local drinks.

I want to grow up and become a health worker, so that I can help those who are sick in my community and neighbouring communities,” she said Explaining how the CTP liberated her family from abject poverty, Aisha’s mother, Mrs Umaima Mande, said she used the remaining part of the money given to her children to purchase a second hand value fridge to run a local brewery in her community.

She produces a special brew of local drink which she sells at home and with the help of her children after the close of school each day. About four years ago, Aisha was one out of the millions of girls without access to basic education as a result of poverty.

The 2013 National Demographic Health Survey indicated that there are about 20 million adolescent girls in Nigeria with very low education. It further states that in Nigeria, 60 per cent of the 10.5 million children out of school were girls. According to UNICEF’s Chief Education Officer, Terry Durnnian, the chunk of this figure resides in Northern Nigeria.

Worried by the trend, UNICEF, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and local partners like the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), initiated an unconditional cash transfer Scheme to boost assess, retention and learning among students, especially girls within the ages of 6 to 15.

Presently, no fewer than 65,056 students both male and females have been enrolled in basic schools in some northern states. The first phase of the programme, which was piloted in Sokoto and Niger states resulted in the enrollment of 23,665 girls. According to Durnnian, since the inception of the CTP, the enrollment of girls in Niger and Sokoto states has increased by 61.8 per cent between September 2014 and October 2016.

“We at UNICEF are dedicated to ensure all children can enjoy their right to a quality education, from early learning opportunities that lay the groundwork for success in school, all the way through secondary school.

“Quality education equips children to succeed in school, perform productive work, take care of themselves, and lead fulfilling lives.

One of our education interventions has successfully managed to remove some of these barriers and given more girls and boys in Sokoto, Niger, Kebbi and Zamfara states an opportunity to go to school and stay in school.

“The programme is specifically designed to address the poverty-related reasons preventing children to enrol and stay in school. It gives families an opportunity to cover direct and opportunity costs related to their children’s – especially girls’ – education.

“While cash on its own often removes financial barriers to children’s schooling, it might not be enough to incentivize all parents and caregivers to send their children to school.

Therefore, the programme has also ran a sensitization campaign for religious leaders, community leaders and parents to raise their awareness on the benefits of education, particularly for girls.

“I am very delighted to tell you that to date, more than 23,000 girls have benefited from the programme in Niger and Sokoto states. The girls’ enrolment rate has increased by 29.4 per cent in Niger and 32.4 per cent in Sokoto. Both state governments have continued to rollout the programme and are successfully reaching more children.

“In Kebbi and Zamfara states,the programme has started. We have already reached out to close to 11,000 girls and boys with the first cash transfer payment,” he added.

Speaking to Inside Abuja, the CTP Coordinator for Sokoto State, Mr. Mamuda Galadinma, said the objective of the programme was achieved from the very first year with 25 per cent increase and over 30 per cent increase in the second year.

Marvelled by the impact of the programme, the Sokoto government immediately took ownership of the CTP in order to retain and sustain the attendance ratio.

“We have sustained the programme after UNICEF left the programme in 2016. In 2017, we prepared our own peculiar programme and in January 2018, we disbursed money to the beneficiaries, we paid 10,120 beneficiaries. “It has improved the socioeconomic status of the family.

In many years, some will invest in petty trading, some in chicken or goats. They produce whatever they have to be able to be able to get whatever they need,” he said.

Meanwhile, an impact assessment exercise conducted by Capri International however revealed that Niger recorded an increase of 52 girls per CTP school, representing 29.4 per cent, while Sokoto had an increase of 73 girls per CTP school also representing 32.4 per cent. It further shows that in Niger State, a total of 58,484 disbursements were made directly to 12,314 beneficiaries.

To further extend this progress due to the high rate of out-of-school children in Kebbi and Zamfara states, UNICEF has introduced the scheme, raising a fresh target of 41,391 child beneficiaries to be coopted into the educational system between September 2016 to June 2021. In Kebbi, 31,044 children are expected to be bought over through the cash transfer scheme, while 10,347 would benefit in Zamfara State.

Citing examples of CTP’s impact on various families within and outside Nigeria, UNICEF’s expert, Mr. Nard Huijbregts, noted that cash transfers was the best solution to addressing the high number of out of school girls in any part of the world. “If you give money to poor women, the first thing they do is to send their children to school because they have always wanted to send them to school but they are financially handicapped.

“If the government wants to increase its economic capital, if you want all your girls to go to school and get quality education, if you want your girls to get a good shot at life, then you must invest in human capital, invest in girl child education through cash transfers,” he said.

If government heeds UNICEF’s advice, hopefully Aisha’s desire to see every little girl in northern Nigeria enrolled and retained in school would be achieved soon and the alarmingly high number of outof- school children in Nigeria could just be a thing of the past.

5,nigeria,"OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.6 million persons are internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security and nutrition situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and as the lean season (May through September) is about to kick off. The new Cadre Harmonisé analysis – which provides an updated understanding of the food security and nutrition situation – was issued, revealing that the number of people estimated to be facing critical and crisis food and nutrition insecurity levels (IPC 3 and 4) in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe stands at 2.3 million for March-May and up to 3 million projected for June-August.

In March, the operational environment deteriorated sharply with the killing of three aid workers in Rann, in Kala/Balge local government area (LGA) in Borno State, during an attack by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) against Nigerian armed forces.

Three female paramedical aid workers were also abducted during the attack and remain unaccounted for. This attack, which took place on 1 March, raised serious concerns regarding the preservation and expansion of the current humanitarian space and the dangers faced by aid workers as they attempt to access vulnerable persons in hard-to-reach areas. Following the attack, all relocatable humanitarian workers were evacuated out of Rann for close to three weeks and little to no assistance was delivered to people in need during that time. Although life-saving activities were able to resume in a progressive manner towards the end of the month, much time was lost in preparing for the rainy season (June through September) in a town that tends to become unreachable by road for months on end due to flooding. The construction of a humanitarian hub, a common storage site and a helipad were delayed pending a new security assessment of the chosen location. As time before the rains start is running out, it is crucial that work on these three projects resume as soon as possible.

Large-scale population movements, caused largely by insecurity, continued with 21,807 new arrivals in March alone. This represents a sharp increase of 75 per cent compared to February and poses major humanitarian challenges as resources are often already overstretched in the locations in which these civilians arrive. With hostilities ongoing, these trends are likely to continue at least until the rainy season starts in May/June. On 24 March, the Government of Nigeria opened the MaiduguriBama-Banki road, in Borno State, to civilian traffic, triggering thousands of population movements along this axis. In addition, the Government has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Maiduguri to Bama where rehabilitation of public and private infrastructure is underway. The UN and its partners are calling for close coordination with the federal and state authorities to ensure that any returns and relocations are carried out following internationally recognised standards of dignity, safety and voluntariness. The UN and partners are also calling for the return of civilian authorities to all return areas and the rebuilding of infrastructure and municipal services.

The north-east is also grappling with two new cholera outbreaks: one in Borno State (in Kukawa LGA), which broke out on 13 February and stands at 646 cases with three associated deaths; and one in Yobe State (in Bade, Karasuwa, Yusufari and Bursari LGAs) which started on 28 March, and stands at 44 cases with seven deaths (with a worrisome case fatality rate of 6.4 per cent). A timely and coordinated response by health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) partners has been put in place, including prevention measures, and the outbreaks are expected to be under control in the coming weeks. As the rainy season approaches, preparedness measures are being put in place to limit disease transmission.

Another challenge in March were the heavy winds which have caused repeated fire outbreaks in Borno State, destroying large numbers of shelters, food supplies and other critical items across camps in the state (in Mafa, Jere, Monguno and Kala/Balge LGAs). Although humanitarian organisations were able to respond rapidly with emergency shelter kits and distributions of other life-saving items, fires are creating major gaps in the affected locations. Fire sensitisation campaigns and other mitigation measures, such as fire stations in heavily congested camps, are ongoing or being rolled out.

Overall, the humanitarian response in north-east Nigeria is hampered by the lack of funding for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Currently, most activities can only be implemented thanks to carry-over funding from 2017 (US$196 million) which will soon run out. For the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be urgently received across all the sectors","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update - Progress on key activities from the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-progress-key-activities-2018

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

The humanitarian crisis in Nigeria’s north-east remains one of the most severe in the world today. In 2017, there were 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the worst conflict-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The crisis is considered a protection crisis first and foremost, that is closely linked to food scarcity and insecurity and high levels of need for basic life-saving assistance and services. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of a conflict that has led to widespread forced displacement and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

In March 2017, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2349, strongly condemning all terrorist attacks, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses by Boko Haram and ISIL, and urged all parties to the conflict to ensure respect for and protection of humanitarian personnel, facilities, and their means of transport and equipment, and to facilitate safe, timely and unhindered access for humanitarian oganisations to deliver life-saving aid to affected people.

Protection concerns

Protection of civilians was a key priority for humanitarians in 2017. Women, men and children faced grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, over 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of women and girls abducted and, in 2017, over 110 children were used as so-called “suicide” bombers. Toward the latter half of 2017, a surge in attacks by non-state armed groups claimed dozens of lives and injured countless others.

Internal displacement and returns

In 2017, more than 1.6 million people were internally displaced in the three worst crisis-affected states – with 80 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Borno State, the epicentre of the crisis. Over half live outside of IDP camps in local communities. Freedom of movement of all IDPs, including refugee returnees, was limited by continued security threats in areas such as Banki, Pulka, Bama, Gwoza, Ngala and Damasak. Nonetheless, 1.3 million people returned home in 2017, indicating that conditions in some locations had improved. Meanwhile, an estimated 930,000 people remain in hard-to-reach areas and humanitarian actors were not able to assess their situation, or to provide them with aid.

Food insecurity and malnutrition

By the end of the year, the risk of famine had been averted in north-east Nigeria in locations where humanitarians had access. The number of people estimated to be facing food insecurity reduced from 5.2 million during June to August 2017 to 2.6 million during October to December 2017³. This improvement was due to (i) improved security conditions that allowed for farming activities in locations that were previously not safe and an upturn in market and trade activity; (ii) delivery of food and livelihood support to almost 3 million people every month (including 2 million per month with just food assistance) since the start of the year; and (iii) favourable climatic conditions for farming.

An estimated 450,000 children under the age of five suffered from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe in 2017. SAM kits were provided to over 30 stabilisation centres to treat more than 7,000 children suffering from SAM with medical complications, and over 150 health professionals from the Health Ministry and NGOs were trained on in-patient management of SAM. The integration of the provision of safe drinking water, adequate sanitation services and safer food and hygiene practices into nutrition activities were required to improve the health of people in need and help combat malnutrition.

Disease outbreaks, including malaria and cholera

A highly vulnerable population, consisting largely of children (58 per cent), continued to be at high risk of disease outbreaks since routine vaccinations, e.g., polio and measles, had been interrupted for many years, . Two thirds of the health facilities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states were damaged by the conflict. The continuous influx of returnees and overcrowding of camps continued to increase the risk of outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than half of recorded deaths in Borno State were due to malaria, more than all other causes of death combined.

Finally, the cholera outbreak that was declared in mid-August 2017 in Borno State, was brought under control following a solid collaboration between health partners and water, sanitation and hygiene partners, and a cholera vaccination campaign in the most at-risk areas of Borno State which reached more than 900,000 people. By the time the epidemic was declared over in December 2017, there had been over 5,300 recorded cases and 61 deaths.

Access and security

The humanitarian access and security situation in the northeast remains challenging for humanitarian partners and has had significant implications on relief operations in 2017.

The north-east of Nigeria, especially Borno State, has experienced a significant increase in military operations in the second half of the year which have resulted in major civilian displacement, access restrictions along main routes and security incidents in previously secure areas.

The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) estimates that around 85 per cent of the target population (5.2 million people) can be reached with aid while an estimated 930,000 people remain in areas that are hard to reach for UN agencies and international NGOs. In Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, three local government areas (LGAs) are currently completely inaccessible for UN and international NGO humanitarian services, whereas 26 are partially accessible and 37 are fully accessible.

All of the three inaccessible and the majority of the partially accessible (19) LGAs are located in Borno State. Due to the lack of access of humanitarian partners to these areas, the identification of potential needs as well as independent context and security assessments have largely not been possible.",Nigeria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Situation Overview

In early April, a series of fires broke out in and near the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp in Borno’s Rann town, injuring 14 people and burning more than 1,000 shelters in the camp, according to local media. Relief agencies are erecting 500 emergency shelters to decongest affected areas and working to address persistent shelter gaps.

The Yobe State Commissioner for Health declared a cholera outbreak in Nigeria’s Bade Local Government Area (LGA) at the beginning of April. Health actors recorded more than 340 suspected cholera cases in the state, more than 95 percent of which were from Bade, between 28 March and 16 April.

In anticipation of increased access challenges during the upcoming May-to-October rainy season, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published the 2018 Rainy Season Contingency Planning for North-East Nigeria on 9 April. It highlights that 407,000 people will be potentially affected during the 2018 rainy season in the three states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.",Nigeria Crisis - ETS Situation Report #18 (Reporting period 1/04/18 to 30/04/18),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-crisis-ets-situation-report-18-reporting-period-10418-300418

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.

9,nigeria,"The Federal Government could ignite a crisis, if its planned resumption of oil exploration in Ogoniland goes ahead without the resolution of key issues.The warning by stakeholders in the Niger Delta is coming on the heels of last weekend’s meeting between the leadership of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu. The meeting had sought to find solutions to the crisis in Ogoniland.

Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was forced to stop exploration and leave Ogoniland in 1993, following an upheaval that caused the death of several Ogoni persons.The President of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, told The Guardian that the meeting proves the Federal Government cares nothing about the tragic experiences the Ogoni people have gone through, including the murder of Ken Saro- Wiwa and other prominent Ogoni activists.

“Government has not learnt anything. What this means is that it values oil more than the Ogoni people and their lives. They are yet to clean the environment and they are talking about the resumption of oil production. I don’t think they will have an environment conducive to oil exploration in Ogoni,” said Omare.

South-South Zonal Director, Civil Liberty Organisation, Steven Obodoekwe, said since government and the oil companies have not shown commitment to cleaning up the devastated Ogoni environment, their desperation to resume oil production therefore amounts to callousness and “fresh corporate terrorism.”

The ideal thing would have been for the government to ensure the environment is completely restored before contemplating renewed exploration in the area, stressed Obodoekwe.A Shell spokesman, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that though the company’s lease for Oil Mining Leases (OML11) has been renewed, it does not cover the over 30 Ogoni oilfields.He explained that contrary to the allegation that Shell wants to return to Ogoni through the backdoor, the company which was forced out of Ogoni in 1993 following an uprising does not intend to resume oil production. Shell’s leases for OML 11 was expected to expire by June 2019.

There has been growing tension in Ogoni since the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) wrote to Shell last year that it had given preliminary approval to a RoboMichael Limited which had expressed interest in obtaining licensing rights of Ogoni oilfields. It was learnt that Shell had already given its approval to RoboMichael.

The endorsement of RoboMichael Limited by NAPIMS and Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers respectively had caused MOSOP and other groups to allege that RoboMichael was Shell’s proxy, an allegation which the oil major has denied.

Amnesty International’s Business and Human Rights Researcher, Mark Dummett, regretted failure by the government and Shell to implement recommendations by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

“Following its groundbreaking survey of 2011, UNEP clearly laid out the path by which the environment of Ogoniland could be made free of the contamination that has devastated it for so long. The government has created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) to organise the cleanup, but little has so far been achieved, and there is no transparency over its plans,” Amnesty’s Rights researcher Dummett said.

MOSOP had told Kachikwu it was not opposed to discussions on the resumption of oil production, but that the consent of the people must first be obtained.It stated “unequivocally” that the contentious issue involves three main parties – the Federal Government, the oil industry led by Shell, and the Ogoni people. “Any attempt to deal with any aspect of the issue must necessarily involve the three principal actors, as stakeholders in a joint project of finding a lasting solution to the Ogoni crisis,” it said.

MOSOP, therefore, warned it would “resist the present attempt by the Federal Government and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria to arbitrarily award the Ogoni fields in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11 without consultation with the Ogoni community.”

The President of the movement, Legborsi Pyagbara, stressed that besides the environmental damage that attended Shell’s operations, Ogoni people are distressed about their lack of participation in the value chain of the oil industry, including employment; the absence of well-defined Community Benefit Sharing Agreements (CBAs); and a sustainable development process that recognises the rights of the people to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), in accordance with global best practices.

Pyagbara described attempts in the last few years to use money to “buy support” from the people as “condemnable” and “reprehensible”. Such move, he said, is “against the spirit of transparency and accountability required in the extractive sector.”He cautioned: “Societies the world over have met this challenge through deliberate and clear actions, and the Federal Government should urgently look in this direction. For, if the Nigerian government fails to protect the Ogoni people, it certainly cannot protect itself. History is replete with the ruins of societies that were built on the sort of injustices that have pervaded Ogoniland over the years.”

The MOSOP President urged the government to set up a better framework of engagement under which the parties involved would have a level-playing field for discussions on the future of oil production in Ogoniland.

According to him, Nigeria will be judged, not by its false claims about developments in Ogoniland, but by how it actually protects the weak, the vulnerable and those whose lives have been imperiled by reckless oil exploration of multinationals.Pyagbara disclosed that the Ogoni people, at the behest of MOSOP, have set up a strategic committee representing the various interests in Ogoni, headed by Prof. Ben Naanen, an economic historian and resource governance expert. This will develop a template to harmonise existing positions and guide the people in engagements with the Federal Government and the oil industry.

Reflecting its responsibility and commitment to ensure that protection is central to all aspects of the humanitarian response in northeast Nigeria, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has developed this Centrality of Protection Strategy to provide vision, guidance and a basis for an operational approach. While acknowledging that the primary responsibility to protect civilian populations lies with the Government of Nigeria, the HCT commits to demonstrating the necessary leadership to fulfill the shared responsibility to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights.

Having this strategy recognizes the significance and overarching imperative to have a comprehensive approach to providing affected populations the means to live their lives in safety and dignity, especially in times of crisis or conflict. It also emphasizes the HCT’s accountability to affected populations when addressing identified protection risks or violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

Addressing the key protection concerns in northeast Nigeria is the joint responsibility of all partners and requires coherent and complementary approaches. The HCT in Nigeria, consisting of INGO, UN and donor representatives, aims to ensure a system-wide achievement of protection priorities in recognition of this. As this is the case, the HCT Centrality of Protection Strategy was developed through a consultative process with HCT and Operational HCT (OHCT) members, the Protection Sector and its AORs.

Through this shared vision, the HCT commits to three overall objectives in the Centrality of Protection Strategy: 1) To create and sustain a protective environment; 2) To enhance protection through freedom of movement and enhanced access; and 3) To ensure protection mainstreaming into the humanitarian response and decision-making.",Centrality of Protection Strategy - Humanitarian Country Team Nigeria December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/centrality-protection-strategy-humanitarian-country-team-nigeria-december-2017
11,nigeria,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

Overall funding this year to end April is US$ 351 million. This amount includes an estimated $185 million in carry-over as reported in the Financial Tracking Service (FTS).

NIGERIA HUMANITARIAN FUND (NHF)

The NHF is one of 18 country-based pooled funds and was launched during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region in February 2017. It plays a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria, providing funding to international and national NGOs, UN agencies, and Red Cross/Red Crescent organisations, with a focus on the front-line responders.",Nigeria: Humanitarian Funding Overview (as of 30 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-humanitarian-funding-overview-30-april-2018

A statement quoted the Nigerian partner, who is also the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Caritas Communications Limited, Adedayo Ojo, as saying, “This is a great opportunity for us and for Navigate Response.

“West Africa and especially the Gulf of Guinea, has seen more than its fair share of maritime incidents in recent years, not least with the rise in offshore piracy.

“Caritas can assist Navigate’s clients, who may be dealing with West Africa’s fragmented and often government-influenced media to help ensure accuracy and to protect the client’s licence to operate within the region.”

Along with Nigeria, the firm was said to have accepted Italy as a member of the crisis network.

The statement quoted the senior communications professional representing the Italian partner, Riccardo Masnata as saying, “I am delighted to be part of Navigate’s global network. I believe partnership is paramount in any crisis, when maritime stakeholders and media relations need to be managed.”

The Chief Operations Officer, Navigate Response, Dustin Eno, was quoted as saying, “We are delighted to bring two more communications specialists into our global response network. Their teams add both crisis management expertise and vital knowledge of regional media landscapes.”

“Our network of 42 offices in 28 countries provides our clients with unrivalled access to local experts backed up by the global experience necessary to respond effectively to any maritime incident.”

14,nigeria,"Fuel crisis hit Bayelsa State Monday following an industrial action declared against the state by the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG).

It was gathered that NUPENG directed their workers to down tools in protest of two fuel-laden tankers seized by the Joint Task Force (JTF), Operation Delta Safe (ODS).

Troops of JTF were said to have taken over the tankers, which were initially impounded by operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) over allegations of diversion of products and alteration of documents.

It was learnt that the interference of the troops would have led to inter-agency rivalries but for the quick intervention of NSCDC authorities.

While NSCDC cleared the trucks belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NSCDC) and ordered their release after meeting with NUPENG and other stakeholders, the JTF was said to have insisted on conducting further investigations.

NUPENG was said to have declared the industrial action after all its efforts to convince JTF to release the tankers proved abortive.

Investigations revealed that following the face-off NUPENG members refused to lift fuel to Bayelsa.

It was found that most petrol stations in Yenagoa sold out their products and locked their filling stations.

Long queues of vehicles were seen in some stations as residents battled to buy the product.

An NNPC source, who spoke in confidence, said despite all the documents proving that the products were not diverted, the JTF failed to release the petrol tankers.

The source, however, said JTF authorities contacted the NNPC and said they were ready to release the truck.

“This crisis was avoidable if the JTF had allowed NSCDC to handle the matter. We provided all the documents proving that the products were genuine and countering any claims of diversion.

“They have called that we should come and claim the tankers but we can’t go without other stakeholders’ directives. Once NUPENG directs, we will go and move the tankers. So, hopefully lifting of petrol to Bayelsa will soon resume.",Fuel crisis hits Bayelsa as troops impound NNPC tankers,http://thenationonlineng.net/fuel-crisis-hits-bayelsa-as-troops-impound-nnpc-tankers-2/

A Burkina Faso Red Cross driver was reported missing on 3 May in the northern Soum province. The driver had been travelling between Djibo and Arbinda towns. His vehicle has also gone missing. Humanitarian access has been significantly hampered in Burkina Faso’s northern region since November 2017 due to armed attacks and military operations. More than 950,000 people, a third of them in the northern Sahel region, require urgent relief assistance across the country.

BANGUI UNREST RESTRICTS HUMANITARIAN MOVEMENT

On 4 May, UN and NGO staff restricted staff movement in the capital Bangui during a protest called to desert the city following the killing of 24 people in a violent attack three days earlier. Protesters barricaded main roads and most people stayed away from the city. Aid organisations are still facing difficulties providing emergency assistance such as ferrying injured people to hospitals due to the presence of armed elements. The unrest has also forced some people to flee for safety elsewhere.

HEAVY RAINS LEAVE OVER 9,000 HOMELESS

Torrential rains over the past two weeks in Uvira in the eastern South Kivu province have left more than 9,000 people homeless and destroyed at least 6,500 houses. Several schools and health centres have been flooded. In total, around 32,000 people have been affected. Basic household items, shelter, water, health, sanitation and hygiene assistance are the urgent needs.

IED KILLS FOUR CHILDREN IN MOPTI

On 2 May, four children playing with an explosive device they thought was a toy died when the ordnance exploded. The accident happened in Dia town in the central Mopti region. Improvised explosive devices are among the biggest threats in central and northern Mali. Since 2013, 341 tons of obsolete, unsafe and unserviceable ammunition, including 85 obsolete surfaceto-air missiles, and nearly 11,500 fire arms were found and destroyed by UN Mine Action Support (UNMAS). This represents the world’s largest ammunition stockpile disposed of by a national authority with UNMAS assistance.

16,nigeria,"Nigeria’s drug abuse problem has been put under the spotlight by a new investigative documentary.

Across several major Nigerian cities, many young adults are known to be addicted to several illicit drugs but, in recent years, opioid-based cough syrups in particular have become a serious menace.

In Sweet Sweet Codeine, an investigative documentary by the BBC, reporters secretly film staff of three major pharmaceutical companies offering to sell thousands of codeine-based cough syrup bottles in illicit deals. The complicity of these companies which produce cough syrups locally helps explain the widespread availability of the drugs despite a government ban on over-the-counter sales. The documentary is the first for BBC’s Africa Eye, a new TV investigations strand, the latest in BBC’s expansion across Africa.

With local pharmaceutical production unregulated by government, cough syrups are being produced on an industrial scale. While drug makers are legally bound to only supply to pharmacies which in turn sell to patients with prescriptions, corrupt staff are taking advantage of the high demand on the black market and running parallel drug syndicates. Following the BBC investigation, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, one of Nigeria’s largest, has suspended the distribution of codeine cough syrup. It came after an Emzor executive was filmed cutting a deal to illegally supply cough syrup bottles.

Nigeria’s health ministry has also announced a ban on importing and producing codeine-based cough syrups.

Catching them young

The target market in the illicit codeine trade typically consists of teenagers and young adults looking for a cheap high. At a price of around 1,000 naira ($3), codeine is exactly that. Even though it is illegal to sell codeine cough syrups without a doctor’s prescription, the drugs remain widely available. It is common to find them casually consumed, sometimes as part of mixtures, at local bars and parties.

Taking codeine has become “cool” as pop culture references about the opioid have proliferated, particularly in the booming Afrobeats scene . “Diet“, an Afrobeats song with the refrain, “on a Codeine diet” has become a big hit for three of Nigeria’s biggest pop stars while the risque music video for Science Student by Olamide was banned by Nigerian media regulators. Codeine references also litter American hip hop as several big name artists, including rapper Lil’ Wayne, have released codeine-inspired tracks.

The thousands of young Nigerians already addicted are at risk of suffering from effects of sustained opioid abuse ranging from schizophrenia to organ failure.

The problem is more acute in Nigeria’s vast north where millions of young adults are unemployed. Its prevalence is also rooted in cultural nuances: with the sale of alcohol banned across most northern states mainly for religious reasons, young adults and teenagers often turn to cheap opioid-based drugs, especially codeine cough syrups, as an alternative. Those who cannot afford codeine syrups turn to more extreme options including lizard dung and cobwebs.

Isa Mohammed, a Kano-based pharmacist attributes the rampant abuse in the north to “access and supply”. Last October, Nigeria’s senate claimed around three million bottles of codeine syrups were consumed daily in two northern states alone. A measure of the scale of the problem, last month, the anti-drug agency seized a truckload of 24,000 bottles of codeine cough syrups in a single incident. The effects of the access to the cheap opioid on a mostly Muslim youth in the wake of poverty and a lack of employment, Mohammed says, “is disastrous.”

Bureaucratic bottlenecks

Nigeria’s government made little progress in curbing the problem. A ban on over the counter sales hardly dented the problem as unregulated production and illicit trade ensure that the drug remains available. It’s unlikely that the ban on sales without prescriptions has been implemented at all of the thousands of drug stores across the country.

Beyond attempting to stop over the counter sales without prescriptions, the government had been slow to act until the ban yesterday (May 1). Indeed a committee was set up in January to look into codeine abuse but its findings and recommendation, initially expected six weeks later, have not been published by the health ministry.

Over Nigeria’s borders, neighboring countries face a similar opioid crisis with Tramadol, a cheap but addictive pain relief medicine. Benin, which borders Nigeria’s west, is the second largest destination for Indian Tramadol globally. Some of the worst affected countries in West Africa are yet to make significant progress in tackling the opioid abuse.

Local advocacy groups recommend regulating production and distribution of drugs as a better solution to the opioid abuse problem. Adeyemi Oluwatosin, editor-in-chief of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, says one way to do that is by finally adopting the national drug distribution guidelines—a policy to regulate the distribution of drugs and eliminate open drug markets as well fake drugs. Five years after it was first proposed however, the policy remains unimplemented.

As for Mohammed, an outright ban alone will only be a temporary fix if government does not take on the much tougher problem of regulation. Addicts, he says, will likely turn to abusing other drugs, some with worse effects. “Banning codeine is not the issue, regulation of drugs is what we need,” he tells Quartz. “If we’re not regulating, then we’re just wasting our time and people will keep dying.”

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

More than 1.634.000 people remain internally displaced across the three north eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, of whom 83.5% are in Borno. The reporting period witnessed a high level of movement, with a total of 16, 542 new arrivals, 3,068 departures and 201 transit movements recorded across 33 LGAs in Borno and Adamawa states. The main reasons for the returns are improved security and voluntary relocation, while new displacement is propelled by poor living conditions, fear of attack, ongoing conflict and military operations.



On 23rd March, the Nigerian Government announced its intention to facilitate the return of IDPs from Maiduguri to Bama LGA. Bama currently has the largest number of displaced people (203,374) still outside of the LGA, and at the same time also hosts the highest number of IDPs (49,139 persons DTM Round XXI) of all Borno LGAs. The first voluntary returns exercise, supported by a government package of 10,000 Naira cash, a 50kg bag of rice, and a bag of maize flour per family, was scheduled for 2nd April. Humanitarian actors have emphasized the importance of ensuring that all returns processes take place in a safe, voluntary, and dignified manner, and take into consideration the capacity of state and other actors to meet the needs of returnees.



As of 31st March, 133 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with 12 deaths (a case fatality rate of 9%) were reported in Bade and Yusufari LGAs of Yobe State. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of cholera. WASH and health partners - including UNICEF, WHO, VCM, MSF Spain, State Ministry of Health (SMoH), State Primary Health Care Board (SPHCMB) and LGAs authorities - are responding in the affected areas. Meanwhile, the number of cholera cases in Kukawa LGA continues to decline following responses by UNICEF and partners. A total number of 639 cases and 3 deaths were reported at the end of March (resulting in a case fatality rate of 0.5%).



On 1st March, members of a non-state armed groups attacked the military camp in Rann, killing seven military personnel.



Hostilities also resulted in the deaths of three humanitarian workers (including a doctor working for a UNICEF contractor) and the abduction of three female health workers (including a nurse working for a UNICEF contractor). Humanitarian activities in Rann were suspended as a result of the attack, temporarily leaving the local population and an estimated 40,000 IDPs without life-saving assistance. The attack also resulted in the closure of the only school in Rann, thus halting learning opportunities for 7300 children (46% of whom are girls) and the destruction of 2,700 school bags with essential learning materials prepositioned in preparation for new enrolment. All teachers have moved to Maiduguri following the attack.
