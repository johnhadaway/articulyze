0,puerto+rico,"It’s been over six months since powerful back-to-back storms left “catastrophic” damage in Puerto Rico.

The federal recovery effort in this American territory has been under fire nearly every day since then. Critics note that hurricane relief in Texas and Florida last year was quicker, more robust and more effective.

At the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, we study the the role of the armed forces in disaster relief and humanitarian emergencies worldwide. So we decided to examine the U.S. military’s deployment to Puerto Rico after hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Limited by posse comitatus

Hurricane Maria hit the island on Sept. 20, 2017. The first soldiers arrived in Puerto Rico eight days later and would stay until mid-November. Eventually, 17,000 troops – including active duty, reserves and National Guard – were deployed to both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Their mission: to conduct search and rescue missions, provide medical care and restore power. Soldiers also delivered food and water to both residents and emergency responders there.

Our first question was why it took the military over a week to get to Puerto Rico. By comparison, U.S. troops were in Haiti two days after its 2010 earthquake.

The answer has to do with an 1878 law called the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits American armed forces from performing domestic law enforcement duties. In other words, the U.S. military does not respond to disasters on home soil unless ordered to do so by an act of Congress or for a “humanitarian assistance mission.”

When, in late September, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., suggested that the military should take over aid distribution in Puerto Rico from the Federal Emergency Management Agency – which was clearly stretched thin by its simultaneous responses to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria – Lt. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, commander of the U.S. Army North, rejected the idea. His response invoked the limits imposed by the Posse Comitatus Act.

“This is not a dictatorship,” he said. “The military does not take charge of these kinds of operations in the homeland.”

The Department of Defense had sent several FEMA liaisons to the Caribbean before Maria. But, by law, it could not mobilize troops until it was determined that civilian agencies were unable to manage the disaster response. For this reason, the U.S. military can actually respond more quickly to international emergencies than it can at home.

By Sept. 27, FEMA had requested help and the military was preparing to dispatch its first brigade of soldiers to Puerto Rico. Buchanan was named chief of the mission.

Deployments abroad and at home

Though it rarely does disaster relief at home, the U.S. military frequently responds to emergencies abroad. Between 1970 and 2000, American troops provided international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief 366 times, mostly in the Pacific. In the same period, they engaged in combat just 22 times.

We used these foreign deployments as a basis of comparison for evaluating the U.S. military’s Puerto Rico mission. And though some experts have recommended more training for these missions, our prior research has generally found that U.S. troops are quite good at international disaster response.

The U.S. Armed Forces score well on what we’ve identified as critical indicators of military success in a relief mission. They typically deploy quickly, bring a specialized skill set, coordinate well with aid agencies on the ground and plan their arrival and exit appropriately.

We modified these indicators slightly to assess the military’s humanitarian response in Puerto Rico, a domestic emergency. And, beyond the relatively slow mobilization, we found the military performed about as well in the Caribbean as it has abroad.

The deployment of 17,000 troops, 82 aircraft and three combat support hospitals was comparable in size to the U.S. military’s mission in the Philippines after 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan. There, 13,400 troops were deployed to some 450 disaster zones across the country.

As critics have observed, that is far smaller than the Haiti earthquake response, when 22,000 troops and 33 U.S. military ships were sent to the island.

This makes sense when given the death tolls of these various disasters, though. Some 230,000 people died in Haiti’s earthquake. Roughly 12,000 died in the Philippines. When the U.S. went to Puerto Rico, the government there maintained that just 16 people had died in the storm – though that would turn out to be a very low count.

Critically, however, fewer other organizations were working in post-hurricane Puerto Rico than were present in Haiti or Philippines.

After Typhoon Haiyan, 23 militaries jointly responded, including 23,000 Filipino troops, 13,400 U.S. troops and at least another 10,000 soldiers from other countries.

Dozens of international organizations also typically rush in to help after a disaster in the developing world. Groups like the International Committee of the Red Cross, CARE and Save the Children provide emergency assistance alongside soldiers.

International armies and charities do not undertake humanitarian relief in the United States. As a result, just a handful of national aid groups – among them the American Red Cross, Caritas de Puerto Rico and Habitat for Humanity – deployed to the islands after Hurricane Maria. They were soon joined by the military.

But, in the end, there simply was not enough manpower to get the job done.

Coordination is key

Our research suggests that the most critical factor in any humanitarian response — whether in a post-disaster scenario or in a conflict setting — is coordination. To succeed, military responders must work together with the civilian groups and government agencies on the ground.

One big reason why the 2005 Hurricane Katrina response in New Orleans failed, for example, was lack of coordination between the Department of Defense – which oversees the U.S. military – and FEMA. That disaster spurred the DOD to create a liaison position integrated with FEMA.

The Puerto Rico response shows that this new system has in fact improved coordination. Our study determined that when military personnel arrived, they complemented – rather than duplicated – the efforts of the federal officials, local authorities and humanitarian organizations already on the ground.

The military brought manpower to the island, including engineers, medical staff and airlift capabilities. This aided in the search and rescue, health care and power restoration work underway. The military also provided translators, mortuary affairs teams and tower climbers.

Coordination was not flawless. A recent report from the Center for Army Lessons Learned finds that FEMA and the military were not always “aligned and synchronized.” Sometimes, for example, they competed to conduct airlifts.

But, in our assessment, the DOD-FEMA liaisons effectively ensured the coordination necessary for the Puerto Rico mission.

Scale of damage was an obstacle

Even so, Puerto Rico’s recovery has clearly lagged. Power has yet to be entirely restored and over a thousand people died from storm-related causes in the weeks after Maria.

What went wrong?

Our interviews with Department of Defense responders suggest that the biggest challenge was the sheer scale of the damage left by Hurricane Maria.

Puerto Rico’s government was completely overwhelmed, making it very difficult for FEMA and the U.S. military to get a clear picture of what was most urgently required – and where – in the first days after the storm.

The island’s total power outage, in particular, hobbled emergency aid. Troops and FEMA staff deployed across the island could not communicate with affected communities.

The rundown condition of the power grid, already fragile before Maria, also made it massively harder to get the lights turned back on. No brigade of soldiers, no matter how well trained, can overhaul the energy infrastructure of a place as big as Puerto Rico in days.

Finally, because Puerto Rico is an island territory with no neighboring states, first responders like the National Guard struggled to arrive quickly. When parts of Texas were badly hit by Hurricane Harvey in September 2017, the National Guard was simply dispatched from elsewhere in Texas and from nearby states.

Lessons learned

Overall, we believe that the U.S. military itself performed as well in Puerto Rico as it does in its international relief missions.

But our assessment reveals real shortcomings in planning for disasters – especially considering that hurricanes occur regularly in the Caribbean.

Puerto Rico is not the first time the U.S. military has been called in to provide humanitarian assistance on domestic soil. It won’t be the last.",http://theconversation.com/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws-91558
1,puerto+rico,"It’s been six months since Hurricane Maria’s 155 mph winds plowed through Puerto Rico, leaving the island severely crippled and desperate for help.

The storm — which knocked out all power and most cellphone service — was the worst disaster ever to hit the Caribbean island, home to 3.4 million American citizens.

The island is still a long way from recovery. Federal workers there are still in emergency mode: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is still distributing food and water supplies; the Army Corps of Engineers is still picking up hurricane debris and installing blue roofs on damaged homes.

Helping Puerto Rico recover is a gargantuan task — FEMA has called it the “largest federal response to a disaster” in American history. But this response has also been unusually painful to watch, with shady contracting deals, a drinking water crisis, and the army of federal responders stretched too thin to effectively get help to everyone quickly. FEMA is also under intense scrutiny for hiring inexperienced contractors, including one company that failed to deliver thousands of meals.

Money is another problem. The government of Puerto Rico was bankrupt before the hurricane hit and needs a lot more cash to rebuild. In February, Congress approved $15.8 billion in FEMA aid specifically for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands — far less than the estimated $94 billion needed just for Puerto Rico. (Within six weeks of Hurricane Katrina, by comparison, Congress had authorized $60 billion in aid to disaster zones.)

Restoring electricity has been another headache, though progress has been slow. About 7 percent of the island’s electricity users still don’t have power, and it’s unclear when power will be fully restored. The lack of basic services has fueled a mass exodus from the island, which demographers expect will only worsen. More than 250,000 people have left Puerto Rico for the US mainland — possibly for good.

Here are five important things to know about Puerto Rico six months after Maria.

1) Rural areas still don’t have electricity

The government of Puerto Rico says 93 percent of island’s electricity customers now have power, mostly in urban areas such as San Juan. This is a huge improvement from three months ago, when only 65 percent were connected to the grid. However, these official figures have been disputed by four mayors, according to Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Día newspaper. They accused the utility company in January of inflating the numbers of customers in their cities who had power.

Regardless of the statistics, the lack of power is still affecting many Puerto Ricans.

The teachers association of Puerto Rico said dozens of schools still haven’t been connected to the power grid, according to an Oxfam report released this week.

“These schools often run on generators, which results in teachers holding classes for only four hours in the morning due to fuel costs, instead of the usual seven hours per school day,” the report explains.

There are many reasons it’s been so hard to restore power. For one, the power grid was a mess before the storm hit. The public utility company, PREPA, had been putting off repairs for years as the island sank into a deep economic recession. The utility company is also bankrupt and understaffed, as thousands of electrical workers have retired or moved to the US mainland in the past decade to find better jobs.

While the storm didn’t destroy the entire power grid, it did knock down 80 percent of the island’s utility poles and all transmission lines. And because Puerto Rico’s government is broke, it didn’t have the money to start repairing the grid right away. Instead, the head of PREPA at the time, Ricardo Ramos, signed two questionable contracts with little-known private American energy companies that required little payment up front. Ramos planned to pay the rest of the contracts with reconstruction grants from FEMA.

The main energy contract never got that far. It was a massive $300 million deal with Whitefish Energy, a tiny Montana company that had two employees at the time.

A congressional investigation later found that Whitefish Energy ended up charging Puerto Rico more than double the regular wages for utility crew line workers and higher-than-normal daily meal rates, and included clauses making it hard for PREPA to enforce a timeline.

The public backlash led Ramos to cancel the contract and resign from his job, and PREPA had to find a new contractor.

Now the US Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing grid repair contracts with more experienced utility crews from the mainland. But the logistics are still a mess. Building and shipping thousands of utility poles and power lines to the island, then setting them up on mountainous terrain, has become a headache for utility crews. And some of the equipment is so old that manufacturers had to make parts just to work for Puerto Rico’s system. That has slowed everything down.

The Army Corps’ last estimate was to have 100 percent of customers hooked up to the grid by the end of May.

2) Few Puerto Ricans can return home

Thousands of Puerto Ricans still don’t have a place to live.

Buildings in Puerto Rico were not made to withstand 155 mph winds. The governor says Maria completely destroyed 87,094 homes, with another 385,703 sustaining major damage.

More than 3,500 Puerto Ricans are still living in hotels on the island and across the United States with temporary housing vouchers provided by FEMA. The program has been extended twice by the agency because few homes have been fixed.

That’s another problem. FEMA has approved less than 40 percent of the 1 million applications for money to help disaster victims fix their homes, according to NPR. The reason is that many, many Puerto Ricans do not hold the deeds to their homes. In rural areas in particular, the process of buying a home can be quite casual, based on verbal agreements or handshakes. Others built homes on public land, essentially living as squatters. But FEMA requires homeowners to show proof that they own their homes to qualify for assistance.

That’s one major reason thousands of Puerto Ricans might never return home.

3) The island is dealing with a suicide crisis

Puerto Rico is dealing with a serious mental health emergency.

The number of people on the island who have reportedly tried to kill themselves since Hurricane Maria hit the island has more than tripled. From November 2017 through January 2018, a crisis hotline run by Puerto Rico’s Department of Health received 3,050 calls from people who said they had attempted suicide. That’s an astounding 246 percent increase compared to the same time last year.

This data was released in a report in January by the health department’s Commission for Suicide Prevention, with additional reporting from El Nuevo Día, Puerto Rico’s largest newspaper.

Even more people called the hotline to report suicidal thoughts (as opposed to those who attempted suicide). About 9,645 people who called the hotline in the past three months said they’d thought about killing themselves — an 83 percent jump from the same time last year.

These numbers offer a snapshot of the mental health crisis unfolding in Puerto Rico.

The rate of Puerto Ricans who chose to end their lives is also on the rise. The suicide rate in 2017 was the highest it has been since 2013, and men and older Puerto Ricans were much more likely to kill themselves.

It’s hard to tell how much of the spike is directly related to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the likely connection is difficult to ignore.

Julio Santana Mariño, a psychology professor at Universidad Carlos Albizu in Puerto Rico, said that Hurricane Maria made a lot of problems in Puerto Rico far, far worse, particularly high unemployment and homelessness. These are common risks factors for suicides, he told El Nuevo Día.

The devastation from the hurricane likely pushed many people over the edge, he added. “It’s normal for there to be family conflicts, but when you add the stress of more than five months without power, without food, living patterns change ... it makes it harder for people to manage daily life,” Santana Mariño told the newspaper.

4) Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have fled the island

The blackout, food shortages, and unreliable running water plaguing Puerto Rico in Maria’s aftermath have triggered an exodus from the island.

It’s impossible to know exactly how many Puerto Ricans have left, but more than 269,000 people have arrived in Florida on flights from Puerto Rico since the hurricane, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management.

Some people are staying with relatives; some have decided to relocate to the US mainland; others are staying at hotels paid for by FEMA.

Before the hurricane, the Orlando area had seen a surge of migration from Puerto Ricans leaving the island for job opportunities in the United States as a result of the recession.

Demographers expect Maria to trigger an even larger migration in the long term. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at the City University of New York estimates that Puerto Rico will lose up to 470,335 residents by the end of 2019 — about 14 percent of the population.

They believe that many of them will move to Florida — up to 82,000 people a year.

The migration has already affected Florida. More than 10,000 Puerto Rican children have enrolled in Florida’s public schools in the past three months.

5) The death count recount

Six months after the hurricane hit, the government has no idea how many people died as a result of the storm. The governor ordered a recount three months ago, which should be completed in April.

The official hurricane death toll has been a source of controversy since President Trump visited the island on October 3 and congratulated Gov. Ricardo Rosselló for the low number of deaths. At that time, the number was six. The official death count — now at 64 — has since been disputed by the press (including Vox), by academics, and by members of Congress.

In November, Vox published an analysis by social science researchers who used mortality data from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics System to compare the historical death averages for September and October and found that the number of people who died from the storm is closer to 1,085. A New York Times analysis of similar data found that the death toll could be at least 1,052.

In December, two members of Congress, Reps. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) and Bennie Thompson (D-MS), requested a federal investigation by the Government Accountability Office. In a letter to the head of the GAO, they said they worried that the death toll had been “artificially suppressed.”

Five days after the letter was sent, Rosselló ordered a recount of all hurricane deaths.

Staff from Puerto Rico’s Public Safety Department and Demographic Registry will investigate each death recorded in the hurricane’s aftermath, regardless of the official cause of death listed on the death certificate, Rosselló said. He did not give details about how the investigation will work or how long it will take.

But many are skeptical of Rosselló’s ability to provide accurate estimates at this point. Velázquez said she will continue to press for an independent federal review.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/20/17138990/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-6-months
2,puerto+rico,"01:19 135,000 Puerto Ricans Now Living on Mainland 6 Months After Maria A look at Puerto Rico six months after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island.

At a Glance Six months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, residents are struggling with mental illness amid the devastation.

A suicide prevention hotline center has had more than 4,500 calls since January, double those before Maria.

Tens of thousands are still without power.

Mental health issues have made a concerning rise in Puerto Rico as residents continue to grapple with massive losses and crippled infrastructure six months after their island home was devastated by Hurricane Maria.

“I sit and cry all day ,” 42-year-old Magdaliz Medina, who has been without power or water all this time, told USA Today. “I was depressed before the storm. Maria made it worse.”

In 2017, 253 Puerto Ricans committed suicide , according to a report released by the local government’s Commission for the Prevention of Suicide. Twenty suicides occurred in December, three months after the storm's landfall. Roughly 86 percent of the deceased were men and 14 percent were women.

The island nation was already battling surging mental health issues after a decade-long recession that left many unemployed and divided families due to people moving away. Maria’s blow and the devastation left behind only added to the distress.

Many are still without the resources they need to resume their lives. Resident Victor Manuel Belen Santiago lost his mother, Zoraida Santiago Torres, in February after the lack of power prevented her from using an oxygen machine .

A suicide prevention hotline center near San Juan told USA Today it received up to 600 calls daily from people who reach out to discuss their losses, economic situations, or family departures for the U.S. mainland. They are also receiving an alarming influx of people discussing thought-out suicide plans.

In January, the hotline saw calls related to suicide double from 2,046 in August to 4,548. Attempts also jumped from 782 to 1,075 within the same timeframe.

Mental health issues can arise during power outages due to the stress of being cut off from essentially everything: from food to transportation,and life-saving devices, according to the Kim Foundation, an organization dedicated to mental illness awareness and suicide prevention. Additionally, outages mean people are unable to communicate with others, which can cause feelings of isolation. Living in the dark can trigger fear and anxiety.

Ponce Health Sciences University Vice President Kenira Thompson told USA Today that many residents have been coming to the institution’s mental health center with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts triggered by the storm. The six-month mark after Maria saw a surge in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, in addition to the thoughts of self-harm.

“We’re very concerned with the suicide rates,” she added. “It’s nerve-racking.”

Health professionals’ concerns are rising as the June 1 start of hurricane season approaches.

“When it starts raining, they have episodes of anxiety because they think their house is going to flood again ,” clinical psychologist Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz told the New York Times in a November 2017 article. “They have heart palpitations, sweating, catastrophic thoughts. They think ‘I’m going to drown,’ ‘I’m going to die,’ ‘I’m going to lose everything.’”

Recovery on the island has gone slowly. Remaining shelters on the island shut down on March 9. Residents who were still homeless were given a different form of temporary government-funded housing.

Research conducted by University of Puerto Rico Behavioral Sciences Research Institute Director Glorisa Canino showed Puerto Rican residents who escaped to the mainland U.S. tended to exhibit fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression than those on the island, NBC News reports.

“When you adjust certain characteristics like unemployment and poverty, which are drastically higher on the island, you see that the rates of depression and anxiety are lower on the island,” she told the network.

Hurricane Maria made a Category 4 landfall in the town of Yabucoa on Sept. 20, 2017, packing maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. The monstrous hurricane killed 64 people on the U.S. territory, according to the Puerto Rican government, but in the months that followed, investigations by news organizations concluded the death toll was likely at least 1,000 .

Islandwide, the lights were supposed to come back on by mid-December, according to a promise made weeks earlier by Gov. Ricardo Rosselló.

According to a press release, it will be an opportunity to not only reunite old friends but also to show unity and support for fellow Puerto Ricans.

6,puerto+rico,"Roughly six months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, the island's governor signed into law ""education reform"" legislation that he says ""puts our students first"" but that critics say stinks of a privatization plan that will do nothing to help students.

The plan will consolidate schools and allow for charter schools and vouchers—ideas that are not endorsed by the Puerto Rico Teachers Association (Asociación de Maestros de Puerto Rico).

Another teacher's union, the Federación de Maestros de Puerto Rico, vowed that it, alongside teachers, parents, and students, would ""defeat the false reform with the struggle on the street and in schools.""

Offering background, education historian Lauren Lefty wrote at Jacobin:

In the wake of twin disasters—one man-made in the form of a vulture fund-fueled debt crisis, and one natural in the form of last September's Hurricane María — Puerto Rican leaders are attempting to implement a vast austerity program, claiming it will solve the island's economic woes. In the eyes of many Puerto Ricans, however, this is textbook ""disaster capitalism"": capitalizing on a moment of crisis, when the population is weak and unable to mobilize, to ram through pro-market austerity measures.

Although the government has slowly been rolling out austerity measures since the debt crisis began, post-hurricane, it's doubled down. And the island's public school system is one of the leading targets.

Among critics' targets is Julia Keleher, Puerto Rico's non-Puerto Rican Education Secretary, who, in the wake of the hurricane said the storm was a ""real opportunity to press the reset button."" Her role, Lefty argued, ""highlights the island's precarious colonial status and harkens to even less sovereign days.""

As NPR reported earlier this month,

teachers' unions in Puerto Rico have responded to the government's proposed overhaul with protest, anger, and derision. Since Gov. Ricardo Rossello presented it to the legislature last month, critics have said he and Keleher are using the damage that Hurricane Maria inflicted on the island and its schools as justification to push privatization, much like the governor recently announced his intention to sell off Puerto Rico's publicly owned electric grid.

""We are disappointed the powers that be in Puerto Rico have bought the wrongheaded DeVos and Trump spin that charters and vouchers are a panacea,"" American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said recently.

8,puerto+rico,"When Hurricane Maria battered their home island in September, Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland activated immediately. At a Johns Hopkins panel discussion Tuesday that assessed Puerto Rico's recovery six months after the devastating storm, scholars described how Puerto Ricans in the diaspora ignited an wave of grassroots support through social media and personal favors, leading to mass deliveries of supplies to the island.

It's a ""complete shift in the paradigm of emergency response,"" said Yale infectious disease specialist Marietta Vazquez, one of the panelists.

""What you have is just people, regular citizens, who were able to organize and establish an effective grassroots response that was timely and replicable,"" she said. ""They were able to deliver life-saving supplies and medication … in a way that government officials and federal agencies could not do.""

In the days following the hurricane, Vasquez launched Puerto Rico Rising Connecticut, which tapped into word-of-mouth connections to deliver 18,000 pounds of medicine and supplies, she said.

In Baltimore, Yonaira Rivera—a Bloomberg School of Public Health PhD candidate—helped found her own relief group, Puerto Rico Stands. Rivera served as moderator of Tuesday's panel, part of the JHU Forums on Race in America. The event also featured Juan Giusti-Cordero, a history professor at the University of Puerto Rico; and Antonio Trujillo, a professor of health economics at the Bloomberg School.

Their wide-ranging discussion touched on a number of topics.

How information spreads

In the telecommunications blackout during and immediately after the Sept. 20 storm, only one radio station was still transmitting on the island, becoming the lone media lifeline for Puerto Ricans.

The AM station, WAPA, took ""desperate calls from persons who still had phone connections"" and at one point delivered a life-saving warning of rising floodwaters, Codero said.

For Puerto Ricans who were not on the island, social media provided critical connections.

""Social media [was] unequivocally … instrumental in the way we were able to communicate,"" said Rivera, who used Facebook Live to track Maria's impacts. ""We were watching.""

Giusti-Cordero, speaking of the relief efforts that sprouted up on the mainland in the storm's wake, said the hurricane could be a groundbreaking case study for ""the role of social media in disaster recovery and making available supplies.""

Maria in context

Major hurricanes are a part of Puerto Rico's history, Giusti-Cordero said, noting that Maria was the 10th such storm of the past 200 years. He spoke of a string of especially damaging storms in the late 1920s to early 1930s, leading Puerto Rico to establish new government mechanisms for relief and reconstruction.

But the Category 4 storm caught everyone by surprise, panelists said. Giusti-Cordero said the local government was ""as well-prepared for Maria as it was for a snowstorm"" and called federal relief funds insufficient.

Puerto Rico's estimated $91 billion in losses add to a fragile economic mix of crippling debt and high unemployment rates on the island, Trujillo said.

Giusti-Cordero pointed to further complications in the territory's ""colonial relationship"" to the mainland U.S., which he said ""creates its own problems with the colonial government,"" including corruption.

Public health impacts

In Maria's wake, pressing concerns include water safety, mitigating infectious disease, providing access to services, and addressing mental health issues, panelists said.

""Suicide ideation and attempts have skyrocketed in Puerto Rico since the storm,"" Rivera said. ""There's a sense of despair among pretty much everyone, especially those who are lacking essential services.""

Even before Maria, Puerto Rico was suffering from an ""exodus of physicians,"" Vazquez said. Trujillo noted that some populations were already vulnerable, particularly the island's large number of elderly residents.

Displacement

For the thousands of Puerto Ricans who have sought refuge on the mainland U.S., there's a lack of coordination and resources, Vazquez said.

""Who runs the show?"" she said of housing efforts. ""It's local officials with nonprofits and human rights organizations, and it's not very organized, and we're all quite anxious about what's going to happen.""

9,puerto+rico,"More than three years ago, I led a team preparing a report on Puerto Rico's economy at the request of the Commonwealth. Puerto Rico was in dire straits: real GDP had been falling since 2006; migration out was accelerating; and the Commonwealth's debt had risen to the point where further borrowing could take place, if at all, only at a very high interest rate. The situation has gotten worse. But Puerto Rico now has a once in a generation opportunity to change course.

Recent governments controlling the island believed that Puerto Rico was in recession, and sought to remedy the situation with increased government spending. But Puerto Rico was not in recession: it was in decline. Years of fiscal stimulus failed abysmally. We found that a panoply of growth-inhibiting policies adopted by Puerto Rico and others imposed by the US government had contributed to the dismal performance.

It remains clear to this day that changes in economic policies need to be made, and there will be difficult years of transition. When countries find themselves in such severe difficulty, they can approach international organizations for support.

Puerto Rico, however, has no such lifeline. There is virtually no prospect of a resumption of sustainable growth without policy reforms, funding for pensions has run out, the government is no longer creditworthy, and the tax burden is already relatively high. PROMESA, which mandated the establishment of an Oversight Board to, among other things, oversee the budget and debt-servicing relief, did not authorize any new money.

The situation is further complicated by Irma and Maria. The electric utility, PREPA, inefficient and costly, which had failed to invest in maintenance and resiliency and is saddled with unsustainable debt, has failed completely. Add to this the damage to other infrastructure and productive capacity, and it is no surprise that an additional 200,000 persons have left the island.

Yet there is an opportunity in the midst of this tragedy. The significant hurricane assistance authorized by Congress and continued suspension of debt service could cushion the impact of much-needed reforms through the short-term rebound from the undertaking of construction and other activities.

The most important prescription for change is in Puerto Rico's labor market. Labor force participation is estimated to be under 40 percent (versus 63 percent on the mainland). Reasons for this include costly regulations governing conditions of work and disincentives for participating in the formal labor market (no earned income tax credit and full access to federal welfare programs).

Puerto Rico is also subject to the federal minimum wage, which is harshly binding, deterring employment (Puerto Rico's per capita income of about two-thirds that of the poorest state, hence the requirement bites hard); a required Christmas bonus of one-month's pay compounds the problem. Other areas of structural reform that are needed include improving the business climate, relaxing regulations governing youth employment, and infrastructure modernization (especially the provision of reliable and competitively priced electricity).

Puerto Rico will also have to overcome disadvantages relative to U.S. states and territories. If it were a state, per capita federal support for Medicare and Medicaid (which covers 60 percent of the population) would be 2.5 times larger than present levels. Puerto Rico receives less than half the lowest supported state (Nevada) and the total shortfall (excluding exceptional financing) is about $2 billion a year. The Jones Act requires that Puerto Rico (but not the U.S. Virgin Islands) use more costly U.S. vessels to ship to and from the mainland.

Puerto Rico must seize the opportunity at hand. Federal disaster relief money gives the Island breathing room to offset deflationary pressures from needed targeted fiscal downsizing. Deep structural policy reforms can reverse the negative economic spiral and spur growth. At the same time, debt restructuring should give room for deep economic reforms to put Puerto Rico on a new growth trajectory. The return to creditors will be higher and reforms can turn the Island into the jewel of the Caribbean.

If, however, federal funds are expended without reforms, the prospects will be dismal. The one-time stimulus from the infusion of cash for reconstruction and other relief efforts will have dissipated. The island's economy and population will return to a world of economic contraction.

10,puerto+rico,"The battle between the governor of Puerto Rico and the federally appointed oversight board over the beleaguered island's fiscal plan hit a new level on Wednesday evening, as Governor Ricardo Rossello gave an impassioned televised address to publicly deny many of the board's requirements.

""As part of the evaluation process of the fiscal plan submitted by our government, the board has sent us a communication proposing measures that would have the effect of increasing the conditions of poverty in Puerto Rico,"" Rossello said in his prepared remarks.

""Although the board endorsed our initiatives to transform the education and health systems, I cannot allow the board to award itself powers that it does not have, much less when they intend to use this power to impose measures that negatively affect the quality of life of our people,"" the governor added.

Earlier on Wednesday, the oversight board sent several letters to Rossello, saying that changes to the proposed fiscal plan, including a cut to the commonwealth's troubled pension system and additional austerity measures, are required.

""The conditions that the board pretends to impose would make it practically impossible to increase the federal minimum wage; would eliminate the Christmas bonus for public employees, would further affect vacation and sick leave; and do not include programs for the training of our workforce. Our proposal was based in the salary increase for our workers and the creation of training opportunities. With these elements made impossible, the proposal is not viable,"" he said.

A spokesman for the oversight board declined to comment on the governor's remarks.

The board is requiring a 10 percent cut to the island's pension system, which currently has around $50 billion of unfunded obligations. Pensioners with a combined retirement plan and Social Security benefits below the poverty level of $1,000 per month would not be subject to the 10 percent cut, according the letter the board sent to Rossello.

The governor has repeatedly rejected any reductions to the island's pension system and excluded it from the most recent draft of the fiscal plan he submitted for review on Friday

Rossello reiterated his stance on the subject in his address Wednesday evening.

""I inform you that although the board certifies in the fiscal plan a reduction of 10 percent to pensions, that unfair and abusive measure will have my tenacious opposition,"" he said.

However, the board says this is a non-negotiable requirement for the bankrupt island's fiscal plan.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/28/they-intend-to-dictate-public-policy-puerto-ricos-governor-spars-with-federal-oversight-board.html

The after effects of the hurricane that ravaged Puerto Rico six months ago are still being felt, and one Texas Ranger continues his quest to help.

Over the offseason, Ivan 'Pudge' Rodriguez helped lead an effort to send assistance and comfort to those affected by the destructive Hurricane Maria in his homeland of Puerto Rico.

Hurricane Maria came ashore on Puerto Rico's eastern edge in September 2017. It tore through the island's interior with winds of 155 mph, dumping nearly 40 inches of rain. Sixty-four people died as a direct result of the hurricane, according to the U.S. government. About 1,000 more perished in the aftermath, according to The New York Times.",https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas-rangers/rangers/2018/03/30/rangers-pudge-rodriguez-gives-latest-update-recovery-efforts-puerto-rico-following-hurricane-maria

Daiza Aponte with her daughters Alannys and Enrielys at the Pointe Plaza Hotel in Brooklyn, where they are being housed by FEMA

On March 5, nearly three months after landing at John F. Kennedy Airport on a flight from Puerto Rico, 29-year-old Daiza Aponte finally moved into a hotel room with a kitchenette.

Soon after Aponte and her two young daughters arrived in New York last December, the Federal Emergency Management Agency placed them, along with dozens of other Puerto Rican families fleeing the island in the wake of Hurricane Maria, in a Holiday Inn Express overlooking the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. Hotel management refused to let the families bring food to their rooms, recalls Aponte, and her toddler daughter didn’t have a crib. She fell out of bed three times.

Now, FEMA has transferred Aponte to the quiet Pointe Plaza Hotel just north of Flushing Avenue in Hasidic Williamsburg. “It’s like a studio,” Aponte told the Voice in Spanish on a recent afternoon at a Brooklyn pizza shop. One-year-old Alannys slept in her stroller, tucked into a pink snowsuit, while three-year-old Enrielys climbed under the table. “If you need pots, spoons, they’ll give it to you. I can ask for a sheet and they’ll give me one.”

Aponte is determined to stay in New York City, where her children, who both have asthma, receive better healthcare than they did in Puerto Rico. But she knows that her current living situation is temporary. FEMA was housing 225 Puerto Rican families in hotels in New York State as of March 13, according to the agency. Its Transitional Shelter Assistance Program has been extended until May 14 at the request of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló, but only for families who qualify based on FEMA’s inspections of their homes back on the island. FEMA also offers rental assistance on a case-by-case basis, but the amount is based on rents in the area where the disaster took place.

Aponte says she’s been offered $550 per month for six months. So far, apartment hunting in New York at that price has been futile. “Everything I’ve found is $1,200 and up, for just one room,” she says. “We lost our homes there, and then came here to end up in the street.”

***

After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was explicit that there isn’t enough affordable housing in New York City to accommodate families who couldn’t stay on the island. More than 63,000 New Yorkers already sleep in shelters each night as of January, and the rental vacancy rate is a sobering 3.6 percent. “I don’t want to encourage people to come here if they don’t have some family to turn to,” de Blasio told CBS’s Marcia Kramer in October. “I think we have to be really clear about that.”

To address other needs, the city launched an emergency service center at the Julia De Burgos Performance and Arts Center in East Harlem that welcomed more than 2,500 households from Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and the Virgin Islands seeking free, bilingual legal counsel and mental health services; winter clothing; and applications for food assistance and Medicaid.

But the emergency center quietly shut down on February 9. Now, nonprofit emergency response organizations and advocates for the Puerto Rican community say City Hall should form a task force to correct issues that have cropped up over and over in recent months, such as a lack of sympathetic translators at Human Resources Administration offices, and insufficient job training and legal assistance for families seeking to challenge FEMA denials. In fact, the city should have circled the wagons months ago, they say, so families would be more prepared to look for their own housing come spring.

Aponte shares her story with a panel of hurricane relief volunteers at Hostos Community College, as Jonathan Soto translates. Photography by David 'Dee' Delgado

Jonathan Soto worked at City Hall until late January as director of de Blasio’s Center for Faith and Community Partnerships. He was tasked with helping set up the city’s emergency center, but left for a job at Union Theological Seminary after realizing he could “do more on the outside.” Soto believes a task force could have helped the city coordinate with councilmembers in districts with large Puerto Rican populations, like the Lower East Side and Sunset Park. With multiple service centers, he says, families wouldn’t have had to make the daunting commute to East Harlem.

“The problem is going to get worse before it gets better,” says Soto. “When FEMA assistance runs out, where are those folks going to go? The existing shelter system.”

Many people who fled Puerto Rico after the storm are running through their savings, he notes, and the island is still a long way from a full recovery. “People are going to make the wager to stay here, putting a bigger strain on nonprofits and welfare,” he says. “I don’t think the city has a contingency plan.”

***

Health and Human Services Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio said at a recent press conference that City Hall closed the emergency services center after “the influx of people evacuating … slowed.” She urges Puerto Ricans to instead seek help at any of the 24 Homebase offices across the city, which provide New Yorkers at risk of homelessness with emergency rental assistance and financial counseling.

“Folks should certainly know that they can walk into any Homebase and get a full array of services,” Palacio told reporters at a recent press conference. HRA also granted the nonprofit Catholic Charities $180,000 to assist Puerto Rican families already in the shelter system with Medicaid, SNAP, and FEMA applications at four Homebase offices in the Bronx.

But advocates worry the issue is a lack of advertising, not a lack of need. “At the beginning the Julia De Burgos Center was promoted very well. They allowed all of the newspapers and cameras to come in,” says Lilah Mejia, a coordinator with New York Disaster Interfaith Services. Her nonprofit had a table there, and distributed winter clothing and MetroCards. “As time went on it kind of died down and people forgot,” she says.

Aponte never made it to the service center. Instead, she says, she made two futile attempts to acquire cash assistance, complicated by the language barrier and her lack of sufficient documentation. HRA requires proof of the number of people living in an applicant’s household, and Aponte’s TSA paperwork doesn’t list her children. During one visit to HRA’s 300 Canal Place center in the South Bronx, she says, Alannys started coughing and a staff member accused her of spreading the flu. “She hung up on the translator, and I had to communicate there as best as I could,” Aponte recalls. “That was really hard. I left there crying. I felt nervous.”

HRA declined to comment on Aponte’s case, citing privacy rules. A spokesperson tells the Voice, “We are doing everything we can to help evacuees from areas impacted by major storms last year, working diligently and as fast as possible to help them get back on their feet.”

As of February 8, according to HRA, 49 percent of storm victims’ cash aid requests and 54 percent of SNAP requests were approved and active. HRA said that some cases were closed because applicants left New York or got jobs that made them ineligible, but did not break down the data further.

“You hear the HRA nightmares,” says Mejia. Since the emergency center closed, she has a skeleton crew operating on Tuesdays and Thursdays out of the Church of the Holy Agony on Third Avenue in East Harlem. “People treat you unjust,” she says. “So families return [to us] because they knew they could come to a warm friendly face. Where we would embrace and assist them.”

***

Advocates have also accused the city of failing to disseminate information about New York’s housing crisis to Puerto Rican families. Maisha Morales is a program coordinator at Good Old Lower East Side, a nonprofit that fights displacement in that neighborhood. For several weeks following Hurricane Maria, she says, Puerto Rican families would show up at her office seeking housing assistance, on the recommendation of volunteers at the Julia De Burgos Center. She had no choice but to send most of them back uptown.

“Of course it’s heartbreaking,” says Morales. “We tried our best as far as informing them what’s out there — understanding what a housing lottery is, and that you would need a certain income bracket to qualify. Most of them didn’t have jobs, so they didn’t qualify for it.”

Without reliable housing, says 28-year-old Raul Grajales, everything else falls apart. His $200-per-month studio apartment in Canóvanas, with a rooftop view of El Yunque National Forest to the east and the beach at Isla Verde to the west, was completely destroyed in Hurricane Maria. He left Puerto Rico and moved in with a friend in Queens in October, but quickly realized that “there was basically no space between us.”

Grajales eventually responded to a Craigslist ad for a bedroom in Washington Heights and agreed to pay $550 for two weeks. The roommates disappeared after a week and the heat and electricity were cut off, a cruel reminder of the situation he’d left behind. “I was like, I should have stayed in PR. What the fuck am I doing?” he recalls.

Grajales ended moving in with some sympathetic neighbors for $650 per month. He established a routine, helping a roommate sell flowers out of a shopping cart. (He says his seven years of experience in food service meant nothing in New York, where restaurants asked for at least a year of local experience.) He was glad to be in a diverse city, he says: “I may not have enough money to travel the world, but New York brings the world to you. I met Jamaicans, I met a lot of Mexicans, I met Dominicans, Taiwanese, people from everywhere. That’s pretty nice.”

“I also chose New York because I wouldn’t need a car,” he says. “People complain a lot about the MTA, but hey, at least it’s something.”

Even so, on March 4 Grajales flew home to his parents’ house in Bayamón with the last of his two years’ savings. “I knew it was going to be difficult,” he says. “But I was unforgivably naive.”

***

On March 13, First Lady Chirlane McCray hosted a press conference at the headquarters of the Hispanic Federation in lower Manhattan to announce a $100,000 grant for mental health services in Puerto Rico. Later that afternoon, she flew to the island for a day of touring. During a Q&A session following the announcement, Deputy Mayor Palacio told the Voice that City Hall has “no plans for a task force explicitly” to address gaps in aid for Puerto Rican evacuees in New York City.

“On the island they’re doing great work,” Mejia of NYDIS said afterwards. “But what about our families here in the city?”

Now that the service center is closed, volunteers are stepping up to assist Puerto Ricans for free. Victor Martinez, a Puerto Rico native from the Bronx, created the website Diaspora X Puerto Rico in October with his wife, Surey Miranda. It links out to subway maps, details about emergency Medicaid and shelter, and job boards. “We use Facebook,” he explains. “We are only four volunteers, and we have been able to contact around 200 people since two weeks after the hurricane.”

Martinez adds, “Apart from talking to people about what they need, we try to have a conversation with them. To know a little bit more about their stories, what they went through.”

Evacuees are also helping each other. Aponte’s friend Axel Reyes, a 42-year-old father of three, came to New York with his family after the hurricane destroyed his restaurant in Coamo. His children’s school shut down and his home lost potable water. He has lived in New York City before and speaks fluent English, so he’s helped other FEMA families, sharing his knowledge about the subway and public assistance.

“We try to help everyone,” he says. “One for all, and all for one.”

Reyes, who’s staying in the same hotel as Aponte, tells the Voice that he doesn’t qualify for a FEMA extension through mid-May because inspectors haven’t been able to assess damages. (He doesn’t have family or friends in Puerto Rico to let the inspectors inside.) He says he’s received notice to move out of the hotel on Tuesday, six months to the day after the hurricane hit Puerto Rico. A FEMA spokesperson says extensions are available for some families, but stressed that allowances are made on a case-by-case basis. Reyes has been working five days a week, commuting to a steelworking job in the Bronx nearly three hours each way, but doesn’t have enough saved to rent an apartment. “My kids aren’t taking it too good,” he says.

Yet he’s determined to stay in New York. Reyes proudly shows the Voice pictures of two certificates his fifteen-year-old daughter has received at her new school in the Bronx: perfect attendance and honor roll.

Back in Coamo, he says, there’s “no food, no water, no school, no light, no nothing. So I made the choice.”

“And my choice turned out to be right,” he adds. “I’m working. I’m feeding my kids. I don’t have a stable home for them, no, I do not, but they’re eating every day.”

14,puerto+rico,"I hesitate to even write the phrase “Activist Comedy.”

The second word is obviously subjective, because not all comedy is funny, but the first word can sound even more vague, loaded with subtext that threatens to defeat any actual context. So “Activist Comedy” sounds like something people can only loudly dislike for stupid reasons or proudly support for emptily symbolic reasons.

But I’m not sure how else to explain something like The Great American* Puerto Rico, an intriguing hourlong special made by Samantha Bee and the Full Frontal crew. It’s an impressive tour through the Caribbean Island, still recovering from Hurricane Maria half a year after the media cycle moved on. It is sometimes funny and sometimes unfunny, but it is a consistently profound attempt to focus the media cycle—and politicians, and voters—onto the problems facing Puerto Rico.

“How did we f— up so badly?” the host asks early in the special. It’s a complicated question, with several answers rooted in history, money, corruption, and the possibility that certain dominant personalities in the government have no idea what Puerto Rico is. One segment that explains the history of Puerto Rico and its confusing status within the United States. (The asterisk in the title is because Puerto Rico’s history, is, to put it mildly, complicated. The island is a Commonwealth, which means that Puerto Ricans are American citizens who don’t get to vote in American elections, which is obviously ridiculous.) Bee’s covering a lot of ground here, talking to local politicians, activists, barbers, people on the street. Trump and FEMA are mentioned, but they are as distant here as they actually are for many Puerto Rican citizens.

Although the special tries to explain the administration’s embarrassingly gradual reaction to the hurricane’s devastation, it also cleverly tracks the unexpected ways that Puerto Rico is changing. Bee flies to Florida, where has seen an influx of Puerto Ricans fleeing a busted power grid and the lack of running water. In one splitscreen, she captures the overlapping conversations about Puerto Rico’s future: Should it be a state, an independent nation, something else? The show also visits an extremely Mr. Robot-y investment summit, where she explores how Puerto Rico is becoming a tax shelter for millionaires. (God help the Puerto Ricans, first came the hurricanes, then came the Blockchainers.)

It’s an assault of information, much of it fascinating. One of the people interviewed is Tania Rosario Mendez, the executive director of Taller Salud, a “nonprofit NGO female-led feminist organization” which is attempting to provide supplies like food and shelter to areas not much helped by FEMA. When you least expect it, David Duchovny suddenly appears, vaguely in character as Fox Mulder and looking vastly less bored than he did this year on The X-Files, trying to come up with a conspiracy theory to explain why so many Puerto Ricans still don’t have power. The hour even ends on a note of capitalist advocacy, with Bee producing Full Frontal T-shirts in Puerto Rico (currently for sale!)

Full Frontal‘s been around for a little over two years. Bee clearly has ambitions for expansion, and I appreciate the intentions to produce something above and beyond the news cycle. The current administration often feels too perfect for late night comedy: If you’re low on jokes in the morning, you can count on the White House suffering a scandal by noon.

The Great American* Puerto Rico aims for something more expansive. It’s held back, I think, by a weirdly broad tone, and some undercooked sketches. The special opens with Bee and her correspondents “arriving” in Puerto Rico, as if they just swam there, okay. There’s a “Despacito” joke, which I guess was mandatory but still isn’t funny. There’s a long jokey montage of Bee working with a T-shirt designer on making a perfect T-shirt, and a long jokey montage where Bee tries to round up all her correspondents, and a scene where she sings “Nobody Does It Better,” oddly prefabricated beats that feel DOA compared to the roving curiosity of the interview segments. The episode ends on a Flashdance joke, and seriously, this and the Deadpool poster, what’s with the Flashdance jokes suddenly? Did everyone get the same subscription to Played Out Pop Culture References Weekly? Is there a Flashdance joke in Ready Player One?

There’s blunt honesty in how Bee presents the plight of the Puerto Ricans. She keeps on situating the island’s story within a larger national framework, referring to how it’s sustained “the longest blackout in US history” after suffering “the worst natural disaster in American history.”

Strong words, but some elements of The Great American* Puerto Rico feel too much like one of those BuzzFeed GIF explainers that simplifies a complex topic past the point of helpfulness. The production visits a local comedy troupe, a hipster bar, and two different barbers. You appreciate the intentions: We’ve gone beyond the politicians to speak to the people! But this never doesn’t feel like a specific sop to some notion of Full Frontal‘s demographic, who presumably have their own comedy troupes that perform at hipster bars in the back room behind a barbershop.

The special ends on an odd note of optimism. Bee says of Puerto Rico: “It’s got a long way to go, but it’ll get there.” This is a lovely thought, at odds with the general chaos the special maps out. I sure didn’t feel optimistic, so I donated to Taller Salud. Whether The Great American* Puerto Rico was good activism, so-so comedy, or unpaid advertising for nonprofit groups, it sure worked on me. I hope Puerto Rico gets “there,” and good luck with the Blockchainers.",http://ew.com/tv/2018/03/29/samantha-bee-puerto-rico-review/
15,puerto+rico,"Full Frontal tonight airs a one-hour special from Puerto Rico in which Samantha Bee and her correspondents visit the island that was very sexy top-of-show news when Hurricane Maria hit months ago, leaving 1,000 dead, about 10K homeless, and 3.4M without power.

The Great American Puerto Rico was taped about a month ago; 103K still were without power, Bee reported, calling it “shameful” given that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.

“If this happened in Connecticut, it would be front page news every day,” she said, adding, “How did we f*ck this up so badly?!”

Bee says in the special she grabbed her correspondents and rushed to Puerto Rico “to find out what the hell was going on,” telling her crew “Let’s make America give a damn about Puerto Rico.”

Bee’s program points the finger at the “shady” companies contracted to restore power to the island. And at FEMA which, locals told her, didn’t just not show up, but rejected hundreds of thousands of homeowner applications for assistance because they did not have deeds for their homes.

David Duchovny is brought in to serve as FEMA Conspiracy Explainer, making great use of his conspiracy-theory yarn. After the hurricanes, Duchovny said, ‘FEMA did its usual mediocre job in Florida and Texas” but in Puerto Rico “did way worse.” They told locals to apply for assistance by phone or online when they had no internet or electricity, for instance. And, even though Puerto Rico is famously broke, FEMA told them they had too much money to receive disaster loans, “because they didn’t do their f*cking homework,” Duchovny scowled.

The show went to the town of Loiza where Tania Rosario Mendez, executive director of Taller Salud, was doing incredible work with the NGO female-led organization. “We were waiting for FEMA to show up, but they didn’t, so we just started buying tarps and putting them up” to replace roofs that had been blown off, Mendez explained. They found out what else the people needed by going to the women and asking them.

“We just listened,” she said, becoming straight-woman for Full Frontal’s question: “You listened to women and no one tried to accuse you of ruining a mediocre comedian’s career?”

During the special Bee announces she had moved her TBS late-night show’s T-shirt production to Puerto Rico, and challenged others to do same, most especially former The Daily Show colleague/current CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert.

Bee actually visited Late Show Tuesday night to tout her special, but kind of stepped on her own promotion when she mentioned to Colbert that, as an adolescent, she used to steal cars:

Bee had first announced herPuerto Rico special back in January, during another Full Frontal special in which she sent her staff to race around, apologizing on behalf of the United States for all the things Trump had done at that point.

That included a stop in Puerto Rico, where Trump paid a visit last October, 13 days after Hurricane Maria hit, to tell residents how much he loves the place he seemed to have only just learned was an island. He informed them their weather is “second to none, but every once in a while you get hit. And you got hit.”

POTUS also addressed the devastation the hurricane caused – to him. “I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,” he said. Trump met with victims, seen on-camera telling one local, “We’re going to help you out…have a good time.”

Trump also handed out supplies, in the Trumpiest way possible, lobbing paper towels and other goods at locals in a church. When he passed out flashlights, the president informed the residents, “Flashlights. You don’t need them anymore!”

About four months later, nearly half a million people on the island still lacked power.",http://deadline.com/2018/03/samantha-bee-puerto-rico-special-donald-trump-fema-david-duchovny-video-1202354417/
16,puerto+rico,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – In explaining his decision to skip the Houston Astros’ trip to the White House nearly two weeks ago, All-Star shortstop Carlos Correa emphasized he was not making a political statement.

It was a statement nonetheless.

Correa opted to spend the day sending supplies to his native Puerto Rico, which continues to struggle in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria six months after the powerful storm tore through the island from east to west.

In carefully chosen words, Correa later thanked Donald Trump for all the help the federal government supplied to Houston, which was also devastated in September by Hurricane Harvey, and “some of the help that he’s provided to Puerto Rico.’’

Considering the Trump administration response to the disaster in Puerto Rico, and his comments about its residents, were widely criticized both in the island and mainland, Correa struck a delicate balance. He was appreciative while still highlighting that his home country of 3.3 million American citizens continues to endure a humanitarian crisis and needs further aid.

Maintaining such an equilibrium required rare skills for a 23-year-old, one tugged by the needs at home but also mindful of his national profile as an spokesman for brands like Adidas.

And yet, Correa has increasingly displayed them in embracing his responsibilities as one of Puerto Rico’s most prominent figures. Correa, Francisco Lindor and Javier Baez have emerged as the leaders of a young wave of Puerto Rican standouts, all three bilingual and articulate.

As the only one to combine a World Series title with All-Star status, Correa has the highest profile. Asked how tough a call it was to stay in Florida or join his teammates in Washington, Correa said:

“It was a difficult decision because it’s an invitation to the White House to meet the president of the United States. As I’ve said before, it’s an honor to be invited to such a historic place. But I also had my people in Puerto Rico who are in need and suffering and dying because they don’t have food on the table, so I decided to go that way.’’

Correa said he learned several lessons from the venerable Carlos Beltran, who retired after earning his first championship ring with the Astros last fall, about representing their homeland in a dignified manner. It might be no coincidence that Beltran also chose to pass on the White House visit after earlier expressing his disappointment with the federal relief efforts.

But as a player with MVP potential and most of his career ahead of him, Correa will have to set his own path. He makes his living representing a city in a conservative state and was aware there would be some backlash for declining the trip to the White House.

“I knew the Trump supporters would be all over me, but once I provided my explanation for not going and they realized it wasn’t political, I felt they would understand,’’ said Correa, adding the social media feedback he got was mostly positive. “When it’s not about politics but about human lives dying and being in need, people understand.’’

His teammates certainly did. Correa addressed them when they returned from Washington and explained his rationale.

Pitcher Dallas Keuchel, who wishes those celebratory visits had not become so politicized, said Correa didn’t have to do that.

“It was an off-day and nobody had to go,’’ Keuchel said. “I commend him for keeping his home country on his mind and helping them out. Whether you went or not didn’t really matter. He could have been sleeping in for all I know. That doesn’t bother me one bit.’’

Correa and Beltran, who donated $1 million, were among numerous Puerto Rican players who launched campaigns to aid their countrymen after Maria, which left them disconnected from their relatives for several days just as the Astros were heading to the playoffs.

St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, an eight-time All-Star and the island’s most decorated player in the wake of Beltran’s retirement, helped raise funds and personally delivered provisions around the northern town where he grew up.

Correa focused his efforts in his southern hometown of Santa Isabel and its surroundings, where he has a team of 30 volunteers reaching out to communities that still lack bare necessities. He said sometimes he receives videos of thankful beneficiaries in tears, which he finds deeply touching.

The instinct to help those in need is almost ingrained in Puerto Rican players, who grow up hearing about Roberto Clemente’s generous spirit. The Hall of Fame outfielder died in a plane crash on New Year’s Eve 1972 while taking supplies to earthquake-ravaged Nicaragua.

Still, manager A.J. Hinch said he has been impressed to see such a young player take on that role.

“One of the things we’ve known more and more about Carlos as he’s gotten more exposure is how philanthropic he is and how much he cares about kids, how much he cares about his community back in Puerto Rico,’’ Hinch said. “The way he gives his time, the way he gives his money, the way he brings attention to all the topics that are important to him, it’s a rare breed.’’

And Hinch expresses no concern over those endeavors taking away from Correa’s baseball duties.

Last season he was on an MVP pace, with a .320 batting average, 20 homers and 67 RBI through July 17, when he sustained a thumb injury that sidelined him for a month and a half. Correa still finished tied for second on the team in home runs (24) and third in RBI (84).

In the postseason, while still getting frequent reports of the hardships his friends and relatives were experiencing back home, he batted .288 and homered five times – including twice in the World Series – as the Astros claimed the first championship in their 55-year history.

Topping off the greatest night of his life, after the Game 7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Correa proposed to his girlfriend, Daniella Rodriguez, in front of a national TV audience. She broke down in tears and said yes.

If anybody wondered about Correa’s willingness to step onto a big stage, that should answer any questions.

“Carlos Correa is already a big Puerto Rican figure who everybody follows,’’ said Molina, who’s more the reticent type. “He’s got great potential and he has shown a lot, being a winner, the way he has played, the way he represents us. Right now, Carlitos, (Francisco) Lindor and Javy Baez project a great image for Puerto Rico. I’m really happy for each of them.’’

18,puerto+rico,"Six months after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the island is struggling to rebuild. Under the cover of a balmy spring, a healthcare crisis is brewing. Earlier this month in San Ju an, I spoke to Dr. Wendy Matos, executive director of the University of Puerto Rico’s faculty practice plan , where she supervises nearly 470 doctors across the island. What she described was stunning: patient attrition in the tens of thousands, increases in inciden ces of cardiac arrests and intracranial hemorrhages, higher rates of waterborne disease, mushrooming suicides, and medical equipment and staff shortages. Better data coll ection and more feder al aid is needed by Puer to Ric o's health sector to prevent more d isaster-related deaths and illnesses.

Six Months After Maria, Puerto Rico Struggles to Rebuild

The following is her testimony:

Dr. Matos: My name is Dr. Wendy Matos, PhD, MPHE. I am the Executive Director of the Faculty Practice Plan for the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. I oversee 468 physicians working at 29 sites across Puerto Rico, covering 91 specialty groups. The doctors I oversee comprise the largest network of medical specialists and sub-specialist s in Puerto Rico.

The patients my doctors see are typically those with complex conditions or who are very sick – that is, high cost and high need patients. We administer ambulatory (outpatient) clinics, and provide specialty and sub-specialty services to patients in Puerto Rico. We also provide inpatient institutional services to people admitted to eight specialty hospitals that comprise the Puerto Rico Medical Center.

The majority – 65 percent – of our patient population is medically indigent. Although most of our patients are covered by government health plan coverage, we receive very low payment, or no payment at all, for our medical services.

Hurricane Maria dramatically affected health, mortality and access to care in Puerto Rico. Since Maria, we have lost track of tens of thousands of patients. Today, we are seeing around 25 percent fewer patients at our hospitals since Hurricane Maria struck the island, when comparing 4 months of data from September 1 to December 31, 2016 (117,156 patients), to September 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (90,475 patients). The number of babies presenting for treatment at our natal services has dropped by around 50 percent.

The Health Problems We Are Seeing in Our Patient Population After Maria Are Severe

The top in-patient service my doctors currently provide at one of our facilities is for patients with intracranial hemorrhages – a type of bleeding within the skull that sometimes causes strokes. The top health problems my physicians are seeing in our patient population after Hurricane Maria also include: Diabetes mellitus type 1 with ketoacidosis; cardiac arrests; gastroenteritis; dermatological conditions – dermatitis, psoriasis, and scabies; musculoskeletal conditions; and respiratory conditions such as asthma and allergies. Each of these medical conditions has seen an increase of at least 10 percent in our patient population after the hurricane.

The most frequent symptoms bringing patients to our clinics are those that are stress related, specially impacting pregnant women, as well as cardiac patients and people needing pain management. Infectious diseases numbers from February and March 2018 remain higher since the disaster.

Our patients still lack access to potable water. Even now, they are presenting with illnesses related to drinking water contamination at greater rates than doctors were seeing prior to Hurricane Maria. These diseases include gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, and dermatological conditions such as dermatitis, scabies and pediculosis. Some of our patients have tested positive for shigellosis. Since Maria, we have also seen several cases of leptospirosis – a relatively rare bacterial infection in humans, commonly transmitted by allowing fresh water that has been contaminated by animal urine (often from rats) to come in contact with the skin, eyes, or with the mucous membranes. This condition usually causes heart failure, kidney failure or liver failure, and most sufferers die if they are not treated quickly. Waterborne diseases are still present as a significant health risk to our patients six months after Maria.

Mental health issues are extreme. My doctors are seeing a significant increase in suicides, and suicide attempts, after the hurricane. The elderly population is suffering the most. Elderly patients presenting at our clinics are extremely anxious and depressed. Many have psychosomatic symptoms related to high levels of stress such as: palpitations, angina, shortness of breath, insomnia, lack of appetite, anxiety, and depression.

Access to Healthcare is a Problem in Puerto Rico Post-Maria At present, there is a serious problem with lack of access to healthcare in Puerto Rico. Many residents need doctors, but cannot travel to San Juan from more remote areas because they don’t have cars. Roads and transportation are ill-repaired and inaccessible, in many cases. In my opinion, recovery efforts need to focus on rehabilitation and reconstructing medical facilities, and on helping physicians who are in more remote communities to start up their practices again. Privately owned clinics – as opposed to federally qualified medical centers – have been particularly badly affected by Maria. Most medical services in Puerto Rico are privately owned. After Maria, the Puerto Rican government contracted with insurance companies to manage health plans; these companies were affected by the disaster and stopped paying medical care providers. This has prevented many medical clinics from re-opening after the hurricane. I am carrying $12 million in arrears with respect to my own clinics, because I am not currently receiving payment from the insurance companies contracted by the government. Many healthcare providers are leaving the island. There was a serious shortage of specialists in Puerto Rico before Maria; this situation has been worsened by the hurricane. The severe specialist and health care professional shortage puts a heavy strain on my clinics. Patients who should ordinarily be seeing primary healthcare providers are turning up at my clinics in greater numbers than before. Pregnant Women and Infants Face Unique Risks A number of pregnant women identified as high risk were sent to the mainland to receive obstetric and birthing services when the hurricane hit. Babies that were expected to be born with congenital cardiac diseases were specially affected because the referral hospital was not able to provide the necessary care. During Hurricane Maria, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the University Pediatric Hospital was relocated. Neonatologists relocated NICU patients in other hospital areas to provide the level 4 services that patients needed after the emergency. This resulted in an increase in nosocomial infections (infections originating in-hospital) because, although hand cleaning and other sanitation protocols were enforced, the environment was not suitable for newborns. Municipalities Outside San Juan Were Slow to Receive Any Functioning Medical Services After Maria In the immediate aftermath of Maria, clinicians and students from the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus were the first responders in providing medical services to residents in 58 municipalities, at the invitation of the governor of Puerto Rico. These included the remote communities of Vieques and Culebra. What we were seeing in these municipalities were chronic patients who were left for several days, without insulin in some cases, without prescription medicines, and without food and water. There was, and still is, an inadequate response to the health needs of Puerto Ricans after Maria. Government Data Collection on Health is Not Occurring or Inadequate There is a growing healthcare crisis on the island. The disaster was at such a scale that it impacted all government agencies, and affected data collection and statistics about the incidence of disease and other health risks. This is, in part, because available resources are strained. In my view disease rates, injuries and deaths are being underreported. Healthcare Providers and Clinics Have Significant Resource Needs Like medical facilities across Puerto Rico, the clinics I oversee are facing critical resource issues. After the hurricane, we couldn’t perform MRIs and ambulatory (outpatient) surgeries because power generators weren’t sufficient to support these tasks. What we really need is solar power so that we can remain functioning at a high level during an emergency power outage. We also need information technology equipment to perform telemedicine, health education, as well as medical equipment to enhance our prevention and screening services for vulnerable residents who cannot travel to our clinics. Urodynamic equipment for urethra and bladder assessment and hysteroscopy equipment would greatly aid our patients and health clinics. After Maria, we acknowledged the need to increase our participation in outreach activities, and to provide integrated and comprehensive services to those that need it most. Both Specialists and Primary Care Providers Need Support After Maria As described by the Institute of Medicine, providing safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient and equitable services is our mission at all our clinics. In treating people with complex conditions, we strive to increase quality of care, contain costs and reduce patient complications. But we need a lot more help. In my opinion, there is an urgent need to provide comprehensive and integrated care to residents of Puerto Rico, and to support Puerto Rico’s primary care physicians. If doctors serving people living outside the metro areas of Puerto Rico receive more support from our specialists, there will be better guidance, preventive services and less patient complications for people with complex health conditions on the island. Patients Still Lack Access to Care

19,puerto+rico,"Six months after Hurricane Maria, and whole towns in Puerto Rico still remain without power. To imagine living for half a year without energy, try this experiment.

Turn off your lights and television. Unplug your refrigerator, your washer and dryer and stereo. Leave off your faucets, because your town’s pumps need power, and your phone too because who knows when you’ll be able to charge it again.

Naguabo firefighter Ronald Vega was dealing with such circumstances when we visited his family home in January. He was one of the 70,000 people living along the coast whose home still remained without power. At night, Vega and his two daughters ran a gas-powered generator for light. But during the day, Vega’s house sits quiet without the buzz of electricity. The refrigerator doesn’t hum, the ceiling fan is still.

“It’s such a tough situation. I’m paying at least $15 a day for the fuel of my generator during the week,” said Vega, who makes less than $20,000 a year.

During our visit, major highways were free of debris, but signs of the devastation lingered in most towns. Trees and power poles leaned haphazardly across roadways in Naguabo and Humacao, two southeastern municipalities where Maria first hit. Lines of cars and trucks crawled along a beachside road, careful to avoid the dangling powerlines. Even the homes that do have power are often struck with power outages.

But a few miles away from Vega’s home, Naguabo’s firehouse sat energized, thanks in part to a 6,600-kilowatt solar system and a humanitarian effort led by a San Francisco-based nonprofit called Empowered by Light.

After Maria knocked out emergency communications and water resources across the island, the organization teamed with the Las Vegas Fire Department to install solar hubs at firehouses across the island. Sunrun, a Bay Area solar company, provided solar panels and solar batteries, while a local construction company called Aireko installed solar-powered water filtration units.

“These communities need to rebuild using smarter, more resilient, diversified power sources,” said Moira Hanes, Empowered by Light’s executive director and co-founder. “Solar and storage is the foundation for the future of any energy infrastructure for places like this that are really prone to extreme weather events.”

These organizations were among dozens to provide renewable energy after the storm. But making renewables a mainstay will require more than solar panels and wind turbines. There’s also a monopoly and Congress with which to contend.

Why Puerto Rico stayed dark

When Hurricane Maria slammed into central Puerto Rico, the entire town of Adjuntas went dark — save for one pink building known as Casa Pueblo.

Founded in 1980, Casa Pueblo is half community center, half environmental organization and fully powered by solar.

“Casa Pueblo has been running on solar power since 1999, so we’re not new in this. After the hurricane, our facilities were intact, as well as our energy system,” said Arturo Massol, Casa Pueblo’s director.

After the hurricane, the building became a refuge. The center’s solar microgrid — a self-contained island of power that doesn’t need any outside energy to operate — allowed the people in Adjuntas to charge their medical devices and phones. Its community radio station broadcast news updates in the days after the storm, Massol said.

Solar panels can survive hurricanes, even Maria’s 150 mile-per-hour winds. Not so for the power plants residing not far from Adjuntas.

“If you were going to pick the worst possible direction for a hurricane to come through, Maria took that route, and did a lot of damage,” said Colonel John Lloyd, commander of Army Corps of Engineers Task Force Power Restoration in Puerto Rico. Eighty percent of the commonwealth’s grid was damaged or destroyed, along with 65 percent of its transmission and distribution system, he said

“If you were going to pick the worst possible direction for a hurricane to come through, Maria took that route, and did a lot of damage.” – Colonel John Lloyd, commander of Army Corps of Engineers

A number of factors made this grid uniquely vulnerable. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the island’s sole energy supplier for 1.5 million subscribers, had built its grid over 76 years. Most of the island’s power plants reside in the south, where the storm made landfall.

These facilities run almost exclusively on imported fossil fuels, with 98 percent of the island’s energy supplied by coal, natural gas and oil. The first wave of Maria flooded those power plants and destroyed ports, which should have stalled but not stopped the energy supply. The death blow came in the form of overgrown trees.

“A big part of the problem was the backlog of maintenance,” said José Román Morales, head of the oversight commission that regulates PREPA. If they wouldn’t have had a trimming backlog, there would have been less damage on the lines.”

Prior to Maria, PREPA had racked up $9 billion in debt and its Fuel Procurement Office faced a corruption scandal. As a result, much of Puerto Rico’s grid was 20 years out of date when the storm arrived. In a matter of hours, trees toppled hundreds of miles of old school transmission power lines.

Rebuilding a grid for 3.5 million Americans in mountainous terrain takes time. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers helicoptered supplies and employees to secluded valleys, but it has also been forced to hand-dig holes in places where heavy equipment can’t go.

Also slowing recovery is The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. This legislation, which sets the terms for how emergency funds are allocated, requires buildings and other infrastructure to be restored to their original state after a disaster.

One stark example involves “Puerto Rico special” — a type of wiring specific to Puerto Rico that is used for electricity lines. Early in the recovery, U.S. stockpiles of Puerto Rico special ran out, and the government was forced to contract with factories overseas in Canada, Mexico and South America.

Other materials, like poles, were running short when we visited– due to demand from areas hit by other Hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. The Army Corps and PREPA had received only half of the 9,800 miles of wiring and less than half of the 54,000 poles they had requested by January.

An Army Corps map of functioning transmission lines from late January showed these challenges. The island’s rugged center and southeast were de-energized.

In the last two months, more supplies and workers have arrived, quickening the recovery. In January, four months after the storm, 450,000 power subscribers lacked power. Today, the number is down to 105,000.

New poles and wiring replaces aging infrastructure, but The Stafford Act prevents the recovery from hardening the grid against the next storm, Lloyd said.

Justo Gonzalez, PREPA’s interim director, echoed this point. In the wake of the storm, he said PREPA wanted to install its power cables underground. But this upgrade would require a seperate overhaul of the grid.

“We hope to change some things to make the system stronger. We now know which [electric] posts are needed to withstand winds of such categories,” Gonzalez told NewsHour through an interpreter. “But this won’t take months to replace. It will take years.”

But there’s an alternative, some say, to replacing the aging infrastructure: a renaissance of renewables.

A solar plant in a virtual cloud

In a white chest in an upstairs apartment in Old San Juan is a box inlaid with a green, pulsating circle that looks like Iron Man’s chest plate. It’s a solar battery — one of the key ingredients in a solar microgrid.

“Batteries have made an enormous leap forward in recent years with the addition of lithium ion batteries, which is why we were able to have this self-contained system,” said Adam Gentner, head of business development for sonnen’s Latin America Expansion.

Sonnen, a world leader in solar batteries, donated microgrids at 15 key sites. They picked mostly food shelters, schools and other locations that had served as makeshift shelters after the storm.

But in Old San Juan, the battery’s cables were attached on one end to rooftop solar panels and on the other to La Perla Lavandería — a laundromat. After Maria, wastewater in Puerto Rico wasn’t being treated, and the skin disease leptospirosis emerged. These solar-powered washing machines can now prevent the risks associated with handwashing clothes in hazardous water.

“We use lithium iron phosphate, which is, as you can see, not a small system for a home, but it’s much more resilient to environmental factors,” Gentner said, relative to other types of batteries. This lithium-ion battery can discharge and charge up to 10,000 times. Meaning at a typical rate of one charge-discharge cycle per day, the battery would last 26 years without replacing, even in this hot humid climate which can affect battery life.

One sustainability expert estimates Puerto Rico would need 350,000 solar systems to support its 3.5 million residents. But that’s not totally accurate, as residential solar systems often collect more energy than they need. This excess energy could be pooled into what’s called a virtual power plant.

Unlike a standard power plant, which ships energy from a single place, virtual power plants consist of hundreds if not thousands of sources — all feeding power to the community. In Europe, a sonnen community of 10,000 residential solar microgrids produces as much energy as all the coal plants in Texas and West Virginia — America’s top-two leaders in coal power production.

A smart grid is a type of virtual power plant that relies on a self-thinking network of microgrids. It can autonomously communicate where excess energy is being produce, and then decide how to transmit this juice along power lines.

At the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, a team of computer scientists, electrical engineers and social scientists have been designing a smart grid tailored for Puerto Rico. The project, called OASIS, has completed lab testing and is in the early stages of field testing.

To support the smart grid, the team engineered a series of machine-learning algorithms. One algorithm predicts how solar microgrids perform in real-time by monitoring weather reports. Another tracks how much energy passes through transmission lines to prevent power surges, electrocution of line operators and blackouts.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/puerto-rico-went-dark-6-months-ago-heres-how-solar-energy-may-speed-the-recovery
20,puerto+rico,"Health experts had registered a total 253 suicide cases; the majority of victims, roughly 86 percent, were men aged between 55 and 69.

Six months since Puerto Rico was torn apart by Hurricane Maria, suicide rates continue to soar as the island struggles to regain its footing.

According to reports, following 2017’s natural disasters on September 20, the number of suicides spiked were seen to spike by nearly 30 percent, the Puerto Rican Department of Health announced.

In 2016, there were 196 victims of suicide registered, the lowest rate recorded in twenty years. However, one year later, health experts had registered a total 253 suicide cases, the highest rate since 2013. The majority of victims, roughly 86 percent, were men aged between 55 and 69.

As of January, the Puerto Rican crisis hotline has received a total of 3,050 calls from suicide attempts, a 246 percent spike from last year.

An additional 9,645 people admitted to calling the hotline in the past three months after considering suicide which is an 83 percent increase from 2016’s records.

Homelessness, unemployment, lack of basic necessities are believed to be large contributing factors to the cloud of stress and anxiety hovering over the island, said Psychology Professor Julio Santana Marino from Puerto Rico’s Universidad Carlos Albizu.

""It's normal for there to be family conflicts, but when you add the stress of more than five months without power, without food, living patterns change ... it makes it harder for people to manage daily life,"" Santana told El Nuevo Dia in February.

The territory continues to experience the longest recorded power outage in U.S. history and health professionals say this also contributes to the prolonged feelings of depression.

“Such prolonged darkness is insidious to community mental health,” said First Deputy Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

Sandro Galea, dean at the Boston University School of Public Health explained that a study should be conducted which links the physical and mental strain victims experience in post-disaster situations, “The stigma that you can just “get over” mental illness remains. In truth, one can get over mental illness roughly the same way one can get over a broken bone by oneself—with difficulty, and likely in a way that will not result in proper healing.”

Last week, distraught family members, Puerto Ricans, and members of civil rights groups paraded outside the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA building in Washington D.C. to protest the stagnant state of affairs on the island and to demand government aid.

FEMA has come under severe criticism for its failure to provide help to Puerto Ricans in dire situations. The U.S. agency has failed to respond to people looking for respite amid situations demanding urgency. With the island in crisis, FEMA has rejected the pleas of Puerto Ricans who don't have a deed to their home.",https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Puerto-Rico-Suicide-Spikes-by-30-Percent-After-Hurricane-Maria-20180328-0032.html

Besides working to restore electricity and basic needs to residents after Hurricane Maria’s destructive run here, state officials are also scrambling to meet the mental health of its residents.

MOROVIS, Puerto Rico — Magdaliz Medina struggles each day to meet life's basic needs: electricity, water, food.

But there's a darker challenge she faces six months after Hurricane Maria ravaged her island: her mental stability and the crushing depression that visits her each day in her darkened home.

“I sit and cry all day,” said Medina, 42, who has lived without power or water for more than six months. “I was depressed before the storm. Maria made it worse.”

Puerto Rico is facing a galloping mental health crisis across the island. Besides working to restore electricity and other basic needs to residents after Maria’s destructive run Sept. 20, state officials also are scrambling to meet the mental health needs of their residents.

Crisis managers at a suicide prevention hotline in Bayamón, near San Juan, receive 500 to 600 calls a day from people around the island in varying stages of desperation. Some callers just want to talk about their loss of home or income or family members who have fled to the mainland USA. Others call with very specific suicide plans.

The number of suicide-related calls to the hotline more than doubled from 2,046 in August to 4,548 in January, according to department statistics. Suicide attempts also have climbed from 782 in August to 1,075 in January, data show.

The island already had been wrestling with a rise in mental illness during its 10-year recession that sparked widespread unemployment and family separation caused by migration. Maria made matters much worse, public health officials say.

The mental health center at Ponce Health Sciences University in the southern part of the island receives about 4,000 to 4,500 patients a month. Many come from the nearby mountains, complaining of anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts tied to Hurricane Maria's destruction, said Kenira Thompson, a university vice president in charge of mental health services.

Initially, counselors saw patients with acute stress and anxiety, she said. But as the six-month mark approached, doctors recorded surges in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts, Thompson said.

“We’re very concerned with the suicide rates,” she said. “It’s nerve-racking.”

Besides manning the suicide hotline, public health officials have dispatched more than 400 counselors and mental health professionals across the island to meet the growing need, said Suzanne Roig, administrator of the mental health division of the Puerto Rican health department.

A rapidly approaching hurricane season, which begins June 1, adds to their concerns. “We know that could have a very big impact on the mental health and emotional reaction of people,” Roig said.

On a recent morning at the hotline call center, Claudee Garnett, one of the crisis managers, took a call from a woman who confessed she had taken an excessive amount of Xanax. Her voice was slow and slurred. Calmly, he asked for the names and phone numbers of family members.

While Garnett kept her on the line, another crisis manager called a relative who raced to the woman’s home. Garnett talked to the woman for more than an hour, until the family member was able to arrive and take her to a nearby hospital emergency room.

Many callers display acute mental disorientation brought on by Maria, Garnett said. “They don’t have basic needs: roof, home, water, electricity,” he said. “Their lives have changed.”

Another crisis manager, Alberto Morales, answered a call from a man in Corozal, about 25 miles southwest of San Juan, who said he was suffering panic attacks brought on by living with family members for months. Maria destroyed his home.

In a calm, steady voice, Morales advised him to keep his mind busy with other activities: Read, listen to music, exercise. If the attacks persists, seek professional help, he told him.

“They feel helpless,” Morales said later. “You try to give them the basic tools to survive.”

The crisis managers work eight-hour shifts, five or six days a week, absorbing some of the worst thoughts and behavior wrought by the hurricane.

Silvette Acosta, 27, said all the crisis managers, including herself, have been trained to handle the pressure of other people’s problems. She deals with the stress by going to the beach, reading or watching movies.

Helping the island's most vulnerable makes it all worth it, she said.

“Some of the cases we work with are difficult,” Acosta said. “But the satisfaction we receive — like saving a life — is all that matters.”

22,puerto+rico,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A blackout hit Puerto Rico's capital and surrounding areas on Thursday after two of the U.S. territory's main power plants shut down as officials warn the power company is struggling to remain operational.

The capital of San Juan was left without power, along with the neighboring municipalities of Caguas, Bayamon and Carolina, company spokeswoman Yohari Molina told The Associated Press. She said crews were working to repair the problem but that wasn't clear how many customers were affected by the outage. More than 970,000 people live in the areas hit by the blackout.

Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority tweeted that the Palo Seco and San Juan plants shut down to protect the electrical system, but it is unclear what caused the shutdown. Officials said they aimed to restore power by Thursday afternoon.

The power outage comes nearly three weeks after a fire erupted at one of the company's substations, knocking two power plants offline, leaving some people without power for two days. The investigation into that incident is still ongoing.

Overall, more than 15 percent of power customers still remain in the dark nearly six months after Hurricane Maria, which destroyed two-thirds of the island's power distribution system. Officials have said they expect power to be fully restored by May.

Meanwhile, a federal control board overseeing the island's finances recently obtained a $300 million loan for the power company, warning it will only serve to keep it operational through late March. Board members said they expect to request more loans in upcoming weeks.

Gov. Ricardo Rossello announced in January that he plans to privatize the power company in 18 months. The company is $9 billion in debt and operating with infrastructure that is nearly three times older than the industry average.

23,puerto+rico,"After a group of SCVi students decided to fundraise for those Puerto Ricans who are still recovering from the disastrous effects of Hurricane Irma, a few decided to offer up their spring break in order to visit and assist those on the ground in the devastated U.S. territory.

According to the official SCVi Backpacks For Hope Blog being run by those on the ground in Puerto Rico, 13 backpackers began their journey at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning, with a minimal amount of their own personal belongings in tow.

“While each traveler carried a small bag of their own belongings, the team also carried 11 large duffle bags filled with the supplies that iLEAD families and supporters had generously donated, and were on their way,” said a blog post from Friday morning. “As the team settled in to the eight-hour flight, excitement was high, but energy was waning.”

And while the flight was long and arduous — from Los Angeles to Houston to Puerto Rico — the SCVi students once again grew excited after they got their first taste of Puerto Rican culture and gratitude — before even landing in San Juan.

“Completely unexpectedly, one of the members of the crew announced our presence to the rest of the passengers: ‘We would like to thank the group of students from iLEAD Schools in California who have come to help rebuild Puerto Rico…’ and proceeded to call each student by name,” said this mornings blog post.

By the time the sun had set on their first day, the SCVi crew had traveled in their van caravan to the far west coast “home-base” located in Aguada.

“A long and winding road led us into the coastal jungle, to the house where we will be staying. It’s amazingly serene, but remote,” explained the blog. “The calls of the night birds and the famous Puerto Rican coqui frog surround us.”

“It was a beautifully painful journey,” reflected one of the students.

Bunkering down to sleep after the long bumpy trip on Thursday, SCVi students planned to wake up early on Friday and utilize their first day full day on the island to replenish and rehabilitate some of the surrounding ecosystem of Cialis.

As they drifted off to sleep, one student said he was excited being helping and lifting up “our friends in Puerto Rico and let them know that they are not alone.”

24,puerto+rico,"Promising junior lightweight Lamont Roach Jr. is going on the road to take on the best opponent of his career.

Roach will head to former world-title-challenger Orlando Cruz's turf to face him April 19 at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan. They will square off in the scheduled 10-round main event of a Golden Boy Boxing on ESPN card (ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes, 9:30 p.m. ET), Golden Boy announced Friday.

Roach (16-0, 6 KOs), 22, of Washington, D.C., is coming off a lopsided 10-round decision against Rey Perez in anther Golden Boy Boxing on ESPN card on Nov. 30 and he is looking to build off that victory by taking down the vastly experienced two-time world-title-challenger Cruz.

""I'm excited for this fight, and I'm ready to perform at a high level on ESPN again,"" Roach said. ""This fight is going to put me exactly where I need to be to show that I'm ready to be on a championship chase.""

Cruz (25-6-1, 13 KOs), 36, has dropped two fights in a row but is easily the most formidable opponent of Roach's career. Cruz suffered an eighth-round knockout loss challenging then-lightweight-world-titleholder Terry Flanagan for his belt in November 2016 and then lost a 10-round unanimous decision to Jose Lopez in June.

""I can say that this training camp has been one of the best of my career,"" said Cruz, boxing's first openly gay fighter. ""I feel blessed by God, who gives me strength and health to stay on top of my game. I will be 110 percent ready for this fight and to have a strong win April 19 in Puerto Rico.""

Golden Boy Promotions is once again partnering with Puerto Rico-based Miguel Cotto Promotions to present the Puerto Rican-heavy card.

One of those fights will be a 10-round all-Puerto Rican lightweight bout between Lopez (24-6-1, 12 KOs) and Mexico's Miguel Gonzalez (21-4, 18 KOs). Also, Magdiel Cotto (8-0, 7 KOs), of Puerto Rico, will face Elie Augustama (6-7, 3 KOs), of Haiti, in a six-round middleweight fight.

In another 10-round fight, welterweight Luis Hernandez (16-5, 9 KOs), of Puerto Rico, will square off with the Dominican Republic's Juan Abreu.",http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/22971967/junior-lightweight-lamont-roach-jr-fight-orlando-cruz-puerto-rico-april
25,puerto+rico,"Yet many Puerto Ricans fled with plans to return. For them, the leap north was a respite from the immediate chaos after the hurricane: the lack of electricity, unreliable hospitals and long lines for gas and food. It is too early to determine how many may return, but there is little doubt that Puerto Ricans have begun trickling back to the island.

For many, it is a joyous return to the motherland after months in exile. But the homecoming is still bittersweet. Those returning must come to terms with an island that is still crippled, where power outages are frequent, businesses remain shuttered and hillsides are pocked with blue roof tarps.

Older people like Enrique and Emma are especially vulnerable to this instability. More than 23 percent of the population in Puerto Rico is over 60, higher than anywhere else in Latin America. And that number is growing as young people abandon the island and leave elders to fend for themselves.

By returning, Enrique and Emma were taking a precarious leap of faith, given their age and fragile health. They were trading away access to world-class medical care in New York City for the unpredictable conditions on an island they yearned for even though it was ill-equipped to tend to their needs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/nyregion/return-to-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria.html
26,puerto+rico,"Within six days of Hurricane Harvey, U.S. Northern Command had deployed 73 helicopters over Houston, which are critical for saving victims and delivering emergency supplies. It took at least three weeks after Maria before it had more than 70 helicopters flying above Puerto Rico.

Nine days after the respective hurricanes, FEMA had approved $141.8 million in individual assistance to Harvey victims, versus just $6.2 million for Maria victims.

During the first nine days after Harvey, FEMA provided 5.1 million meals, 4.5 million liters of water and over 20,000 tarps to Houston; but in the same period, it delivered just 1.6 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water and roughly 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico.

Nine days after Harvey, the federal government had 30,000 personnel in the Houston region, compared with 10,000 at the same point after Maria.

It took just 10 days for FEMA to approve permanent disaster work for Texas, compared with 43 days for Puerto Rico.

Seventy-eight days after each hurricane, FEMA had approved 39 percent of federal applications for relief from victims of Harvey, versus 28 percent for Maria.",https://www.salon.com/2018/03/27/trump-treats-texas-hurricane-victims-better-than-those-from-puerto-rico/
