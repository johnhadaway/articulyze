0,colombia,"In a hospital near Colombia’s border with Venezuela, migrants fill beds with the wounds of the nation they left behind.

An 18-year-old woman rubbed her stomach. She fled Venezuela with her new born daughter when the wounds she suffered while giving birth became infected.

A young man hurt in a motorcycle crash needed antibiotic drugs for an infection.

A retiree with an enlarged foot arrived at the hospital after taking a 20-hour bus ride from Caracas. He went there because Venezuelan doctors told his family he needed the foot cut off — without antibiotics or drugs to control pain during the operation.

""If you want to sign, sign. But we are not responsible for the life of your father,"" said Teresa Tobar. She was repeating what the doctors told her when they handed over the papers for her father's operation.

As Venezuela's economic crisis worsens, rising numbers of people are fleeing overseas. Independent groups say as many as 3 million to 4 million Venezuelans have left their homeland in recent years. Several hundred thousand reportedly left in 2017 alone.

Many of those are arriving in Colombia by foot and going to emergency rooms there with medical conditions that Venezuelan hospitals can no longer treat.

Health officials say Venezuelans made nearly 25,000 visits to Colombian emergency rooms last year, up from just 1,500 in 2015. At hospitals in border cities like Cucuta, patients lay side by side on stretchers, not much unlike the conditions they fled back home.

Officials predict the number of Venezuelans being treated at Colombian hospitals could double in 2018. They say the nation's public health system cannot help the large number of refugees.

Colombia cannot pay the cost of medical treatment for everyone arriving, said Julio Saenz, an adviser on migrant affairs to Colombia's Health Ministry. “It’s “a very big concern,"" he added.

The Venezuelans are fleeing a national government that has been unable to stop rising costs. The high rate of inflation makes Venezuelan money nearly worthless and forces millions to go hungry. Migrants say the country’s collapsing health system is also forcing them to leave as things like antibiotics become hard to find or too pricey.

""I said to myself, 'I have nowhere else to go,'"" noted Grecia Sabala, a 32-year-old mother. She went to Colombia for treatment for cancer because doctors in Venezuela were unable to offer any treatment.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has refused to accept humanitarian aid. Maduro denies there is a crisis in the country. He added that permitting international aid could lead to foreign intervention.

Yet what little information officials have released shows Venezuelans are facing problems. The numbers of babies and mothers dying have risen sharply. And diseases like diphtheria, which officials thought was no longer a health threat, have reappeared.

Health officials are especially concerned about the spread of infectious diseases. Colombian doctors confirmed numerous cases of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV among Venezuelan migrants last year.

""It's increasing the numbers of some illnesses that we had under control,"" Saenz said.

By law, Colombia's hospitals are required to treat any person, local or foreign, who shows up at an emergency room. But many Venezuelans are arriving with conditions like cancer, which requires costly, continuing care. Health centers in Colombia are not required to provide those treatments.

Hospitals offer “emergency room care, but beyond that there is no more we can do,"" said Juan Ramirez, director of Cucuta’s Erasmo Meoz Hospital.

Cucuta health officials estimate the cost of caring for Venezuelan migrants will be millions of dollars this year. Most of that money comes from local agencies, many of which are low on financial resources. Health officials say they need the help of the central government and international community.

Aside from providing health care, border cities are also seeing a rise in the sex trade and groups of men, women and children sleeping on the streets.

President Juan Manuel Santos is being pressured to declare an emergency, which would free up additional money.

The United States’ Agency for International Development recently sent its top official for Latin America to Cucuta. The aim of the fact-finding trip was to see how the U.S. can help Colombia with the growing crisis.

The Colombian health ministry is planning to send six mobile medical centers to the border area to treat minor conditions.

A Colombia Red Cross medical station already operates at the foot of the Simon Bolivar International Bridge, where about 35,000 Venezuelans enter the country each day. The Red Cross station treats several hundred Venezuelans every week.

Michel Briceno, the young new mother who fled to Colombia after giving birth, said she knew she had to leave Venezuela. She said she made the decision after learning that several other women at the Venezuelan hospital had gotten sick and died.

When she saw the infection, she and her husband, their young son and newborn daughter took a small bus for a 12-hour ride into Colombia. She felt terrible pain during the ride.

Briceno said if she had stayed in Venezuela “I would have died.”

A Colombian church has donated 250,000 wafers to Venezuela's Catholic Church, which has struggled to buy its own because a shortage of flour.

The diocese of the city of Cucuta, which is on the border between the two countries, donated the wafers ahead of Easter celebrations.

The wafer is used to celebrate Holy Communion during Roman Catholic Mass.

In a statement, the Colombian church said the wafers had been handed over on a bridge between the two countries.

Venezuela has been hit hard by an economic crisis and shortages of food and medicine have become common.

This has meant the country's churches have found it difficult to make their own wafers due to a shortage of flour.

In the run-up to Easter, when the wafer is used to celebrate Holy Communion, the Colombian Catholic church said it was its moral duty to help Venezuelans celebrate the festivities.

""It is important to attend to the needs that afflict the faith as a result of this time of border crisis,"" a statement from the diocese said.

""At this time of the week, the central mysteries of the Christian faith can be celebrated.""

Earlier this month, it was reported that some churches in Venezuela had asked people to bring their own flour after supplies had run out.

Some priests have had to ""appeal to churchgoers to take flour to the nuns,"" a local parish priest told Roman Catholic newspaper La Croix.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-43593970
2,colombia,"Most Venezuelans crossing the Simón Bolívar bridge are fleeing their country for food and medicine.

Cúcuta is the principal border point into Colombia with up to 40,000 people passing every day.

One lady who we cross has arrived with acute appendicitis. She has made it just in time.

On the Venezuelan side of the border, crumbling hospitals are at breaking point. Now in its fifth year of recession, the International Monetary Fund forecasts inflation will hit 13,000% in Venezuela by the end of this year.

In middle of 2017, the Red Cross, funded by the EU Humanitarian Aid office, set up a reception facility next to the bridge in a bid to alleviate a crisis it says nobody wants to see or talk about.

Javier Francisco Gonzalez, the country manager from the German Red Cross says: ""The Red Cross has been opening and closing this post every morning and night. As a way to raise our hand and say: 'Something is happening here and we need to draw attention to this'. It's an invisible crisis on both sides.""

Three nurses and a doctor are always on duty in the first aid tent.

Many people come with chronic diseases. They often need simple, cheap, medicine, which is no longer available in Venezuela.

There are also cancer patients desperate to restart treatment, as well as the malnourished.

Juan Carlos Gonzalez, a Red Cross coordinator at the emergency facility says: ""We are providing assistance to a person who fainted. We brought him here and it looks like he is suffering from malnutrition. Every day we treat five to six cases of malnutrition.""

The Red Cross post is located next to the migration office, where over 3,000 migrants queue daily to have their passports stamped. Many have taken days to cross the border.

Getting in touch with their families is a priority.

One man, who was a professional bull-fighter in Venezuela wants to go to Peru with his wife. They are looking for work to send some money home to their three children who they have left in Venezuela.

""The first thing was charging the phone to call our family. We haven't heard from them for four days. (The guards on the Venezuelan side) are charging 10 dollars per person to stamp their passport. If you don't have it the queue lasts for days and days and days. This has to be done for free. You cannot charge for it.""

Faced with this massive influx of migrants, Colombia has called for international help.

The EU's Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Christos Stylianides recently visited Cúcuta.

He announced Europe would be providing 2 million euros to Venezuela and 6 million to Colombia.

Speaking to Euronews the EU Commissioner said: ""For the Colombian authorities it is a huge challenge to deal with this unprecedented situation, because of course they face also their challenges in their country about the reconciliation process and peace process. So, our humanitarian aid is going in both sides, inside Venezuela and inside Colombia. Especially in Venezuela we are trying a lot in order to find ways in particular to provide medicines and to find projects to deal with acute malnutrition.""

Venezuelan families are constantly settling in Cúcuta. Illegal migrants, with no documents, are moving into the city's deprived neighbourhoods.

The Norwegian Refugee Council, with EU Aid, is organising activities for 500 children not in school.

Area Mananger Luz Yadyra Galeano Saavedra says the goal is to get them back into the classroom.

""Children can now have access to the schools, but their right to enroll doesn’t mean they'll be able study. That's because many of these children live irregularly in the country. Their parents have no documents enabling access to any kind of legal right inside Colombia. What does this mean? It means for example that these kids don’t receive any certificate when they finish the school year,"" she says.

Some 4,100 Venezuelan pupils are registered at school in the department of Norte de Santander. Andreina's daughters are among them.The family settled illegally in Cúcuta three years ago. In Venezuela Andreina was a nurse and says she had a normal life. Her daughters and nephew had to wait one year before they could go to school.

""The children are managing to study regularly. Regularly in terms of their documents, but financially it's not normal. It's not easy to maintain three children at school when you are a foreigner without documents. If you manage to get food, how is it possible to buy items, like school uniforms, shoes. That is very difficult,"" she says.

It's estimated that 230,000 illegal migrants live in Cúcuta.

3,colombia,"Thousands of Venezuelans are pouring out of their crippled nation in one of the biggest migration crises in Latin American history, causing growing alarm in the region and prompting neighboring countries to rush thousands of soldiers to the border.

The massive scale of the exodus is being compared to the flow of Syrians into Western Europe in 2015. And, just as in that crisis, countries overwhelmed by the flood of new arrivals are beginning to bar their doors.

A boy from Venezuela’s indigenous Yukpa community stands at the entrance to the border bridge in Cucuta, Colombia, last month.

“This is a humanitarian crisis,” said Willington Munoz Sierra, regional director of the Scalabrini International Migration Network, a Catholic charity running a shelter in this border city, where desperate Venezuelans are now living in parks and cheap motels or sleeping on sidewalks. “In Venezuela, children are dying. People are starving and being persecuted. What they’re getting from us is a door in the face.”

Nowhere is the crisis more acute than here in Colombia, where 3,000 troops are fanning out across the 1,400-mile border to contain an influx of Venezuelans fleeing a collapsing economy and an increasingly repressive socialist regime. Roughly 250,000 Venezuelan migrants have surged into Colombia since August, with 3,000 a day still arriving.

The sheer numbers have led to a backlash in Colombian cities and towns, prompting the national government last month to suspend the issuance of temporary visas for Venezuelans. Colombian authorities are now launching operations in which dozens of Venezuelans a day are captured and expelled.

Police detain a Venezuelan woman without a valid visa in Cucuta. “I can‘t go back,” the distraught woman told officers.

“Let’s go!” Maj. Jarlinzont Zea barked into his walkie-talkie one recent afternoon, jumping out of a police truck in this city of 650,000. Simultaneously, dozens of Colombian officers and migration officials poured out of vehicles and stormed a park, sending panicked Venezuelans scattering.

One slight young woman, in a black tank top and denim shorts, didn’t move fast enough.

“What’s your name?” an officer demanded.

“Andie,” she said, quaking.

“Papers,” insisted the officer.

“I don’t have any.”

“Where are you from?”

“Venezuela,” she said, near tears. “Please. I — can’t. I can’t go back.”

‘I cannot feed my children’

Latin America has seen mass exoduses before. In the decades after Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, about 1.4 million Cubans fled the island, many heading for the United States, where they transformed the social and ethnic fabric of Miami. During the 1980s and 1990s, more than 1 million people — more than a quarter of the population — were displaced during El Salvador’s civil war.

Yet there is little precedent in the region for the speed and intensity of the Venezuelan migrant crisis.

After the leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez became president in 1999, thousands of Venezuelans — especially from the upper classes — moved out of the country. But the current exodus is far more dramatic.

Under Chávez’s handpicked successor, President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has reached a breaking point, with lower oil prices and economic mismanagement leading to the world’s highest inflation rate and spiraling indexes of poverty and malnutrition. At the same time, Maduro’s government has jailed and allegedly tortured opponents, sparking a wave of political asylum seekers.

Nearly 1 million Venezuelans have left their country over the past two years, according to the International Organization for Migration, with experts citing a surge during the second half of 2017, when the economy took a sharp turn for the worse. That figure is in addition to the hundreds of thousands who departed between 1999 and 2015.

“Our migration levels are now comparable to Syria or to [the Rohingya going to] Bangladesh,” said Tomás Páez, an immigration expert at the Central University of Venezuela. More than 1 million Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and others fleeing war and poverty poured into Europe in 2015, and 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have recently fled persecution in Burma, seeking refuge in Bangladesh.

Globally, the growing Venezuelan diaspora is reshaping cities from Miami to Buenos Aires to Madrid. But most Venezuelan migrants are staying in Latin America, where countries are handling a dire situation in different ways.

Peru, for instance, is offering temporary resident permits to Venezuelans, granting them the right to work. Last year, nearly 149,000 Venezuelans entered the country, up from 40,000 in 2016, according to Peruvian government statistics.

“We’re going to Peru because I cannot feed my children in Venezuela,” said Liuiben De Navarro, a 28-year-old Venezuelan seamstress who, on a recent morning, crossed the Colombian border at dawn with her two young children.

She and a host of other Venezuelans — army deserters, laborers, nurses — arrived to a barrage of offers from vendors peddling trips on rickety buses to cities such as Quito, Lima and Santiago. A few feet away, desperate Venezuelans sold scrap metal to Colombian junk merchants. “We buy hair!” yelled another Colombian merchant as a young Venezuelan woman sat in a chair under a tree, blushing as the scissors cut her long locks, destined to become a wig.

“I love my country,” De Navarro said. “But we cannot get food.”

In Brazil, President Michel Temer declared a state of emergency after a visit to his country’s border with Venezuela last month and pledged $20 million plus a new field hospital to ease the crisis. Four shelters on Brazil’s border are now packed with Venezuelans, officials say, with an estimated 40,000 additional Venezuelan migrants residing in Boa Vista, the closest big Brazilian city to the border.

Officials say they will treat the newcomers as Brazilian citizens. But Temer also vowed to double the number of troops at the border.

In October, overwhelmed Panama imposed new visa requirements on Venezuelans, making it far more difficult for economic migrants and asylum seekers to enter the country. In January, 308 Venezuelans were expelled or agreed to return to their countries when faced with deportation. From 2010 to 2016, Panama deported only 196 Venezuelans in total, according to government statistics.

“We’ve been coming here en masse, like people fleeing from a war zone,” said Marcos Ardon, 47, a former business owner in Venezuela now working in a Panama City coffee shop. “You’re on the bus and you hear people speaking with a Venezuelan accent everywhere now. You feel like [Panamanian] people don’t like it, that we’re too many here.”

A border crackdown

Colombians flocked to Venezuela to find work in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Now the job-seekers are Venezuelans heading in the opposite direction.

Venezuelans have enjoyed access to special permits good for two years in Colombia’s border region, allowing them to stay up to seven days at a time. Facing severe food and medical shortages at home, most have stocked up on supplies, or visited hospitals, before returning across the border.

But Colombian officials say those visas became a lure for Venezuelans looking to start a new life — bringing a dramatic surge across the border that reached a peak of 90,000 people a day in December. In early February, President Juan Manuel Santos suspended the issuing of new temporary visas and declared a massive militarization of the border.

The moves cut the daily flow almost in half — though critics say it has only motivated migrants to cross at dozens of illegal entry points along the border, putting them at risk of harm from guerrillas and criminal bands. Locals, meanwhile, are accusing the Venezuelans already here of harming the economy and driving up crime.

“We need to close the border,” said Nancy Pineda, a 30-year-old Cucuta fruit seller. “They come with fruit they buy for nothing in Venezuela and sell for prices here that I can’t compete with. They come here, killing and robbing Colombians. We need take our city back.”

That is just what Colombian authorities say they are doing — staging operations several times a day in which they round up migrants lacking valid visas. Jozef Merkx, representative for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in Colombia, said the agency is concerned about the operations. But because Venezuela is not at war, its people are harder to classify as refugees in need of international protection.

“People fleeing Syria were generally seen as refugees, but that’s not the case with Venezuelans,” Merkx said. “Venezuela is not being bombed. It has some of the dimensions [of a refugee crisis], but not all Venezuelans are refugees.”

‘You have to go’

On a recent morning in Cucuta, however, the scene resembled a refu­gee crisis, with women clutching babies and exhausted families toting old suitcases streaming across a border bridge. The most desperate headed straight to the hospital.

“We don’t know where to turn,” said Jose Urriola, 30, standing next to his 18-month-old daughter, Mavis, who languished in a hospital bed. The family had recently arrived from Venezuela. The little girl was malnourished and also had developed a life-threatening heart blockage. The hospital was petitioning national authorities for funds before proceeding with the costly operation.

Winston Martínez, deputy director of Colombia’s migration agency, said the country was not conducting “mass deportations.” Instead, he said, it was carrying out special operations designed to limit the number of Venezuelans without valid visas. He noted that the government is offering Venezuelans who have passports the chance to apply for special resident visas and has already awarded more than 160,000.

“Like any country, we need to have a safe and secure border,” Martinez said. But many Venezuelans weren’t able to get passports in their homeland because of the cost and long wait.

The operations are sending as many as 100 migrants a day back to Venezuela.

Shortly after Andie, the woman in the black shirt and jean shorts, was detained by police, they loaded her onto a truck. About 15 minutes later, she and three dozen other migrants were released at a border bridge swarming with mosquitoes.

One by one, the migrants walked back toward Venezuela as the Colombian officers watched.

And then only Andie was left.

“You have to go,” said a female officer. More than a dozen Colombian officers surrounded the thin Venezuelan.

“I can’t,” Andie said, her voice breaking. “Please. I’m pregnant, and we won’t survive there.”

The officer paused.

“I’m sorry, honey, but you need to go back.”

Andie nodded, then turned. Sobbing and clutching her stomach, she walked across the bridge.

4,colombia,"“In this neighbourhood, everyone is like family,” Raquel Zarraga says of the poor barrio of Las Delicias, near the Colombia–Venezuela border.

“We feel comfortable and secure,” she adds, “even when we are living in a room without a door.”

Zarraga, 35, is one of nearly 600,000 Venezuelan migrants officially living in Colombia, though many suspect the true number to be closer to one million. They were driven from their country – once the most prosperous in Latin America – by a downward spiral of hyperinflation, high crime and shortages of essential goods.

“In Venezuela there was unemployment and lack of food,” Zarraga, originally from the north western town of Tinaquillo, tells i. “We had a house and services but ate only one meal a day.”

Displacement crisis

The extreme downturn, blamed by most analysts on the mismanagement of President Nicholas Maduro’s government, has led to the largest displacement crisis in the western hemisphere. Every day, thousands of Venezuelan migrants cross into Colombia, and there are severe concerns for their health and wellbeing.

Unknown numbers live in desperate and isolated conditions, vulnerable to sexual exploitation or forced recruitment by armed groups. In addition, relief workers are increasingly worried about the xenophobia migrants are encountering. Many have faced discrimination at the hands of Colombians who fear for their jobs.

But in finding a home in Las Delicias, Zarraga says she has gained a new family. Situated on the south-western outskirts of Cúcuta, the notorious border city between Colombia and Venezuela, Las Delicias was unrecognised by the government until 2015.

The community – which still lacks basic infrastructure – is home to around 2,500 people, about half of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs). After years of internal conflict, Colombia has one of the highest IDP rates in the world, with many people living on the fringes of society.

In solidarity

But in Las Delicias, the IDP’s shared experience of displacement has led to an extraordinary empathy and solidarity with the 270 newer arrivals from Venezuela.

“When I came to Colombia, I didn’t know anyone,” says Zarraga. “But after I met Graciella, our families shared a room for four months.”

“It’s very sad to see people in the streets with kids and no food to eat. We help with our hearts and our hands.”

Graciella Sanchez, 39, is a long-term Las Delicias resident and an IDP from Colombia’s Caqueta department. She was forced to flee her home in 2007, after she received an anonymous letter telling her that she could no longer sell food to the military from her small restaurant.

“I decided to leave and travel very far away,” she says. “I left everything, my house, my possessions, and came just with my kids. I didn’t know anyone in Cúcuta.”

A decade later, the deepening crisis in Venezuela led to the arrival of migrants like Zarraga and her family.

Local empathy

“It reminds me of my own situation,” Sanchez says. “Many people had to flee in Colombia and abandon everything.”

After the pair met, Sanchez let Zarraga’s family stay for free in her small house.

“We all lived together for four months, 10 or 11 people under the same roof,” she says. Then, Sanchez had her property extended for her friend’s family, where they now sleep.

“I gave her the room because it was the same thing when I was displaced,” Sanchez says.

“I came here alone, with only my kids. I understand what they are living through.”

The cramped living conditions – three mattresses lie on the floor in a bare brick room – are a step down from Zarraga’s former home in Venezuela. In a front room, there is a wheelbarrow of jerry cans – her daughter, Roxana, a 19-year-old former medical student, illicitly sells petrol by the road for a meagre income.

Life without fear

But here, Zarraga says, her family can eat three times a day and live without the fear of violence that stalks life in Venezuela.

“I left some of my family in Venezuela, but Graciella is like a new family to me,” she says. “I don’t feel neglected, I feel good.”

The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which was previously working with IDPs in the community, has adapted its strategy in Las Delicias and across Colombia to deal with the influx of Venezuelan migrants.

The agency’s workers are concerned about the impact the migration crisis will have on Colombia and fear that the political response has been lacking.

This is echoed by community leaders from Las Delicias and other nearby settlements, who say that resources are already too overstretched to cope with more newcomers.

Stark generosity

But there is also widespread sympathy among Las Delicias residents for their new neighbours. Other Venezuelan families i spoke to also shared stories of stark generosity from their neighbours, who are largely IDPs.

Among them, Lisseth Portillo, 33, who was given a plot of land for free by Luzdelly Mosquera’s family, after she was evicted from a previous home.

Mosquera, an IDP, highlights an important aspect of the current crisis – many Colombians sought refuge in Venezuela during the country’s conflict. Now, the tables have turned.

“We want to help because Venezuelans opened the doors to Colombians in the past,” Mosquera says.

“It’s very sad to see people in the streets with kids and no food to eat,” she adds. “We help with our hearts and our hands.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/from-crisis-in-venezuela-to-haven-in-colombia-the-families-of-south-americas-great-migration/
5,colombia,"Medellín, Colombia (CNN) — Medellín, once dubbed ""the most dangerous city in the world,"" has worked hard to shed that image connected to drugs, gang warfare and gun violence.

The ""City of Eternal Spring,"" as Colombians affectionately call it because of its temperate climate, is fast becoming a tourist hot spot for fine dining, trendy bars and, of course, world-class coffee.

The capital of Antioquia offers visitors the chance to experience the bustling, chaotic Colombian culture amid a backdrop of soaring mountains and leafy coffee plantations.

The flight into Colombia's second-largest city, home to 3 million people, is reason alone to visit. Nestled in a valley, the city clings to the mountainsides, and descending through the low clouds hugging the coffee plantations is spectacular.

Medellín has a wealth of beautiful public spaces, ingenious infrastructure and luxury offerings.

Getting acquainted

Although Pablo Escobar may be the city's most infamous export, Colombian sculptor Fernando Botero, who created his signature large, exaggerated ""Boterismo"" style and first rose to fame in the 1950s, is certainly the city's most revered.

His voluminous, voluptuous art is dotted around the city, while Botero Plaza is a large, bustling square dedicated to the artist's work. And if that isn't enough to satisfy you, the nearby Museum of Antioquia houses a large collection of Botero's paintings.

It's impossible to visit Medellín without coming across some mention of Escobar, the 1980s billionaire drug lord dubbed the ""King of Cocaine,"" and it would be foolish to ignore his impact on the city.

Although there are Escobar tours (the most popular provided by Medellín City Tours for $55), they are frowned upon by locals who are keen to shed the city's violent past. They're interesting, yet other tours also cover Escobar with additional cultural, social and historical insights into the city.

One such walking tour is free to join. Real City Tours is run by Pablo Alvarez-Correa, who earns money by relying on tips from satisfied customers. The tour is so popular you have to book in advance online, so his method appears to be working.

He takes tourists on a whistle-stop tour to some of the best sites in town: Plaza Botero, Parque de las Luces (formerly a spot where the city's homeless gathered, but now renewed with a forest of towering light poles), Iglesia de la Veracruz and the Parque San Antonio. Plus a pit stop for the best empanadas in town at Empanadas Envigadeñas opposite Plaza Botero.

Admiring the infrastructure

Colorful houses and food stalls line the Medellín streets. Lucy Sherriff

Medellín has been hailed worldwide as a beacon for using infrastructure to transform rough, crime-ridden neighborhoods into thriving, tourist-friendly communities.

Comuna 13 is just one example of Medellín's impressive infrastructure. Get a taxi to Cr 109 #36-63 and follow the crowds up to the first ""escalera electrica"" -- one of many escalators built at almost gravity-defying angles into the hilltops to help improve social mobility in the barrio by saving residents the grueling walk up and down the mountainside to reach the city center for work.

It's a long way up, but food and drink stalls line the higgledy-piggledy alleyways, and the view at the top over the Medellín valley will have you lingering for hours.

Although the escaleras made international headlines for their innovation and social impact on the poverty-stricken neighborhood, it's the Metro that really gets ""Paisas"" -- as the region's inhabitants are colloquially known -- waxing lyrical. Built in 1995, during some of the worst years of the country's 50-year conflict -- which recently culminated in a historic peace agreement -- it became a symbol of hope, resilience and pride for the city's residents.

Even though it's 23 years old, the Metro is immaculately clean and graffiti-free, putting New York's subway and London's Underground to shame.

For a more gravity-defying ride, the city's cable cars will sweep you up to the northeast neighborhood of Santo Domingo, where the award-winning modernist Parque Biblioteca España is found. It's another great spot for snapping photographs, admiring wall murals and sampling some of the city's best street food.

Transferring to the Line L metrocable from Santo Domingo will transport you even further out of the city to Parque Arví (open Tuesday to Sunday), where lush forests and waterfalls abound less than 20 miles outside the city center. From the cable car station you can take a horse or a bus to the Piedras Blancas entrance and stroll the trails surrounding the lake.

What to eat

The El Poblado neighborhood is the main destination for most tourists, and the best place to head for bars, nightclubs and trendy coffee shops. Parque Lleras is a leafy square lined with discotecas and can get quite rowdy at night, but by day has some great cafes that wouldn't look out of place in Brooklyn.

The best coffee beans are no longer all exported and independent roasters including Cafe Velvet Pergamino and Urbania are all offering high-end coffee prepared in a variety of methods from French press to siphon.

To truly understand Colombian coffee, you'll need to take a trip out of town to the world-famous Eje Cafetero, or Coffee Triangle.

Andrés Múnera offers one-day or overnight trips to Concordia and Jardín, two of the most beautiful areas in the country, with his LandVenture Travel company.

The groups are small, sometimes just two people, and you're driven deep into the coffee axis, with Múnera providing a running commentary as you snake your way across valleys and rivers, through villages and to the top of mountains.

One of the highlights is picking your own coffee amid the clouds at the Don Modesto plantation, and learning how to brew the perfect cup.

Back in Medellin, El Poblado is making a name for itself as a foodie destination, too. Michelin-star chefs have descended on the upscale barrio in the past few years, opening up a slew of fine-dining and modern establishments to cater to the trendy crowds.

You'll need to book far in advance for Carmen , a Colombian-Californian fusion restaurant run by a couple who both trained at Le Cordon Bleu, but it's worth planning. The fish of the day is fresh from the Pacific Coast, and customers dine in a beautiful room overlooking the open kitchen.

Edgy, urban and recently renovated OCI.Mde is a local favorite, specializing in slow cooking, with the glazed pork shank being the star dish.

For a more traditional Medellín meal, the ""bandeja paisa"" is the pride of Antioquia.

It's a behemoth of a meal; plates are piled high with morcilla, chicharron, red beans stewed with pork, ground meat, chorizo and fried egg, plantain and, naturally, an arepa. Head to Restaurante Hacienda in the old center of town for the most meat you've ever seen in your life.

Where to stay

The best, and safest, place to stay is El Poblado, which offers a range of accommodation from shared dorm hostels to five-star luxury.

The sleek, sexy Charlee Hotel is where the hip hang out. With a rooftop pool, DJ, three floors of gym space and a sushi bar, it's a magnet for the young and beautiful. With only 42 rooms, the high-rise hotel focuses on quality over quantity, and every bedroom is beautifully furnished, with a spacious, modern bathroom and plenty of room to continue the party.

If you're looking for a more relaxed setting, Patio del Mundo delivers with its location in a leafy suburb just a stone's throw from the hubbub of Parque Lleras. Family-run, this seven-bedroom boutique hotel offers a welcome breather from the city.

The lounge opens up onto a beautiful terrace, and guests can walk down the winding path to the outdoor hot tub at the bottom of the garden. Rooms are individually designed, paying homage to the French owners' world travels.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/medellin-colombia-things-to-do/
6,colombia,"Our call to action for Colombia

In 2018, Colombia is going through a period of political and social transition. At the same time, it has a historic opportunity to rescue the voice of more than 8 million victims of the armed conflict.

These are our calls to action in relation to four of the issues that most concern us in the country.

The armed conflict

We urge the newly elected administration and members of parliament in 2018 to make the humanitarian response to victims of the conflict and armed violence a priority in their political agenda. In the years to come, the country's leaders must undertake to comply with the humanitarian aspects of the Peace Agreement and ensure that the resources needed for their implementation are available.

Humanitarian agreements must be adopted as part of the talks between the Government and ELN; such agreements must have a real impact on the lives of people who have suffered because of the conflict.

We reiterate our call to the security forces and all armed groups – including the ELN, AGC, EPL and structures from the former FARC-EP Eastern Bloc that did not join the peace process – to observe international humanitarian law and other humanitarian rules and keep the civil population out of hostilities.

We remind the State of its obligation to limit the use of force under an IHL framework to groups involved in situations of armed conflict, as defined under international law.

Missing persons

The Missing Persons Search Unit (UBPD) must maintain its extrajudicial and humanitarian roles and have sufficient human and financial resources allocated to it.

Victims' organizations need support to strengthen their position and participate in the search process:

Family members must always be included, receive information and be treated with dignity. State authorities must respond effectively to their needs.

We remind all parties that are or have been involved in the armed conflict of their obligation to provide any useful information they might have concerning the fate of people reported missing during the conflict.

Vulnerable regions

It is urgent for the Colombian State to ensure that it has a constant presence in the country's most isolated areas, with a focus on social reconstruction (e.g. guaranteeing basic services, ensuring public participation, taking advantage of sustainable opportunities). Any such State presence should not be limited to land or police control.

We call on the State to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of communities affected by new types of armed violence, including the most vulnerable urban areas.

""When oil spills happen, just coming into contact with oil in the short term has incredibly horrible side-effects,"" Wolff says.

Oil spills not only affect the flora and fauna of the environment, but farmland as well. Contaminated fields prevent locals from cultivating the land, and chemically poisoned fish—a protein-packed dietary staple—must be taken out of the diet.

In addition to the symptoms reported by the Colombian locals, people suffering from oil contamination can experience respiratory issues, skin rashes, fatigue, and seemingly undiagnosed illnesses lasting months or years. Spill-related conditions can also kill children. (Related: ""Gulf Oil Spill Helps Explain Air Pollution Mystery"")

Wolff adds that it can take days for local government to get involved right after a spill, so community members are often left to try to clean up their environment without adequate protection. Not enough studies have been done on the lasting consequences of oil spills, she says, since government intervention normally stops 60 days after the initial spill.

""There is continual danger for years and years of what’s in the fish and what's in the water,"" Wolff says. ""If you ruin the water and the land that people depend on, their livelihood is gone.""

Hope for the Future

Local and international attention can shed light on oil spills and their consequences, ultimately helping communities recover over time.

""Usually, people are just really angry or upset for a long time to come,"" Wolff says. She adds that cases locals brought to court about the Peruvian oil spills ""kind of sent the message to the country that people were not OK with this.""

She says long-term medical care and financial support are crucial for helping communities respond to these types of disasters, as are support and recognition from the government.

Oil-Eating Bacteria Could Be a Solution to Spill Cleanups April 18, 2015 —Five years after the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oil remains on some marshland and inside plant tissues.

8,colombia,"El Estrecho, Colombia - For more than 35 years, Blanca Ducuara Gomez lived in Colombia's mountains, patrolling the countryside as a member of the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

But today she lives in a FARC disarmament camp (also known as reintegration areas) in the southern state of Cauca, where she has a perfect view of the lush valley and the surrounding mountains from her small, wooden balcony that she now calls home.

The FARC sprung up as a peasant movement in the 1960s, fighting corruption and huge inequality in the country, especially in rural areas. What resulted was a civil war that lasted more than 50 years and saw over 220,000 people killed and seven million displaced.

One year ago, Gomez finally put down her weapons after a landmark peace deal was signed, and entered a demobilisation camp created to help the rebels transition into citizen life.

However, like many of the other, former combatants, Gomez has become disillusioned by the peace process, saying the government isn't following through on its commitments to reintegration. This includes everything from housing to medical services and work opportunities, all of which were promised in the peace agreement.

""At the moment, it's hard for us, and a lot of people feel it,"" said Gomez, from her camp in El Estrecho, in the southern state of Cauca where the FARC once had a major stronghold. ""Many people have left because the government hasn't complied [with its agreements].""

According to Gomez, people in the camps were initially optimistic about the future of peace in Colombia. They even nicknamed her son ""el hijo de la paz"", or the son of peace, since he was born on November 24, 2016 - the same day the landmark agreement was signed.

But today, there are less than 50 former rebels living in the El Estrecho camp, out of the 315 who originally demobilised in this area last year.

{articleGUID}

The figures are similar in camps across the country. The UN recently calculated that more than 55 percent of all the FARC members have left the 26 reincorporation zones.

Many of them have left to join their families back home, find jobs in other regions, or are even suspected of joining dissident factions or other armed groups.

But the reasons for leaving are often the same; there is not enough motivation to stay in the camps.

Lacks running water, proper homes

Of all the 26 reincorporation zones, El Estrecho is an extreme example of underdevelopment. The camp lacks running water, the former combatants all share one toilet, and people are still living in makeshift tarpaulin tents made of plastic.

{articleGUID}

But El Estrecho is also a new zone. The former combatants relocated here in December last year from their previous location of Policarpa, Narino, saying the government failed to comply with any of its development promises, including basic housing, which was meant to be finished before they even laid down their arms last January.

Officials say the lack of development in Policarpa was due to its complicated and remote location, a common problem for most of the reincorporation camps.

""The [demobilisation] areas where the FARC built are areas that are very difficult to access,"" said Luis Hernando Moreno, regional coordinator of the Office of the High Commissioner for Peace (OACP), the main liaising body between the FARC and the government.

""Policarpa was so far out there, even the guerrillas couldn't get there,"" Hernando continued.

But this highlights an important reality for Colombia, where more than 40 percent of the rural population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank, and where state investment in public infrastructure, particularly roads, schools or hospitals is rare.

In many rural areas, like Policarpa, roads either don't exist or were made by the communities themselves. This is one of the major, structural reasons the war began in the first place. A lingering and important issue, rural reform is the first point in the peace agreements.

The local FARC leaders expect things to be different in El Estrecho, which is only nine kilometres from the Pan-American highway. They say officials have no excuse for resources not getting to the camp.

'Things are moving too slow'

Apart from the basics of housing and water, the biggest concern for the former combatants here is receiving help to develop their own economic projects.

{articleGUID}

This includes land for agricultural use and funding for entrepreneurial or cooperative projects, two of the main demands across all of the camps.

According to Leovigildo Moreno Zambrano, a member of the FARC's pedagogy unit, now in El Estrecho, things are moving ""very slow. Too slow.

""What is lacking is real political will on the part of the state,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Most of the former fighters do have bank accounts and identification cards and are receiving a small monthly stipend of roughly $230.

These are just three points in the peace deal the government has complied with so far, directed at the former rebels individually.

But without productive projects, or education and work training, the former rebels struggle to fill their days.

According to Moreno, the FARC is playing politics by focusing on what the government is not doing, rather than providing solutions.

""The politics of the FARC right now are to show the defects of the other, instead of transforming,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""You have to blame the state, because in some way that helps to delegitimise the state and legitimise your discourse.""

There are no laws forcing the former rebels to stay in their territories, but the outflow of people is raising alarm bells among international monitors.

In November, the UN warned the exodus was a troubling sign that may be increasing the number of FARC dissident groups, and told the Colombian government that it must ""substantially accelerate"" its reintegration effort.

The former FARC combatants are also a prime recruitment target for other armed groups that continue to exist in Colombia's rural areas.

These include paramilitary groups, narcotraffickers, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and other, smaller groups.

According to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has long worked with war victims in Colombia's countryside, the only way out of this cycle is to give the demobilised rebels alternative opportunities to avoid recruitment.

The NRC has implemented high-school education programmes in several of the FARC camps for this very reason, after an evaluation of the former rebel fighters showed that more than 80 percent had not finished high school.

""The fact that some have left without receiving a process of reincorporation, yes we see it as a big risk,"" said Christian Visnes, the NRC's Country Director in Colombia.

""We offer education so that these people can reincorporate into civil life; that's the first step to ending the war,"" he said.

'It's very frustrating'

In November, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos admitted that the government has made mistakes in the process, but told the country to ""be patient"".

{articleGUID}

But since Colombia is in an election year, many citizens are already looking forward to what a new government will bring, rather than expecting new commitments from Santos, who will not be up for re-election, nor does he have a direct successor.

According to the latest polls, left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro is in the lead, but Ivan Duque, a member of the far-right Democratic Centre (Centro Democratico) party and vocal adversary of the peace agreement, is not far behind.

On March 11, Colombians held congressional elections, where the Democratic Centre party and other right-wing candidates won most of the seats. But, the number of Green Party and other alternative party seats also doubled - including the 10 spaces saved for members of the FARC, as agreed in the peace agreements



Back in El Estrecho, Blanca Gomez says being patient for politicians to implement change isn't always easy, especially when people continue to lack resources in the camp and they consistently hear about violence increasing in certain areas in the country, including the assassinations of some of their own colleagues.

""We have to wait to see what solution the government is going to give,"" said Blanca. ""But us here without arms or anything. It's very frustrating.""",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/farc-rebels-leaving-reintegration-camps-180327141706796.html

10,colombia,"Cucuta, Colombia - A pink stroller is surrounded by rubbish where children covered in dirt linger around a makeshift camp under a bridge in Colombia's Cucuta.

The anesthetised gaze in the children's eyes reflects their precarious health situation which worsens by the week.

They are sheltering from the scorching sun in the shadow of a bridge that connects Venezuela with Colombia. This a point of relief for many Venezuelans who have faced the hardship of a long trip fleeing the humanitarian and economic crisis facing their home.

Under the bridge, the crude reality of the migration crisis is impossible to miss.

About 550,000 Venezuelans left for Colombia at the end of 2017, according to migration authorities. There has been a 62 percent increase in the second half of last year, with many crossing on foot.

Among those fleeing are complete indigenous clans who are trying to escape hunger in Venezuela and are hoping to receive medical aid for themselves and their children in Colombia.

There are two main entrance points to get from Venezuela to the Colombian border city Cucuta. The Simon Bolivar Bridge, crossed daily by thousands and a symbol for the mass exodus of Venezuelan refugees, and the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, a quieter border crossing under which rights groups are saying a humanitarian disaster is taking place.

It is here that a number of indigenous groups can be found. They either waded through the river or were able to cross the bridge before access was restricted.

Under the bridge, people rest on the ground as underfed toddlers with bloated bellies and babies with scabies roam around.

""The children are dying because of the lack of medicines and food,"" says the 38-year-old Remigio Segundo Romero Yordes.

Romero belongs to a complete indigenous Yukpa clan, of about 150 persons that left their ancestral lands of the Sierra de Perija, in Venezuela's Zulia state, just across the border.

At a distance of a few hundred metres, two additional Yukpa clans add to the more than 700 indigenous refugees who have crossed to Colombia, according to the local ombudsman's office of Colombia. The majority are living in dire conditions.

The ombudsman's office tells Al Jazeera that many of the children here have tuberculosis and are malnourished.

Nevertheless, staying in Venezuela was not an option according to Romero.

""When [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro received power from [late President] Chavez, he terminated everything,"" Romero says. ""There is no food and there are no medicines.""

The indigenous hope to receive aid and support in Colombia and are determined to stay.

An uncertain future

Last year, inflation in Venezuela reached at least 2,600 percent and this year it is expected to overtake 13,000 percent, according to the IMF.

{articleGUID}

Meanwhile, there are severe food and medicine shortages, which worsen every week. The homicide rate is among the highest in the world and the government has cracked down on opponents.

Most of the indigenous people who have fled to Colombia sleep in makeshift tents made from branches and rubbish bags.

Children can be seen playing cards under canopies. Some have a dry rash all over their body. Women often hang up clothes they washed in the dirty waters of the Tachira River, which is also used for consumption.

Today, the Yukpa survive by selling hats and baskets on the streets of Cucuta - a chaotic, dusty city and a sprawling open-air market for Venezuelan contraband goods.

Older women braid hats that are sold at the entrance of the bridge by a few men who try to get the attention of passersby.

They say they feel completely abandoned, adding that the Colombian government is not aiding them.

""Better said, they are threatening us,"" says Romero, who first arrived in August 2017.

He says that the Colombian government already deported them to Venezuela three times for not having valid identity papers, but they came back every time.

The municipality did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.

Binational tribe

The Yukpa belong to a binational tribe that lives on both sides of the border.

{articleGUID}

Olga Lucia Fuentes, a Colombian consultant in development, human rights and peace, says that Colombia's Constitutional Court ordered the state in 2009 to formulate plans to ethnically safeguard the survival of all Yukpas, whose existence was previously under threat by the Colombian internal conflict.

Most Yukpa do not possess identity papers, however, and it is hard for them to prove their binationality. Horacio Guerrero, Director of Indigenous Affairs of Colombia's Ministry of the Interior, said Venezuela did not respond it the ministry's request to establish the identity of the Yukpa. They are, therefore, treated as regular foreigners by Venezuelan authorities.

Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos announced last month that only Venezuelans with a valid passport and holders of a migration border card, of which no new ones are issued, can enter Colombia.

According to Pedro Santiago Posada Arango, director of indigenous issues from the national Ombudsman's office in Colombia, however, the Yukpa are ""an indigenous border community [and] they have all the rights to enter Colombia, independently of whether they are registered in on or in both countries"".

He adds that the Yukpa ""should be treated as border peoples and therefore should receive help and attention"".

Posada stresses that the situation is very complicated and that there needs to be an assessment of those living under and near the Francisco de Paula Santander Bridge.

He says that errors have been made and that the regular requirements cannot be asked from the Yukpa, because of their special status.

Additionally, Christian Visnes, director of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Colombia, says Colombia signed up to the Cartagena agreement and, therefore, cannot deport refugees of any kind.

""Every person that has humanitarian needs should be received and their humanitarian needs should be attended,"" Visnes tells Al Jazeera.

He suspects that the state might be afraid of attracting more indigenous Yukpa if aid is given, but ""in this case, it's evident that there are humanitarian needs and, therefore, they should not be deported"".

'We will end up dead'

For the Yukpa themselves, it is a matter of life or death.

{articleGUID}

""It's like escaping from boiling water and they throw us right back in,"" Romero explains.

""We will end up dead,"" he says as he fears the consequences of the grave health situation of his clan.

There is also distrust between the indigenous groups and Colombian authorities.

On a few occasions, when the Family Welfare state-institute handed out milk and bread, they also asked which children were ill, sometimes removing children from the makeshift camps.

""I haven't seen my baby in a month,"" wails Milagro, a 17-year-old mother, who only gave her first name, tells Al Jazeera.

Milagro watched as Family Welfare took away her child, she says, adding that she has no idea where her daughter was taken.

According to Gladys Navarro Uribe, president of the Colombian Red Cross - section Norte de Santander, the children who are removed are taken care of by the Family Welfare institute.

A source with Family Welfare, who asked not to be named, also says the Colombian state sometimes removes children found in ""vulnerability or in danger, and with health problems"". The source adds that the children are placed in substitute homes from the institute and are taken back as soon as they are ready to return.

Additionally, the source denies that the Yukpa are deported, but rather ""returned"" to their lands, adding that their presence under the bridge is a disturbance to the nearby neighbourhoods.

To compound the misery of the Yukpa, many often wade the river water to go back to the Venezuelan border to receive food - though rotten - that they cannot obtain on the Colombian side.

Indigenous women who fear being detained and deported, choose to wade through the deeper parts of the river to bring food, often carrying young children with them.

If they are caught, the food is often taken by Colombian customs authorities, the Yukpa say.

""Sometimes, the women take about 10 kilos. The DIAN [Colombian customs] take the food from them saying that it is contraband,"" says the 39-year old Bertilio Gonzalez, a member of one of the three Yukpa clans. ""This is for our consumption!"" Gonzalez adds.

DIAN authorities maintain that the food that is taken does ""not comply with sanitary standards"".

Such food seizures have led to violent confrontations between the Yukpa and the DIAN, illustrating a crisis that looks certain to deepen.

Back at the makeshift camp where Romero lives, he waves his arms as he goes on about the binationality of his peoples.

""They do not recognise us as indigenous, but rather as regular Venezuelans,"" he says.

""We can cross the border without documents!"" he says while walking through the rubbish.

""In the [Colombian and Venezuelan] constitution, the indigenous are recognised!""",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/indigenous-yukpa-face-humanitarian-crisis-fleeing-venezuela-180310123952276.html

With the death of “El Indio,” the Urabeños’ third-in-command, Colombian security forces have dealt another blow to the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the country, a sign that authorities are closing in on the group’s top leader.

Colombian police announced in a March 28 press release that Manuel Arístides Meza Páez, alias “El Indio,” was shot down during an aerial assault operation in the northern department of Córdoba.

The raid that led to El Indio’s killing was part of “Operation Agamemnon II,” a joint effort between the police and the military aimed at taking out the Urabeños’ leadership and weakening the group’s finances. Over the past seven months, the operation has led to the downfall of Roberto Vargas Gutiérrez, alias “Gavilán,” and Luis Orlando Padierna, alias “Inglaterra,” both of whom were high-ranking Urabeños bosses. Security forces have also successfully dismantled several of the group’s drug trafficking routes and intercepted large drug shipments.

According to the police statement, this was the sixth operation directly targeting El Indio, and it was carried out based on information about his location obtained by the national police intelligence unit. Army Commander Alberto Mejía described it as “the most important and forceful blow to [the Urabeños] in 2018.”

El Indio was the Urabeños’ finance chief and head of operations in the Magdalena Medio region as well as on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. He also served as a middleman with criminal actors in Central America and Mexico to facilitate drug trafficking operations. Revenues from these activities were reportedly laundered through shell companies and other properties.

The police report adds that El Indio commanded more than 200 men and was under investigation for a series of targeted murders. Moreover, according to El Tiempo, the crime boss orchestrated “Plan Pistola,” an assassination operation in late 2016 targeting security forces in the northwestern Urabá region.

InSight Crime Analysis

The death of El Indio represents another decisive blow to the Urabeños’ structure and criminal enterprise.

As a key actor in the group’s financial and drug trafficking activities, Meza Páez was likely one of the bosses who brought in the greatest revenues for the organization. Therefore, his absence will undoubtedly affect the Urabeños’ finances.

Meza Páez’s killing also reduces the ranks of an already-thinning Urabeños leadership, a clear indication that authorities are closing in on the organization’s top leader, Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel.” After the death of Gavilán, Otoniel offered to surrender to authorities, but continued operations against the Urabeños show that the government intends to continue its head-on assault against the group.

With a number of top lieutenants out of the picture, Otoniel will have to replace his inner circle with people who do not necessarily have the same level of experience and knowledge as their predecessors. And given the authorities’ unrelenting pressure, combined with the Urabeños’ ongoing decentralization, the group is primed for more dramatic fragmentation.

The deaths of ringleaders like El Indio not only affect the Urabeños at the national level, but also the local level. Now that the Urabeños’ operations on the Pacific coast are leaderless, competing groups like the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) could try to scoop up territory that the weakened group no longer has the power to control.",https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/in-latest-blow-to-urabenos-colombia-government-takes-down-el-indio/

Venezuela is experiencing severe shortages of medicines and basic goods.

The US said the money would provide fleeing Venezuelans and the Colombian communities hosting them with emergency food and health assistance.

Colombian officials estimate that about 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed the border in recent years.

'Humanitarian disaster'

The announcement about ""this initial, and immediate commitment of $2.5m"" was made by the administrator of the US Agency of International Development (USAid), Mark Green.

Mr Green put the blame for the Venezuelan exodus on the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

""Regrettably, this crisis in Venezuela, which is now spilling into the broader region, is man-made - the result of continued political mismanagement and corruption by the Maduro regime,"" Mr Green said.

The US government has been highly critical of President Maduro and has placed sanctions on him and other high-ranking members of his government and the military.

On Monday, in his latest move targeting the government in Caracas, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring US companies and citizens from dealing in Venezuela's crypto-currency, the Petro.

The economic and political crisis in Venezuela has also been one of the main talking points in a meeting between Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Brazilian President Michel Temer in Brasilia on Tuesday.

While the number of Venezuelans which have crossed into Brazil is believed to be in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands who left for Colombia, Brazilian border states are feeling the strain.

On Tuesday, Venezuelans who were squatting in a building in the town of Mucajaí in Roraima state in northern Brazil were driven out by residents angry over the killing of a local person.

About 300 residents protested in front of the building and burned the possessions of the Venezuelan migrants after police said the two suspects in the murder were Venezuelan nationals.",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-43476672
13,colombia,"After more than 50 years of warfare characterized by intense fighting, a rash of kidnappings and bloody massacres, Colombian rebels signed a peace accord with the government in November 2016 and, seven months later, laid down their weapons. The former rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC in Spanish) turned to soccer as one of the ways to integrate into civilian life.

Editor's note: Because of safety concerns, all subjects interviewed for this photo essay are under assumed names.

Kleider Palma put on rubber boots, the ones used for patrolling as a guerrilla, and hung his soccer cleats around his neck. He boarded the metal boat, or panga, and, along with some assembled FARC comrades, headed toward the nearby village of Vegaez in northwestern Colombia. The stated mission was not a skirmish with government forces as in the past but an afternoon of soccer, the sport that ignites passion in war or peace.

""We would carry 70 kilos [154 pounds] on our backs and walk up to 30 km [19 miles] a day up on the mountains. The first thing we would do before camping would be to clear a field with our machetes so we could play soccer. Sports have always been part of our guerrilla way of life,"" said Kleider, who saw his dream of becoming a professional soccer player cut short by the civil conflict in Colombia.

After 53 years of guerrilla warfare, in June 2017, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, turned in their weapons to the United Nations, signaling a new era of peace for Colombia. Now FARC is transforming itself into a new political party and reinserting thousands of former guerrillas into civilian life. Some local media reports even point to eventual participation in the national soccer league.

""We approached Dimayor [Colombia's professional soccer authority], and we asked if we could include two B division teams, one of women and another of men, all former fighters, in the association. We have the talent to play against professional teams, like América de Cali or Nacional de Medellín. We should give our men and women that chance,"" said Walter Mendoza, the sports director for FARC, who spoke with an assumed name because of security concerns.

The first step in this ambitious endeavor of launching a FARC soccer club involves scouting talent through clinics set up in the majority of the 26 transitional settlements where the estimated 7,000 former rebels have demobilized. This is compounded by the overall financing of such a club, as FARC notoriously funded itself during war by means that included drug trafficking and kidnapping ransoms.

Meantime, in most of the FARC settlements, former fighters are playing in and winning local soccer tournaments. At the Tumaco settlement on Colombia's Pacific coast, self-sustaining projects are underway, and the players are selling raffles to buy equipment and cover travel to tournaments.

""We've started to see an increase in local communities participating in sports events. Soccer is a way for us to win hearts and minds,"" said Edison Romana, an alias for the once-feared FARC commander who now runs a settlement.

Colombia, which will hold presidential elections in May, on Wednesday blocked access to the Pig.gi app, which gives users free top-ups in exchange for receiving ads and completing surveys. The app has more than a million downloads in Colombia and Mexico combined.

The regulator said the app might be connected to Cambridge Analytica, accused by a whistleblower of improperly accessing data to target U.S. and British voters in recent elections.

A representative for the app told Reuters in an email on Thursday that Pig.gi did not have a relationship with the consultancy in the Andean country and that it has not shared any data gained from surveys of Colombian users with Cambridge Analytica.

Pig.gi also said it had not yet been informed of the ban by the Colombian regulator.

“Pig.gi users have the choice to share their opinions consensually in exchange for internet connectivity coins. Their opinions are always anonymized before they are sent in accordance with Colombian and Mexican law,” the app said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.

The app cut ties with Cambridge Analytica in Mexico after the data scandal broke, saying it had shared results of two election polls of Mexican users with the consultancy and other partners.

The commerce regulator said it would comment when its investigation had concluded.

Facebook said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network. The company says the information of about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.

Cambridge Analytica has denied Facebook data was used to help to build profiles on American voters and build support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-politics-cambridge-analytica/colombia-data-not-shared-with-cambridge-analytica-blocked-cellphone-app-idUSKBN1H5308

Amelia sat on a bench outside her one-room straw-roofed hut knitting a handbag while her toddler grandsons played nearby in the dirt. They were skinny, and itchy-looking red rashes spread up their arms. “They spend days without eating,” said Amelia.

She told me she sold the colorful bags she knits for the equivalent of five US dollars each—though they are sold for as much as $50 online. But such handicrafts don’t go far to alleviate the dire malnutrition suffered by the Wayuu, Colombia’s largest indigenous group.

A gathering of officials this week in Paris could help bring them relief. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)—a prestigious agency of mostly high-income countries that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world—is examining Colombia’s application to join.

Membership is one of President Juan Manuel Santos’s longstanding ambitions and few hurdles remain. But on March 22, the OECD’s Employment, Labour and Social Affairs Committee will scrutinize whether Colombia is doing enough to “assist people without work, and other vulnerable groups, to combat poverty.” In the case of the Wayuu, it is not.

The hunger crisis is rooted in government’s serious failures of governance—including extremely poor access to basic services, limited government efforts to root out local corruption, and an insufficient response to the crisis. Among the causes is limited access to food and water–made worse by the humanitarian crisis in neighboring Venezuela, just across the border.

Three of Amelia’s seven children died before reaching adulthood, she told me, and that devastating rate of loss is not so unusual among the Wayuu. Limited access to water and food has fueled the needless deaths of scores of Wayuu during the past two years, and it is eroding the health of thousands. The crisis is well-known in Colombia for its devastating effect on children. An average of almost one indigenous child under five has died of causes linked to malnutrition every week throughout the past two years, the government reports.

But the suffering of Wayuu women and children often goes unnoticed. On my recent visits, many stoic women like Amelia gave me a glimpse of their suffering and sacrifices. I found Marcela*, for example, a pregnant woman, sweaty and dusty, on the road to Luace, her tiny rural community. For prenatal checkups, Marcela has to ride a motor scooter for an hour over bumpy dirt roads—little more than rutted paths—to reach a clinic in the town of Paraiso. She had arrived for her latest appointment at 7 a.m. the previous day and waited seven hours to see a doctor—which was typical, she said. But poor access to medical care is only part of the problem for pregnant women like Marcela. “Sometimes we eat twice a day; sometimes once and that’s it,” she told me.

On the Guajira Peninsula, some pregnant or breastfeeding women have reportedly died of causes linked to malnutrition. Shipia Wayuu, an indigeous rights group, documented four cases in 2017. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has asked the Colombian government to take immediate action to address the Wayuu women’s crisis.

The government has promised to act, but its efforts have fallen short, speaking volumes about Colombia’s commitment to the Wayuu. Government food programs for children in the villages I visited often ran short. Many doctors and nurses lacked medicine to treat children. And several wells dug by the government were not operating or provided only salty water.

In one community at the southern end of the peninsula, a woman and girl filled buckets from a mossy receptacle exposed to the elements at a newly-dug public well. They bathed, sluicing themselves with fetid, reeking water speckled with insects.

While Wayuu women suffer the lack of services and the ravages of hunger, they also serve in leadership roles in the fight for a decent life. Despite rigid traditional gender roles in Wayuu communities, it was often women—as teachers, community leaders, or nurses—who were doing the most, in the villages I visited, to help their neighbours. Dolores*, a cook for a government program that provides hot meals to poor children in a community at the eastern tip of the penninsula, was typical of these quiet heroes.

She struggles to feed her own family, but at times asks her daughter not to eat at the meal program. The rice, vegetables, and meat the private company that operates the program provides is often insufficient, she said, so she spends a chunk of her own $300 monthly salary to buy more. Many cooks and teachers on the peninsula told me that, like Dolores, they use their salaries to help feed the children of their villages.

I met Maria, 19, in the town of Manaure, and when I told her I couldn’t visit her home village of Camasia to do research, she decided to do her own reporting there. Through her cellphone recordings of relatives, I learned that Maria’s people generally eat only once a day and sometimes, day after day, drink only chicha–a corn gruel. The village goes weeks without access to water, and Maria’s relatives walk for more than an hour-and-a-half to fill their buckets.

Now is the time for the Employment, Labour and Social Affairs Committee of the OECD to shine a spotlight on the Wayuu crisis—and to examine the inadequate steps Colombian authorities have taken to address it. The committee should ask the Colombian goverment for a serious action plan to address the crisis, with concrete benchmarks and a vigorous verification system. Right now, the OECD has all the leverage it needs to press Colombia to alleviate the suffering of selfless women like Dolores and Maria—and help them save many more lives.

16,colombia,"During an official visit to Colombia to visit EU aid projects and meet with government officials, Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides has announced today €31 million for humanitarian aid and disaster preparedness for Latin America and the Caribbean.

""The European Union's commitment to support Latin America is stronger than ever. Here in Colombia, our new EU funding will help on two fronts: addressing the humanitarian consequences of the decades-long conflict in the country and helping reinforce the region's preparedness and response to natural disasters. We have also announced new funding for those affected by the crisis in Venezuela: supporting those in need is a priority for the EU."" said Commissioner Stylianides.

The Commissioner met with Colombian President Santos in Bogota where he reiterated the EU's commitment to stand side by side in the country's path to peace and prosperity. Over recent days, he also visited Quibdo, in the Choco department, an area greatly affected by conflict as well as the border town of Cucuta where there has been an upsurge in those fleeing Venezuela.

The funding announced today is part of an overall humanitarian aid package for the region, with €6 million going for Colombia. A further €2 million will go to those people affected by the crisis in Venezuela.

This comes on top of the EU's other aid programmes and support to the region such as the EU Trust Fund for Colombia. Since 1994, the Commission has provided over €1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on the populations most affected by natural disasters and violence, and preparing communities to withstand future hazards.

Background

The overall humanitarian aid package announced today supports a range of concrete projects in the region, in addition to the funding for Colombia and Venezuela.

The funding includes €6.9 million for food assistance, disaster risk reduction and support to those affected by violence in Central America (particularly Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua) and Mexico. €3 million will support disaster risk reduction activities in the South American region (notably Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru). €5 million is for emergency food assistance in Haiti, with a further €6.3 million going for disaster risk reduction in the country. €2 million will support disaster risk reduction and resilience interventions in the Caribbean.

The Latin America and Caribbean region is one of the world's most disaster-prone areas. Natural hazards affect thousands every year - particularly the most vulnerable populations living in poverty, in remote areas with limited access to basic services, such as indigenous peoples. Conflict and violence also plague several Latin American and Caribbean countries. Despite the ongoing peace negotiations, Colombia's long-standing internal conflict has caused the internal displacement of 7.3 million people, with spill-over effects in the whole region.

17,colombia,"The Simon Bolivar bridge has become symbolic of the mass exodus of migrants from Venezuela. The crossing is also just one piece in the complex puzzle facing Colombia, as it struggles to absorb the increasing number of migrants prompted by its neighbour’s economic and social meltdown.

Up to 45,000 migrants cross on foot from Venezuela to Cúcuta every day. The Colombian city has become the last hope for many fleeing Venezuela’s crumbling economy. Already four million people, out of a population of 30 million, have fled Venezuela due to chronic shortages of food and medicine.

Venezuelans, who have crossed the border, describe what life is like in their home country.

“Back there, there is no food, you can’t find anything. There are no medicines. We had to come here to vaccinate the baby,” one woman says.

“At home we only have electricity for two hours a day. We have water from one to three hours every two days. There is no gas,” says another man.

“It’s a challenge to be able to get everyone in our family to sit at the table to have at least one meal a day,” adds another man.

Now in its firth year of recession, critics blame both government incompetence and corruption in Venezuela for the country’s economic crisis.

Crippled by hyperinflation, last year inflation topped 2600%. This year the IMF expects it to hit 13,000%.

President Nicolas Maduro recently announced plans to change the face value of the country’s bolivar currency, knocking three zeros off.

Despite that redenomination, the real value of the minimum wage in Venezuela still only amounts to six US dollars a month.

For those making the journey, Colombia offers a way out of the mess.

“It is much cheaper here and you can get anything. You can find mayonnaise, toilet paper, the essential things needed to feel human. There is no toilet paper or napkins back home. How is it possible that one litre of petrol costs one bolivar and one litre of water costs 5,000, for the love of God!,” says one man.

The bridge from Venezuela to Cúcuta is the main border point between the two Latin American neighbours.

Scores of small businesses have sprung up – from stalls offering to buy hair to wheelchair-taxi services – proof of people’s ingenuity in the face of extreme adversity.

It is estimated more than a million Venezuelans have settled in Colombia. On arrival they are not considered refugees.

But irrespective of whether those fleeing want to live in Colombia – or simply use it is as a gateway elsewhere – they first need to be allowed in, as Rafael Zavala from the UNHCR explains.

“In order to enter Colombia, they need a passport. There are people who manage to get the border mobility card, which is a temporary permit. In addition to that, about a year ago Colombia created a special visa, which is another way of establishing yourself once you are already in the country. To obtain it you must have entered Colombia regularly, with your passport stamped.”

To stem the flow of migrants from Venezuela, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos recently announced an end to the border mobility card scheme.

The temporary visas were the most common documents used by poor Venezuelans given the difficulty of obtaining a passport.

One man crossing the border tells us: “You cannot get a passport. You can get one if you pay. They were asking for around 10 million bolivares. A salary is about 400-500 thousand bolivares. This means half a million bolivares, and we are talking 10 million. That’s more than one year’s salary to pay for a passport”

With neither the correct documents or the right to work, thousands of Venezuelans – who once held decent jobs at home – have been reduced to begging for food and small change in Cúcuta.

At one shelter run by the Catholic Church, they distribute more than 1,000 free meals a day. Some just cross the bridge for the food.

One man tells us: “The situation is horrible. We come here because in San Cristobal there is no food. I worked at the Town Hall of San Cristobal, but the money wasn’t enough to eat.”

Others cross the border in the hope of finding any sort of job to send some money back home – many families have been split apart.

One mother trying to find work in the city says: “Venezuela is a country which makes me deeply sad because I’ve left my three children behind in order to come here and find a job to send them some money. What would I do if I brought them here? Where would I keep them? I could not keep them on the street.”

Euronews: “Where are you going to sleep tonight?”

“I don’t know. Perhaps in the street, wherever I can find,” she says.

The epicentre of Venezuela’s migrant exodus in Colombia is in the historically volatile region of Norte de Santander.

Armed groups still control vast swaths here, despite a peace deal with FARC in 2016.

That officially ended the 52-year conflict but many of Colombia’s internally displaced now live in Cúcuta’s poorest districts, while the number of Venezuelan migrants entering the city’s vulnerable neighbourhoods since August is believed to have risen from zero to 3000.

Church missionaries who work in the city’s poorest areas say the migrants run a huge risk of exploitation.

Father Francesco Bortignon tells us: “This massive influx of Venezuelans, many of whom are trained professionals, has obviously presented a big opportunity for dishonest employers. They can make half promises, pay badly or not pay them at all. The migrants can also be recruited and sent somewhere. They can be asked to harvest coffee, or even coca leaves.”

Faced with large numbers of migrants, Colombia has called for international help. The EU’s chief for Humanitarian Aid Christos Stylianides recently met President Santos and also visited Cúcuta for himself.

During the visit he announced Europe would be providing an addition 31 million euros in funding – 2 million of which will go to Venezuela and 6 million to Colombia.

“For the Colombian authorities it is a huge challenge to deal with this unprecedented situation, because of course they face also their challenges in their country about the reconciliation process and the peace process. So, our humanitarian aid is going to both sides, inside Venezuela and inside Colombia. Especially in Venezuela we are trying a lot, in order to find ways in particular to provide medicines and to find projects to deal with acute malnutrition,” Stylianides said.

International aid agencies are also working with the Colombian government to provide more shelter for the migrants.

But President Santos has been heavily criticised over Colombia’s efforts to stem the migrant flow.

The head of one migration centre, Willinton Muñoz Sierra, believes Bogota’s stricter policy could backfire by actually increasing the number of illegal entries.

“The measures taken by the Government are effectively a diplomatic closure of the border. Now Venezuelans need a passport or a special permit to enter. Everything is much more complex. The alternative for migrants is to go via illegal entry points. Everyone knows there are criminal groups acting outside the law. This puts the migrants welfare at risk, “he says.

Since February the authorities in Colombia claim migrant numbers have dropped by more than 30%.

They also say nearly 1,500 people have been repatriated.

The Venezuelans we spoke to branded the new measures as “deportations”. One young man forced onto the street, despite having a passport, , was among them.

“As a Venezuelan citizen when I arrive in another country I know there are laws that must be observed. I am working and looking for a legal way to earn a living and get by every day. You cannot evict me from the country and even less take the merchandise as they have done. In Venezuela there are six million Colombians that make a living there and still do very well. But when I come here, they want to throw me out? Why? Where is the justice in that? What did Bolivar want? A united nation. There is xenophobia in Colombia. There is xenophobia because we are Venezuelans.”

From the Colombian border Euronews’ Monica Pinna says the plight of many migrants remains desperate.

Yolima Dussán/Diálogo |

Colombia’s disaster response system led to an increase in the number of relief missions in local communities, and also provided assistance during recent disasters in Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Costa Rica. The system is built around several public and private entities, and community and military organizations brought together under the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management (UNGDR, in Spanish). UNGDR was established in 2008 by the National Center for Personnel Rescue (CNRP, in Spanish) that the Colombian Air Force (FAC in Spanish) operates to aid the civilian population. The unit is based at the Military Air Transport Command in Bogotá.

Transfers and aeromedical evacuations are FAC’s most frequently flown missions. (Photo: Colombian Air Force)

“The level of disaster response coordination that Colombia attained saves more lives each time,” FAC Major Ricardo Ovalle, coordinator of Joint Operations for CNRP and UNGDR, told Diálogo. “FAC plays a decisive role in this process. It’s round-the-clock work that never lets up.”

Emergency response fronts

CNRP operates on three fronts. The center transports personnel and cargo to put out massive wildfires and responds to landslides and floods. CNRP also conducts aerial surveillance over areas where civilian populations are at risk, such as volcanoes, snowy regions, and rivers.

“Avalanches and mudslides are more critical. Fires have a huge impact on flora and fauna, but you have some time before they impact people. Avalanches involve a lot of wounded people, without houses, without services,” Maj. Ovalle said. “They require more effective assistance.”

The second front consists of search-and-rescue operations for military and civilian personnel following aircraft crashes or river accidents. The center’s third front is unquestionably the area of highest demand: relocation and aeromedical evacuation. In 2004, the Directorate of Special Air Operations (today’s CNRP) established a broad set of procedures in an efficient protocol for disaster response and rescue. Since then, the unit transported more than 19,000 service members and civilians from all places and especially from hard-to-reach areas that only military aircraft can access.

Every minute counts

CNRP never rests. Its command is made up of just 22 officers and enlisted who coordinate its interfaces with a large army of specialists from every unit of FAC, who almost always race against the clock when responding to emergencies.

“In our mission to save lives, every minute matters,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel John Jairo Baez, head of CNRP, told Diálogo. “In disaster response, every minute counts to save the lives of those who are in harm’s way. In search and rescue, a single minute can make the difference to find those injured or lost. And in aeromedical evacuation, time matters even more.”

Among its other missions, the National Center for Personnel Recovery helps relocate civilians impacted by disasters. (Photo: Colombian Air Force)

Every decision is based on a stream of information to carry out the procedure as quickly as possible. Strict adherence to established response protocols shape their use over time.

“Our mission during the April 2017 avalanche in Moca showed how our disaster response system evolved and how FAC’s response capabilities increased thanks to the incorporation of [response] developed resources and protocols,” Lt. Col. Baez said. “We’re at the forefront of disaster response in the region.”

FAC pilots execute CNRP’s operations. Trained to operate under the most stressful circumstances, pilots review every request for assistance to choose what resources to use to respond to each case. Pilots, who understand the implications of their choices, make quick but thoughtful decisions.

“To go where someone needs help is one of FAC’s commitments. We did entire military operations to bring women in labor out from far-flung places and transfer sick children and adults,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel José Luis Avendaño Hurtado, chief of CNRP’s Transportation and Aeromedical Evacuation Division, told Diálogo. “There are several factors to assess to ensure operational effectiveness: weather conditions, nearby treatment locations, and the amount of time needed for treatment based on indications from the medical evaluation system.”

The amount of combat evacuations for wounded soldiers across Colombia during the armed conflict required capacity building to overcome obstacles. Up to 2015, members of the public security forces represented the largest number of transfers. But, since 2016, civilian rescues lead the statistics.

“We follow a doctrine set forth by the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization—the governing bodies on search and rescue procedures—to determine the locations and conditions in which a person can survive,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel Fernando Mendoza, chief of CNRP’s Search-and-Rescue Division, told Diálogo. “We work with technology, but, when technology fails us, the power goes out, and there are no indicators, we are left with the experience of our pilots, trained in war operations and used to applying their knowledge of basic geometry and trigonometry to perform triangulations and find the target.”

Effective equipment and human commitment

To carry out these missions, CNRP has a fleet of three medically outfitted Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft, and three UH-60 helicopters, dubbed the “Angels Squadron,” which are equipped with a hoist system to perform personnel rescues in hard-to-reach areas. The aircraft are also equipped to carry the Bambi Bucket system, a must to put out fires. Three Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft supplement the fleet. When needed, a C-130 Hercules can be fitted with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS II).

“The experience gained from the conflict allowed us to know what’s needed to survive on land, in water, in poor visibility conditions, and at night—in extremely risky conditions,” added FAC Major Pablo Mora Díaz, deputy director of Human Resources and Technical Support for UNGDR. “We do whatever needs to be done. We follow protocols, and we’re creative. We work for the well-being of all. We’re soldiers who rescue people,” he concluded.",https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/colombian-air-force-bolsters-humanitarian-aid-capacity

One evening in early February, local police rounded up Ernesto Marquez along with hundreds of his fellow Venezuelans in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, drove them to the frontier and ushered them back into the crumbling country they had previously fled.

The pushbacks by Cucuta law enforcement are part of a new policy response to long-simmering tensions between local residents and the Venezuelan migrants, who sleep by their hundreds in public places, which have begun to boil over violently.

Marquez, a 38-year-old chef, said Venezuela was too dangerous to sleep outside, so he stayed awake all night. In the morning, he walked back into Cucuta, alongside many of those deported the day before.

""We were loaded like dogs, like any other load of freight,"" Marquez said. Once a chef at the Princesa Plaza, an upscale hotel in the Venezuelan city of Maracay, he now sells individual cigarettes to save money for a bus ride to Colombia's capital, Bogota.

Marquez's quick return underscores the difficulties the Colombian government has had controlling the influx of Venezuelans, impoverished by hyperinflation and a sinking economy. Migración Colombia reported in February that more than 600,000 Venezuelans have entered the country through official crossings. Estimates of the number of irregular entries differ but may be as many of the legal entrants.

""The deportations don't do anything,"" said Father David Perez of the Catholic diocese of Cucuta, who runs a charity kitchen for Venezuelans at the border. ""They send the migrants out and they return through the smuggling paths.""

The border between Colombia and Venezuela stretches over hundreds of miles through jungle territory controlled by a myriad of armed groups who oversee the hundreds of informal pathways for smuggling Colombian drugs and Venezuelan contraband as well as people. Experts doubt Colombia could impose effective immigration controls in such a lawless zone.

""The borders are unstable at the moment due to both the humanitarian situation and to the number of criminal and violent actors,"" said Ivan Briscoe, Bogota-based Latin America director with the International Crisis Group. ""I do not think that Colombia has either the resources or experience to be able to manage a large outflow of migrants on its own.""

Suggesting a heightened sense of urgency on the government's part, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos visited Cucuta on February 9th to announce new actions addressing the refugee crisis. Santos suspended registry for Colombian border entry cards and deployed 3,000 military and police personnel to boost border security, noting that Colombia was spending millions of dollars to support the migrants.

""Colombia has never lived through a situation like what we have today,"" Santos said in a televised address before reporters and local authorities gathered to receive him in Cucuta.

The same day, Brazil's defense minister, visiting his own country's Venezuelan border, echoed Santos' remarks, deploying the military to the border and ordering the relocation of tens of thousands of migrants from the border zone. On February 12th, Brazil's president, Michel Temer, visited the border city of Boa Vista, where a growing number of Venezuelan refugees are straining local resources.

""Obviously it's a reflection of the huge concern in these countries,"" said Briscoe with the Crisis Group. ""It's a complex humanitarian emergency. International support is crucial.""

Beyond the immediate humanitarian concerns, Colombia faces long-term threats of destabilization as masses of Venezuelans move into the country without proper reception, health care, or social services, Briscoe said.

Both Colombia and Brazil will hold presidential elections this year, and neither incumbent will contest them. Temer has said he will not stand, and Santos is limping to the end of a second term, so there is little incentive for a long-term thought-through response to the Venezuelan refugee surge.

Santos' measures stopped short of extending more aid to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans now stranded in Colombia, or the countless more who are still sure to arrive, according to Ana Teresa Ramos, founder of Asociacion Deredez, which helps displaced people at the border with support from the United Nations Refugee Agency.

""It's good that he came, but he didn't do anything to help the Venezuelans,"" she said of Santos' announcements.

She said Colombia should work to provide documentation for the Venezuelans so that they can travel onward in the country, find legal work, and enroll their children in school. And she said Colombia will have to provide those services at no cost, as few Venezuelans are able to pay.

Despite the urgency conveyed by Santos and Temer's visits, it is unclear that Venezuela's neighbors will be able to stem the flow of people over the border. Colombia's control of its border zone has weakened in recent years. Coca cultivation in the department surrounding Cucuta increased sharply between 2015 and 2016, from 28,482 acres to 61,358 acres, according to U.N. figures, a sign of the growing presence of groups that run the drug trade.

Lawlessness in Venezuela has provided an opportune point of export for Colombian drugs, according to the International Crisis Group, and many illicit goods that would have left Colombia through Panama or the Caribbean coast now cross the border in the opposite direction of the migrants.

Armed groups now operate across the border with impunity—an important sign of weak state control. Such is the case with the ELN, an armed group that local magazine SEMANA reported in February were waging attacks in Colombia from bases in Venezuela.

People regularly turn up dead on the illicit roads and footpaths that traverse the area. Ramos of Asociacion Deredez said that any tightening of official border control will only push desperate Venezuelans onto illicit routes, by which they'll continue to arrive en masse in Colombia.

""All we can hope for is help from the other countries,"" she said.

The aid agency warns that unaccompanied children are fleeing across the border where they fall prey to traffickers and paramilitary groups

By Philippa Hitchen

The international humanitarian agency Save the Children has raised the alarm about hundreds of thousands of vulnerable children who have fled across the border from Venezuela into Colombia.

In a press release on Tuesday, the agency said the spiral of political violence and economic insecurity in Venezuela has led to a sharp increase in malnutrition rates, with half a dozen children dying every week from food shortages.

Fleeing to escape starvation

To escape starvation, many families and unaccompanied children are fleeing into Colombia where they are at risk of kidnapping and exploitation from traffickers, criminal gangs or armed groups.

Tamara Lowe is head of humanitarian information and communication at Save the Children UK. She told Vatican News more about this unfolding humanitarian crisis

Listen to the interview with Tamara Lowe of Save the Children UK

Lowe says that the rapidly deteriorating economic and political situation has caused hyperinflation and unemployment, as well as food and medical shortages.

She notes that those seeking refuge in Colombia are not only Venezuelans, but also Colombians themselves, who fled their own country during the civil war and are now being displaced again as they try and escape from the food and medical shortages.

Severe malnutrition

Lowe says that of the 550.000 people who’ve fled into Colombia in the past year, 49 percent are children and most of them show signs of severe malnutrition. She says most families were unable to eat more than one meal a day, “if they were lucky”, since average wages are about twelve dollars a month.

Even after arriving in Colombia, Lowe says, it is “really difficult for people to improve their lives” as most cannot afford to buy a passport and so cross the border illegally. Since they have no legal rights for access to health or education, she adds, many people live on the streets, or in makeshift tarpaulin shelters. These people have little protection from the rain and live in areas prone to severe flooding, thus compounding the risk of disease.

Risk of disease and violence

Lowe explains that the regions where people are arriving are poverty stricken areas, where guerilla forces and armed groups are still active. Local inhabitants have had mixed reactions to the new arrivals, some reciprocating the help they received during the civil war, but others reporting rising xenophobia as people compete for jobs and services.

In particular, Save the Children is concerned about the plight of unaccompanied children crossing the border, where they are vulnerable to paramilitaries or armed groups, often connected to traffickers or criminal gangs.

Support for young migrants

21,colombia,"Geneva/Panama, 21 March 2018– Aid workers working along the Colombia-Venezuela border are warning of rising vulnerabilities among people crossing the border and are calling on the international community to increase support for humanitarian efforts.

An estimated 796,000 people entered Colombia from Venezuela through official migration points in 2017. The volume of people on the move has already triggered regional repercussions, with many people now crossing from Colombia into Ecuador and Brazil, and from there to countries further south including Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.

“We are increasingly concerned about this situation, and we believe that additional, urgent action needs to be taken to ensure that people can access basic services and support,” said Walter Cotte, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Regional Director for the Americas.

“The sheer volume of people crossing the border has created a complex situation that requires immediate action. The Colombian Red Cross Society and IFRC have been working for more than a year to support people arriving in Colombia and travelling through the country. But we need to do more, and we are appealing to partners to invest in our operations,” said Mr Cotte.

Between 2,000 and 10,000 people are estimated to be on the move within Colombia every day, with the country being used as a transit area, supply point, or a place of temporary or long-term shelter. These figures do not include people using informal border crossings along the Colombia-Venezuela border. This is a major concern as these crossings are typically in areas where non-state armed groups are present.

The movement of people across the border is complex: some people are entering and leaving Colombia for specific purposes; some are migrating to other countries, and others are seeking a permanent home in Colombia. However, all should be able to access basic services, and should be protected from harm or harassment on their journeys, without any distinction.

This situation is generating significant humanitarian needs in transit zones, places of temporary settlement or host cities in Colombia, especially along the Colombia-Venezuela and Colombia-Ecuador borders.

IFRC and the Colombia Red Cross have launched an international emergency appeal for 2.2 million Swiss francs, with the aim of providing expanded support to about 120,000 of the most vulnerable people who have crossed from Venezuela. The Red Cross aims to provide a range of basic services, including health care, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash transfer programming and livelihoods support.

In 2017, the Colombian Red Cross assisted more than 300,000 people. Their actions received financial backing from IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF).

“No one organization, agency or government can address this issue alone,” said Mr Cotte. “Authorities must work closely with national humanitarian actors and other partners to coordinate and strengthen the humanitarian assistance available to people in need, and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/colombia/red-cross-warns-rising-humanitarian-needs-among-people-entering-colombia

Effective immediately, the United States is increasing humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans in Colombia who were forced to leave their country due to the ongoing crisis created by the Maduro regime. The U.S. Agency for International Development is providing this new initial assistance, totaling $2.5 million, in partnership with the Colombian government. The funds will go to humanitarian organizations that provide Venezuelans with emergency food and health assistance in impacted border areas.

This funding is in addition to the $36.5 million the State Department is providing in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to support the regional humanitarian operations of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international organizations. Those operations include assistance for Venezuelans now resident outside their country. We commend the humanitarian contributions made by all donors, and encourage additional contributions to meet growing needs.

We applaud the government of Colombia for its compassion in hosting hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have fled their country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/colombia/statement-administrator-green-us-humanitarian-assistance-vulnerable-venezuelans
23,colombia,"When Cajamarca expelled multinational miner AngloGold Ashanti from its territory a year ago, the town in central Colombia was told its economy would collapse. The opposite happened, according to locals.

Almost 98% of the town’s inhabitants voted against “La Colosa,” what would become the world’s largest open pit goldmine on March 26, 2017.

Since then, the locals and their government have disagreed on the consequences of the vote.

Mayor forced to cut expenses

The local government has entered in crisis since the referendum in which only 67 locals voted in favor of the mine, local government officials told economic newspaper Portafolio in February.

According to the newspaper, some 1,000 locals had lost their jobs. In June last year, the paper said that 600 locals lost their jobs.

Today Cajamarca looks like a ghost town, say some of the citizens who still inhabit it, and with a candle in hand they pray for the mining activity to return

Portafolio

City council president Luz Armanda Sanchez told the newspaper that “the budget cut for 2018 was big. There are no resources to carry out all the programs. Considering the drop in tax revenue, the only funds that were approved were for the minimal operation of the municipality.”

Since the vote, Portafolio has published multiple articles and editorials in which it highlighted allegedly negative consequences of the expulsion of the world’s third largest miner.

Locals, however, reject the claims made by the paper whose editor-in-chief, Ricardo Avila, is a regular speaker at foreign investment summits.

Locals say economic activity increased

“We want to be very clear to the country that the farmers of Cajamarca have no regrets,” Luz Angela Jimenez told newspaper El Espectador.

Jimenez founded the Tourism and Environmental Corporation of Cajamarca and Anaima, the neighboring town, and has been promoting tourism in the region as an alternative to mining.

Her claim is supported by Berlain Vargas, a local farmer who closed a deal with restaurant chain Crepes & Waffles.

“The town is not in crisis and the farmers do not repent saying no to mining in our territory. To the contrary, we are increasingly convinced that the future of Cajamarca is tourism and agriculture,” said Vargas.

Crepes and Waffles signed the agreement with the Cajamarca farming community months after the vote and has since been buying local produce.

The company is not the only one, according to the local farmers’ association.

“After the referendum, large trading and export companies have come and are investing in the cultivation of granadilla, gulupa, and hass avocado,” farmers’ representative Alfonso Arias said.

Multiple European NGOs have also arrived in Cajamarca to promote the diversification of the economy, according to El Espectador.

The Belgian city of Ghent jumped in to help the farmers monitor the water quality in the region.

The newly founded tourism board director, who also opposes the mayor, hopes that “people come, get to know and enjoy Cajamarca.”

“We have parrots, pumas, tigrillos, deer, sloths [and] armadillos,” Jimenez said. “We live in a privileged ecosystem. Cajamarca is green.”
