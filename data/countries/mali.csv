BAMAKO, Mali — A militia in Mali claims it found the vehicle used by four American soldiers killed in an ambush by Islamist militants in neighboring Niger last fall. The discovery indicates how fighters linked to the Islamic State likely traveled between the two countries.

As the militia of ethnic Tuareg soldiers discuss how to return the vehicle to U.S. authorities, the Islamic State is pushing deeper into this poor, West African country and raising fears of more violence.

Mali's minister of foreign affairs, Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly, said he was concerned that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, would redeploy to Africa as the U.S-led coalition quashes the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria.

""The current momentum in the Middle East can have consequences for the stability of Mali"" and the surrounding region here, Coulibaly said.

Mali already has an active chapter of al-Qaeda, which drove a car bomb into a military base near Timbuktu on April 14, killing a United Nations peacekeeper and wounding seven French soldiers.

""Three days don’t go by without hearing the news of an assassination by the terrorists,” said Hamady Touré, a commercial spice salesman. “The worst thing is that vehicles carrying civilians drive on explosive devices that the terrorists place.”

Those concerns mount despite an international response to the terrorist threat in Mali. The U.N. sent 15,000 peacekeepers to Mali five years ago. France has 4,000 troops in this former French colony. Five nearby countries — Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger — created a joint force of 5,000 troops to secure their borders against militants.

The Tuareg militia that claims it found the Americans’ four-wheel-drive Toyota in March also said it is an important defense against ISIS.

“The main target of these armed terrorists is none other than the local authorities and religious leaders,” said Fahad Almahmoud, a Tuareg militia spokesman.

The Tuareg soldiers are now allies of Mali’s government, but until three years ago they fought against the regime for an independent country.

Tiébilé Dramé, an opposition politician, said the government shouldn’t depend on militias and needs to do more. He said more terrorists appear to be moving into Mali despite the international help, so ordinary citizens see little reason to believe in their leaders.

""The fault is the current governance is bad,” Dramé said. “More than 500 schools are closed in the center of the country because of poor security.”

Mali's security situation has been precarious the past several years. In November 2015, heavily armed gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, the Mali capital, killing 20 people. A year ago, several local extremist groups announced they had banded into a bigger organization affiliated with al-Qaeda.

A U.N. report in March said the militias here have too much power. The report said the Tuaregs and another militia allied with the Malian government conducted extra-judicial executions, made illegal arrests, recruited child soldiers and had other human rights violations in northern Mali.

“It is necessary that both the government and the armed groups investigate serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law,"" said Mongi Hamdi, a U.N. special representative in Mali when the report was published. “This is in the interest of victims’ rights and for the reconciliation and establishment of a lasting peace in Mali.”

In the south, Mali's army and the Dozo — traditional armed hunters who act as an independent defense force — have been accused of similar abuses against the Fulani ethnic community, a Muslim group often loyal to extremists.

""The Malian army is making summary executions of civilians suspected of terrorism,” said Nouhoum Cissé, a member of a Fulani defense organization. When a Fulani appears in the central part of the country, ""you can be suspected of terrorism,” he said.

Malians and Fulanis lived together in harmony for centuries but are now poised to kill each other, Cissé said. He said terror attacks have also driven the indigenous Dogon people to create self-defense militias. Dogon and Fulani groups have clashed as a result.

“The question is who benefits from this situation. It does not benefit the Dogon. It does not benefit the Fulani,” Cissé said. “Those who benefit are the terrorist groups.”

The political situation in Mali is tense and the Malian army is currently too weak to guarantee stability and security. Many Timbuktu residents who fled the city in 2012 have not returned. They do not trust the uneasy peace and their city faces an uncertain future.

Dakar — Ethnic violence in central Mali has driven 3,000 people into northern Burkina Faso since February, straining dwindling food and medical supplies in that part of the West African nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali's Mopti region, said a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

The influx is putting pressure on vulnerable host communities in Burkina Faso's north, which is facing its worst hunger in years coupled with growing violence, aid agencies said.

""We think that the influx of new asylum-seekers might aggravate the situation,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Marlies Cardoen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Poor rains last year have left almost a million people in need of food aid in Burkina Faso, while attacks by a homegrown Islamist group are on the rise.

The new arrivals - including 2,000 Malians and 1,000 Burkinabe who had settled in Mali - are mostly staying with friends and relatives in volatile, hard-to-reach areas near the border, said UNHCR.

""We want them to come to Ouahigouya (the nearest town) or the refugee camp where we can register them all and give them food aid,"" said Cardoen by phone.

But some prefer to remain in the border area because they are expecting family to join them, hope to go home soon, or do not know of other options, she said.

While 3,000 people will not make a big difference on a national scale, it could have an impact in host communities, said Christian Munezero, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

""It is worrying, especially if it's on the level of one community or a few villages,"" he said.

The refugees have no work opportunities, and parents fear sending their children to school because of attacks, said UNHCR.

The 3,000 new arrivals add to about 24,000 Malians who have fled to Burkina Faso since Islamists seized Mali's desert north in 2012. French troops intervened to push them back a year later, but Islamist attacks and ethnic fighting persist.

AID WORKER ATTACKS THREATEN ACCESS

Armed men on 11 April attacked and seized an aid worker near Kouango town in the southern Ouaka prefecture. The aid worker was released, but his belongings were taken. A week earlier, gunmen abducted a driver with an international aid group also near Kouango. The attacks risk affecting humanitarian access in the area. Efforts are underway to sensitise on the neutrality of humanitarian workers.

The first group of Sudanese refugees willing to return home left on 14 April. Fifty-three people were repatriated under the terms of a May 2017 agreement between Chad, Sudan and UNHCR on voluntary refugee return. More than 329,000 Sudanese have been living in eastern Chad for over a decade.

Many are unwilling to return due to persistent insecurity back home. Meanwhile, around 4,000 Chadians in Darfur have returned home since December 2017.

Since February, intercommunity clashes have forced around 3,000 people – mainly from Koro locality in Mali’s northern Gao region – to flee to Burkina Faso. The clashes between Dogon and Peul communities have also claimed several lives. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth. Rising intercommunal tension has also been reported around the Mali - Niger border following the 11 April abduction of a German aid worker in Niger.

On 16 April, health authorities announced that four health districts in Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions had reached the meningitis alert threshold, meaning five cases per 100,000 people per week. While no health district has reached the epidemic threshold (10 cases per 100,000), several health centres in Maradi and Tahoua regions have reached the epidemic levels. Health authorities have enough medicines for over 4,000 patients. A vaccination campaign targeting people between two and 29 years old is being organised. In 2017, Niger recorded 3,506 cases of meningitis, causing 232 deaths.

3,mali,"In Mali, which has been wracked by violence and is prone to frequent and deadly jihadist attacks, the once unthinkable is now being asked by observers: is it time to negotiate with the extremists?

""Every analysis of the Malian crisis shows that a purely military solution is not possible,” said Ambroise Dakouo of the Alliance for Rebuilding Governance in Africa (ARGA), a think tank. “We cannot be dogmatic. We must be open to dialogue with these groups to find out if conciliation is possible. We must find out what they want and what we can concede.”

Waves of foreign soldiers, along with Malian government forces, have failed to eradicate the extremist groups that took control of the northern desert in 2012. Large tracts of territory remain lawless despite a 2015 peace deal intended to end the longer-term conflict that has pitted nomadic Tuaregs in the north against the government, based in the south.

The jihadists, who were not party to that accord, were ousted in 2013 from the northern towns they had captured. But their attacks continue to claim victims and are spreading to the centre of the country, affecting growing portions of the south. Just last week, militants disguised as UN peacekeepers attacked two bases in the ancient desert city of Timbuktu, in northern Mali, killing one peacekeeper and injuring dozens more.

In a late March incident, suspected jihadists attacked a hotel in central Mali shortly after the prime minister visited. In early April, dozens of suspected jihadists clashed with French and Malian troops near the Niger border.

Malian officials hope the new G5 Sahel sub-regional force, comprising troops from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania, can finally make headway against the Islamist militants.

Read more: A dozen shades of khaki: counter-insurgency operations in the Sahel

But influential observers, including several key political and religious figures, have been stepping up their push for an entirely different strategy: negotiations with jihadist groups.

Tiébilé Dramé is one of them. He is a former foreign minister who helped negotiate the so-called Ouagadougou Accord, which enabled people in areas controlled by armed groups to vote in Mali’s 2013 presidential elections.

Ali Nouhoum Diallo, a former president of the national assembly, is another. And they are joined by Mahmoud Dicko, the president of the High Islamic Council of Mali and one of the country's most powerful clerics.

The idea of talking to extremist groups, ruled out so far by the government, has become less and less taboo. A recent opinion poll showed that a slim majority of Malians (55.8 percent) favour such negotiations. The poll by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, conducted in November, tapped Malians in all the regional capitals as well as the District of Bamako.

The proposal of dialogue is not completely new. It was discussed during the 2017 Conference of National Understanding in Bamako. At the end of the discussions, the participants – about 300 representatives of government, the opposition, armed groups and civil society – called for open meetings to find out what the jihadists really want.

A year on, the idea appears to be gaining currency, but hard questions remain.

Who to talk to?

Iyad Ag Ghaly and Amadou Koufa are the two main extremist figures in Mali. After failing to become leader of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) – the first armed group to begin hostilities against the Malian army in 2012 – Ag Ghaly turned to radicalism and founded Ansar Dine, an al-Qaeda-linked group that sought to establish strict Islamic law in Mali. It operates essentially in the north.

Koufa, a Fulani preacher from the central Mopti Region, set up the jihadist Macina Liberation Front, which operates in the centre of the country, in 2015.

Last March, these two groups, along with the Saharan branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), announced an alliance under the banner of Jamaat Nosrat al-Islam wal-Mouslimin (Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, JNIM or GNIM).

According to Dakouo, of the ARGA think tank, one of the aims of dialogue with the extremists would be to isolate the foreign fighters within their ranks. “We would then have a clear idea of the positions of the jihadist movements that are Malian,’ he said. “Then we would also know that the other groups are not Malian, and that would let us know the true nature of our adversaries.”

This strategy could also help to end the victimisation of certain ethnic groups, such as the Fulani, often mistakenly assumed to be militant followers of Koufa.

Are jihadist groups really open to dialogue?

In May 2017, emissaries of Koufa and Ag Ghaly reportedly approached Ali Nouhoum Diallo and Mahmoud Dicko, the former president of the national assembly and the influential cleric.

Dicko, the cleric, is well placed to act as an intermediary for these extremist leaders if such approaches are to be renewed, said Professor Kissima Gakou, a criminologist at the University of Bamako who specialises in security issues. “They recognise in him certain values that give him the benefit of the doubt and enable him to interact with them,” he said.

But Gakou believes the hardline ideology of the extremist groups means they are fundamentally opposed to dialogue. ""The problem with jihadists is that they have maximalist (extreme) positions,” he said. “They know they have the power to fight to the last drop of blood... All they have is violence.”

Read more: Why some Malians join armed groups

Another obstacle to talks, according to Fahad Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government Imghad and Allies Tuareg Self-Defence Group, or GATIA, is the structure of Mali’s extremist groups, which are allied with larger organisations in the wider Sahel region.

""You cannot negotiate with one without the approval of the others,"" he said. ""If we have to talk with Amadou Koufa, he must have the consent of Iyad (Ag Ghaly), who needs the assent of (AQIM leader Abdel Malek) Droukdel.”

Ag Mohamed added that he didn’t think these larger groups would let their allies negotiate with the Malian government.

What to discuss?

Introducing sharia law across Mali is the jihadists’ long-standing goal.

Discussions cannot include ""sharia, the Islamisation of the country,"" said Adama Ben Diarra, a spokesman for the Waati Sera movement, which regularly organises demonstrations in support of the national army.

But ARGA’s Dakouo said the idea that entering into talks implied an acceptance of sharia was wrong and missed the point.

“Dialogue is a crisis-resolution mechanism,"" he said. The parameters must be the preservation of ""the republican state, justice, and the principles of law"".

The talks should aim to bring the extremist groups into the agreement for peace and reconciliation that was made with the Tuaregs, Dakouo said.

But Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government group, said that particular scenario was impossible. ""If you open a process with them, it will be a different process,” he said, referring to the extremists. “It has nothing to do with the agreement signed in 2015.""

Human rights abuses?

Some extremist groups are accused of serious human rights violations.

The International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) has initiated several lawsuits against some of the Malian extremist groups related to sexual violence, and has filed legal complaints against some of their leaders, including Ag Ghaly.

""Mali has adopted a national policy of transitional justice,"" Dakouo noted. He insisted mechanisms could be set up to allow human rights abuses to be handled while dialogue continued. He also stressed that the Malian government and its troops are also accused of violations.

What about international allies?

Cross-border aspects of the Malian conflict are also a major consideration. France and the UN are already deeply involved in trying to sort out the country’s crisis, so it would be difficult for Bamako to go it alone by entering into unilateral talks with extremist groups.

""The issue goes well beyond Mali,"" said Gakou. ""Mali cannot engage in dialogue before convincing all partners of the relevance of its approach. Otherwise, it's a lost cause.""

The international players engaged in Mali have steadfastly refused to enter into negotiations with extremist groups.

“They are terrorists,” France’s then foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said last year in response to the call by national conference to consider talking to the jihadists. “How do you negotiate with terrorists? This is a fight with no ambiguity.”

Dakouo, however, insisted that opening dialogue is a promising option – one given legitimacy by the fact attendees at the 2017 conference strongly supported the idea. The government, he said, just needs to ""find the right arguments"" if it decides to go down that road.

5,mali,"A retired general who led Canadian troops in one of the biggest battles during the war in Afghanistan says the government’s plan for a peacekeeping mission in war-torn Mali is focused too heavily on the military.

As the government readies more than 200 Canadian Forces personnel along with combat and troop-carrier helicopters, it should include civil engagement, says former Major-General David Fraser.

Fraser, commander of more than 2,000 Canadian troops and personnel during a fierce 2006 battle between Canadians and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan, said Monday Canada’s Mali mission is “very military.”

In an appearance on CBC Radio’s The Current, Fraser said he supports the government decision to send Canadian forces on their first UN mission under the Trudeau Liberals.

But he said the government should learn from what Canadians accomplished on the non-military side of the war in Afghanistan.

“This was about talking, this was about building, what we brought to this conflict was a multicultural, multi-ethnic, a whole-of-government team Canada approach,” Fraser said of Canada’s Afghanistan mission.

No new details have emerged about the government’s plan for a UN mission to Mali since Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced it in March.

The only confirmed components consist of two Chinook troop-transport helicopters to carry peacekeepers from other countries and four Griffon combat helicopters as escorts for the Chinooks. There has been at least one report another country, Ecquador, could supply two attack helicopters for more robust defence against attacks from Islamic groups battling the Mali government.

The government is expected to deploy up to 250 aircrew and other support personnel.

The war has been deadly for UN peacekeepers from African countries since it began in 2013, with more than 160 killed in the warring.

As of Monday, Canada’s Global Affairs international risk level advisory for Mali was (in capital letters) “AVOID ALL TRAVEL.”

Fraser, commander of the Canadian troops in Kandahar when four Canadian soldiers died in one day during direct combat against hundreds of Taliban fighters, said Canada should apply the methods of civilian engagement it used in Afghanistan to Mali.

“When we go to Mali, let’s take that whole of government approach, it’s all of the stuff that we’ve done in Afghanistan. You can apply the same template to our UN missions,” he said.

“Right now, it seems very penny-packeted, it seems very military and it’s not in keeping with the totality of what Canadians are coming out of Afghanistan, how we had a whole of government approach” Fraser said.

“Why are we not applying that in a more cohesive fashion where you take the helicopters, the C-130 Hercules aircraft, put some CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency) in there, put some foreign affairs in there?” he told The Current Host Anna-Maria Tremonti.

The Canadians won a tactical victory during the two-week 2006 battle against Taliban soldiers in Operation Medusa, but the Taliban forces who were forced out of the region eventually returned to resume hit-and-run attacks against NATO soldiers.

“I’m suggesting that we look at the lessons of operation Medusa and what we got out of that,” Fraser said. “Our 12, 14 years of Afghanistan, and we could probably apply that to every other mission when we go around the world, including Mali.”

The Canadian Forces personnel are expected to be deployed to the city of Gao, in the rebel-torn region of northern Mali and near a massive French military operation.

Canadian development and humanitarian assistance to Mali totalled $152 million in 2014-2015, government figures show.

6,mali,"France will lead a push at the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on parties in Mali blocking efforts to turn a three-year-old peace agreement into reality on the ground, the French ambassador said on Wednesday.

Britain and the United States said they backed targeted sanctions as violence continues to engulf the West African country and signatories of a 2015 peace deal fail to deliver on their promises.

""We cannot wait any longer,"" French Ambassador Francois Delattre told a council meeting on Mali.

""France will together with its partners, in the coming weeks... begin work to identify those who obstruct the implementation of the peace agreement.""

Last year, the council set up a sanctions regime for Mali that would allow the blacklisting of individuals and entities, which would be hit by a global travel ban and an assets freeze.

The list to be agreed by the council would be the first targeted sanctions imposed on Mali.

Mali's government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of armed groups in June 2015 to end the fighting, but insurgents remain active, including in central Mali.

UN envoy Mahamat Saleh Annadif told the council that the security situation was worsening as the country heads toward a presidential election in July and August.

Seven UN peacekeepers have been killed in attacks in Mali this year alone, serving in a mission that has been described as the UN's most dangerous.

The United Nations has deployed 13 000 troops and police in Mali, many of whom are deployed in the lawless north of the country.

Islamist extremists linked to Al-Qaeda took control of the desert north of Mali in early 2012, but were largely driven out in a French-led military operation launched in January 2013.

A UN panel of experts warned in a report to the council last month that insecurity ""continues to rage"" in Mali despite diplomatic efforts.

Human, drug and arms trafficking remain rife, and despite the 2015 deal, ""the humanitarian situation in the north and center of the country remains volatile, unstable and a marked deterioration persists,"" said the report, a copy of which was obtained by AFP.

The ongoing crisis in Mali led to the creation of the multinational G5-Sahel force to respond to what the report described as ""intensified terrorist threats of the ISGS (Islamic State in the Greater Sahara) and Ansar al-Islam.""

7,mali,"Drought, conflict and high food prices will drive millions of people in West Africa's Sahel region into malnutrition and further insecurity without immediate aid, three United Nations agencies warned on Thursday.

This could be one of the worst crop seasons in several years and many families may exhaust their food reserves early, according to the World Food Program, the UN children's agency and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Poor rainfall in parts of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania and Senegal has ruined livestock and harvests, leading to an early start of the hunger season.

More than 1.6 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition this year, 50% more than in the Sahel's last major crisis in 2012, the agencies said at a press conference.

Insecurity in the Sahel has forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes and has led to the closure of schools and disruption of basic social services. Such vulnerabilities create an environment where extremism can thrive, the UN agencies said.

Fighters affiliated with the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda already are active in the region.

""You do have a whole cohort of people with little access to education, little job opportunity, conflict, everyone at home, movement to (displacement) centres where they basically have very little to do. This is all creating a situation where there is fertile ground for groups that do not have noble intentions to recruit these people in their ranks,"" said Marie-Pierre Poirier, Unicef's regional director for West and Central Africa.

Early action will prevent a downward spiral, the agencies said.

""If we don't do anything, what will they do? Die, join extremist groups, migrate? Migrate where?"" asked Abdou Dieng, the WFP regional director for West and Central Africa. ""We must invest in programs in the Sahel.""

The FAO called for $128m to prevent a deteriorating situation for 2.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. WFP asked for $284m to provide assistance to some 3.5 million people across the six countries. And Unicef seeks $264m to reach nearly 990 000 children at risk of severe malnutrition.","West Africa's Sahel threatened with malnutrition, insecurity",https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/west-africas-sahel-threatened-with-malnutrition-insecurity-20180503
8,mali,"Khadidia Maïga was frustrated by how Google searches of her country tended to throw out keywords like “terrorism,” “poverty” and “deprivation.” But she decided she wasn’t going to just sit back and criticize her country’s increasingly dysfunctional systems responsible for those word associations.

So, she helped create an online platform called Transformons le Mali (Let’s Transform Mali) that calls for ideas from the public and then processes them into a comprehensive plan for change. She and her friends, she says, have long discussed what kind of country they want to live in, and what needs to be done. Now they’re doing it.

And they’re not alone. Using the power of the internet, a new breed of cyber-activists is emerging in Mali, trying to connect citizens and urge them to move beyond living-room criticism into actual action for change. At their heart, these initiatives are about upturning a political culture that is disconnected from Mali’s citizens and a social culture of apathy born out of disillusionment.

We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about. Khadidia Maïga, cofounder, Transformons le Mali

The 2012 crisis was what pushed Fatouma Harber, a Timbuktu-based teacher and blogger, toward activism too. On her blog, Facebook page and Twitter account, she takes on Islamist forces she views as imposing an alien version of the religion on a city that for centuries has been a center of moderate Islamic teachings and science. And Transformons le Mali is planning to unveil a roadmap of action in June, a month before Mali’s presidential elections.

For Ousmane Maïga, who was born in Mali, has lived in New York and now shuffles between France and the country of his birth, the turning points were an armed rebellion and a coup — both in 2012 — that shook the nation to its core. The coup, which threatened to reverse Mali’s limited gains since its transition to democracy in 1991, left Ousmane and his friends feeling helpless. So, they devised and launched kouloubametre.com, a website and a discussion tool that tracks the current president’s election promises and the status of their implementation.

“We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about,” says Khadidia.

Almost everyone in this vast West African nation — the size of Alaska, Texas and Michigan combined — has a smartphone, so the emergence of cyber-activism isn’t surprising. But these initiatives aren’t limited to the country’s borders. They strive to include the vast diaspora — an estimated 1.2 million Malians live in France alone.

That diaspora connection is important. At the time of the 2012 coup, most of them weren’t in the country. “We had no say in the matter,” Ousmane recalls. That won’t happen again with others in the diaspora, if kouloubametre.com has its way. To overcome the challenge that many cannot read, write or express themselves in French, the official language, Ousmane and her colleagues send people apps on their smartphones that allow them to contribute ideas in any language.

For Harber, having her say online is critical, for the future of her city. ”I have to represent my city, as an integral part of Mali with its inclusive culture that others have been trying to take away from us,” she says. But she has also started a platform called Sankoré Labs that serves an incubator, a co-working space and a digital training school, all rolled into one. As a young girl, she found her family background and culture nourished her talents. She wants Sankoré Labs to play that role too. It’s a place “for the young,” she says, “where they can work, receive training in how to navigate the digital world and regain a sense of self-value.”

Will any of this work? These movements are emerging in a political context marked by a “very large” gap between citizens and politicians, says Baba Dakono, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, an Africa-wide research organization that looks into terrorism, justice and governance. “There is no space for debate,” he says. Mali has tried multiple experiments since adopting democracy, says Dakono. It has had citizens’ action and reflection circles. But leaders ultimately succumbed to political gamesmanship and lost the trust of citizens, he adds.

For the new digital initiatives to succeed, they need to “bridge that gap,” says Dakono. “They can do this by becoming wellsprings of ideas,” he says. “And by remaining independent.”

That’s what Transformons le Mali is trying to do. So far, the website has received around 200 ideas on subjects such as health care, agriculture, security, education, culture and identity. To avoid just being a receptacle of ideas, the group is working in thematic teams, each processing ideas related to a sector. A Transformation Plan for Mali, based on this work, will be unveiled publicly in June, says Mamadou Camara, the project’s coordinator. They will also share the plan with “all candidates and we’ll get them to pledge to carry it out if they get elected,” says Camara.

Won’t this pull them into exactly the kind of political game Dakono is warning against? Maybe. But the urgency of Mali’s predicament is such that the activists and their supporters worry more about the inevitable failure that comes from doing nothing. “We seem to be stuck with a political class that is incapable, some even say unwilling, to do anything about the crisis we’re in,” says Ousmane. “And so — it’s up to us.”

That urgency appears to be resonating. Sirandou Diawara is a young Franco-Malian architect who has embraced the new movement. “We’re in a time of crisis, and we must come up with solutions,” she says. She’s trying to figure out how best she can contribute, professionally and personally.

These disparate activities are only loosely connected, with limited contact with each other. But they’re part of a wider emergence of digital change agents across West Africa nations, who regularly meet — a conclave has been planned in Ouagadougou in June.

The movement may be spreading, but Malian cyber-activists are clear. They’re only starting out, and their journey is long. Khadidia Maïga mulls what it will take for her to feel content. That will be when Mali’s youth start acting on their own. “We’re a catalyst,” she says. “All we want to do is to change minds.”",Can Cyber-Activism Strengthen Mali's Democracy?,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/can-cyber-activism-strengthen-malis-democracy/86264
9,mali,"In Cape Town, the residents brace for “Day Zero” in late August, when the taps could run dry. Further north, in the Sahel, drought has prematurely thrust migrating communities into the crosshairs of soldiers from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, adding to the conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Looking out her window at the snow-covered ground following another nor’easter, climate scientist Lisa Goddard ponders weather’s effect on other global crises: the drought leading to the Syrian civil war, torrential rain causing floods in India and Pakistan, the recent hurricanes that wrecked the Caribbean — outcomes she might have predicted. But unlike a TV meteorologist, Goddard, director of Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), doesn’t attempt to forecast the weather on any specific day. Rather, she looks months ahead, offering longer-term predictions — a bit like The Old Farmer’s Almanac but with “climatology and actual statistics of variability behind it,” she says.

“We study phenomena that may cause a region’s climate to differ from previous years,” Goddard continues. “A key factor is the temperature of the oceans … and since ocean currents change slowly, we can anticipate their effects on the atmosphere.”

As the director of IRI, which assists developing countries to prepare for and manage the impacts of climate change, Goddard, 51, has traveled from Colombia to Zambia — and many countries in between — helping to build national forecasting systems from scratch and working with aid agencies, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to anticipate the next weather emergency. Until just recently, however, neither Goddard nor academics in general have been seated at the tables of the United Nations, the World Bank or any other multilateral organization advising on policy and programs for society at large.

Goddard is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.”

That will soon change. In April 2017, President Lee Bollinger announced Columbia World Projects (CWP) — perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in his nearly 16-year tenure — to connect the capacities of the Ivory Tower to organizations with the power to translate research into programs that benefit the global community. “The extraordinary developments in recent decades of greater interconnectedness … have created or accelerated highly complex problems and have given rise to political movements favoring a reversal or change of course,” Bollinger said in a statement announcing CWP. “The multilateral institutions created in the period following the Second World War are straining under new realities. … All of this calls out for universities to become more involved.”

Nicholas Lemann, former dean of Columbia’s journalism school, has been tasked with directing CWP, and Goddard will lead its inaugural project focused on climate threats to food production and nutrition in six countries (Ethiopia, Senegal, Colombia, Guatemala, Bangladesh and Vietnam). In addition to improving food security, her goals include expanding economic livelihoods and supporting environmental stability. Goddard also wants to expand an enterprise created and implemented at the IRI — index insurance, which issues payouts to farmers in years when the weather causes categorical loss.

Surprisingly, climate change did not drive Goddard’s interest in weather. It started instead with a love of physics. Born in California to a teacher and a government official, Goddard received her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in atmospheric and oceanic sciences from Princeton University. While at Princeton, she developed a curiosity about the cyclical El Niño climate pattern, which brought her to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the El Niño guru himself: Mark Cane, who helped build the first computer model to successfully predict the 1985 El Niño months in advance. Cane went on to found the IRI with a mission to help millions of people by better preparing for the effects of droughts and changing ocean temperatures.

“I have known Lisa since she was a student, and as the IRI director, she has worked a miracle, taking an organization that was demoralized and facing a serious threat to its existence, and bringing it to extraordinary vibrancy,” says Cane, referring to IRI’s loss of funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which threatened to shutter the institute a few years back.

“I believe the IRI is increasingly recognized worldwide as the expert institution for application of climate science to societies in the developing world. This was what the IRI was intended to be, but it took Lisa to make it a reality,” Cane adds.

For her part, Goddard, who has two sons and lives north of Manhattan near the Hudson River, says that she is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.” Still, she has her critics. Judith Curry, a former professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, says that IRI’s seasonal forecasting methods are several levels below state of the art.

“Their approach relies heavily on forecasts of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña, which has no particular skill beyond a few months,” Curry says. “Even if they were able to accurately predict [the El Niño effect], this shows very little skill in predicting the intensity of the Asian and African monsoon rains. Simply put, they are not using the best models, and their interpretation of the drivers of climate dynamics is overly simplistic.”

Goddard says that even the best models have errors and biases. “This is something that is not handled in any sophisticated way for real-time prediction at any other center in the world,” she explains. “The biggest sin in the prediction world … is using the output of a model, straight off the shelf, and without consideration of those who are using the information.” People of all backgrounds with a little training can make use of the information the IRI provides, Goddard insists, not just climate scientists.

“Once, in a meeting in Kenya,” Goddard recalls, “a colleague of mine communicated the concept of probability, which is not a word in their local language, to aid workers by using a paper airplane, which he flew repeatedly, marking all the spots where it landed on the floor to represent the range of possible climate outcomes.

“The locals got it, and their communities have since embraced our forecasts.”",Severe Weather Ahead: She's Predicting the Next Climate Crisis,https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/severe-weather-ahead-shes-predicting-the-next-climate-crisis/85664

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

After six years of armed conflict in the north, and despite progress made since the peace accord in 2015, Mali remains affected by a protracted and multifaceted humanitarian crisis compounded by a deteriorating security situation. The lack of access to essential services and limited State presence and capacity in both the north and the centre are driving humanitarian needs. The slow implementation of the peace agreement contributes to exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the affected populations in north and centre Mali. In that regard, main challenges include the slow redeployment of the interim authorities, the difficulties in the establishment of the Operational Coordination Mechanism (MOC) and the delayed Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process.

As of February 2018, some 46,330 people remain internally displaced due to the conflictincluding individuals displaced since 2012. This represents an increase from December 2017 (38,100 IDPs), with 8,100 new IDPs registered in February in Mopti, Menaka, and Timbuktu, due to a resurgence in communal violence and armed conflict in northern Mali. In addition, over 134,000 Malian people have sought refuge in the neighbouring countries of Niger, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso (UNHCR Data Portal). Around 526,000 long-term IDPs from the conflict have returned between 2013 and 2018. Yet, in many areas, conditions for a safe return, such as security and access to essential services, have not been met.

Humanitarian needs increased with up to 4.1 million people in need of food assistance in 2018, with projections for the lean season in June-August 2018 estimating that 795,000 people will be facing Crisis [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3] and 20,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In some areas of Kayes, Segou, Mopti, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal regions, food insecurity worsened since 2017. The malnutrition situation in 2018 is likely to be worse than estimated at the end of 2017. The process of the Cadre Harmonisé (Joint National Food Security and Nutrition Analysis) which took place in Mali at the end of November 2017 indicated that the food security has deteriorated continuously since 2016 and will continue to deteriorate in 2018, due to an earlier-than-expected lean season and erratic rains. As food insecurity is one of the determinants of malnutrition, the Ministry of Health through its Nutrition Division and in collaboration with the Nutrition Cluster has revised the need for nutrition upwards for 2018. The expected cases of SAM for 2018 will rise to the national level from 162,913 to 274,145, and the expected cases of MAM for 2018 will also increase from 470,000 to 582,000. This makes an increase of 229,000 malnourished children including 111,232 severe acute malnourished children under-5, 489,238 children from 6 to 59 months of moderate acute malnutrition and 45,245 pregnant and lactating women.

Overall, 1.73 million people are in need of health assistance as the health system has gradually deteriorated in the conflictaffected regions in northern and central Mali. Indeed, a shortage of medical staff is reported, with only three health workers per 10,000 inhabitants in 2017. Between 1 January and 20 February 2018, 109 cases of measles, including 49 confirmed, were reported in Ansongo (Gao), Bandiagara and Douentza (Mopti), and Yanfolila and Kadiolo (Sikasso).

Some 908,000 people are in need of WASH assistance throughout Mali, including 788,000 in northern and central Mali. Up to 63% of the population do not have access to water.

Some 950,000 people are in need of protection, including from 526,000 children. The school year 2018-2019, has shown a rise in the number of schools closed (715 in February 2018, from 500 in May 2017). This increased albeit is due to a combination of insecurity in the affected regions, in addition to the already chronic challenges of the education system such as lack of teachers, lack of food canteens and poor infrastructure.","UNICEF Mali Humanitarian Situation Report, January – February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/unicef-mali-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018

Operational Updates

Implementation of the Transitional Interim Country Strategic Plan (T-ICSP) began in January 2018. The T-ICSP is based on seven strategic outcomes and aims to support the Government in achieving its National Development Plan (CREDD 2016–2018), the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of Zero Hunger and SDG 17, Partnership.

According to the March 2018 Cadre Harmonisé, 390 000 people are in urgent need of food assistance, with this number rising to 930,000 from June 2018. These figures are higher than the projection made in November 2017. The increase in food insecurity is due to a poor agricultural harvest in some areas, persistent insecurity in northern and central Mali, a basic food basket which is 20-30 percent higher than the same time last year, all of which affect the poorest and most vulnerable households. In addition, insufficient water and low levels of biomass have led to early transhumance, increasing the strain on natural resources and risks of conflicts over resources. These factors have resulted in a deterioration in the food security situation.

In line with the T-ICSP Strategic Result 1 and 2, WFP aims to provide emergency and seasonal assistance to 155,000 vulnerable people starting from March. To combat the deteriorating situation, from June WFP will increase food assistance to 504,000. A total of 197,000 children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and lactating women will be assisted to prevent malnutrition. WFP plans to provide nutritious foods to 298,000 children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women to treat acute malnutrition.

First published by ISS Today

Foreign military footprints, especially those of the United States (US) and France, are expanding in West Africa, particularly in the Sahel. This presence is receiving increasingly hostile public criticism. It is often considered invasive, and at times ill-adapted and ineffective against growing insecurity, and even counterproductive.

Regarding the opening of a US military base in Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo said in April, “So let me state with the clearest affirmation that Ghana has not offered a military base, and will not offer a military base to the United States of America.” This statement came in response to protests that shook the country after a defence cooperation agreement was signed with the United States.

Four months earlier, Nigerian authorities denied having authorised the deployment of Italian military personnel in the north of the country, which would have added to the existing US and French military bases in the region of Agadez.

Foreign military presence in the region was previously restricted to advising, training and equipping national armies. However, since the start of the 2012 Malian crisis, it has expanded to include active ground troops, with the installation of logistical and military bases. The occupation of northern Mali by extremists triggered a French military intervention in January 2013. This helped stop the progress of violent extremists moving towards the south, and contributed to driving them out of major cities.

In this military frenzy, Mali and Niger, at the crossroads of regional instability, have also become epicentres of Western power security dynamics in the Sahel. Despite using similar security rhetoric to justify their presence, Western powers seem to have different agendas.

If the war against terror remains the US’s top priority in the region, it seems that European partners such as Germany and Italy are guided by motives to control migration. The Italian government’s decision in December last year to send troops to Niger to combat terrorism seems more about controlling migration flows. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 75% of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe in 2017 landed in Italy and most moved through Niger.

Germany’s contribution of 1,000 soldiers to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the opening of a German logistics base in Niger’s capital, Niamey, reinforce the country’s presence in the Sahel and its drive to be at the forefront of the fight against irregular migration.

While the rise of violent extremism and organised crime in the Sahel have accelerated foreign military presence, so has a weakening of the states in the region. Poor state governance in the Sahel is characterised in most countries by endemic corruption, a weak justice system, an inability to provide basic social services and an ineffective integration of peripheral regions. This creates an enabling environment for extremist groups to deepen their local connections and strengthen their efforts.

If France intervened in 2013 at the request the Malian transitional authorities, it was in the name of a common past, but also to protect its own nationals and defend its strategic and economic interests in the region.

For example, the country continues to import uranium, essential for its nuclear energy, from neighbouring Niger. The intervention, known as ‘Operation Serval’, was replaced six months later by Barkhane, whose mandate is preventive in nature. It costs about €1 million a day and is present across the five countries of the G5 Sahel – Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad.

While the French presence is widely publicised, other countries such as the US and Germany are more discreet. In October 2017, four US commandos and five Nigerien soldiers died in Tongo Tongo, a village near the border with Mali. The Islamic State in the Great Sahara claimed responsibility for the ambush. The attack revealed not only the extent of the US military presence in Niger, but its expanding military footprint in the region. It also showed that despite regional efforts, complex and sophisticated attacks by extremists continue.

The rhetoric following the Tongo Tongo attack – presenting the Sahel as the new frontier of global jihad – carries significant risks. Numerous studies, including by the Institute for Security Studies, have highlighted the importance of local dynamics when considering the emergence and expansion of terrorist groups in the region. These groups exploit people’s grievances against state governance, and community tensions between, for example, farmers and herders.

Furthermore, the US decision to weaken rules of engagement for the troops deployed on the ground seems risky. Targeting errors can be exploited by violent extremist groups to consolidate their presence and thus influence the effectiveness of interventions.

Popular dissatisfaction with the foreign military presence has increased in the region, and the French forces, welcomed by quasi-general consensus in Mali in 2013, are facing growing public criticism. Protests across Mali have denounced French policy, perceived as seeking only to protect its interests to the detriment of those of the local populations. In Niger, too, protesters responding to the call of a coalition of civil society organisations chanted last February, “French, American and German armies, go away!”

On the whole, the many military interventions in the Sahel show Western powers’ desire to defend their strategic security, political, diplomatic or economic interests. Trying to mask this only amplifies the impression of a region that’s victim to the geo-political calculations of foreign powers. DM

15,mali,"A new initiative to strengthen multi-hazard early warning systems and to boost resilience is underway in Mali.

The Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) project was launched on 30 April as part of a wider plan to modernize Mali’s hydrological and meteorological services. It will be implemented during the next four years and brings together national institutions responsible for meteorology, hydrology, food security and civil protection.

For the past three decades more than 7 million Malians have been directly impacted by drought and flood events, and UN agencies are warning that more than 4 million people will need humanitarian assistance this year. Associated economic damage and losses have been calculated at approximately USD140 million per year. Two thirds of Mali’s land area is classified as desert or semi-desert and the country is one of the most drought-prone in the world. It is also frequently impacted by flooding events, caused by combination of river overflow and heavy precipitation.

The government of Mali has secured resources from the Climate Risk and Early Warning System (CREWS) initiative to strengthen its flood vigilance system along the Niger River, with improved flood bulletins based on precipitation forecasts. CREWS resources are providing technical assistance leveraging resources from Green Climate Fund (GCF) (USD22.75 million) and the International Development Association (IDA) to enhance the country’s hydro-meteorological and warning capabilities.

A joint World Bank, and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) CREWS mission, comprising experts in meteorology, hydrology, civil protection, disaster risk management and food security, met from 26 to 30 April 2018 with focal points from the four institutions involved in warning systems. These institutions include Mali Météo (Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure), Food Security Early Warning System (Food Security Commissariat, Office of the President), Civil Protection Directorate General (Ministry of Security and Civil Protection), and the National Directorate for Water Resources (Ministry of Energy and Water).

The key objective of the mission was to update all the relevant investment plans, to launch the CREWS activities, and to pre-appraise the GCF and IDA project.

The four-year CREWS project is supported financially by Australia, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and will be implemented by WMO and the World Bank and its Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. It is closely aligned with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Mali’s Minister of Security and Civil Protection Salif Traoré pledged support for the project. He said that Mali’s current early warning system originates from the Cereal Market Restructuring Program in the 1980s. It focuses mainly on food insecurity resulting from droughts and pest invasions.

“It is time for Mali to adopt procedures and tools for rapid warning, which will complement existing early warning arrangements. We are particularly thinking of hazards such as floods, sandstorms and bushfires. The management of these risks requires concerted action between the institutions responsible for monitoring and forecasting, for coordinating the response, local authorities and citizens,” Gen. Traoré told the opening session of the meeting.
