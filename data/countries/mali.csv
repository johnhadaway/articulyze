0,mali,"In Mali, which has been wracked by violence and is prone to frequent and deadly jihadist attacks, the once unthinkable is now being asked by observers: is it time to negotiate with the extremists?

""Every analysis of the Malian crisis shows that a purely military solution is not possible,” said Ambroise Dakouo of the Alliance for Rebuilding Governance in Africa (ARGA), a think tank. “We cannot be dogmatic. We must be open to dialogue with these groups to find out if conciliation is possible. We must find out what they want and what we can concede.”

Waves of foreign soldiers, along with Malian government forces, have failed to eradicate the extremist groups that took control of the northern desert in 2012. Large tracts of territory remain lawless despite a 2015 peace deal intended to end the longer-term conflict that has pitted nomadic Tuaregs in the north against the government, based in the south.

The jihadists, who were not party to that accord, were ousted in 2013 from the northern towns they had captured. But their attacks continue to claim victims and are spreading to the centre of the country, affecting growing portions of the south. Just last week, militants disguised as UN peacekeepers attacked two bases in the ancient desert city of Timbuktu, in northern Mali, killing one peacekeeper and injuring dozens more.

In a late March incident, suspected jihadists attacked a hotel in central Mali shortly after the prime minister visited. In early April, dozens of suspected jihadists clashed with French and Malian troops near the Niger border.

Malian officials hope the new G5 Sahel sub-regional force, comprising troops from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania, can finally make headway against the Islamist militants.

But influential observers, including several key political and religious figures, have been stepping up their push for an entirely different strategy: negotiations with jihadist groups.

Tiébilé Dramé is one of them. He is a former foreign minister who helped negotiate the so-called Ouagadougou Accord, which enabled people in areas controlled by armed groups to vote in Mali’s 2013 presidential elections.

Ali Nouhoum Diallo, a former president of the national assembly, is another. And they are joined by Mahmoud Dicko, the president of the High Islamic Council of Mali and one of the country's most powerful clerics.

The idea of talking to extremist groups, ruled out so far by the government, has become less and less taboo. A recent opinion poll showed that a slim majority of Malians (55.8 percent) favour such negotiations. The poll by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, conducted in November, tapped Malians in all the regional capitals as well as the District of Bamako.

The proposal of dialogue is not completely new. It was discussed during the 2017 Conference of National Understanding in Bamako. At the end of the discussions, the participants – about 300 representatives of government, the opposition, armed groups and civil society – called for open meetings to find out what the jihadists really want.

A year on, the idea appears to be gaining currency, but hard questions remain.

Who to talk to?

Iyad Ag Ghaly and Amadou Koufa are the two main extremist figures in Mali. After failing to become leader of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) – the first armed group to begin hostilities against the Malian army in 2012 – Ag Ghaly turned to radicalism and founded Ansar Dine, an al-Qaeda-linked group that sought to establish strict Islamic law in Mali. It operates essentially in the north.

Koufa, a Fulani preacher from the central Mopti Region, set up the jihadist Macina Liberation Front, which operates in the centre of the country, in 2015.

Last March, these two groups, along with the Saharan branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), announced an alliance under the banner of Jamaat Nosrat al-Islam wal-Mouslimin (Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, JNIM or GNIM).

According to Dakouo, of the ARGA think tank, one of the aims of dialogue with the extremists would be to isolate the foreign fighters within their ranks. “We would then have a clear idea of the positions of the jihadist movements that are Malian,’ he said. “Then we would also know that the other groups are not Malian, and that would let us know the true nature of our adversaries.”

This strategy could also help to end the victimisation of certain ethnic groups, such as the Fulani, often mistakenly assumed to be militant followers of Koufa.

Are jihadist groups really open to dialogue?

In May 2017, emissaries of Koufa and Ag Ghaly reportedly approached Ali Nouhoum Diallo and Mahmoud Dicko, the former president of the national assembly and the influential cleric.

Dicko, the cleric, is well placed to act as an intermediary for these extremist leaders if such approaches are to be renewed, said Professor Kissima Gakou, a criminologist at the University of Bamako who specialises in security issues. “They recognise in him certain values that give him the benefit of the doubt and enable him to interact with them,” he said.

But Gakou believes the hardline ideology of the extremist groups means they are fundamentally opposed to dialogue. ""The problem with jihadists is that they have maximalist (extreme) positions,” he said. “They know they have the power to fight to the last drop of blood... All they have is violence.”

Another obstacle to talks, according to Fahad Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government Imghad and Allies Tuareg Self-Defence Group, or GATIA, is the structure of Mali’s extremist groups, which are allied with larger organisations in the wider Sahel region.

""You cannot negotiate with one without the approval of the others,"" he said. ""If we have to talk with Amadou Koufa, he must have the consent of Iyad (Ag Ghaly), who needs the assent of (AQIM leader Abdel Malek) Droukdel.”

Ag Mohamed added that he didn’t think these larger groups would let their allies negotiate with the Malian government.

What to discuss?

Introducing sharia law across Mali is the jihadists’ long-standing goal.

Discussions cannot include ""sharia, the Islamisation of the country,"" said Adama Ben Diarra, a spokesman for the Waati Sera movement, which regularly organises demonstrations in support of the national army.

But ARGA’s Dakouo said the idea that entering into talks implied an acceptance of sharia was wrong and missed the point.

“Dialogue is a crisis-resolution mechanism,"" he said. The parameters must be the preservation of ""the republican state, justice, and the principles of law"".

The talks should aim to bring the extremist groups into the agreement for peace and reconciliation that was made with the Tuaregs, Dakouo said.

But Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government group, said that particular scenario was impossible. ""If you open a process with them, it will be a different process,” he said, referring to the extremists. “It has nothing to do with the agreement signed in 2015.""

Human rights abuses?

Some extremist groups are accused of serious human rights violations.

The International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) has initiated several lawsuits against some of the Malian extremist groups related to sexual violence, and has filed legal complaints against some of their leaders, including Ag Ghaly.

""Mali has adopted a national policy of transitional justice,"" Dakouo noted. He insisted mechanisms could be set up to allow human rights abuses to be handled while dialogue continued. He also stressed that the Malian government and its troops are also accused of violations.

What about international allies?

Cross-border aspects of the Malian conflict are also a major consideration. France and the UN are already deeply involved in trying to sort out the country’s crisis, so it would be difficult for Bamako to go it alone by entering into unilateral talks with extremist groups.

""The issue goes well beyond Mali,"" said Gakou. ""Mali cannot engage in dialogue before convincing all partners of the relevance of its approach. Otherwise, it's a lost cause.""

The international players engaged in Mali have steadfastly refused to enter into negotiations with extremist groups.

“They are terrorists,” France’s then foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said last year in response to the call by national conference to consider talking to the jihadists. “How do you negotiate with terrorists? This is a fight with no ambiguity.”

Dakouo, however, insisted that opening dialogue is a promising option – one given legitimacy by the fact attendees at the 2017 conference strongly supported the idea. The government, he said, just needs to ""find the right arguments"" if it decides to go down that road.

The budding striker scored five goals at the African Championships last October, four of which were in Mali’s opening game where they thrashed hosts Cape Verde 12-0.

The Eagles flew into the gold medal final against Morocco and despite losing to the three-time African champions, finishing second secured Mali a spot at the World Championships for the first time in history.

“I am really excited about the countries that are drawn in our group. We have some of the best countries in the world and playing against the best is ultimately how you get better.""

“We went to Cape Verde with the goal of qualifying for the 2018 World Championships. Accomplishing this goal gives me a great sense of pride and it is a clear indication of our progress since we began five years ago,” Traore said.

With a little over a month until their Worlds debut, the Mali National Team completed a training camp last week in the capital, Bamako, and will be travelling to Paris to play France this month to tune the Malian players’ focus towards their anticipated Worlds debut.

Mali have three tough opponents in Group D: reigning Paralympic and world champions Brazil, European bronze medallists England and Central American champions Costa Rica.

However, Bandiougou sees the teams in Group D as an opportunity for Mali to battle with the crème de la crème in blind football.

“I am really excited about the countries that are drawn in our group. We have some of the best countries in the world and playing against the best is ultimately how you get better. Our fundamental goal is to progress out of the group stages and go as far as we can in the World Championships.”

Mali’s first ever game in the sixteen-team tournament will be against Brazil on 8 June.

2,mali,"In Cape Town, the residents brace for “Day Zero” in late August, when the taps could run dry. Further north, in the Sahel, drought has prematurely thrust migrating communities into the crosshairs of soldiers from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, adding to the conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Looking out her window at the snow-covered ground following another nor’easter, climate scientist Lisa Goddard ponders weather’s effect on other global crises: the drought leading to the Syrian civil war, torrential rain causing floods in India and Pakistan, the recent hurricanes that wrecked the Caribbean — outcomes she might have predicted. But unlike a TV meteorologist, Goddard, director of Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), doesn’t attempt to forecast the weather on any specific day. Rather, she looks months ahead, offering longer-term predictions — a bit like The Old Farmer’s Almanac but with “climatology and actual statistics of variability behind it,” she says.

“We study phenomena that may cause a region’s climate to differ from previous years,” Goddard continues. “A key factor is the temperature of the oceans … and since ocean currents change slowly, we can anticipate their effects on the atmosphere.”

As the director of IRI, which assists developing countries to prepare for and manage the impacts of climate change, Goddard, 51, has traveled from Colombia to Zambia — and many countries in between — helping to build national forecasting systems from scratch and working with aid agencies, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to anticipate the next weather emergency. Until just recently, however, neither Goddard nor academics in general have been seated at the tables of the United Nations, the World Bank or any other multilateral organization advising on policy and programs for society at large.

Goddard is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.”

That will soon change. In April 2017, President Lee Bollinger announced Columbia World Projects (CWP) — perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in his nearly 16-year tenure — to connect the capacities of the Ivory Tower to organizations with the power to translate research into programs that benefit the global community. “The extraordinary developments in recent decades of greater interconnectedness … have created or accelerated highly complex problems and have given rise to political movements favoring a reversal or change of course,” Bollinger said in a statement announcing CWP. “The multilateral institutions created in the period following the Second World War are straining under new realities. … All of this calls out for universities to become more involved.”

Nicholas Lemann, former dean of Columbia’s journalism school, has been tasked with directing CWP, and Goddard will lead its inaugural project focused on climate threats to food production and nutrition in six countries (Ethiopia, Senegal, Colombia, Guatemala, Bangladesh and Vietnam). In addition to improving food security, her goals include expanding economic livelihoods and supporting environmental stability. Goddard also wants to expand an enterprise created and implemented at the IRI — index insurance, which issues payouts to farmers in years when the weather causes categorical loss.

Surprisingly, climate change did not drive Goddard’s interest in weather. It started instead with a love of physics. Born in California to a teacher and a government official, Goddard received her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in atmospheric and oceanic sciences from Princeton University. While at Princeton, she developed a curiosity about the cyclical El Niño climate pattern, which brought her to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the El Niño guru himself: Mark Cane, who helped build the first computer model to successfully predict the 1985 El Niño months in advance. Cane went on to found the IRI with a mission to help millions of people by better preparing for the effects of droughts and changing ocean temperatures.

“I have known Lisa since she was a student, and as the IRI director, she has worked a miracle, taking an organization that was demoralized and facing a serious threat to its existence, and bringing it to extraordinary vibrancy,” says Cane, referring to IRI’s loss of funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which threatened to shutter the institute a few years back.

“I believe the IRI is increasingly recognized worldwide as the expert institution for application of climate science to societies in the developing world. This was what the IRI was intended to be, but it took Lisa to make it a reality,” Cane adds.

For her part, Goddard, who has two sons and lives north of Manhattan near the Hudson River, says that she is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.” Still, she has her critics. Judith Curry, a former professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, says that IRI’s seasonal forecasting methods are several levels below state of the art.

“Their approach relies heavily on forecasts of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña, which has no particular skill beyond a few months,” Curry says. “Even if they were able to accurately predict [the El Niño effect], this shows very little skill in predicting the intensity of the Asian and African monsoon rains. Simply put, they are not using the best models, and their interpretation of the drivers of climate dynamics is overly simplistic.”

Goddard says that even the best models have errors and biases. “This is something that is not handled in any sophisticated way for real-time prediction at any other center in the world,” she explains. “The biggest sin in the prediction world … is using the output of a model, straight off the shelf, and without consideration of those who are using the information.” People of all backgrounds with a little training can make use of the information the IRI provides, Goddard insists, not just climate scientists.

“Once, in a meeting in Kenya,” Goddard recalls, “a colleague of mine communicated the concept of probability, which is not a word in their local language, to aid workers by using a paper airplane, which he flew repeatedly, marking all the spots where it landed on the floor to represent the range of possible climate outcomes.

“The locals got it, and their communities have since embraced our forecasts.”",Severe Weather Ahead: She's Predicting the Next Climate Crisis,https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/severe-weather-ahead-shes-predicting-the-next-climate-crisis/85664
3,mali,"Khadidia Maïga was frustrated by how Google searches of her country tended to throw out keywords like “terrorism,” “poverty” and “deprivation.” But she decided she wasn’t going to just sit back and criticize her country’s increasingly dysfunctional systems responsible for those word associations.

So, she helped create an online platform called Transformons le Mali (Let’s Transform Mali) that calls for ideas from the public and then processes them into a comprehensive plan for change. She and her friends, she says, have long discussed what kind of country they want to live in, and what needs to be done. Now they’re doing it.

And they’re not alone. Using the power of the internet, a new breed of cyber-activists is emerging in Mali, trying to connect citizens and urge them to move beyond living-room criticism into actual action for change. At their heart, these initiatives are about upturning a political culture that is disconnected from Mali’s citizens and a social culture of apathy born out of disillusionment.

We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about. Khadidia Maïga, cofounder, Transformons le Mali

The 2012 crisis was what pushed Fatouma Harber, a Timbuktu-based teacher and blogger, toward activism too. On her blog, Facebook page and Twitter account, she takes on Islamist forces she views as imposing an alien version of the religion on a city that for centuries has been a center of moderate Islamic teachings and science. And Transformons le Mali is planning to unveil a roadmap of action in June, a month before Mali’s presidential elections.

For Ousmane Maïga, who was born in Mali, has lived in New York and now shuffles between France and the country of his birth, the turning points were an armed rebellion and a coup — both in 2012 — that shook the nation to its core. The coup, which threatened to reverse Mali’s limited gains since its transition to democracy in 1991, left Ousmane and his friends feeling helpless. So, they devised and launched kouloubametre.com, a website and a discussion tool that tracks the current president’s election promises and the status of their implementation.

“We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about,” says Khadidia.

Almost everyone in this vast West African nation — the size of Alaska, Texas and Michigan combined — has a smartphone, so the emergence of cyber-activism isn’t surprising. But these initiatives aren’t limited to the country’s borders. They strive to include the vast diaspora — an estimated 1.2 million Malians live in France alone.

That diaspora connection is important. At the time of the 2012 coup, most of them weren’t in the country. “We had no say in the matter,” Ousmane recalls. That won’t happen again with others in the diaspora, if kouloubametre.com has its way. To overcome the challenge that many cannot read, write or express themselves in French, the official language, Ousmane and her colleagues send people apps on their smartphones that allow them to contribute ideas in any language.

For Harber, having her say online is critical, for the future of her city. ”I have to represent my city, as an integral part of Mali with its inclusive culture that others have been trying to take away from us,” she says. But she has also started a platform called Sankoré Labs that serves an incubator, a co-working space and a digital training school, all rolled into one. As a young girl, she found her family background and culture nourished her talents. She wants Sankoré Labs to play that role too. It’s a place “for the young,” she says, “where they can work, receive training in how to navigate the digital world and regain a sense of self-value.”

Will any of this work? These movements are emerging in a political context marked by a “very large” gap between citizens and politicians, says Baba Dakono, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, an Africa-wide research organization that looks into terrorism, justice and governance. “There is no space for debate,” he says. Mali has tried multiple experiments since adopting democracy, says Dakono. It has had citizens’ action and reflection circles. But leaders ultimately succumbed to political gamesmanship and lost the trust of citizens, he adds.

For the new digital initiatives to succeed, they need to “bridge that gap,” says Dakono. “They can do this by becoming wellsprings of ideas,” he says. “And by remaining independent.”

That’s what Transformons le Mali is trying to do. So far, the website has received around 200 ideas on subjects such as health care, agriculture, security, education, culture and identity. To avoid just being a receptacle of ideas, the group is working in thematic teams, each processing ideas related to a sector. A Transformation Plan for Mali, based on this work, will be unveiled publicly in June, says Mamadou Camara, the project’s coordinator. They will also share the plan with “all candidates and we’ll get them to pledge to carry it out if they get elected,” says Camara.

Won’t this pull them into exactly the kind of political game Dakono is warning against? Maybe. But the urgency of Mali’s predicament is such that the activists and their supporters worry more about the inevitable failure that comes from doing nothing. “We seem to be stuck with a political class that is incapable, some even say unwilling, to do anything about the crisis we’re in,” says Ousmane. “And so — it’s up to us.”

That urgency appears to be resonating. Sirandou Diawara is a young Franco-Malian architect who has embraced the new movement. “We’re in a time of crisis, and we must come up with solutions,” she says. She’s trying to figure out how best she can contribute, professionally and personally.

These disparate activities are only loosely connected, with limited contact with each other. But they’re part of a wider emergence of digital change agents across West Africa nations, who regularly meet — a conclave has been planned in Ouagadougou in June.

The movement may be spreading, but Malian cyber-activists are clear. They’re only starting out, and their journey is long. Khadidia Maïga mulls what it will take for her to feel content. That will be when Mali’s youth start acting on their own. “We’re a catalyst,” she says. “All we want to do is to change minds.”",Can Cyber-Activism Strengthen Mali's Democracy?,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/can-cyber-activism-strengthen-malis-democracy/86264

Operational Updates

Implementation of the Transitional Interim Country Strategic Plan (T-ICSP) began in January 2018. The T-ICSP is based on seven strategic outcomes and aims to support the Government in achieving its National Development Plan (CREDD 2016–2018), the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of Zero Hunger and SDG 17, Partnership.

According to the March 2018 Cadre Harmonisé, 390 000 people are in urgent need of food assistance, with this number rising to 930,000 from June 2018. These figures are higher than the projection made in November 2017. The increase in food insecurity is due to a poor agricultural harvest in some areas, persistent insecurity in northern and central Mali, a basic food basket which is 20-30 percent higher than the same time last year, all of which affect the poorest and most vulnerable households. In addition, insufficient water and low levels of biomass have led to early transhumance, increasing the strain on natural resources and risks of conflicts over resources. These factors have resulted in a deterioration in the food security situation.

In line with the T-ICSP Strategic Result 1 and 2, WFP aims to provide emergency and seasonal assistance to 155,000 vulnerable people starting from March. To combat the deteriorating situation, from June WFP will increase food assistance to 504,000. A total of 197,000 children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and lactating women will be assisted to prevent malnutrition. WFP plans to provide nutritious foods to 298,000 children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women to treat acute malnutrition.

WFP continues to provide food assistance for assets creation in the food-insecure areas vulnerable to agro-climatic shocks.

5,mali,"Officially they are there to fight terror, but external interventions may be more about self-interest. By IBRAHIM MÄIGA.

First published by ISS Today

Foreign military footprints, especially those of the United States (US) and France, are expanding in West Africa, particularly in the Sahel. This presence is receiving increasingly hostile public criticism. It is often considered invasive, and at times ill-adapted and ineffective against growing insecurity, and even counterproductive.

Regarding the opening of a US military base in Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo said in April, “So let me state with the clearest affirmation that Ghana has not offered a military base, and will not offer a military base to the United States of America.” This statement came in response to protests that shook the country after a defence cooperation agreement was signed with the United States.

Four months earlier, Nigerian authorities denied having authorised the deployment of Italian military personnel in the north of the country, which would have added to the existing US and French military bases in the region of Agadez.

Foreign military presence in the region was previously restricted to advising, training and equipping national armies. However, since the start of the 2012 Malian crisis, it has expanded to include active ground troops, with the installation of logistical and military bases. The occupation of northern Mali by extremists triggered a French military intervention in January 2013. This helped stop the progress of violent extremists moving towards the south, and contributed to driving them out of major cities.

In this military frenzy, Mali and Niger, at the crossroads of regional instability, have also become epicentres of Western power security dynamics in the Sahel. Despite using similar security rhetoric to justify their presence, Western powers seem to have different agendas.

If the war against terror remains the US’s top priority in the region, it seems that European partners such as Germany and Italy are guided by motives to control migration. The Italian government’s decision in December last year to send troops to Niger to combat terrorism seems more about controlling migration flows. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 75% of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe in 2017 landed in Italy and most moved through Niger.

Germany’s contribution of 1,000 soldiers to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the opening of a German logistics base in Niger’s capital, Niamey, reinforce the country’s presence in the Sahel and its drive to be at the forefront of the fight against irregular migration.

While the rise of violent extremism and organised crime in the Sahel have accelerated foreign military presence, so has a weakening of the states in the region. Poor state governance in the Sahel is characterised in most countries by endemic corruption, a weak justice system, an inability to provide basic social services and an ineffective integration of peripheral regions. This creates an enabling environment for extremist groups to deepen their local connections and strengthen their efforts.

If France intervened in 2013 at the request the Malian transitional authorities, it was in the name of a common past, but also to protect its own nationals and defend its strategic and economic interests in the region.

For example, the country continues to import uranium, essential for its nuclear energy, from neighbouring Niger. The intervention, known as ‘Operation Serval’, was replaced six months later by Barkhane, whose mandate is preventive in nature. It costs about €1 million a day and is present across the five countries of the G5 Sahel – Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad.

While the French presence is widely publicised, other countries such as the US and Germany are more discreet. In October 2017, four US commandos and five Nigerien soldiers died in Tongo Tongo, a village near the border with Mali. The Islamic State in the Great Sahara claimed responsibility for the ambush. The attack revealed not only the extent of the US military presence in Niger, but its expanding military footprint in the region. It also showed that despite regional efforts, complex and sophisticated attacks by extremists continue.

The rhetoric following the Tongo Tongo attack – presenting the Sahel as the new frontier of global jihad – carries significant risks. Numerous studies, including by the Institute for Security Studies, have highlighted the importance of local dynamics when considering the emergence and expansion of terrorist groups in the region. These groups exploit people’s grievances against state governance, and community tensions between, for example, farmers and herders.

Furthermore, the US decision to weaken rules of engagement for the troops deployed on the ground seems risky. Targeting errors can be exploited by violent extremist groups to consolidate their presence and thus influence the effectiveness of interventions.

Popular dissatisfaction with the foreign military presence has increased in the region, and the French forces, welcomed by quasi-general consensus in Mali in 2013, are facing growing public criticism. Protests across Mali have denounced French policy, perceived as seeking only to protect its interests to the detriment of those of the local populations. In Niger, too, protesters responding to the call of a coalition of civil society organisations chanted last February, “French, American and German armies, go away!”

On the whole, the many military interventions in the Sahel show Western powers’ desire to defend their strategic security, political, diplomatic or economic interests. Trying to mask this only amplifies the impression of a region that’s victim to the geo-political calculations of foreign powers. DM

7,mali,"Lewis MacKenzie, a retired major-general, was the first commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo.

So, the United Nations has officially requested Canada provide helicopter support to its floundering “peacekeeping” mission in Mali. Okay, but that is not the full story – far from it. You see, the UN never makes a formal public request for support from a country that is turned down. This would be too embarrassing for both parties.

In this case, Canada spent an enormous amount of time and effort to study, research, liaise, travel and debate internally before it publicly promised to contribute a modest force of some 600 souls to help out somewhere in the multitude of possibilities in Africa. The UN was pleased with the expectation that a small battalion of our highly capable soldiers would be sent to one of the three major UN missions to augment the Third World contingents currently doing the dirty work on the ground. After months of inexplicable foot dragging, the private negotiations with the UN resulted in Canada agreeing to a formal request for some helicopters. The UN was disappointed, but at least it was an actual commitment somewhere on the horizon.

Once the modest pledge had finally been announced, the subsequent public political pronouncements contributed even more to embarrassing our country at home and abroad. Having taken more than a year to come up with the commitment, we were told ad nauseam that while Mali was the most dangerous of the UN missions in Africa, our folks would be safe by avoiding the IED threat and ambushes by the insurgents.

Now I come to the crux of the matter: risk. In any sane planning process involving deployments into hostile territory, the first question that needs to be answered is, “What is the aim of the mission we are about to join?” The second question must be, “What is the chance of success?” When those two questions are answered in a positive, satisfactory manner, then planning for the Mali mission should continue. However, the misleading answer to the first question has been, “to contribute to the peace process,” which is ridiculous in the extreme, as there is no functioning peace process. With regard to the second question, the answer is “absolutely none.”

When the aim becomes clear and is determined to be in Canada’s best interests – including the ethical issue of protecting innocent victims who need our help – then proceed. Gaza, Sinai, Cyprus, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Central America and Sarajevo are but a few examples of missions where risk was accepted as a given.

In the case of Mali, our government’s obsession with avoiding risk and actually advertising such is a clear indication that the decision makers do not believe the objective is achievable. Regarding the chance of success, the predicted end to the Canadian mission is our own self-declared end date of one year – no matter how serious the situation is on the ground or in the air at the time. Success has nothing to do with our departure.

Mali is a classic dog’s breakfast. In fact, it’s a dog’s breakfast discovered after he’s been sick. First, there is the on-again, off-again civil war that’s been raging since the coup born of NATO’s ill-founded attack on Moammar Gadhafi’s forces in 2011. Second, there are competing insurgencies and terrorist groups sometimes fighting each other and other times linking up to advance their own short-term self-interests. There are multiple international missions operating in the country with different aims, some of which are actually achievable: the mission of the effective French operation is to kill as many of the insurgents as possible. For others, it’s to protect some isolated communities vulnerable to attack. Some are not sure what the aim is, and hunker down in their base locations. The compelling and illustrative fact is that none of them want or will agree to operate under UN command and control, realizing that the UN is experiencing serious challenges in leading its own force of 16,000.

Before Canada deploys to Mali, let’s be told what the actual objective is. If it’s to support the so-called stalled peace process, that’s not good enough. If it was to be the protection of a small geographical populated area under threat, then fine, deploy Canadian boots on the ground to do so. If it’s to win some UN brownie points with a modest, low-risk contribution for future consideration when it comes time to seek a rotating seat on the Security Council, then stay home. Soldiers aren’t political pawns – at least they shouldn’t be.

Fifa has extended the mandate of a normalisation committee set up to run Mali's Football Association (Femafoot) until 31 October.

This would enable the committee led by Dao Fatoumata Guindo to finalise a roadmap that will pave the way for Femafoot elections.

Fifa installed the normalisation committee on 20 December with a four-month mission to revise the statutes, conduct elections and manage the daily affairs of Femafoot.

It came after Fifa banned Mali for governmental interference into the running of the country's football, the ban was lifted when the committee was allowed to begin work.,

Veron Mosengo-Omba, who is the African and Caribbean Regional Director at football's world governing body, said it was important to give more time for the committee to complete their work.

""A draft revision of the statute is under way and Fifa will give its full support,"" the Fifa delegate told reporters in Mali.

""We all know that the reason behind the creation of the committee is to organise a free and transparent elections in accordance with both the Fifa and Caf statutes.

""For that to happen, certain prerequisites must be implemented including the judicial body, the revision of the statutes, not forgetting a very important point, which is that all the candidates must pass an integrity test.

""Fifa, specifically its emergency committee decided to extend the committee's mandate until 31 October 2018 so that these prerequisites can be fulfilled before holding an elective general assembly.""

9,mali,"Suspected rebels have killed at least 17 civilians belonging to the Tuareg ethnic community in northern Mali, just days after 40 Tuaregs were killed during a similar raid on nearby villages, authorities say.

The attacks occurred on Tuesday in the village of Tindibawen, 160km east of the town of Menaka near the border with Niger, and in a nearby village, Nanout Kotia, mayor of Menaka, told Reuters news agency.

Violence has escalated in recent months as armed groups, once confined to the remote north of the west African country, have exploited ethnic tensions to recruit Fulani herders and extend their presence further south.

Fulani herders have come into conflict with Tuareg pastoralists over access to scarce water points.

In recent months, Tuareg civilian defence groups, supported by French soldiers, have fought against al-Qaeda-linked fighters in northeastern Mali.

The attacks in the villages may also be an attempt to further exploit tensions between Tuareg and Fulani herdsmen.

Mali has been struggling with lawlessness in the north since Tuareg rebels and al-Qaeda-linked fighters sought to take control there six years ago.

Tuareg rebels declared independence in April 2012, just a month after President Amadou Toumani Toure was pushed out in a coup.

But three months later they lost ground to Ansar Dine, a group with links to al-Qaeda that imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law on the local population, carrying out amputations and executions.

In early 2013, France intervened militarily to assist Malian government forces to take back the region.

10,mali,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Five million people in West Africa’s Sahel region will need food aid in the coming months following a drought, but current funding will be insufficient to prevent starvation, the United Nations said on Thursday.

Six countries in the Sahel, a semi-arid belt below the Sahara, are facing the worst hunger in years after poor rains caused little vegetation to grow, U.N. agencies said.

The peak of the crisis has not yet hit, but more supplies must be ordered now to prevent deaths from malnutrition in June and July, said the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF.

“For once, the agencies and our partners are calling for action before the tragedy,” UNICEF’s regional director Marie-Pierre Poirier told journalists in Senegal’s capital Dakar.

“We must act now, immediately, to avoid children dying.”

More than 1.6 million children in the region are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, 50 percent more than during the Sahel’s last major food crisis in 2012, UNICEF said.

The agency expects it will need 1.3 million packets of therapeutic food to save the most vulnerable, but it has only been able to order 700,000 so far, said Poirier.

The area at risk includes parts of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, southern Mauritania and northern Senegal.

The Sahel has only one growing season, so if it goes poorly due to climate shocks or conflict people must survive on whatever they have until the next one, said Abdou Dieng, regional director of the World Food Programme (WFP).

This year, many families have already exhausted food stocks meant to last until September, and herders have been forced to migrate four months early in search of grass, U.N. agencies said.

“We are hearing of people cutting down the number of daily meals and children dropping out of school,” said Dieng.

“If we don’t do anything for these people, what will they do? Die, or join terrorist groups, or migrate,” he said.

Various conflicts in the region, home to a number of Islamist militant groups, have exacerbated the situation and will make it difficult to provide aid, he added.

12,mali,"Pro-Mali militia fighters in the Mali-Niger border region

Over the course of the last week, intercommunal violence within Mali’s northern Menaka region has escalated in dramatic fashion. Dozens of civilians from Tuareg and Fulani communities have been killed in massacres while ongoing counterterrorism operations are being conducted against the so-called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).

Starting between April 26 and April 27, at least 40 people from the Daoussahak Tuareg were killed in two separate attacks on remote villages in the Menaka area near the Gao region. While no one has claimed credit for the massacres, two pro-Mali militias, the Imghad and Allies Self Defense Movement (GATIA) and the Movement for the Salvation of Azawad (MSA), have placed the blame on ISGS.

GATIA is a signatory member of the Platforme alliance, a group of largely pro-Malian state armed groups in the northern half of the country. MSA was founded last year by former members of several pro-Azawad groups [Azawad refers to northern Mali], but is allied to GATIA and other Platforme groups. The two have been counterterrorism partners with Mali, Niger, and France in the Gao and Menaka regions.

On the same day as the murders of the Tuareg, GATIA and MSA have been accused of killing dozens of Fulani in Niger near the borders with Mali in retaliation for the massacre of the Tuaregs. This is not the first time the two militias have been accused of extra-judicial killings. Last month, the UN reported that there have been at least 95 extra-judicial killings in the Menaka region since the beginning of the year. GATIA and MSA are believed to be responsible for the majority of the murders.

On May 1, suspected ISGS militants again targeted two Tuareg camps near the borders with Niger, which left at least 16 people dead. These massacres came after another joint GATIA-MSA operation alongside Malian and Nigerian troops against ISGS fighters. While yesterday, more intercommunal violence was reported.

The counterterrorism operations being conducted in the Menaka area have steadily deteriorated into large scale intercommunal conflict between Tuaregs, Fulani, and other populations inhabiting the Mali-Niger border areas.

Since February of this year, operations against ISGS have been occurring as part of a renewed push to combat the jihadist group. Last October, four US Special Forces soldiers and five Nigerien soldiers were killed in ambush by ISGS militants in the locale of Tongo Tongo close to the Malian borders.

A few weeks later, troops from the G5 Sahel [an alliance between the Sahelien states] deployed to the tri-border region of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The troops, which are from the three aforementioned countries, are meant to combat rising militancy and criminal activities in the region.

They join French troops, which have long conducted anti-jihadist operations in the tri-border region. Lastly, suspected ISGS militants launched a suicide car bombing against French troops near the Malian town of In-Delimane earlier this year.

However, the renewed push against the ISGS militants did not begin in earnest until Feb. 22. French troops, along with militants from GATIA and MSA, battled the jihadists in the In-Delimane area of Mali’s northern Gao region. In a statement released by GATIA, the joint operation reportedly left at least six jihadists dead. According to RFI, the operations lasted until Feb. 24.

On Feb. 25, more clashes between the Tuareg alliance and ISGS were reported between the Malian town of Akabar and Bani Bangou in Niger. In these raids, at least 12 jihadists were reportedly killed and another six were captured according to a statement released by the alliance. On March 6, French troops clashed with jihadists near In-Delimane.

While no group was specified, militants belonging to ISGS are widely suspected to have been the target. Militants belonging to al Qaeda’s Group for Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) are also known to operate in this area too.

One day later, the GATIA-MSA alliance released a statement saying that its forces clashed with ISGS in the Tinzouragan area of Gao. At least five jihadists were killed, including a high level commander named as Djibo Hamma. Other militants and vehicles were reported captured.

On March 11, seven more jihadists, including a reported senior leader, identified as Almahmoud Ag Idar, were killed by the Tuareg alliance near Tabardé, Mali. It is also likely in this battle that the Tuareg forces recovered a vehicle used by US Special Forces in the Oct. 4 ambush.

In late March, French troops, along with soldiers from Mali and Niger, as well as militants from GATIA and MSA, launched a coordinated offensive in the Mali-Niger border region. On April 1, the combined forces reported a large-scale assault on ISGS.

The Tuareg groups reported two separate clashes, one in Akabar, Mali and the other in Bani Bangou, Niger, which killed at least 20 jihadists. However, the French military first reported at least 30 jihadists, but this number was later raised to 60. The actual number of jihadists killed is unclear. On April 6, GATIA and MSA reported more clashes in the Mali-Niger border region. At least 15 jihadists were reportedly captured by the alliance, as well as vehicles and weapons.

Jihadist groups, both ISGS and JNIM, can take advantage of the growing violence by positioning themselves as self-defense or community defense groups for marginalized communities. In many respects, the two already do so and recruit from the Fulani, Tuareg, or Arabs in the Menaka region. However, the massacres allow for a heightened sense of tension and fear among the local populations in which the jihadists can exploit.

By continuing to ally with and utilize militias such as GATIA or MSA, Mali, France, and Niger, stand to lose whatever legitimacy they had with the local populations. Jihadists can also exploit anti-government or anti-French sentiments which have been further exacerbated by the eye for an eye killings currently taking place in the Menaka region.

By Nellie Peyton

DAKAR, April 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ethnic violence in central Mali has driven 3,000 people into northern Burkina Faso since February, straining dwindling food and medical supplies in that part of the West African nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali's Mopti region, said a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

The influx is putting pressure on vulnerable host communities in Burkina Faso's north, which is facing its worst hunger in years coupled with growing violence, aid agencies said.

""We think that the influx of new asylum-seekers might aggravate the situation,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Marlies Cardoen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Poor rains last year have left almost a million people in need of food aid in Burkina Faso, while attacks by a homegrown Islamist group are on the rise.

The new arrivals - including 2,000 Malians and 1,000 Burkinabe who had settled in Mali - are mostly staying with friends and relatives in volatile, hard-to-reach areas near the border, said UNHCR.

""We want them to come to Ouahigouya (the nearest town) or the refugee camp where we can register them all and give them food aid,"" said Cardoen by phone.

But some prefer to remain in the border area because they are expecting family to join them, hope to go home soon, or do not know of other options, she said.

While 3,000 people will not make a big difference on a national scale, it could have an impact in host communities, said Christian Munezero, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

""It is worrying, especially if it's on the level of one community or a few villages,"" he said.

The refugees have no work opportunities, and parents fear sending their children to school because of attacks, said UNHCR.

The 3,000 new arrivals add to about 24,000 Malians who have fled to Burkina Faso since Islamists seized Mali's desert north in 2012. French troops intervened to push them back a year later, but Islamist attacks and ethnic fighting persist.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

After six years of armed conflict in the north, and despite progress made since the peace accord in 2015, Mali remains affected by a protracted and multifaceted humanitarian crisis compounded by a deteriorating security situation. The lack of access to essential services and limited State presence and capacity in both the north and the centre are driving humanitarian needs. The slow implementation of the peace agreement contributes to exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the affected populations in north and centre Mali. In that regard, main challenges include the slow redeployment of the interim authorities, the difficulties in the establishment of the Operational Coordination Mechanism (MOC) and the delayed Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process.

As of February 2018, some 46,330 people remain internally displaced due to the conflictincluding individuals displaced since 2012. This represents an increase from December 2017 (38,100 IDPs), with 8,100 new IDPs registered in February in Mopti, Menaka, and Timbuktu, due to a resurgence in communal violence and armed conflict in northern Mali. In addition, over 134,000 Malian people have sought refuge in the neighbouring countries of Niger, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso (UNHCR Data Portal). Around 526,000 long-term IDPs from the conflict have returned between 2013 and 2018. Yet, in many areas, conditions for a safe return, such as security and access to essential services, have not been met.

Humanitarian needs increased with up to 4.1 million people in need of food assistance in 2018, with projections for the lean season in June-August 2018 estimating that 795,000 people will be facing Crisis [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3] and 20,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In some areas of Kayes, Segou, Mopti, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal regions, food insecurity worsened since 2017. The malnutrition situation in 2018 is likely to be worse than estimated at the end of 2017. The process of the Cadre Harmonisé (Joint National Food Security and Nutrition Analysis) which took place in Mali at the end of November 2017 indicated that the food security has deteriorated continuously since 2016 and will continue to deteriorate in 2018, due to an earlier-than-expected lean season and erratic rains. As food insecurity is one of the determinants of malnutrition, the Ministry of Health through its Nutrition Division and in collaboration with the Nutrition Cluster has revised the need for nutrition upwards for 2018. The expected cases of SAM for 2018 will rise to the national level from 162,913 to 274,145, and the expected cases of MAM for 2018 will also increase from 470,000 to 582,000. This makes an increase of 229,000 malnourished children including 111,232 severe acute malnourished children under-5, 489,238 children from 6 to 59 months of moderate acute malnutrition and 45,245 pregnant and lactating women.

Overall, 1.73 million people are in need of health assistance as the health system has gradually deteriorated in the conflictaffected regions in northern and central Mali. Indeed, a shortage of medical staff is reported, with only three health workers per 10,000 inhabitants in 2017. Between 1 January and 20 February 2018, 109 cases of measles, including 49 confirmed, were reported in Ansongo (Gao), Bandiagara and Douentza (Mopti), and Yanfolila and Kadiolo (Sikasso).

Some 908,000 people are in need of WASH assistance throughout Mali, including 788,000 in northern and central Mali. Up to 63% of the population do not have access to water.

Some 950,000 people are in need of protection, including from 526,000 children. The school year 2018-2019, has shown a rise in the number of schools closed (715 in February 2018, from 500 in May 2017). This increased albeit is due to a combination of insecurity in the affected regions, in addition to the already chronic challenges of the education system such as lack of teachers, lack of food canteens and poor infrastructure.","UNICEF Mali Humanitarian Situation Report, January – February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/unicef-mali-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018

17,mali,"Jihadists killed 17 civilians in an attack of “unparalleled horror” in northern Mali, near the border with Niger, local militia groups said on Wednesday.

Elderly people were burned alive in their homes and attackers looted property.

It came days after suspected jihadists killed more than 40 people on April 26 and 27 in the northwestern region of Menaka, according to the UN.

“On May 1, members of the same terrorist group summarily executed 17 people in Tindinbawen and Taylalene,” GATIA and MSA said in a joint statement.

GATIA — the acronym in French for the Imghad and Allies Touareg Self-Defence Force — is a pro-government group, while the MSA stands for Movement for the Salvation of Azawad (MSA), comprising former rebels.

The latest attack “reached an unparalleled level of horror”, the statement said, adding that after their attack, the assailants made off with looted possessions.

The French force Barkhane said the perpetrators probably belonged to a group calling itself the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.

That group is led by Adnane Abou Walid Sahraoui, a former member of another jihadist group called al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known by its French acronym of AQMI.

18,mali,"Suspected rebel fighters in Mali have killed dozens of people belonging to the ethnic Tuareg community in two attacks near the country's border with Niger, according to local sources.

Daouda Maiga, governor of Menaka region, said on Saturday that motorbike-riding gunmen staged the attacks in the remote northeastern villages of Awakassa on Friday and in Anderanboucane, a day earlier.

He said Fulani members of Islamic State Greater Sahara likely attacked in retaliation for military actions supported by Tuareg in the region bordering Niger, The Associated Press news agency reported.

In recent months, Tuareg civilian defence groups, supported by French soldiers, have fought against al-Qaeda-linked fighters in northeastern Mali.

The attacks in the villages may also be an attempt to further exploit tensions between Tuareg and Fulani herdsmen.

""There have been 43 deaths in two days, all civilians, from the same community,"" tribal leader Sidigui Ag Hamadi told AFP news agency from the regional capital, Menaka.



""Our fighters are destroying their bases and wiping them out. They are targeting innocent civilians,"" he added, saying he viewed the bloodletting as a reprisal for attacks by armed Tuareg groups.

Peace deal

The Tuareg group National Movement for the Salvation of Azawad also put the death toll from the two attacks at 43.

It urged the governments of Mali and Niger to take steps to ensure that ""an immediate end is put to these abominable crimes"" and added that it would ""not give in to any intimidation"".

Mali has been struggling with lawlessness in the north since Tuareg rebels and al-Qaeda-linked fighters sought to take control there six years ago.

Tuareg rebels declared independence in April 2012, just a month after President Amadou Toumani Toure was pushed out in a coup.

But three months later they lost ground to Ansar Dine, a group with links to al-Qaeda that imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law on the local population, carrying out amputations and executions.



In early 2013, France intervened militarily to assist Malian government forces to take back the region.

Two years later, Mali's government and Tuareg rebels signed a peace deal.

'Get Tuareg fighting again'

Speaking to Al Jazeera, analyst Nii Akuetteh said he believed the latest attacks were an attempt to provoke the Tuareg into a larger conflict.

""The Tuareg have had conflicts and disagreements with whichever government has been in Bamako ever since independence in 1960, because they, as a separate ethnic group, have always argued that they want to separate, they want their own country,"" he said.

""They have always agitated for this. A few years back, they signed the most recent peace deal with the government which so far appears to be holding.

""[So,] why would the terrorists target them? It would seem that they are trying to get the Tuareg to once again pick up the guns and destabilise the government of Mali. I think that may be the reason why they are trying to target the Tuareg and get them fighting again.""",Suspected rebel fighters kill dozens of Tuareg in Mali,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/suspected-rebel-fighters-kill-dozens-tuareg-mali-180429075636520.html
19,mali,"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is alarmed at a spike in intercommunal violence in central Mali which over the past weeks has driven some 3,000 people into neighbouring Burkina Faso.

Dozens of people have been killed in clashes between the Dogon and Peul communities since February, and homes and other property have been destroyed, mainly in the Koro area of central Mali’s Mopti region.

The violence led 3,000 people to flee across the border into Burkina Faso’s Nord Region between mid- February and early April. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the start of the Mali conflict in 2012.

With extremist and inter-communal violence on the rise UNHCR now fears more displacement and increased humanitarian needs.

The new arrivals in Burkina Faso include 2,000 Malian citizens as well as 1,000 Burkinabe who had been living in Mali for many years. With many afraid to travel by road, for fear of kidnappings and murder, they arrived via unofficial border crossings, on foot or in light vehicles.

The new displacement adds to the challenges faced by people of the region. Food insecurity is high due to a lack of rain affecting crops. Health facilities are equally overstretched, with gaps in medicines and staff.

Hosted by friends or relatives, the new arrivals are staying in areas that are hard to reach. UNHCR is urging them to move to a camp further away from the border, where they could be registered and have access to basic social services.

This would also afford better protection, as insecurity is rising in the north of Burkina Faso, with recurrent acts of banditry and violence in areas that are hosting Malian refugees. Refugees have no work opportunities, in order to sustain themselves, and parents are afraid to send their children to school.

Insecurity in northern Burkina Faso has also led to internal displacement. It is reported that several thousand Burkinabe in the Soum province of the Sahel region have left their homes, fleeing southwards or to the east inside the borders of their country.

Together with the authorities, UNHCR is working to relocate to safe zones refugees settled in spontaneous sites. We are also working to assist vulnerable people, such as the elderly, single women and children. Distributions of basic relief items and provision of long-term support are urgently needed, especially for the youth.

Currently, UNHCR operations in Burkina Faso are only funded by 8 per cent. An additional US$22.9 million is needed to help in 2018.

20,mali,"France will lead a push at the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on parties in Mali blocking efforts to turn a three-year-old peace agreement into reality on the ground, the French ambassador said on Wednesday.

Britain and the United States said they backed targeted sanctions as violence continues to engulf the West African country and signatories of a 2015 peace deal fail to deliver on their promises.

""We cannot wait any longer,"" French Ambassador Francois Delattre told a council meeting on Mali.

""France will together with its partners, in the coming weeks... begin work to identify those who obstruct the implementation of the peace agreement.""

Last year, the council set up a sanctions regime for Mali that would allow the blacklisting of individuals and entities, which would be hit by a global travel ban and an assets freeze.

The list to be agreed by the council would be the first targeted sanctions imposed on Mali.

Mali's government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of armed groups in June 2015 to end the fighting, but insurgents remain active, including in central Mali.

UN envoy Mahamat Saleh Annadif told the council that the security situation was worsening as the country heads toward a presidential election in July and August.

Seven UN peacekeepers have been killed in attacks in Mali this year alone, serving in a mission that has been described as the UN's most dangerous.

The United Nations has deployed 13 000 troops and police in Mali, many of whom are deployed in the lawless north of the country.

Islamist extremists linked to Al-Qaeda took control of the desert north of Mali in early 2012, but were largely driven out in a French-led military operation launched in January 2013.

A UN panel of experts warned in a report to the council last month that insecurity ""continues to rage"" in Mali despite diplomatic efforts.

Human, drug and arms trafficking remain rife, and despite the 2015 deal, ""the humanitarian situation in the north and center of the country remains volatile, unstable and a marked deterioration persists,"" said the report, a copy of which was obtained by AFP.

The ongoing crisis in Mali led to the creation of the multinational G5-Sahel force to respond to what the report described as ""intensified terrorist threats of the ISGS (Islamic State in the Greater Sahara) and Ansar al-Islam.""

21,mali,"Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, was speaking to journalists after a scheduled humanitarian task force meeting in Geneva.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over,” he said, amid reports that “tens of thousands of people” from Rural Damascus were preparing to evacuate to Idlib in the north-west of the country.

“We’ve still only 23 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded and we’re now in May,” Mr Egeland said, warning that there was “no cash …available to humanitarian actors” as “desperate, exhausted people arrive now every day in Idlib. There is no money for the operations.”

He called on countries not to slow down their support “before this marathon of suffering is over.”

Mr. Egeland’s comments come amid ongoing aid-access challenges, in many areas of Syria, linked to mass displacement and acute needs caused by more than seven years of war.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over” - Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria

One year ago, well over four million people lived in so-called hard-to-reach locations where aid access was extremely unreliable, and hundreds of thousands more were trapped by surrounding forces.

Today, two million people remain in hard-to-reach areas in Syria and 11,000 still live in besieged locations; but the apparent progress in terms of numbers, is deceptive, the UN Special Advisor explained:

“It is a good thing that people are not any longer living massively in besieged areas, and that much fewer people live in hard-to-reach areas. But when this comes at the cost of horrific battles in heavily populated areas, and when it comes because of agreements made by a small group of military people and politicians, too often humanitarian concerns and the protection concerns for the civilian population is lost.”

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), displacement in some parts of Syria is as high as it was at the beginning of the crisis.

OCHA’s records indicate that for every person who returns home voluntarily, another three people are newly displaced.

Areas of particular concern include Afrin in the north, the former ISIL stronghold of Raqqa, as well as Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus and Yarmouk in the south of the capital - where the UN has highly-restricted access.

But Mr. Egeland said his “worry number one” was Idlib, which is already home to more than two million people.

“They are living out in the open, they are living in congested displacement camps…crammed in collective centres,” he said.

“They arrive at 2am, you know, sort of every night now, just to find that they can hardly get a bed anywhere offered by completely overwhelmed humanitarian actors. So we cannot have a war in Idlib,” he implored.

Amid reports that armed groups are continuing to strike what Mr Egeland called “bad humanitarian agreements” to allow civilians to leave several conflict zones including the besieged Shia towns of Foah and Kafraya in the north-west and Yarmouk south of Damascus, he said it was important that people went to a place of their choosing.

Mr. Egeland also expressed concern for the 40,000 people living in displacement camps near eastern Ghouta – previously home to 390,000 people - amid a reported lack of freedom of movement for civilians, particularly men.

The veteran aid chief also defended the value of the UN-coordinated “deconfliction system” which offers protection to humanitarian locations whose location is communicated to warring parties.

More than 660 sites had now asked the UN to transmit their coordinates to Member States whose militaries are operating within Syria, Mr. Egeland said, and more than 500 of those requests had come this year alone.

“I’m surprised really by those who say they really want to help protect medical facilities, that they are questioning the whole value of trying to get a deconfliction system up in the Syria war, like we have it in Yemen, we have it in Afghanistan, we have it in Mali and many other conflicts,” he added.","‘Marathon of suffering’ in Syria conflict, far from over: UN humanitarian adviser",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008832
22,mali,"On April 19th and 20th, CaLP and the Regional Platform for Social Protection hosted a learning event exploring how humanitarian cash transfer programmes can work to support national social protection systems in the Sahel.

We were joined by a good number of government representatives from the Sahel region and beyond, including Liberia, Niger, Mali, Chad, Senegal and Comoros.

They accompanied humanitarian actors, donors and development partners to look at case studies in Liberia, Mali and Senegal, and collectively draw recommendations.

The event was very well received, and we were pleased to hear participants remarking with enthusiasm that this was the first time such a group of actors have come together to discuss these issues.

Discussions were lively and interesting, ranging from the possibility of taxing extractive industries to channelling Islamic charitable giving to fund social protection, and from what a ""household"" means in a modern urban context, to how social protection can work in conflict settings.

Recommendations emerging were around:

Strategic coordination and accountability: What role can Cash Working Groups play in supporting national social protection systems? How can we be more inclusive, build the capacity of government, and make sure we have the right resources?)

Social registries: Can government and humanitarian actors build, work from and adapt common databases of vulnerable households? What are the data protection issues? Can we share common targeting approaches?

Financing: Can we explore innovative funding sources, such as Islamic social finance, taxes on luxury items, or solidarity tax? How can we encourage flexible multi-donor funding pools?

Technical coordination: To what extent can/ should we harmonize tools, targeting criteria, and transfer values? Can we share M&E systems? How can we plan and prepare for shocks jointly?

The political situation in Mali is tense and the Malian army is currently too weak to guarantee stability and security. Many Timbuktu residents who fled the city in 2012 have not returned. They do not trust the uneasy peace and their city faces an uncertain future.

Dakar — Ethnic violence in central Mali has driven 3,000 people into northern Burkina Faso since February, straining dwindling food and medical supplies in that part of the West African nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali's Mopti region, said a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

The influx is putting pressure on vulnerable host communities in Burkina Faso's north, which is facing its worst hunger in years coupled with growing violence, aid agencies said.

""We think that the influx of new asylum-seekers might aggravate the situation,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Marlies Cardoen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Poor rains last year have left almost a million people in need of food aid in Burkina Faso, while attacks by a homegrown Islamist group are on the rise.

The new arrivals - including 2,000 Malians and 1,000 Burkinabe who had settled in Mali - are mostly staying with friends and relatives in volatile, hard-to-reach areas near the border, said UNHCR.

""We want them to come to Ouahigouya (the nearest town) or the refugee camp where we can register them all and give them food aid,"" said Cardoen by phone.

But some prefer to remain in the border area because they are expecting family to join them, hope to go home soon, or do not know of other options, she said.

While 3,000 people will not make a big difference on a national scale, it could have an impact in host communities, said Christian Munezero, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

""It is worrying, especially if it's on the level of one community or a few villages,"" he said.

The refugees have no work opportunities, and parents fear sending their children to school because of attacks, said UNHCR.

The 3,000 new arrivals add to about 24,000 Malians who have fled to Burkina Faso since Islamists seized Mali's desert north in 2012. French troops intervened to push them back a year later, but Islamist attacks and ethnic fighting persist.

from RUDD KONTE in Bamako, Mali

BAMAKO, (CAJ News) – DOZENS of civilians have been killed in the escalating clashes over resources in northern Mali in recent weeks.

The communal violence between Tuareg and Fulani groups is widespread in the Menaka region along the border with Niger.

Clashes between communities are frequent in the region, especially at this time of the year, when the unpredictable weather makes getting enough water for people and decent grazing for their livestock difficult.

However, humanitarian organisations bemoaned that the scale of the violence as far as the number of people wounded or killed and the number who have fled is unusually high.

According to local witnesses, dozens of bodies have still not been buried.

“We call on the local authorities and the international community to work with all the actors involved to find a way to end the violence,” said Loukas Petridis, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) head of delegation in Niger.

Jean-Nicolas Marti, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Mali, appealed for calm.

“We ask everyone in the region to show restraint and not add fuel to the fire. The situation is explosive,” Marti said.

ICRC is providing assistance to the health-care centres in both countries.

People wounded or injured in the fighting will be evacuated and given medical treatment for free.

The communal violence is the latest in a series of bloodshed in Mali.

Clashes between the Dogon and Peul communities in central regions have left dozens dead and 3 000 displaced to Burkina Faso.
