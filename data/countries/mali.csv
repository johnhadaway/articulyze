0,mali,"Khadidia Maïga was frustrated by how Google searches of her country tended to throw out keywords like “terrorism,” “poverty” and “deprivation.” But she decided she wasn’t going to just sit back and criticize her country’s increasingly dysfunctional systems responsible for those word associations.

So, she helped create an online platform called Transformons le Mali (Let’s Transform Mali) that calls for ideas from the public and then processes them into a comprehensive plan for change. She and her friends, she says, have long discussed what kind of country they want to live in, and what needs to be done. Now they’re doing it.

And they’re not alone. Using the power of the internet, a new breed of cyber-activists is emerging in Mali, trying to connect citizens and urge them to move beyond living-room criticism into actual action for change. At their heart, these initiatives are about upturning a political culture that is disconnected from Mali’s citizens and a social culture of apathy born out of disillusionment.

We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about. Khadidia Maïga, cofounder, Transformons le Mali

The 2012 crisis was what pushed Fatouma Harber, a Timbuktu-based teacher and blogger, toward activism too. On her blog, Facebook page and Twitter account, she takes on Islamist forces she views as imposing an alien version of the religion on a city that for centuries has been a center of moderate Islamic teachings and science. And Transformons le Mali is planning to unveil a roadmap of action in June, a month before Mali’s presidential elections.

For Ousmane Maïga, who was born in Mali, has lived in New York and now shuffles between France and the country of his birth, the turning points were an armed rebellion and a coup — both in 2012 — that shook the nation to its core. The coup, which threatened to reverse Mali’s limited gains since its transition to democracy in 1991, left Ousmane and his friends feeling helpless. So, they devised and launched kouloubametre.com, a website and a discussion tool that tracks the current president’s election promises and the status of their implementation.

“We know that there’s another Mali, with young talent and the drive to turn our country into the Mali we’re dreaming about,” says Khadidia.

Almost everyone in this vast West African nation — the size of Alaska, Texas and Michigan combined — has a smartphone, so the emergence of cyber-activism isn’t surprising. But these initiatives aren’t limited to the country’s borders. They strive to include the vast diaspora — an estimated 1.2 million Malians live in France alone.

That diaspora connection is important. At the time of the 2012 coup, most of them weren’t in the country. “We had no say in the matter,” Ousmane recalls. That won’t happen again with others in the diaspora, if kouloubametre.com has its way. To overcome the challenge that many cannot read, write or express themselves in French, the official language, Ousmane and her colleagues send people apps on their smartphones that allow them to contribute ideas in any language.

For Harber, having her say online is critical, for the future of her city. ”I have to represent my city, as an integral part of Mali with its inclusive culture that others have been trying to take away from us,” she says. But she has also started a platform called Sankoré Labs that serves an incubator, a co-working space and a digital training school, all rolled into one. As a young girl, she found her family background and culture nourished her talents. She wants Sankoré Labs to play that role too. It’s a place “for the young,” she says, “where they can work, receive training in how to navigate the digital world and regain a sense of self-value.”

Will any of this work? These movements are emerging in a political context marked by a “very large” gap between citizens and politicians, says Baba Dakono, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, an Africa-wide research organization that looks into terrorism, justice and governance. “There is no space for debate,” he says. Mali has tried multiple experiments since adopting democracy, says Dakono. It has had citizens’ action and reflection circles. But leaders ultimately succumbed to political gamesmanship and lost the trust of citizens, he adds.

For the new digital initiatives to succeed, they need to “bridge that gap,” says Dakono. “They can do this by becoming wellsprings of ideas,” he says. “And by remaining independent.”

That’s what Transformons le Mali is trying to do. So far, the website has received around 200 ideas on subjects such as health care, agriculture, security, education, culture and identity. To avoid just being a receptacle of ideas, the group is working in thematic teams, each processing ideas related to a sector. A Transformation Plan for Mali, based on this work, will be unveiled publicly in June, says Mamadou Camara, the project’s coordinator. They will also share the plan with “all candidates and we’ll get them to pledge to carry it out if they get elected,” says Camara.

Won’t this pull them into exactly the kind of political game Dakono is warning against? Maybe. But the urgency of Mali’s predicament is such that the activists and their supporters worry more about the inevitable failure that comes from doing nothing. “We seem to be stuck with a political class that is incapable, some even say unwilling, to do anything about the crisis we’re in,” says Ousmane. “And so — it’s up to us.”

That urgency appears to be resonating. Sirandou Diawara is a young Franco-Malian architect who has embraced the new movement. “We’re in a time of crisis, and we must come up with solutions,” she says. She’s trying to figure out how best she can contribute, professionally and personally.

These disparate activities are only loosely connected, with limited contact with each other. But they’re part of a wider emergence of digital change agents across West Africa nations, who regularly meet — a conclave has been planned in Ouagadougou in June.

The movement may be spreading, but Malian cyber-activists are clear. They’re only starting out, and their journey is long. Khadidia Maïga mulls what it will take for her to feel content. That will be when Mali’s youth start acting on their own. “We’re a catalyst,” she says. “All we want to do is to change minds.”",Can Cyber-Activism Strengthen Mali's Democracy?,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/can-cyber-activism-strengthen-malis-democracy/86264

The political situation in Mali is tense and the Malian army is currently too weak to guarantee stability and security. Many Timbuktu residents who fled the city in 2012 have not returned. They do not trust the uneasy peace and their city faces an uncertain future.

Dakar — Ethnic violence in central Mali has driven 3,000 people into northern Burkina Faso since February, straining dwindling food and medical supplies in that part of the West African nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali's Mopti region, said a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

The influx is putting pressure on vulnerable host communities in Burkina Faso's north, which is facing its worst hunger in years coupled with growing violence, aid agencies said.

""We think that the influx of new asylum-seekers might aggravate the situation,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Marlies Cardoen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Poor rains last year have left almost a million people in need of food aid in Burkina Faso, while attacks by a homegrown Islamist group are on the rise.

The new arrivals - including 2,000 Malians and 1,000 Burkinabe who had settled in Mali - are mostly staying with friends and relatives in volatile, hard-to-reach areas near the border, said UNHCR.

""We want them to come to Ouahigouya (the nearest town) or the refugee camp where we can register them all and give them food aid,"" said Cardoen by phone.

But some prefer to remain in the border area because they are expecting family to join them, hope to go home soon, or do not know of other options, she said.

While 3,000 people will not make a big difference on a national scale, it could have an impact in host communities, said Christian Munezero, head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

""It is worrying, especially if it's on the level of one community or a few villages,"" he said.

The refugees have no work opportunities, and parents fear sending their children to school because of attacks, said UNHCR.

The 3,000 new arrivals add to about 24,000 Malians who have fled to Burkina Faso since Islamists seized Mali's desert north in 2012. French troops intervened to push them back a year later, but Islamist attacks and ethnic fighting persist.

BAMAKO, Mali — A militia in Mali claims it found the vehicle used by four American soldiers killed in an ambush by Islamist militants in neighboring Niger last fall. The discovery indicates how fighters linked to the Islamic State likely traveled between the two countries.

As the militia of ethnic Tuareg soldiers discuss how to return the vehicle to U.S. authorities, the Islamic State is pushing deeper into this poor, West African country and raising fears of more violence.

Mali's minister of foreign affairs, Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly, said he was concerned that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, would redeploy to Africa as the U.S-led coalition quashes the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria.

""The current momentum in the Middle East can have consequences for the stability of Mali"" and the surrounding region here, Coulibaly said.

Mali already has an active chapter of al-Qaeda, which drove a car bomb into a military base near Timbuktu on April 14, killing a United Nations peacekeeper and wounding seven French soldiers.

""Three days don’t go by without hearing the news of an assassination by the terrorists,” said Hamady Touré, a commercial spice salesman. “The worst thing is that vehicles carrying civilians drive on explosive devices that the terrorists place.”

Those concerns mount despite an international response to the terrorist threat in Mali. The U.N. sent 15,000 peacekeepers to Mali five years ago. France has 4,000 troops in this former French colony. Five nearby countries — Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger — created a joint force of 5,000 troops to secure their borders against militants.

The Tuareg militia that claims it found the Americans’ four-wheel-drive Toyota in March also said it is an important defense against ISIS.

“The main target of these armed terrorists is none other than the local authorities and religious leaders,” said Fahad Almahmoud, a Tuareg militia spokesman.

The Tuareg soldiers are now allies of Mali’s government, but until three years ago they fought against the regime for an independent country.

Tiébilé Dramé, an opposition politician, said the government shouldn’t depend on militias and needs to do more. He said more terrorists appear to be moving into Mali despite the international help, so ordinary citizens see little reason to believe in their leaders.

""The fault is the current governance is bad,” Dramé said. “More than 500 schools are closed in the center of the country because of poor security.”

Mali's security situation has been precarious the past several years. In November 2015, heavily armed gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, the Mali capital, killing 20 people. A year ago, several local extremist groups announced they had banded into a bigger organization affiliated with al-Qaeda.

A U.N. report in March said the militias here have too much power. The report said the Tuaregs and another militia allied with the Malian government conducted extra-judicial executions, made illegal arrests, recruited child soldiers and had other human rights violations in northern Mali.

“It is necessary that both the government and the armed groups investigate serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law,"" said Mongi Hamdi, a U.N. special representative in Mali when the report was published. “This is in the interest of victims’ rights and for the reconciliation and establishment of a lasting peace in Mali.”

In the south, Mali's army and the Dozo — traditional armed hunters who act as an independent defense force — have been accused of similar abuses against the Fulani ethnic community, a Muslim group often loyal to extremists.

""The Malian army is making summary executions of civilians suspected of terrorism,” said Nouhoum Cissé, a member of a Fulani defense organization. When a Fulani appears in the central part of the country, ""you can be suspected of terrorism,” he said.

Malians and Fulanis lived together in harmony for centuries but are now poised to kill each other, Cissé said. He said terror attacks have also driven the indigenous Dogon people to create self-defense militias. Dogon and Fulani groups have clashed as a result.

“The question is who benefits from this situation. It does not benefit the Dogon. It does not benefit the Fulani,” Cissé said. “Those who benefit are the terrorist groups.”

Operational Updates

Implementation of the Transitional Interim Country Strategic Plan (T-ICSP) began in January 2018. The T-ICSP is based on seven strategic outcomes and aims to support the Government in achieving its National Development Plan (CREDD 2016–2018), the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of Zero Hunger and SDG 17, Partnership.

According to the March 2018 Cadre Harmonisé, 390 000 people are in urgent need of food assistance, with this number rising to 930,000 from June 2018. These figures are higher than the projection made in November 2017. The increase in food insecurity is due to a poor agricultural harvest in some areas, persistent insecurity in northern and central Mali, a basic food basket which is 20-30 percent higher than the same time last year, all of which affect the poorest and most vulnerable households. In addition, insufficient water and low levels of biomass have led to early transhumance, increasing the strain on natural resources and risks of conflicts over resources. These factors have resulted in a deterioration in the food security situation.

In line with the T-ICSP Strategic Result 1 and 2, WFP aims to provide emergency and seasonal assistance to 155,000 vulnerable people starting from March. To combat the deteriorating situation, from June WFP will increase food assistance to 504,000. A total of 197,000 children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and lactating women will be assisted to prevent malnutrition. WFP plans to provide nutritious foods to 298,000 children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women to treat acute malnutrition.

WFP continues to provide food assistance for assets creation in the food-insecure areas vulnerable to agro-climatic shocks.

WFP Mali manages the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) as part of its T-ICSP on behalf of the humanitarian community. From the Bamako base, UNHAS provides humanitarian air services to seven destinations: Timbuktu,

7,mali,"Gao – Since 10 April, 1,135 West African migrants – including 9 women and 30 children – have been assisted by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, in Gao, northern Mali. These migrants were apprehended by the Algerian authorities when they were attempting to reach Europe via Algeria.

The migrants entered Mali via Inkhalid, a small town along Algeria’s southern border with Mali, after they were deported by the Algerian authorities. Located in Mali’s desert region of Kidal and declared an area of insecurity since the country’s 2012 political crisis (as a result of a military coup and rebellion in the north) Inkhalid has no infrastructure to house the hundreds of returning migrants and no public transportation to Gao, the closest city under the Malian government’s control – and a 36-hour drive away, through the desert. Given the security situation in the area, assistance operations are also difficult.

In Gao, IOM and its partners, local civil society organizations, the Malian Red Cross, UNICEF and shelter centres (Regional Directorate of Civil Protection, Migrant Reception Centre, Direy Ben and La Maison des Migrants) work together to house the hundreds of migrants in need of immediate assistance (reception, profiling, food, accommodation, non-food item provision and health care) until they are transferred to the Civil Protection Transit Centre of Sokoniko, Bamako.

The rescued migrants mainly come from Mali but also from Guinea, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger, the Gambia, Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Liberia, and Nigeria and are all in alarming health conditions.

“Some 488 migrants arrived in one day (23/4), but the IOM office in Gao can house a maximum of 300 people,” said Oscar Safari, head of the IOM sub-office in Gao. “To better assist these migrants and continue our work in good conditions, IOM in Bamako immediately deployed additional staff in Gao. However, even more staff and equipment are urgently needed to deal with daily arrivals to Gao.”

In Bamako, Malian authorities and IOM are facing the same difficulties. The Sokoniko Civil Protection Centre and other such reception centres have also reached their capacity even though the rescued migrants still need to receive immediate assistance. Private centres were contacted by IOM to respond to the housing needs of the next wave of returning migrants, before the opening of the Migrant Centre built by the Government of Mali.

“Since April 2018, large migration flows were observed at the border between Algeria and Mali,” said Bakary Doumbia, IOM Chief of Mission in Mali. “IOM works hard to provide immediate assistance to returning migrants. Given the conditions in which these migrants arrive and the immediate need to facilitate their return to their countries of origin, emergency response with adequate actions should be conducted. We should increase our response capacity to deal with these emergencies.”

To date, 509 people were transported by IOM to Bamako, and 242 have returned to their countries of origin. The consular services in Bamako are facilitating the safe return of the remaining migrants in their countries of origin across the region. Until their departure, migrants will be assisted by IOM and its partners.

Notably, since September 2017, IOM witnessed large migration flows at the border between Algeria and Niger. Since 1 January, over 3,000 migrants were rescued in the desert and 1,500 last week only. Most of the migrants assisted by IOM Niger were found in bad health conditions after they were brought to the Algerian border and left in the desert.

Nigerien authorities and IOM rescued and transported the 1,500 migrants to Arlit and then to the Transit centre in Agadez. IOM, through its Resource and Response Mechanism for Migrants (MRRM) programme and in collaboration with Niger authorities, UNICEF and NGOs, provides basic humanitarian assistance for these people upon their arrival in Niger and before they return to their place of origin. Voluntary return operations to their countries of origin are now underway under the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration.

By Nellie Peyton

DAKAR, April 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ethnic violence in central Mali has driven 3,000 people into northern Burkina Faso since February, straining dwindling food and medical supplies in that part of the West African nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

More refugees are expected to arrive, driven by a surge in fighting between Peul and Dogon communities in Mali's Mopti region, said a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.

9,mali,"A retired general who led Canadian troops in one of the biggest battles during the war in Afghanistan says the government’s plan for a peacekeeping mission in war-torn Mali is focused too heavily on the military.

As the government readies more than 200 Canadian Forces personnel along with combat and troop-carrier helicopters, it should include civil engagement, says former Major-General David Fraser.

Fraser, commander of more than 2,000 Canadian troops and personnel during a fierce 2006 battle between Canadians and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan, said Monday Canada’s Mali mission is “very military.”

In an appearance on CBC Radio’s The Current, Fraser said he supports the government decision to send Canadian forces on their first UN mission under the Trudeau Liberals.

But he said the government should learn from what Canadians accomplished on the non-military side of the war in Afghanistan.

“This was about talking, this was about building, what we brought to this conflict was a multicultural, multi-ethnic, a whole-of-government team Canada approach,” Fraser said of Canada’s Afghanistan mission.

No new details have emerged about the government’s plan for a UN mission to Mali since Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced it in March.

The only confirmed components consist of two Chinook troop-transport helicopters to carry peacekeepers from other countries and four Griffon combat helicopters as escorts for the Chinooks. There has been at least one report another country, Ecquador, could supply two attack helicopters for more robust defence against attacks from Islamic groups battling the Mali government.

The government is expected to deploy up to 250 aircrew and other support personnel.

The war has been deadly for UN peacekeepers from African countries since it began in 2013, with more than 160 killed in the warring.

As of Monday, Canada’s Global Affairs international risk level advisory for Mali was (in capital letters) “AVOID ALL TRAVEL.”

Fraser, commander of the Canadian troops in Kandahar when four Canadian soldiers died in one day during direct combat against hundreds of Taliban fighters, said Canada should apply the methods of civilian engagement it used in Afghanistan to Mali.

“When we go to Mali, let’s take that whole of government approach, it’s all of the stuff that we’ve done in Afghanistan. You can apply the same template to our UN missions,” he said.

“Right now, it seems very penny-packeted, it seems very military and it’s not in keeping with the totality of what Canadians are coming out of Afghanistan, how we had a whole of government approach” Fraser said.

“Why are we not applying that in a more cohesive fashion where you take the helicopters, the C-130 Hercules aircraft, put some CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency) in there, put some foreign affairs in there?” he told The Current Host Anna-Maria Tremonti.

The Canadians won a tactical victory during the two-week 2006 battle against Taliban soldiers in Operation Medusa, but the Taliban forces who were forced out of the region eventually returned to resume hit-and-run attacks against NATO soldiers.

“I’m suggesting that we look at the lessons of operation Medusa and what we got out of that,” Fraser said. “Our 12, 14 years of Afghanistan, and we could probably apply that to every other mission when we go around the world, including Mali.”

The Canadian Forces personnel are expected to be deployed to the city of Gao, in the rebel-torn region of northern Mali and near a massive French military operation.

Canadian development and humanitarian assistance to Mali totalled $152 million in 2014-2015, government figures show.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

After six years of armed conflict in the north, and despite progress made since the peace accord in 2015, Mali remains affected by a protracted and multifaceted humanitarian crisis compounded by a deteriorating security situation. The lack of access to essential services and limited State presence and capacity in both the north and the centre are driving humanitarian needs. The slow implementation of the peace agreement contributes to exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the affected populations in north and centre Mali. In that regard, main challenges include the slow redeployment of the interim authorities, the difficulties in the establishment of the Operational Coordination Mechanism (MOC) and the delayed Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process.

As of February 2018, some 46,330 people remain internally displaced due to the conflictincluding individuals displaced since 2012. This represents an increase from December 2017 (38,100 IDPs), with 8,100 new IDPs registered in February in Mopti, Menaka, and Timbuktu, due to a resurgence in communal violence and armed conflict in northern Mali. In addition, over 134,000 Malian people have sought refuge in the neighbouring countries of Niger, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso (UNHCR Data Portal). Around 526,000 long-term IDPs from the conflict have returned between 2013 and 2018. Yet, in many areas, conditions for a safe return, such as security and access to essential services, have not been met.

Humanitarian needs increased with up to 4.1 million people in need of food assistance in 2018, with projections for the lean season in June-August 2018 estimating that 795,000 people will be facing Crisis [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3] and 20,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In some areas of Kayes, Segou, Mopti, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal regions, food insecurity worsened since 2017. The malnutrition situation in 2018 is likely to be worse than estimated at the end of 2017. The process of the Cadre Harmonisé (Joint National Food Security and Nutrition Analysis) which took place in Mali at the end of November 2017 indicated that the food security has deteriorated continuously since 2016 and will continue to deteriorate in 2018, due to an earlier-than-expected lean season and erratic rains. As food insecurity is one of the determinants of malnutrition, the Ministry of Health through its Nutrition Division and in collaboration with the Nutrition Cluster has revised the need for nutrition upwards for 2018. The expected cases of SAM for 2018 will rise to the national level from 162,913 to 274,145, and the expected cases of MAM for 2018 will also increase from 470,000 to 582,000. This makes an increase of 229,000 malnourished children including 111,232 severe acute malnourished children under-5, 489,238 children from 6 to 59 months of moderate acute malnutrition and 45,245 pregnant and lactating women.

Overall, 1.73 million people are in need of health assistance as the health system has gradually deteriorated in the conflictaffected regions in northern and central Mali. Indeed, a shortage of medical staff is reported, with only three health workers per 10,000 inhabitants in 2017. Between 1 January and 20 February 2018, 109 cases of measles, including 49 confirmed, were reported in Ansongo (Gao), Bandiagara and Douentza (Mopti), and Yanfolila and Kadiolo (Sikasso).

Some 908,000 people are in need of WASH assistance throughout Mali, including 788,000 in northern and central Mali. Up to 63% of the population do not have access to water.

Some 950,000 people are in need of protection, including from 526,000 children. The school year 2018-2019, has shown a rise in the number of schools closed (715 in February 2018, from 500 in May 2017). This increased albeit is due to a combination of insecurity in the affected regions, in addition to the already chronic challenges of the education system such as lack of teachers, lack of food canteens and poor infrastructure.","UNICEF Mali Humanitarian Situation Report, January – February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/unicef-mali-humanitarian-situation-report-january-february-2018

Darfur

Lieutenant General Leonard M. Ngondi, the Force Commander at the African Union-UN Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), stressed that the importance of peacekeeping missions as political tools for finding durable solutions to conflicts, could not be overemphasized.

Challenges in Darfur, though different in nature than Mali, are also extremely complicated and must be addressed for the Mission to deliver on its mandate, he said.

These include restrictions on UNAMID’s freedom of movement and cooperation on the part of the Sudanese government; dealing with armed groups operating outside the peace framework; helping ease inter-communal conflicts over natural resources; and dealing with rising crime and banditry together with the proliferation of weapons.

In increasing support for UNAMID, Lt. Gen. Ngondi urged the Security Council to consider adding a so-called “transition strategy” as part of the Missions’ mandate.

“Lessons learned from missions in Liberia (UNMIL) and Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) show that good transition guarantee gains made are not in vain,” he said.

South Sudan

Force Commander at the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), Lt. Gen. Frank Mushyo Kamanzi, also spoke of the challenges faced by the mission in the world’s youngest country that has spent much of its short history since 2011, mired in conflict, plunging the country into a humanitarian and economic crisis.

Providing security and civilian protection in South Sudan has grown more complex having moved from a conflict between two parties to one in which the transitional Government “has the upper hand, but faces political and military opposition from multiple actors,” said Lt. Gen. Mushyo.

“Protection of civilians remains our priority task and we continue to provide physical protection to over 209,000 internally displaced persons and UN agencies and other humanitarian actors who live and work within the five Protection of Civilian sites,” he added, noting that over 40 per cent of UNMISS peacekeeping troops are dedicated to this task.

Underscoring the importance of a political solution to the crisis in the country, the UNMISS Force Commander called on the Security Council to encourage all parties in the country to work to that end, which he said “will in turn improve the prospects of the mission achieving its mandate.”","Complex and deadly new threats mean UN missions must adapt, argue Force Commanders",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1009302

Complex and deadly new threats mean UN missions must adapt, argue Force Commanders

Evolving and increasingly deadly threats, together with deepening humanitarian crises mean that United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world need more support for ‘blue helmets’ on the ground, Force Commanders told the Security Council on Wednesday.

In their briefings, military chiefs from the UN peacekeeping operations in Darfur, Mali and South Sudan underscored that these obstacles have to be overcome, if UN missions are to implement their mandates; in line with the Dos Santos Cruz Report on casualties suffered by peacekeeping missions.

The retired Lieutenant General’s report released in January, said the UN flag no longer offered “natural” protection to peacekeepers, and UN peacekeeping has pledged to develop an action plan to put its recommendations into practice.

In addition to the threats posed by armed groups and terrorists, supplying remote outposts and dealing with harsh environments have severely challenged UN operations; underscoring the importance of comprehensive training, high-quality medical equipment, air-support and strong intelligence gathering and processing entities, said Maj. Gen. Deconinck.

13,mali,"In Mali, which has been wracked by violence and is prone to frequent and deadly jihadist attacks, the once unthinkable is now being asked by observers: is it time to negotiate with the extremists?

""Every analysis of the Malian crisis shows that a purely military solution is not possible,” said Ambroise Dakouo of the Alliance for Rebuilding Governance in Africa (ARGA), a think tank. “We cannot be dogmatic. We must be open to dialogue with these groups to find out if conciliation is possible. We must find out what they want and what we can concede.”

Waves of foreign soldiers, along with Malian government forces, have failed to eradicate the extremist groups that took control of the northern desert in 2012. Large tracts of territory remain lawless despite a 2015 peace deal intended to end the longer-term conflict that has pitted nomadic Tuaregs in the north against the government, based in the south.

The jihadists, who were not party to that accord, were ousted in 2013 from the northern towns they had captured. But their attacks continue to claim victims and are spreading to the centre of the country, affecting growing portions of the south. Just last week, militants disguised as UN peacekeepers attacked two bases in the ancient desert city of Timbuktu, in northern Mali, killing one peacekeeper and injuring dozens more.

In a late March incident, suspected jihadists attacked a hotel in central Mali shortly after the prime minister visited. In early April, dozens of suspected jihadists clashed with French and Malian troops near the Niger border.

Malian officials hope the new G5 Sahel sub-regional force, comprising troops from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania, can finally make headway against the Islamist militants.

But influential observers, including several key political and religious figures, have been stepping up their push for an entirely different strategy: negotiations with jihadist groups.

Tiébilé Dramé is one of them. He is a former foreign minister who helped negotiate the so-called Ouagadougou Accord, which enabled people in areas controlled by armed groups to vote in Mali’s 2013 presidential elections.

Ali Nouhoum Diallo, a former president of the national assembly, is another. And they are joined by Mahmoud Dicko, the president of the High Islamic Council of Mali and one of the country's most powerful clerics.

The idea of talking to extremist groups, ruled out so far by the government, has become less and less taboo. A recent opinion poll showed that a slim majority of Malians (55.8 percent) favour such negotiations. The poll by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, conducted in November, tapped Malians in all the regional capitals as well as the District of Bamako.

The proposal of dialogue is not completely new. It was discussed during the 2017 Conference of National Understanding in Bamako. At the end of the discussions, the participants – about 300 representatives of government, the opposition, armed groups and civil society – called for open meetings to find out what the jihadists really want.

A year on, the idea appears to be gaining currency, but hard questions remain.

Who to talk to?

Iyad Ag Ghaly and Amadou Koufa are the two main extremist figures in Mali. After failing to become leader of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) – the first armed group to begin hostilities against the Malian army in 2012 – Ag Ghaly turned to radicalism and founded Ansar Dine, an al-Qaeda-linked group that sought to establish strict Islamic law in Mali. It operates essentially in the north.

Koufa, a Fulani preacher from the central Mopti Region, set up the jihadist Macina Liberation Front, which operates in the centre of the country, in 2015.

Last March, these two groups, along with the Saharan branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), announced an alliance under the banner of Jamaat Nosrat al-Islam wal-Mouslimin (Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, JNIM or GNIM).

According to Dakouo, of the ARGA think tank, one of the aims of dialogue with the extremists would be to isolate the foreign fighters within their ranks. “We would then have a clear idea of the positions of the jihadist movements that are Malian,’ he said. “Then we would also know that the other groups are not Malian, and that would let us know the true nature of our adversaries.”

This strategy could also help to end the victimisation of certain ethnic groups, such as the Fulani, often mistakenly assumed to be militant followers of Koufa.

Are jihadist groups really open to dialogue?

In May 2017, emissaries of Koufa and Ag Ghaly reportedly approached Ali Nouhoum Diallo and Mahmoud Dicko, the former president of the national assembly and the influential cleric.

Dicko, the cleric, is well placed to act as an intermediary for these extremist leaders if such approaches are to be renewed, said Professor Kissima Gakou, a criminologist at the University of Bamako who specialises in security issues. “They recognise in him certain values that give him the benefit of the doubt and enable him to interact with them,” he said.

But Gakou believes the hardline ideology of the extremist groups means they are fundamentally opposed to dialogue. ""The problem with jihadists is that they have maximalist (extreme) positions,” he said. “They know they have the power to fight to the last drop of blood... All they have is violence.”

Another obstacle to talks, according to Fahad Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government Imghad and Allies Tuareg Self-Defence Group, or GATIA, is the structure of Mali’s extremist groups, which are allied with larger organisations in the wider Sahel region.

""You cannot negotiate with one without the approval of the others,"" he said. ""If we have to talk with Amadou Koufa, he must have the consent of Iyad (Ag Ghaly), who needs the assent of (AQIM leader Abdel Malek) Droukdel.”

Ag Mohamed added that he didn’t think these larger groups would let their allies negotiate with the Malian government.

What to discuss?

Introducing sharia law across Mali is the jihadists’ long-standing goal.

Discussions cannot include ""sharia, the Islamisation of the country,"" said Adama Ben Diarra, a spokesman for the Waati Sera movement, which regularly organises demonstrations in support of the national army.

But ARGA’s Dakouo said the idea that entering into talks implied an acceptance of sharia was wrong and missed the point.

“Dialogue is a crisis-resolution mechanism,"" he said. The parameters must be the preservation of ""the republican state, justice, and the principles of law"".

The talks should aim to bring the extremist groups into the agreement for peace and reconciliation that was made with the Tuaregs, Dakouo said.

But Ag Mohamed, secretary-general of the pro-government group, said that particular scenario was impossible. ""If you open a process with them, it will be a different process,” he said, referring to the extremists. “It has nothing to do with the agreement signed in 2015.""

Human rights abuses?

Some extremist groups are accused of serious human rights violations.

The International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) has initiated several lawsuits against some of the Malian extremist groups related to sexual violence, and has filed legal complaints against some of their leaders, including Ag Ghaly.

""Mali has adopted a national policy of transitional justice,"" Dakouo noted. He insisted mechanisms could be set up to allow human rights abuses to be handled while dialogue continued. He also stressed that the Malian government and its troops are also accused of violations.

What about international allies?

Cross-border aspects of the Malian conflict are also a major consideration. France and the UN are already deeply involved in trying to sort out the country’s crisis, so it would be difficult for Bamako to go it alone by entering into unilateral talks with extremist groups.

""The issue goes well beyond Mali,"" said Gakou. ""Mali cannot engage in dialogue before convincing all partners of the relevance of its approach. Otherwise, it's a lost cause.""

The international players engaged in Mali have steadfastly refused to enter into negotiations with extremist groups.

“They are terrorists,” France’s then foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said last year in response to the call by national conference to consider talking to the jihadists. “How do you negotiate with terrorists? This is a fight with no ambiguity.”

Dakouo, however, insisted that opening dialogue is a promising option – one given legitimacy by the fact attendees at the 2017 conference strongly supported the idea. The government, he said, just needs to ""find the right arguments"" if it decides to go down that road.

CAR

Humanitarian access in Bangui has deteriorated since conflict escalated on 31 March, prompting the local Red Cross to request the opening of a humanitarian corridor in the third district to reach the most vulnerable. Insecurity, presence of armed groups, and physical constraints limit operations while barricades on main roads to protest against armed attacks limit movement in the city. At least 240 people have been injured in Bangui since the beginning of violence, heightening the need for urgent health assistance.

The LNA began a military operation to capture Derna, which it has besieged since May 2016. The potential escalation of conflict is likely to deteriorate an already dire humanitarian situation in the city. Since late 2017, humanitarian access, as well as the population's access to health care, electricity, and food markets have deteriorated significantly amidst the protracted insecurity. In addition, there are concerns that movement restrictions will limit civilians' ability to reach safety unless evacuated.
