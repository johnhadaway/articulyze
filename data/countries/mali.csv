Security incidents against relief workers in Mali during 2017 increase by 96 percent compared to 2016

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

The 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Mali requests nearly $263 million to provide humanitarian assistance to 1.6 million of the estimated 4.1 million people in need, a nearly 11 percent increase from the 3.7 million people requiring assistance in 2017.

Humanitarian workers continue to experience attacks and incidences of criminality in Mali. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) recorded 133 security incidents targeting relief actors in 2017, a nearly 96 percent increase from the 68 incidents recorded in 2016.","Mali Complex Emergency Fact Sheet #1, Fiscal Year (FY) 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/mali-complex-emergency-fact-sheet-1-fiscal-year-fy-2018

Screams of support cut through the wind as students cheered on their fellow teammates who were running toward the finish line as fast their buckets brimming with water would allow. It was a simple game with a significant purpose: to enlighten students about the importance of water.

The United Nations Children’s Fund’s UTD chapter gathered in North Point Park on March 31 for their first Water Walk, an event meant to raise awareness of the roughly 600 million people worldwide who live without access to clean water and proper sanitation tools. Finance and Information Technology and Systems senior Sejal Mali, the chapter’s treasurer, explained that the obstacle courses and relay races that participants competed in were meant to convey the struggles that individuals across the world must go through to simply reach a clean source of water.

“One of our relays is that you have to walk backwards, (representing that) the terrain is really bad, or you have to carry two buckets and make sure the water doesn’t spill, and halfway through you might ‘get’ cholera or dengue fever because the water’s not clean,” Mali said. “So we’re just trying to educate people but in a fun way.”

UNICEF estimates that unclean and polluted water kills over 800 children a day, but this was not the only concern which the club’s members hoped to inform students about. The chapter’s president, biochemistry senior Shivani Bhatnagar, also discussed the lack of access to sanitation facilities and education about proper hygiene.

“One thing that UNICEF does is educate people,” she said. “We all learned in elementary school to wash our hands while we sing ‘ABC’ or ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,’ but not everybody gets that education about the benefits of soap and hand-washing. And access to toilets is also a really big thing. So it’s more than just water, it’s access to sanitation facilities and … toilets and places to wash your hands.”

Bhatnagar and her fellow members sought to educate their participants about these issues throughout the afternoon, quizzing them on facts such as how many gallons of water were needed daily in order to keep a human alive, or the number of children that had to live with the contaminated water caused by flooding. Healthcare studies freshman Madison Nguyen said she was particularly impacted by the extreme lengths that women would have to go to in order to access water.

“I didn’t consider all the walking,” Nguyen said. “(This event) isn’t even close to the 7 miles compared to them, and my legs are already cramping.”

Nguyen’s teammate, healthcare studies freshman Aniqa Islam, added that the water they were carrying during the obstacle races paled in comparison to the gallons other men and women must carry back to their homes.

“This isn’t even that much water. They have huge buckets that they have to carry over their heads. We were walking from here to there and they walk for miles and miles,” said Islam, pointing to other side of the course. “It really puts everything in perspective.”

Ultimately, the $5 entry fee will go towards UNICEF’s WASH initiative, which works in over 100 countries to provide water purification tablets, transportable water jugs and more accessible, unpolluted water wells.

“It’s hard to believe that there’s actually people in the world that don’t have access to water at all times and they have a hard time drinking it and getting enough water to clean themselves,” Islam said. “We’re in our little bubble here. And we could save so many lives … but we don’t put that into our conscience. It’s hard to remember all those other people out there.”",Water crisis spurs student activism,http://utdmercury.com/water-crisis-spurs-student-activism/

Paris has been in touch with a dozen countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and Denmark, about the initiative, holding a working group to outline the idea in March.

The idea aims to bring together European countries with a military capacity and political desire to collaborate on planning, carry out joint analyses of emerging crises and to react to them quickly.

“It would not be within the European Union and would allow countries outside it, like Britain, to be part of it,” said one source.

French President Emmanuel Macron broadly outlined the idea to have a rapid European intervention force by the end of the decade during a landmark speech on Europe last September.

While some EU tactical interventional groups exist in principle, so far they have never been used.

The sources declined to name the countries that would be at a launch ceremony in Paris in June, but said it did not mean countries could not join it a later stage.

Germany, which has a historical resistance to military missions that included the use of force, in March appeared to back the plan given the need for a better European cooperation to crises.

However, it has previously emphasized the force should be folded into the new Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) defense pact being set up between EU governments. French officials insist the new initiative will not cannibalize PESCO.

French Defence Minister Florence Parly will discuss the project with her German counterpart Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday in Paris.

“It’s creating a smaller group of countries that have common analysis and procedures,” said a second French defense source. “It would plug in the different military planning and operations centers,” said one source.

The source said its aim was to try to anticipate future crises, be it military conflicts or humanitarian such as the recent storms that hit the Caribbean, and avoid situations whereby one country would be forced to intervene alone, as France did in Central African Republic and Mali.

The project is not on a list of 17 joint projects initiatives, including a European armored infantry vehicle, agreed by the founding PESCO members.

PESCO members have yet to decide on whether to let non-member states join the projects, prolonging uncertainty over any future role for Britain after it leaves the EU next year.

As Europe’s biggest military power along with France, Britain is central to European security efforts but has long blocked defense integration.

However, Britain is seeking a security treaty with the EU by 2019, worried out missing out on key weapons projects.

The eventual aim of PESCO is to develop and deploy forces together, backed by a multi-billion-euro fund for defense research and development that is now under negotiation.

“The EU’s second-biggest army is leaving the union so this multilateral project makes sense when everything is being broken up,” said a French military source.

Humanitarian partners target 36 percent of the population in need in 2018.

800,000 persons will be affected by food insecurity during the lean season.

More than 670 schools were closed, of which 60 percent are in Mopti.

The number of civilian victims of improvised explosive devices is rising.

Security incidents affecting aid workers nearly doubled between 2016 and 2017.

$263 million sought in 2018

4.1 million people in need

According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), the population in need of humanitarian assistance is estimated at 4.1 million people in 2018, which is 400,000 people more than 2017. This increase is linked to the consequences of the rainfall deficit, the erosion of the Niger river, the insufficiency of funding received in 2017, as well as the expansion of insecurity from the north to certain parts of central Mali.

1.5 million people targeted by humanitarian partners

This year, the humanitarian workers target 1.5 million people , representing 36 percent of the country’s population in need, according to the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), launched on 14 February in Bamako. The plan consists of the complementary humanitarian plans and programmes of the State to respond to the most urgent needs of the affected communities and to strengthen their resilience

Overall, $263 million are necessary to cover the urgent needs of the target population in the HRP framework. Within this amount, 40 percent is meant for the food security sector.","Mali: Humanitarian Bulletin, January-February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/mali-humanitarian-bulletin-january-february-2018

Mali’s army killed 14 jihadist suspects trying to escape detention in its central region, the latest in a string of killings by the armed forces that have provoked condemnation from rights groups.The military said in a statement the suspects were arrested in Dioura on April 5 and were killed the next day.“Following an alleged attempt to escape, 14 terrorist suspects were killed on April 6 in Dioura,” the statement said. “The command has taken measures to shed light on this issue”.The statement is likely to draw the attention of human rights groups which accuse the security forces of carrying out summary executions in their campaign to secure central Mali, plagued by violent Islamists and ethnic militias.Amnesty International raised the alarm last week over reports six people found dead in a mass grave in the central Mopti region in March were arrested by the military three days earlier.There has been a spate of killings and kidnappings ahead of a July presidential election which rights groups say are being conducted by the army against suspected sympathisers of jihadist groups.

Two relatives of some of those killed have also alleged that they were summarily executed.

A largely semi-arid region, the Sahel stretches from Senegal on Africa’s Atlantic coast, through parts of Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Sudan to Eritrea on the Red Sea coast.

It is plagued by the increasing threat posed by terrorism and violent extremism and its spread in surrounding countries and regions. This is compounded – or caused – by weak development progress in the Sahel and the impacts of climate change on food supplies, migration flows and conflict over land and resources.

“The complexity and multi-dimensional nature of these challenges attest to the necessity to respond collectively to the Sahel crisis, and in a more coherent, comprehensive and integrated manner,” Ms. Mohammed explained.

These challenges promoted changes to the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel to better meet the needs of the 10 countries in the region.

The Deputy Secretary-General said five key priorities on addressing the root causes of the crisis are: inclusive and equitable growth; public good services, including access to basic service, governance and rule of law; climate and energy; gender equality and women’s empowerment; and security, including preventing violent extremism, transnational crime and human trafficking.

The Council recognized the determination and ownership of the Governments of the Group of Five for the Sahel States (G5 Sahel) to address terrorism and transnational organized crime, including through cross-border joint military counter-terrorist operations.

The members expressed concern over Mali's security situation and the transnational dimension of the terrorist threat in the Sahel region, urging the Malian parties to “fully implement the [peace] Agreement without further delay.”

Humanitarian access has deteriorated in seven countries over the past six months, according to the Humanitarian Access Overview report released today by ACAPS.

Out of the 37 countries included in the report, nearly half of them (18) are currently facing high humanitarian access constraints. Moderate humanitarian access constraints are an issue in nine countries and ten present low humanitarian access constraints.

“We are deeply concerned that in countries such as Myanmar and Mali that are already facing significant humanitarian challenges, it has become more difficult to operate. This means that even more people in need do not have access to critical humanitarian assistance” said Lars Peter Nissen, ACAPS Director.

This bi-annual analysis is the second released by ACAPS. The first publication was released in August 2017. What has changed in six months?

In comparison with the situation six months ago:

• Humanitarian access situation has deteriorated in 7 countries: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Turkey.

• Although some countries are categorised as ‘no change’ over six months, there may have been fluctuations during this period.

• Myanmar is the country where humanitarian access has deteriorated the most, as access for the Rohingya population has become increasingly difficult.

• In Cameroon, curfews, check-points and violence constrain access in the Anglophone regions where the security situation has worsened over the past six months.

• In Libya, insecurity deteriorated in 2017 and early 2018 when direct attacks against UNSMIL and abductions of humanitarian workers were reported in Southern and Eastern part of the country.

• In Mali, violence has been increasing and movement has become more restricted. Over 130 incidents against humanitarian workers were reported in 2017, more than double the previous year.

• In Pakistan, in the second half of 2017 over 20 INGOs had their permissions revoked, deteriorating the operating environment.

• Humanitarian access situation has improved in one country: The Republic of Congo where the end of hostilities in Pool department following the 23 December ceasefire point to improving humanitarian access.","Humanitarian Access Overview, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/map/world/humanitarian-access-overview-march-2018

16,mali,"OTTAWA—Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan sidestepped a question Monday about Canadian peacekeepers supporting an African-led counterterror force in Mali, saying Canada has already helped what is known as the Group of Five Sahel. The United Nations Security Council in December authorized the peacekeeping mission in Mali to provide assistance to the group, a military force composed of troops from five African nations. That assistance includes medical evacuations for combat and non-combat injuries as well as the provision of fuel, water and rations — exactly what the six Canadian military helicopters due to arrive in Mali in August will be configured to do. The revelation last week that Canadian helicopters could be used to support the G5 Sahel force sparked opposition calls for the Liberal government to provide more information about what the Canadian military is walking into in Mali. While Sajjan did not say Monday whether Canadian peacekeepers would end up helping the counterterror mission, he did note that Canada has “actually been supporting the G5 Sahel force for some time.”

“We’ve been doing capacity-building in that region,” he said during an event at the University of Calgary. “We’ve been supporting with logistical support to the French with tactical airlift.” Canada has sporadically provided a heavy transport aircraft to move weapons and equipment into Mali for the French military, which helped establish and has been working alongside the G5 Sahel since last year.

Canadian commitment to Mali coincides with review of UN mission Opinion | Walkom: There is no peace to keep in Mali for Canadian troops Canada’s Mali mission will emphasize deployment of female peacekeepers The most recent flight was in February, and there were four before that going back to November 2016. The Canadian military has also been helping train local forces in Niger, one of the five African countries participating in the G5 Sahel. “So we’ve been supporting that and being a responsible partner for some time,” Sajjan said. “We will always look at how we can best support our partners in all aspects of challenges around the world.” The G5 Sahel, whose members are Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania, Niger and Mali, has been tasked with fighting jihadists and transnational crime groups across a large swath of West Africa south of the Sahara desert. The force was the brainchild of France, which has been conducting counterterror operations in Mali and the region since 2012, and it enjoys financial backing from France, the U.S., the European Union and others. But the 5,000-strong force’s first operation in November was plagued by logistical problems, and it remains very much a work in progress despite political support from a variety of powers including Russia and China. It was in that context that the UN Security Council passed a resolution Dec. 8 emphasizing the G5 Sahel’s role in bringing security to the region and authorizing the UN mission in Mali to provide support to the African force. An agreement between the UN, the EU and G5 Sahel members to provide operational and logistical support to the force through the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, or MINUSMA, was signed in February, a UN spokesperson said. Security Council members specifically authorized the provision of medical evacuations, including those related to combat and other malicious acts, as well as fuel, water, rations and engineering services to the G5 force. Such support is to be restricted to Mali, in accordance with the UN mission’s own boundaries, and only when it won’t negatively affect the peacekeeping mission’s own operations.

Acute rainfall deficits last season in several regions of the Sahel, and worsening insecurity have escalated humanitarian needs.

Drought has prematurely thrust pastoralist communities into the lean season, with herders migrating earlier than usual. Growing insecurity in Mali and armed attacks in border regions with Burkina Faso and Niger have uprooted hundreds of families in recent months, adding to the devastation by the long-running conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Swaths of pastoral and agro-pastoral regions are suffering severe pasture and water deficits. Around 2.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are at risk of serious livelihood crisis in 2018.

Mauritania, and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal and Mali are the worst affected in the Sahel.

Armed attacks, banditry and intercommunity conflict have increased in Mali’s central regions. In areas unaffected by conflict, chronic vulnerabilities persist. In the Lake Chad Basin, humanitarian needs will remain high in 2018 and beyond. In areas worst hit by violence, almost 500,000 children are severely acutely malnourished and 5.8 million people are struggling with high levels of food insecurity.

In 2018, 24 million people will need humanitarian assistance in the Sahel. Some 32 million people are at risk of, or struggling with food insecurity – among them 10.8 million severely food insecure – and 4.7 million children are malnourished. Over 5 million refugees, internally displaced people and returnees are grappling with the consequences of forced displacement.

Sahel countries count among the world’s most at risk of crises and disasters. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts and floods and land degradation threaten the livelihoods of highly vulnerable communities. Food insecurity and malnutrition are often high and widespread, with seasonal peaks pushing millions into crisis. In the last decade, a spike in armed conflict and violence has worsened chronic needs, uprooted entire communities and disrupted livelihoods.

To address the most urgent needs across the region, humanitarians will need US$2.7 billion in 2018. In five countries – Cameroon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria – aid organisations and Governments have developed response plans to provide life-saving assistance and help communities rebuild livelihoods. In Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal, humanitarian work plans address acute peaks, while preparing the full integration of relief response in longer-term strategies that address the structural causes of vulnerability.

Humanitarian action across the region is progressively adopting the New Way of Working. Response strategies this year are further strengthening collaboration with Governments and development actors to provide urgent relief assistance and tackle the causes of recurrent emergencies. The Sahel humanitarian response is aligned with the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) priorities, which recognise the importance of the humanitariandevelopment and security-peace nexus and enshrines a proactive crisis prevention-oriented approach. The UNISS support plan seeks to address common humanitarian/security concerns in the Sahel, particularly the Lake Chad Basin areas, northern Mali and the Liptako-Gourma region.

Only concerted and sustained efforts by all actors can bring peace, security, and development, improve human rights, uplift Sahel’s most vulnerable inhabitants from recurrent crises, and create stable conditions for communities and families to prosper.

CONFLICT, FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION

PROTRACTED AND EMERGING CONFLICT

Conflict remains one of the main drivers of humanitarian emergencies in the Sahel. Increased hostilities could heighten humanitarian needs in the region, where 24 million require assistance this year.

The deteriorating insecurity has in recent months opened a new front. Regions in Burkina Faso and Niger bordering Mali have come under a rising spate of armed attacks that have devastated communities and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. In 2017, around 90 incidents of insecurity were recorded in Burkina Faso, forcing 141 schools to shut and affecting thousands of children. Villages in Niger’s western Tillabéri and Tahoua regions have also suffered multiple attacks that have uprooted residents. Burkina Faso and Niger respectively host 23,000 and 56,000 Malian refugees.

Mali and the Lake Chad Basin remain the region’s prominent conflict hotspots. In Mali, insecurity is spreading from the northern to the central regions. Clashes between armed groups, banditry and intercommunal violence recurrently cause displacements. Some 5.1 million people – more than 27 per cent of the country’s population – live in the areas affected by insecurity. Currently 59,000 people are displaced within the country, and almost one in five Malians is food insecure. While humanitarian assistance has enabled hundreds of thousands of people to survive, the situation remains critical. In 2018, aid groups will assist around 1.6 million people, 200,000 more than the previous year.

Across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin, around 2.2 million people have been displaced. Millions of people are grappling with hunger, poor living conditions in displacement sites and other adversity unleashed by the nine-year-long conflict. Humanitarian action has saved many lives, but millions of people still require relief assistance to survive and rebuild their livelihoods.

As humanitarians strive to assist Sahel’s vulnerable populations, Governments are making efforts to tackle extremist violence. The establishment of the G5 Sahel Joint Force hopes to address a key factor of regional instability. However, military operations could complicate humanitarian access, underscoring the need for dialogue and coordination between humanitarian and military actors.

FOOD INSECURITY, DROUGHT AND PASTORAL CRISIS

Following poor rains in 2017, Mauritania and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal are witnessing severe pasture and water shortages. In these areas, the lean season has begun early and will last longer. Many pastoralist communities, who make up 30 per cent of Sahel’s population, begun migrating earlier than usual and will face a tough lean season as their resources dwindle. The early transhumance is exacerbating vulnerability. Meat and milk production has declined, livelihoods taken a hit and food prices are increasing. Terms of trade between cereals and livestock is unfavourable for herders. For instance, in Mali, Mauritania and Niger it dropped by 15 - 50 per cent compared to December 2016. In areas where pastoralists have moved into, the additional herds are exerting pressure on limited water and pasture and the likelihood of intercommunity tensions increased.

Across the region, food insecurity will remain high owing to the effects of poor rainfall, transhumance restrictions, high staple food prices and increasing displacement by conflict. For children, worsening food security will create additional hurdles such as learning difficulties or school retention, as parents are unable to afford fees and need their children to stay at home to work.

HIGH MALNUTRITION RATES

Malnutrition also remains prevalent in the region and is expected to deteriorate if early and sustained actions are not taken. Poor access to healthcare, water, sanitation, education and other basic services has left millions of children suffering from acute malnutrition. Some 4.7 million children are likely to face acute malnutrition. Global and severe acute malnutrition rates have surpassed the emergency threshold in parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. The drought that has also caused crisis among Sahel’s pastoralist communities is likely to increase the already high malnutrition rates. Education can play a key role in malnutrition prevention programmes by assisting children in school and their young parents with nutrition education, malnutrition screening services and prevention packages for the household.

MOBILISING FOR ACCELERATED RESPONSE

Humanitarian needs remain high in the Sahel, home to some of the world’s most protracted and severe crises. The impact of climate change, armed conflict and insecurity, underdevelopment and poverty subject millions of people to severe hardship. Around one in five people requiring humanitarian assistance in the world resides in the Sahel, and 16 per cent of the region’s 150 million inhabitants needs help.

The number of people uprooted, mainly by conflict, has nearly tripled in the past four years, rising from 1.8 million in 2014 to more than 5 million this year. Humanitarian response budget has hovered around $2 billion over the same period. In 2018, Sahel’s budget accounts for 12 per cent of the $22.5 billion global humanitarian financial requirement.

Progressively adopting the New Way of Working, humanitarian, Governments and development actors in the region have developed strategies to respond to the humanitarian emergency and address the causes of Sahel’s recurrent crises. Donor support has been critical in saving lives. 2018 is expected to be a very difficult year not only for pastoralist communities but also for thousands of communities who rely on markets for access to food in the Sahel. Accelerated efforts by all actors are crucial in reducing human suffering and restoring livelihoods.",Sahel 2018: Overview of Humanitarian Needs and Requirements,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/sahel-2018-overview-humanitarian-needs-and-requirements
18,mali,"press release

Being vaccinated against diseases like diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, meningitis, pneumonia, yellow fever, and other potentially fatal illnesses is a commonplace event for many children. But in northern Mali, where a combination of insecurity, isolation, and limited health infrastructure means that many communities cannot access health facilities, it can prove difficult to protect children against these illnesses.

In its existing projects in the region, ongoing since 2015, MSF staff had begun to notice that many children had not been immunised against common illnesses for several years. As a result, and in partnership with the Ministry of Health and local authorities, MSF launched a vaccination campaign seeking to protect the most vulnerable against these life-threatening and debilitating diseases. In January 2018, MSF began its first multi-antigen campaign to vaccinate 10,000 children between the ages of 0 and 5 years.

But the campaign, which involves covering a total of 60,000km of desert roads to reach the number of children targeted, is complicated to implement.

""Bringing this campaign about requires a lot of resources. Before anything else, you have to make the vaccines available, and then get logistics support to move teams around a vast region where access to isolated populations is complicated,"" says Patrick Irenge, Medical Coordinator for MSF in Mali. ""Vaccines have to be kept at a temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius in a region where temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius. On top of that, mobilising so many people - from qualified medical personnel to drivers who know the region perfectly - is no mean feat.""

The campaign will take place in three stages in order to follow the established vaccination calendar in Mali. Measles, yellow fever, and meningitis vaccines need only be administered once to take effect. Others must be delivered in three separate doses. Such a process can be all the more difficult to follow given the nature of mobile, nomadic communities which do not always stay in one location over a period of weeks.

""That poses an access problem for the vaccination activities,"" continues Patrick. ""But vaccination is an efficient preventative measure which protects the most vulnerable.""

MSF has now completed two stages of the vaccination campaign, and will complete the campaign by the beginning of May.","Mali - Vaccinating 10,000 Children Over 60,000KM of Desert Roads",http://allafrica.com/stories/201804100251.html

21,mali,"BAMAKO (REUTERS) - Unidentified gunmen killed one person and wounded at least two others late on Wednesday (March 28) in an attack on a hotel in the central Mali town of Bandiagara regularly frequented by United Nations staff and humanitarian workers, two witnesses said.

Five men approached the entrance to the Hotel la Falaise on foot at around 9.30pm (5.30am Thursday, Singapore) and opened fire, they said.

""The were walking calmly and seemed normal,"" said Bocar Karambe, a driver who was across the street from the hotel when the attack occurred.

""Once they arrived in front of the gate, we heard the gunfire. When I turned around I saw they were shooting point blank at the people in front of the hotel,"" he said.

At least three people, a soldier guarding the entrance and two hotel workers, were struck by bullets. The soldier later died, Karambe and a second witness said.

One attacker was also killed.

The Hotel la Falaise was once popular with tourists visiting the Dogon people, who inhabit the cliffs of Mali's central plateau.

However, the area's tourism industry dried up after Islamist groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized Mali's desert north in 2012. They were driven back by a French-led military intervention a year later, but attacks remain frequent.","Gunmen attack central Mali hotel, one dead: Witnesses",http://www.straitstimes.com/world/africa/gunmen-attack-central-mali-hotel-one-dead-witnesses
22,mali,"BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali’s army said on Saturday it had killed 14 jihadist suspects who were trying to escape detention in its central region, the latest in a string of killings by the armed forces that have provoked condemnation from rights groups.

The military said in a statement that the suspects had been arrested in Dioura on April 5 and were killed the following day.

“Following an alleged attempt to escape, 14 terrorist suspects were killed on April 6 in Dioura,” the statement said. “The command has taken measures to shed light on this issue,” it said.

The statement is likely to draw the attention of human rights groups which have accused the security forces of carrying out summary executions in their campaign to secure central Mali, which has been plagued by violent Islamists and ethnic militias.

Amnesty International raised the alarm this week over reports that six people found dead in a mass grave in the central Mopti region in March had been arrested by the military three days earlier.

There has been a spate of killings and kidnappings ahead of a July presidential election which rights groups say are being conducted by the army against suspected sympathizers of jihadist groups. The government has rejected the allegations.

The violence has raised doubts about whether Mali will be able to hold credible elections in less than three months’ time.

Two Chadian peacekeepers were killed on Thursday and at least 10 others were wounded when a U.N. camp came under mortar fire in the northern Kidal region, the country’s most volatile.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said such acts “only reinforce the commitment of the United Nations to support the people and the Government of Mali in their quest for peace”.

On Friday evening, a peacekeeper was killed when two armed men in the northern city of Gao opened fire on his vehicle, the U.N. force said in a statement.

Unidentified gunmen killed one person and wounded at least two others last Wednesday in an attack on a hotel in the central town of Bandiagara regularly frequented by U.N. staff and humanitarian agency workers.

Some 65 people have been killed in 2018 by improvised explosive devices, Amnesty International estimated this week.

Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Mali and Mauritania launched a G5 Sahel taskforce last year to tackle Islamist militants in the region.

France, its main Western backer, hopes the force will enable them to start drawing down the 4,000 or so troops it has had stationed in Mali since intervening to prevent Islamists and allied Tuareg rebels taking over the country in 2013.

International donors have committed half a billion dollars to the force, but Mali remains heavily dependent on foreign firepower.

A mass grave uncovered in central Mali is the latest grim confirmation that the security situation in the region has reached crisis point, Amnesty International said today. Local witnesses in the village of Dogo identified on 22 March six bodies as people who had been arrested by the military three days earlier.



Amnesty International also documented an increase in attacks on civilians by armed groups including Ansar Dine and GSIM (Groupe de soutien à l’Islam et aux musulmans), and confirmed that 65 people, including children, have been killed by improvised explosives since the beginning of the year.

“This macabre discovery comes after weeks of escalating violence which has left civilians in central Mali caught in the crossfire, facing enforced disappearances and unlawful killings by the military on one side, and roadside bombs and abductions by armed groups on the other,” said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International’s West Africa researcher.

“The increase in attacks has also resulted in the closure of hundreds of schools, leaving more than 214,000 children deprived of education. When bodies are thrown into mass graves, children are killed in rocket attacks and fear forces teachers and students to abandon their classrooms, there is an urgent need for measures to protect civilians from these crimes under international law and prevent further human rights violations.”

Amnesty International researchers carried out field research in the region of Mopti in February and March. Researchers interviewed 70 persons, including officials, who confirmed the increase in attacks in the central region of Mopti. The increased presence of armed groups, which intensifies the recruitment of local supporters and members, exacerbates tensions between different ethnic groups.

Amnesty International received information on 65 people killed in attacks by armed groups using improvised explosive devices since the start of the year, with the largest number of attacks now taking place in the central regions of Mopti and Segou. An example includes 26 people, including women and children killed in January when their bus was attacked.

In the region, at least eight people, including three women abducted in the last three years, are known to be still held hostage by armed groups. Two others were kidnapped in February and held hostage for over a month before being released.

One of them told Amnesty International:

“I was abducted by three members of an armed group, they tied my hands behind my back and I was blindfolded. They put me on a motorbike and drove for more than three hours. I was then detained in a forest for over a month, they threatened to kill me if ever I tried to escape.”

More than 200,000 students deprived of education

Insecurity and intimidation of teachers by armed groups have forced 715 schools to close across the central and northern regions of the country, affecting more than 214,000 students.Regions affected by the crisis include Gao, Kidal, Ségou, Mopti and Timbuktu. In February 2018, 440 schools were closed in the Mopti region alone. These closures are partly due to insecurity and intimidation of teachers by armed groups, and also the lack of presence of the State authorities.

One school head teacher told Amnesty International:

""Six members of an armed group came by foot to the village and asked my deputy where I was. Then they went to the school to ransack my office, my books, and all my education materials. Before leaving, they said they do not want schools or teachers in the village. We packed up all our stuff and left as there is no school.""

Military forces fighting armed groups have also committed crimes under international law, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests.

For example, on 21 February during a baptism ceremony in the village of Daresalam, military forces arrested nine men - two of whom were from the Bambara ethnic group, and seven of whom were Peulh – and took them to an unknown location. They have never been seen since, despite attempts by the families to seek information from the authorities, who have ordered an investigation.

An eyewitness told Amnesty International:

«The military showed up in several vehicles and arrested nine men who were taken, blindfolded and with their hands tied behind their back, to a checkpoint. The two Bambara men were later released while the seven others, who all are Peulh, are not yet back.”

Searches by the military, which people told Amnesty International were carried out to obtain information about the whereabouts of members of the armed groups, resulted in further violations.

An eyewitness described an operation in the village of Finadje in February: “The soldier took my sister by her hair and rounded up those in our compound, asking her where the armed groups were. Another person was beaten with a baton until his head and mouth were bleeding.”

Mass grave

Amnesty International has also interviewed witnesses who confirmed that the six bodies found in a mass grave on 25 March had been arrested by the military three days earlier in the village of Dogo and taken away to an unknown location. A photograph of the bodies show that the victims appear to have been blindfolded prior to being killed.

A villager told Amnesty International how their bodies were discovered:

“One of the elders of the village, who was among the first to be informed, ordered us and the imam to go and check. There were almost one hundred villagers searching, and they uncovered six bodies in a grave. The bodies were identified by the villagers as being among those arrested on 22 March.”

These are not the first allegations made against the Malian security forces. MINUSMA has verified other cases of extrajudicial executions by the security forces in 2017. In a report in February, the UN’s independent expert on the human rights situation in Mali also reported that at least 43 people had been victims of enforced disappearance by the Malian security forces during anti-terrorist operations in May and June 2017.

The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Gustavo Meza-Cuadra (Peru):

The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the attack against a vehicle of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), which occurred on 6 April 2018 in Gao and caused the death of a Nigerien peacekeeper.

The members of the Security Council expressed their deepest condolences and sympathy to the family of the victim, as well as to the Government of Niger and to MINUSMA. They paid tribute to the peacekeepers who risk their lives.

The members of the Security Council called on the Government of Mali to swiftly investigate this attack and bring the perpetrators to justice. They underlined that attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law. They stressed that involvement in planning, directing, sponsoring or conducting attacks against MINUSMA peacekeepers constitute a basis for sanctions designations pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. They underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice. They stressed that those responsible for these killings should be held accountable, and urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard.

The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed. They reaffirmed the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.

The members of the Security Council reiterated their full support for MINUSMA and the French forces that support it. They reiterated their strong support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Mali, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, and for MINUSMA to assist the Malian authorities and the Malian people in their efforts to bring lasting peace and stability to their country, including through MINUSMA’s support to the implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (the Agreement). They recognized the determination and ownership of the Governments of the Group of Five for the Sahel States (G5 Sahel) to address the impact of terrorism and transnational organized crime, including through the conduct of cross-border joint military counter-terrorist operations.

The members of the Security Council expressed their concern about the security situation in Mali and the transnational dimension of the terrorist threat in the Sahel region. They urged the Malian parties to fully implement the Agreement without further delay. They noted that the full implementation of the Agreement and the intensification of efforts to overcome asymmetric threats can contribute to improving the security situation across Mali. They underlined that the efforts of the Force Conjointe of the G5 Sahel to counter the activities of terrorist groups and other organized criminal groups will contribute to create a more secure environment in the Sahel region.

The members of the Security Council further stressed the importance that MINUSMA has the necessary capacities, including combat convoy companies, to fulfil its mandate and promote the safety and security of the United Nations peacekeepers, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2364 (2017).

25,mali,"Justice Ministry Should Conduct Investigations in the Mopti Region

The government of Mali should urgently conduct credible investigations into abuses against suspects its army detained during a major military operation against armed Islamist groups, Human Rights Watch said. The army high command should suspend officers implicated in abuse pending investigations and ensure that all detainees are treated humanely and are promptly turned over to government gendarmes.

The investigations should include the deaths in detention of 27 men and the severe torture of two others in February, March, and April 2018 during Operation Dambe, a major offensive that ramped up in early 2018 in the Mopti region of Central Mali. The army has said that it is investigating two of the reported cases. In light of the failure of the military to hold accountable soldiers implicated in past abuses, an independent Justice Ministry investigation for the current spate of abuses is crucial, Human Rights Watch said.

“Multiple accounts of mass arrests followed by the discovery of common graves point to the army running amok in central Mali,” said Corinne Dufka, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Prompt government action is needed to stop the abuses and bring those responsible to justice.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 14 men on April 5, who had been arrested in the Mopti region during military operations on March 8 and 12. Five of the detainees alleged that they were mistreated while in army custody, two of them severely. Numerous deep gashes and scars covering their backs, abdomens, and legs were clearly visible during the interviews, one of which was in a clinic where the most severely injured detainee was still receiving medical attention.

A 57-year-old herder described being tortured by the soldiers. He said that at around 8 a.m. on March 12, six soldiers arrested him, his son, and a nephew at their home. The soldiers ordered them to walk to a spot outside the village, where he was blindfolded, and his hands and feet bound. He was severely beaten there for about 40 minutes. “One soldier held my head while another held my feet. The third began striking me with a machete on my back again and again until I lost consciousness.”

Another man, 42, detained in the same operation, was beaten with gun butts and a machete, and threatened with death: “They interrogated me while beating me and one threatened to slit my throat if I didn’t talk.”

The defense and justice ministries should also follow through on pledges to investigate two common graves in the towns of Sokolo and Dogo, which contain the remains of 13 men allegedly executed just days after soldiers took them into custody.

In Sokolo, relatives said that the army arrested seven ethnic Peuhl men who were celebrating a baptism on February 21. They included the head of the village and several members of his family. The relatives said they had learned from informal sources that their detained family members were thought to have been killed in custody. On February 27, the Malian government announced it had investigated and determined that the seven men were killed during fighting in the region.

On March 25, residents of Dogo told Human Rights Watch they had identified the bodies of six men, including a father and son, who had been arrested by security forces three days earlier. One said: “The last time we saw them alive they were in the custody of the soldiers. The next time we saw them they were in a common grave.” In a statement to the media, Mayor Omar Dicko of Dogo reported that the men, all of them ethnic Peuhl, were well known in the village as merchants and had no known involvement with armed groups. The defense minister has said that he had not been fully briefed on the discovered grave, but that he would seek to open an investigation into the incident.

Villagers from around the Dioura area told Human Rights Watch on April 5 that the army had detained 14 local men from the villages of Nelbal and Dekounna. The next day the army issued a statement saying that 14 men had died while attempting to escape. A witness said: “The army found a gun in the village and proceeded to arrest all the men – they were blindfolded and taken away by the army. We only learned of their fate from social media.”

In a September 2017 news release, Human Rights Watch documented the existence of three other common graves – in the villages of Yirima, Issèye, and Mougnoukana – which witnesses allege contain the remains of at least 14 men killed after being taken into custody by the Malian security services between late December 2016 and May 2017. In October, the Defense Ministry committed to investigate the allegations.

“The rapidly growing list of grave incidents in the Mopti region suggests that the army there has serious command and control problems that need to be urgently addressed,” Dufka said. “This is all the more reason for a credible independent investigation by civilian authorities.”","Mali: Deaths, Torture in Army Detention",https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/mali-deaths-torture-army-detention
