1,mongolia,"(Corrects to show mortgage subsidies began in 2013, not 2012)

ULAANBAATAR, March 20 (Reuters) - Mongolia’s central bank has rejected lawmakers’ proposals to cap or cut interest rates, currently among the world’s highest, as rifts deepen over an economic rescue package agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year.

As parliament discusses a bill to prevent interest rates on commercial bank loans from exceeding 18 percent, Bank of Mongolia president Bayartsaikhan Nadmid proposed an alternative strategy during a forum on Tuesday.

“The central bank supports the strategy to decrease interest rates by enabling a macroeconomic environment for it, not by force or control,” he said.

Mongolia secured a $5.5 billion bailout with the IMF last May after an economic crisis left the landlocked Asian nation struggling to pay off its debts and sent its currency, the tugrik, into a tailspin.

The terms of the deal forced the government to raise taxes and cut spending, and also urged Mongolia to strengthen the independence of its banking system and make it less vulnerable to political interference.

Most of the austerity measures have been enacted by the ruling Mongolian People’s Party, but opposition politicians have expressed concern about the economic impact of high interest rates and are seeking powers to force banks to make cuts.

Mongolia has some of the world’s highest interest rates, averaging 19.4 percent in January, according to the central bank. The high rates have reduced economic activity and discouraged small businesses, analysts say.

Inflation currently stands at 6.9 percent, according to the Bank of Mongolia, below an 8 percent target.

Mongolia began subsidising mortgages in 2013 allowing homes to be bought at a rate of 8 percent. According to the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation, which manages the portfolio, total outstanding mortgages as of December 2016 stood at around 4 trillion tugrik ($1.67 billion).

However, the IMF has discouraged the central bank from participating in programmes it describes as “quasi-fiscal activity”.

Demberel Sambuu, a former legislator and head of an economic think tank, said demand for lower interest rates has been on the rise in recent years, but forcing banks to comply was not the solution.

“Fixing the maximum rates on loan interest would be an inefficient way,” he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/mongolia-rates/corrected-mongolian-cbank-rejects-interest-rate-cap-as-austerity-bites-idUSL3N1R23P7
2,mongolia,"New York, Mar 10 (JEN): Mongolia first joined United Nations peacekeeping in 2002 with the deployment of two unarmed military observers to the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. Soon after that, it sent two more officers to the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, Mongolia has continued to expand its contributions to UN peace operations in hot spots around the world.

In 2006, Mongolia made its first sizeable contribution to UN peacekeeping when it deployed 250 military personnel to the UN Mission in Liberia, a West African country that was recovering from a violent civil war. Six years later, Mongolia undertook it largest deployment to date when it sent a full battalion of 850 troops to the UN Mission in South Sudan, where they continue to play an important role in protecting civilians.

Throughout its decade-and-a-half history in UN peacekeeping, Mongolian contributions to UN peacekeeping have been notable for their high standards of training and for the high number of women they deploy.

Mongolia has risen to become the 27th largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, with nearly 900 military and police personnel deployed in five operations. But they have not forgotten their first mission--they continue to send a handful of military observers to Western Sahara.

Peacekeeping is a dangerous business. UN personnel can sustain injuries in the line of duty, the workplace or in vehicular accidents, and harsh conditions and disease can also take its toll. Peacekeeping operations deploy medical contingents contributed by Member States to ensure that UN personnel – troops, police and civilians – receive the best medical care possible.

In Kabkabiya in the Darfur region of Sudan, Mongolia has for several years provided a Level Two Hospital to address this need. The unit consists of 68 personnel, 34 men and 34 women, and is responsible for providing UN personnel with health care, emergency resuscitation and stabilization, life and limb-saving surgical interventions, basic dental care and facilitation of casualty evacuation for more severe cases. It also administered vaccinations and other prophylaxis measures. In addition to serving UN staff, the Mongolian hospital unit treated more than 10,000 people from the local communities.

Since 2003, more than 14,000 Mongolian peacekeepers have served in UN missions around the world. Today, Mongolia deploys nearly 900 peacekeepers to five UN peacekeeping operations – in South Sudan, Abyei, Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Western Sahara. The Mongolian contribution consists of troops, police and unarmed military observers.

A key task of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is monitoring the ceasefire observed by the parties since September 1991 – carried out by some 200 military observers. Seen here, a Mongolian military observer serving with MINURSO, together with colleagues from Ghana, France and Bangladesh, check a map while carrying out an observation patrol in the vast area in Smara.

In recent years, the people of South Sudan have simultaneously endured civil war and high levels of food insecurity. Among their tasks, Mongolian peacekeepers provide security as the UN World Food Programme (WFP) drops much-needed food in Bentiu, South Sudan. Their responsibilities also include protecting civilians, securing UN bases, carrying out patrols, escorting convoys, supporting search operations carried out by UN Police, as well as protecting fellow peacekeepers as they carry out road maintenance and demining operations.

In May 2017, more than 850 Mongolian peacekeepers were awarded the United Nations Medal for their commitment and service to the UN and the people of South Sudan during a ceremony in Bentiu. In awarding the medals, the Head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), David Shearer, praised the Mongolian troops for their “robust, calm and appropriate” approach to peacekeeping. He said the courage and determination they had shown set a high standard for all peacekeeping forces to emulate.

“The Mongolian peacekeepers have led the way in terms of robustness which is an approach that we would like to see more of in our peacekeeping efforts in South Sudan,” Shearer added.

Ensuring justice is a key element of the work of the United Nations, including its peacekeeping operations. The Special Court for Sierra Leone was set up by the Government and the UN to ""prosecute persons who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law"" during the country’s civil war (1991-2002).

When the UN peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone closed, the Security Council mandated the UN mission in neighbouring Liberia (UNMIL) to provide security to the detainees and the Court. Mongolia accepted the responsibility and deployed its personnel in early 2006. The well-trained and equipped Mongolian Guard Unit performed to the highest standards and completed its mission years ago.",https://indiablooms.com/world-details/F/14796/service-and-sacrifice-mongolia-continues-to-strengthen-its-contribution-to-un-peacekeeping.html
3,mongolia,"THE former president of MONGOLIA has offered to host the ground-breaking meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.

The meeting, set to occur ""by May"", will make Trump the first ever US President to meet with a North Korean leader.

AP:Associated Press Donald Trump has agreed to meet with Kim Jong-un, South Korea says

Today Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj tweeted: ""A long waited breakthrough! Here is an offer: US President Trump and NK leader Kim meet in UB.

""Mongolia is the most suitable, neutral territory. We facilitated important meetings, including between Japan and NK.""

North Korean reps have actually met with former US officials in Mongolia recently as the two countries initiated preliminary meetings.

The White House confirmed talks between the leaders will be held ""at a place and time to be determined"" but South Korea claims that a meeting would take place by May.

Twitter The former president of Mongolia tweeted the suggestion today

South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui Yong said that Jong-un ""expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible.""

The White House said the historic diplomatic meeting between the powerful leaders would take place, but wouldn't reveal when or where.

Sarah Sanders, White House spokeswoman, said: ""President Trump greatly appreciates the nice words of the South Korean delegation and President Moon.

""He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un at a place and time to be determined.

""We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.""

The president later told his 48 million followers on Twitter that ""great progress"" was being made and that a meeting was ""being planned"".

He said: ""Kim Jong-un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.

""Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!""

US officials were reportedly blindsided by Trump’s decision to pop into the briefing room today to reveal an announcement would be taking place regarding North Korea.

Trump appeared to have caught his own top foreign policy official off guard as well.

Speaking to the media earlier in the day, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to shoot down the prospect of direct negotiations with North Korea.

Tillerson had said: “In terms of direct talks with the United States, and you asked negotiations, we’re a long way from negotiations, we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it.""

A meeting between the powerful leaders would be a major turnaround after North Korea carried out a battery of tests aimed at developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.

How China's frosty relations with North Korea helped push Kim towards Trump Jim Hoare, former Foreign Office diplomat who helped set up the British embassy in Pyongyang from 2001 to 2002, spoke to The Sun Online about China’s deteriorating relationship with North Korea. Hoare, of The Royal Institute of International affairs, believes North Korea’s isolation could have helped push Kim Jong-un towards Trump. He said: “You suddenly realise that everybody amongst your neighbours is not being very friendly. That would make me want to talk I think.” He added: “Their relations with China are not good. The North Koreans feel like China is not helping them by signing up to UN sanctions “The Chinese have come in for some criticism from North Korea on their willingness to impose sanctions. “Just before Christmas, North Korea criticised Chinese for interfering with humanitarian work by not allowing certain goods across the border.” Hoare says the Chinese “got very worried” over the terrifying war of words between Trump and Kim last year. He says Beijing was worried that more incidents like January’s ballistic missile false alarm in Hawaii could become more common and that “somebody could react to that.”

The relationship between Trump and Kim has been fraught with the pair trading insults over social media and official public statement.

Chung and National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon flew to Washington earlier on Thursday to explain North Korea's stance on possible future talks with the US, and the prospect of Pyongyang suspending nuclear tests if the security of the North's government is assured.

Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said in response to the announcement in Washington that North Korea must commit to abandoning nuclear development completely in order for meaningful talks to take place with Pyongyang.

BOONE, N.C. — The geological research of Appalachian State University’s DAGGER (Devonian Anoxia, Geochemistry, Geochronology and Extinction Research) team, which is led by Drs. Sarah Carmichael and Johnny Waters, will continue thanks to a $29,932 grant from the National Geographic Society (NGS). This funding will support their project titled “Looking for Mass Extinctions in All the ‘Wrong’ Places: The Late Devonian of Mongolia.”

Carmichael is an associate professor in Appalachian’s Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences, and Waters is professor emeritus in the department.

The DAGGER group is an interdisciplinary, international research team focused on the systematics of mass extinctions in the Late Devonian. The group is based at Appalachian, but consists of geochemists, sedimentologists, paleontologists and stratigraphers from around the globe.

“‘The present is the key to the past’ is a fundamental tenet of the geosciences,” Carmichael said, “wherein observations of modern phenomena are used to infer geologic processes in deep time.”

“We can likewise use the information preserved in the rock record to predict future events. In this project, we will use ocean sediments from the Late Devonian (375-350 million years ago) to predict the effects of future rapid climate change on marine animals and ocean geochemistry.”

According to Carmichael, the Late Devonian was a time of prolonged climate instability and catastrophic extinction that decimated marine ecosystems, including the virtual demise of coral reefs.

She said, “In order to use past biodiversity crises to predict future ones, our team will test our hypothesis that Late Devonian mass extinction pulses were climate driven and global in scope, and that survival depended on oceanic isolation. However, our current knowledge is limited by significant sampling bias, as nearly all previous studies are from semirestricted basins on continental shelves in the U.S. and Europe, which are not representative of global oceanic conditions at that time.”

To address this, Carmichael said the team will continue to study Late Devonian extinction events in western Mongolia, in sediments that formed on the flanks of isolated volcanic island chains and represent typical oceanic conditions in the Late Devonian.

“Understanding where and how marine animals can survive rapidly changing oceanic conditions and oxygen loss during past mass extinctions is a vital tool for predicting how marine ecosystems will respond to a predicted future biodiversity crisis,” she said.

The DAGGER team works primarily in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt of western China and western Mongolia, as well as in southeast Asia and in Europe, said Carmichael, “to determine the extent, scope and cause of Devonian ocean anoxia events, their potential for organic carbon sequestration (natural gas deposits) and the rebound from the mass extinctions associated with these events.”

Other members of the team include Dr. Sersmaa Gonchigdorj, a geologist at the Mongolian University of Science and Technology in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Dr. Peter Königshof, section head in the Department of Paleontology Historical Geology at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany; and many others.

5,mongolia,"PARSIPPANY, N.J. – Nigel Linsan Colley, an independent researcher of the legacy of Gareth Jones, the first journalist to report on the Great Famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine, died on February 1 after a brief battle with cancer. He was 57.

Mr. Colley was a grandnephew of Jones, the young Welsh journalist who traveled to Ukraine in March 1933 at the time of the Holodomor and reported his findings. For that, Jones was branded a liar by none other than Walter Duranty of The New York Times, who famously wrote: “There is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation, but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition.”

Jones responded, and his reply was published as a letter to the editor in The Times. He stated in part: “[Moscow] Journalists are allowed to write, but the censorship has turned them into masters of euphemism and understatement… May I in conclusion congratulate the Soviet Foreign Office on its skill in concealing the true situation in the USSR?”

In 1935 Jones was kidnapped in inner Mongolia and then murdered under mysterious circumstances on the eve of his 30th birthday. As Mr. Colley related in one of his research papers about his great-uncle, “…his premature death deprived the world [of] the wisdom of a true humanitarian and silenced one of the very few Western witnesses of the 1932-1933 Holodomor. There is no doubt that Gareth was, as [former British Prime Minister David] Lloyd George remarked, ‘a man who knew too much.’ “

Mr. Colley underscored: “With his murder the only reliable Western witness to arguably Stalin’s greatest atrocity had effectively been silenced and like the Holodomor itself was effectively airbrushed out of history until after the fall of Communism in the 1990s.”

Dr. Margaret Siriol Colley and her son Nigel knew the story of their courageous uncle and great-uncle – but not all of it. What they knew was that Jones was murdered, allegedly by bandits, while he was traveling in Manchukuo, as Japanese-occupied Manchuria and Inner Mongolia were called.

“He was a legend in our family, and a mystery,” Dr. Colley, a physician, explained when she and her son visited the editorial offices of The Ukrainian Weekly in 2003. “We wanted to find out why he was murdered, and then we worked back from there,” added her son. And thus, the two began to research Jones’s life and work. The result was Dr. Colley’s book “Gareth Jones: A Manchukuo Incident” (2001). Mr. Colley provided additional materials and editing for the book, and was responsible for the website dedicated to Gareth Jones (www.colley.co.uk/gareth jones). The book “Gareth Jones: A Grain of Truth” was published four years later. Written by Dr. Colley with her son as collaborate and editor, it was a biography of Jones that also focused on his articles about the USSR and his groundbreaking reports on the Holodomor in Ukraine.

In 2003 the Colleys wrote a letter to The Pulitzer Prize Board with “a personal plea to revoke the 1932 Pulitzer Prize from the infamous journalist, Walter Duranty.” They argued that “the Pulitzer Prize should be revoked from Walter Duranty, not just for his falsification of Stalin’s ruthless execution of the Five-Year Plan of Collectivization, but also for his complete disregard for journalistic integrity. Through abusing his position of authority as The New York Times’ reporter in the Soviet Union, he villainously and publicly denigrated the truthful articles of my uncle, and ashamedly did so, whilst being fully aware of the ongoing famine. Indeed, if you were seeking a means of restoring the international prestige of the Pulitzer Prize, then you ought to consider bestowing the award posthumously to Gareth Jones for his valiant and truthful international exposure of the Soviet Genocide-Famine of 1933, and in doing so help commemorate all the defenseless victims of Stalin’s inhumanity.”

That year Dr. Colley wrote also to the publisher of The New York Times, Arthur Sulzberger Jr.: “In view of the fact that Walter Duranty must have known the true state of affairs in Ukraine in 1930 and by his denial of the famine as ‘Stalin’s Apologist,’ then I totally support the campaign requesting you to return his Pulitzer in the name of my uncle, Gareth Jones, and all those who sadly perished in the Holodomor of 1932-1933.”

In 2005, speaking at the Holodomor commemoration in St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, Mr. Colley stated: “To the list of the millions of Ukrainian peasants who lost their lives due to Stalin’s man-made Famine, the name of the only Welshman, my great-uncle, Gareth Jones, should perhaps now be added.” He noted that newly discovered evidence at the British Public Records Office “points the finger of blame for Gareth’s murder in 1935 in the direction of Moscow, quite probably in retribution for his international exposure of the Holodomor.” Mr. Colley said Jones’ only crime was his “dogged pursuit of truth.”

Mr. Colley was born on June 20, 1960. He held a bachelor of science degree in biochemistry from York University in the United Kingdom, and he worked in the field of computers.

The resident of Nottinghamshire, England, once noted “I only have a degree in biochemistry and no history qualifications whatsoever…,” yet he became an indefatigable researcher. He went on to speak at various academic conferences and universities in Europe and North America, as well as at the United Nations. He was a featured speaker also at Ukrainian community events and was interviewed by the news media. He was a researcher for Ray Gamache’s book, “Gareth Jones: Eyewitness to the Holodomor.”

At the National Press Club on November 21, 2011, Mr. Colley presented the story of his great-uncle and information on his latest findings about the Holodomor based on Jones’ diaries and letters. He noted that Jones was convinced there was a famine in Ukraine and that he had to see it first-hand and report on it, so that the Soviets couldn’t continue to deny its existence.

Mr. Colley’s talk was dedicated to his mother, Dr. Colley, who had died the previous day.

Writing about the passing of Nigel Colley in the National Review online, Andrew Stuttaford said: “Nigel Colley died last week, far, far, too soon. …in his own modest, determined way, he played a part in changing the course of history. He did so by a making a significant contribution to the way that a terrible story is now remembered, with results that not only changed how we see the past, but will also help shape the future.”

Mr. Stuttaford also noted that Mr. Colley “was determined to reinsert his great-uncle into the historical record and, alongside that, to do his part to make sure that the genocide Jones had witnessed should never again be allowed to be ‘forgotten’ in the way that its perpetrators – and their successors – have tried to ensure. Nigel wanted to do right by Jones and he wanted to do right by Ukraine. He succeeded on both counts.”

Funeral services for Mr. Colley were held on February 15 in Nottingham at Calverton Village Hall.

Michael Sawkiw Jr., chairman of the U.S. Committee for Ukrainian Holodomor-Genocide Awareness, wrote: “Nigel was a true friend of the Ukrainian Holodomor. His goal was to bring the truth about the Holodomor, and those who wrote about the genocide in the 1930s, to the attention of the world. Nigel will always be remembered for spreading awareness of the Holodomor and the works of his [great] uncle, Gareth Jones.”",http://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/nigel-colley-researcher-and-grandnephew-of-gareth-jones-57/
6,mongolia,"Mongolia’s central bank has cut its policy interest rate by 1 percentage point to 10%, the bank’s Monetary Policy Council announced on March 23.

The Monetary Policy Department’s director, Bayardavaa Bayarsaikhan, said the adjustment was aimed at ensuring inflation does not exceed 8% in 2018, with the regulator expecting inflation to remain mostly unchanged at that level in 2018-2020. The move marks a second cut within the last four months as the country recovers from the 2016 crisis that saw economic growth in the country slow to 1% and its currency boarding a rollercoaster.

Growth recovered to 5.1% in 2017 partly supported by rising commodities prices and growing demand for Mongolian coal in China, which had to replace North Korean coal shipments barred by sanctions in the wake of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons tests.

Mongolia’s annual consumer price inflation jumped 6.9% y/y in January, according to latest published figures from the national statistics office.

The World Bank expects a continued cyclical recovery in Mongolia in 2018, according to the bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report. It has forecast growth at 3.1% in 2018 (after previous expectations that growth would come in at 2.7% for 2017), accelerating sharply to 7.3% in 2019, before easing to 5.5% in 2020.

Russia reportedly encountered difficulties in obtaining visas for their participants, with both Russia's late submission of their visa applications and the understaffed embassy in Moscow being stated as reasons for the difficulties.

Occurring in the background to these events is the ongoing diplomatic crisis between Russia in the West after the poisoning of a British spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England in early March.

India and Mongolia have accepted invitations to wrestle in Russia and Iran's places. Iran had previously committed to wrestle in the World Cup after original invitee Turkey backed out. The top eight teams from the previous year's World Championships are automatically invited to the subsequent year's World Cup.

In a report, the White Helmets said the toll is for regime attacks carried out between Feb. 19 and Friday.

Russia, a staunch ally of Assad, called for daily five-hour local ceasefires to establish what it calls a humanitarian corridor so that aid can enter the enclave and civilians and the wounded could leave. But the first such truce on Tuesday quickly collapsed when bombing and shelling resumed after a short lull. Hundreds of people have died in 11 days of bombing of eastern Ghouta, a swathe of towns and farms outside Damascus that is the last major opposition-controlled area near the capital.

Eastern Ghouta has been under siege for the last five years; humanitarian access to the area, which is home to 400,000 people, has been completely cut off.

In the past eight months, Assad regime forces have intensified their siege of Eastern Ghouta, making it nearly impossible for food or medicine to get into the district and leaving thousands of patients in need of treatment.

Syria has been locked in a devastating conflict since early 2011 when the regime cracked down on demonstrators with unexpected ferocity.

According to UN officials, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict to date.

Eastern Ghouta becomes ghost town due to Assad siege An analysis of aerial drone footage showed widespread new damage in Syria's besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta. Eastern Ghouta, a swathe of towns and farms outside Damascus that is the last major opposition-controlled area near the capital, has turned into a skeleton of its former self. It has become a city of craters, debris and damaged structures.Even minarets demolishedEven in neighborhoods with respectively less damage compared to other parts of the city, apartment blocks with their façade ripped apart and bare rooms can be seen. Rooms do not have walls, and are only distinguished by internal columns.When there is a lull in the shelling, locals prefer to travel via motorbikes. Not even places of worship are safe from being targeted, as the video shows mosques stripped of their minarets. In the last two weeks, the Syrian regime has targeted 22 health centers, a mosque and an orphanage. There are few differences between the ghost town’s cemetery and the remaining parts of the city.Video: Drone footage reveals skeleton of Eastern GhoutaThe Nur Mosque in Douma, which was built 120 years ago, was hit by warplanes of Russia, despite the country being one of the guarantors of the Astana agreement, which declares the suburb a de-escalation zone.Russia and Turkey, along with Iran are sponsoring the Astana peace talks, which focuses on a cease-fire and ending the six-and-a-half-year civil war in Syria.Over 100 children killedRussia and the Syrian regime continue shelling the city despite the UN call for a ceasefire.

9,mongolia,"The Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar is the world’s most polluted.

People often overlook Ulaanbaatar, not knowing where or what it is, but its environmental crisis is one that cannot be ignored. As Mongolia’s capital and largest city, Ulaanbaatar — or Ulan Bator — is home to more than 1.31 million people, making up nearly half of the nation’s total population. Beijing, the Chinese capital that is known for its smog, has 21.5 million residents. Despite Beijing’s exceedingly larger population, Ulaanbaatar tops the list as the world’s most polluted capital city.

Ulaanbaatar’s average annual temperature is approximately 30 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the coldest capital in the world, contributing greatly to why it is the most heavily polluted. Raw coal and garbage are used to heat homes, filling each chimney in the city with massive amounts of smoke. Up to 1.3 tons of coal, which can fill up a small truck, lasts a single family for about a month through the dead of the winter.

Mongolia is historically a land of nomadic people who live in gers (portable tents) with vast spans of land. In recent years, many of these traditional farmers have headed from rural regions to the capital in hopes of job opportunities. Around 20% have migrated to Ulaanbaatar, imposing not only infrastructure challenges, but also great environmental damage. This includes approximately 70% of degraded land, unstable crop growth due to climate change and extreme fluctuations in weather conditions.

Air pollution has also resulted in a child health crisis. These risks include chronic health and birth issues, cognitive impairment, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma.

10,mongolia,"SEOUL, March 26 (Yonhap) -- The Red Cross chiefs of South and North Korea will meet this week in a regional forum to discuss cooperation on social issues, the South Korean chief said Monday.

Park Kyung-seo, the president of the Red Cross in South Korea, said in a speech to a seminar, ""I will fly to Hong Kong and have half-official, half-informal discussions with the Red Cross of North Korea.""



He said the meeting will bring together the Red Cross chiefs of six Northeast Asian countries, including the two Koreas, China, Japan and Mongolia, Wednesday and Thursday in the Chinese territory.

The 2018 East Asian Red Cross leadership meeting is designed to discuss mainly regional cooperation on issues like reducing the risk of disaster and support for young people. But it could possibly touch upon humanitarian assistance between the two Koreas, as it would be a rare chance for officials from the two Koreas to meet ahead of an inter-Korean summit slated for late April.

""There's no arrangement so far for a separate meeting with the North Korean Red Cross,"" a Red Cross official here said.

The same Red Cross leadership meeting held in Beijing in 2014 was attended by the former president of the South Korean Red Cross and a vice chief of the North Korean Red Cross.

MIDDAY

5 March 2018

Concludes Dialogue with Experts on Transitional Justice and on the Prevention of Genocide

The Human Rights Council in its midday meeting held a clustered interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, John Knox, and with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Hilal Elver. It also concluded its interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, and the Special Adviser of the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng.

Presenting his last report to the Human Rights Council as Special Rapporteur, Mr. Knox highlighted the obligation of States to take into account the effects of proposed actions on children, facilitate the participation of children in environmental decision-making, and to ensure that the best interests of children were a primary consideration in all environmental decision-making. Presenting his report on 16 framework principles on human rights and the environment, Mr. Knox underlined that they did not create new legal obligations. Rather, they reflected the application of existing human rights obligations in the environmental context. The simplest way of expressing the interdependence of human rights and the environment was through the recognition of a human right to a healthy environment. More than 100 countries had already recognized that right in their national constitutions. Mr. Knox encouraged States to support the recognition of that right in a General Assembly resolution, or another global instrument. He spoke on his missions to Mongolia and Uruguay.

In her presentation, Ms. Elver provided an update on the right to food in conflict zones and presented the thematic report on the right to food in the context of natural disasters. She reminded that hunger affected 11 per cent of the global population and that it killed more people every year than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined. Overall, high levels of acute food insecurity were faced by 108 million people across 48 countries. The thematic report highlighted that even though international food assistance had risen in response to escalating humanitarian crises, it still fell short of $ 3 billion. Almost all foreign aid currently supported short-term relief operations and there were barely any aid funds devoted to agricultural investment and rural development which could improve long-term food security. Though natural disasters created large-scale human suffering, no holistic multilateral disaster response treaty existed. She spoke about her trip to Zambia.

Mongolia and Uruguay spoke as concerned countries. Zambia did not take the floor as a concerned country.

In the ensuing discussion on the environment, speakers underlined that disasters and environmental pollution disproportionately affected the most vulnerable in societies, including the elderly, women, people with disabilities and children. Three million children died from environment-related causes and conditions; low-cost solutions, such as simple filtration and disinfection of water at household levels could dramatically reduce the risk of diarrhoea and disease. Speakers called for the recognition of the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, and expressed concern about the arbitrary detention, repression of freedom of expression and even murder of environmental human rights defenders.

On the right to food, speakers reminded that natural and conflict-related disasters disproportionately affected the rural poor, over 75 per cent of whom derived their livelihood from agriculture. Food security should be addressed together with other related problems, including climate change. Relief funding should be geared towards the development of sustainable food security ecosystems, thereby improving the resilience and effectiveness of the relief effort in times of calamities. Everyone should remain committed to ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture globally. Speakers appreciated the emphasis given to the need for reforms of the current food aid regime, and to true human rights-based solutions within the framework of food sovereignty.

Speaking were European Union, Costa Rica on behalf of a group of countries, Togo on behalf of the African Group, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on behalf of a group of countries, Slovenia, Haiti, Pakistan, Egypt, Switzerland, Senegal, Philippines, Viet Nam, Madagascar, Togo, Cuba, France, China, Ethiopia, India, Greece, Venezuela, Malaysia, Iraq, Maldives, Iran, Costa Rica, Georgia, Peru, Indonesia, Botswana, Bolivia, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Turkey, Bangladesh, Ireland, Gabon, United Nations Environment Programme, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Nepal, State of Palestine, Jordan on behalf of the Arab Group, and Azerbaijan.

Also taking the floor were the following non-governmental organizations: Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain Inc, Indian Council of South America, Asian Legal Resource Council, Franciscans International, Friends World Committee for Consultation, Human Rights Watch, Make Mothers Matter, International Federation Terre des Hommes, Earthjustice, Amnesty International, FIAN International, Song of Cheetah in Desert, International Human Rights Association of American Minorities, World Barua Organization, and Organization for Defending Victims of Violence.

At the beginning of the meeting, the Council concluded its interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, and the Special Adviser of the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng. A summary of the discussion held on Friday, 2 March, can be read here.

In his concluding remarks, Mr. de Greiff said that the joint study had been carried out to strengthen the prevention mechanisms, but it also served as an invitation to Member States, other multilateral mechanisms and non-government organizations to conduct fundamental efforts in reinforcing prevention initiatives. It was important to think of every initiative as part of the overall prevention framework.

Mr. Dieng stated that the most effective way to analyze the situation on the ground was through the framework of analysis for atrocity crimes developed by the Special Adviser’s office. States could identify both strengths and weakness that would assist in developing a risk framework, and based on such analysis a comprehensive prevention framework could be developed.

In the discussion speakers expressed deep concern about gross human rights violations that undermined the potential of transitional justice mechanisms and the rule of law, mostly because of widespread impunity. They underlined the importance of a legal framework for the prevention of genocide, and of the universal ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

Speaking in the discussion were International Commission of Jurists, International Human Rights Association of American Minorities, Centre for Global Nonkilling, and Association Internationale pour l’égalité des femmes.

Nepal and Indonesia spoke in a right of reply.

At 4 p.m., the Council will hold the second part of the annual full-day meeting on the rights of the child, with a focus on protecting the rights of the child in humanitarian situations.

Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Recurrence, and the Special Adviser of the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide

International Commission of Jurists expressed deep concern about gross human rights violations that undermined the potential of transitional justice mechanisms and the rule of law, such as in Nepal. One of the main reasons was widespread impunity. International Human Rights Association of American Minorities (IHRAAM) called on the Special Rapporteur to pay attention to the reality of occupied regions, such as Palestine and Kashmir. Turning to Yemen, it called for holding accountable those responsible for human rights violations and providing remedy to victims. Centre for Global Nonkilling underlined the importance of a legal framework for the prevention of genocide, and of the universal ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

International Association for Equality of women drew attention to the 1989 massacre of political prisoners in Iran, and underlined the right to remedy of the families. After nearly 30 years no investigation had been carried out by the Iranian authorities. It was high time that an international commission be established to bring justice to the victims.

Concluding Remarks

PABLO DE GREIFF, Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, said that the joint study had been prepared to strengthen the prevention mechanisms, but it also served as an invitation to Member States, other multilateral mechanisms and non-government organizations to conduct fundamental efforts in reinforcing prevention initiatives. It was important to think of every initiative as part of the overall prevention framework. The Council could play a very important role in this framework, whether by including policies of access to education, access to health, fiscal policies, labour policies, as all those policies had been part of prevention framework. The United Nations was in a privileged position to convene the consultations that could upgrade the framework and the Council could assist in such endeavours. Member States were invited to take much more aggressive steps towards developing risk assessments.

ADAMA DIENG, Special Adviser of the Secretary General on the prevention of genocide, stated that the most effective way to analyse the situation on the ground in a certain country was through the framework of analysis for atrocity crimes developed by the Special Adviser’s office. States could identify both strengths and weaknesses that would assist in developing a risk framework, and based on such analysis a comprehensive prevention framework could be developed. In this endeavour, States had to be supported by the United Nations country teams and civil society organizations. The strengthening of the seven key inhibitors listed in the Secretary-General’s Responsibility to Protect should be the State’s responsibility. The work on the prevention was initiated under the former Secretary-General and would be continued under the current one. Cooperation was already established with the European Union and it was planned with the African Union as well in order to develop early warning systems. Finally, concerning the role of the Council in identifying atrocities crimes risk, the Universal Periodic Review could serve as an important mechanism.

Presentation of Reports by the Special Rapporteur on a Healthy and Sustainable Environment and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food

JOHN KNOX, Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, in his last address to the Council as Special Rapporteur, noted that a healthy environment was necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights, and that the exercise of human rights was critical for the protection of a healthy environment. He reminded of the recent adoption of the text of a new treaty on the right to information, participation and access to justice in the environmental context by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and hailed it as one of the most important human rights treaties and one of the most important environmental treaties of the past 20 years. Turning to his report on children’s rights and the environment, Mr. Knox recalled that environmental harm interfered with a host of children’s rights, including their rights to life, health and development, food, housing, water and sanitation, play and recreation. States had to improve their development and dissemination of information about environmental hazards, and ensure that environmental impact assessment procedures took into account the effects of proposed actions on children. States should facilitate the participation of children in environmental decision-making, and should ensure that the best interests of children were a primary consideration in all environmental decision-making. States could begin by committing to implement the recommendations of expert agencies, such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF, which had recently issued detailed reports with examples of good practices on protecting children’s health and well-being from environmental harm.

Turning to his country visits, Mr. Knox said that Uruguay had made a truly remarkable commitment to renewable energy. Over the past decade, it had pursued a long-term strategy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Its national energy plan had surpassed its original targets: over 90 per cent of its electricity now came from renewable resources. At the same time, Uruguay faced challenges. For example, as it increased its production of agriculture and livestock, it had to ensure that it protected its sources of drinking water from pollution from fertilizers, pesticides and cattle. As for Mongolia, its tradition of nomadic herding was under pressure from many directions, including overgrazing, climate change, and mining activities. Those pressures drove herders to urban areas. Mongolia was well aware of those issues and it had adapted environmental laws that included strong substantive standards. But implementation often lagged behind.

Finally, presenting his report on 16 framework principles on human rights and the environment, Mr. Knox noted that they did not create new legal obligations. Rather, they reflected the application of existing human rights obligations in the environmental context. For example, they stated that the rights to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly applied to environmental issues, as did the right to information, public participation in decision-making and access to effective remedies. They provided that States’ duties to protect human rights defenders included environmental human rights defenders, who were working to protect the environment on which our human rights depended, often at great personal risk. On average, four were killed every week around the world. The framework principles made clear that the obligations of States to prohibit discrimination and to ensure equal and effective protection against discrimination applied in relation to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Perhaps the simplest way of expressing the interdependence of human rights and the environment was through the recognition of a human right to a healthy environment. More than 100 countries had already recognized that right in their national constitutions. Mr. Knox encouraged States to support the recognition of that right in a General Assembly resolution, or other global instrument. Recognition of the right to a healthy environment would not require a sea-change in human rights law; on the contrary, it would highlight what had already become clear: all human beings deserved to live in an environment that enabled them to enjoy their human rights.

HILAL ELVER, Special Rapporteur on the right to food, provided an update on the right to food in conflict zones and presented the thematic report on the right to food in the context of natural disasters. Hunger affected 815 million people or 11 per cent of the global population, and it killed more people every year than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined. In Yemen 17.8 million people were food insecure and 1.8 million children were acutely malnourished. In South Sudan 48 per cent of the population had experienced severe food insecurity. In North East Nigeria 2.6 million people were food insecure. In Syria the starvation and surrender tactics aggravated the conditions of civilians. Overall, high levels of acute food insecurity were faced by 108 million people across 48 countries. Her thematic report highlighted that even though international food assistance had risen in response to escalating humanitarian crises, it still fell short of $ 3 billion. Almost all foreign aid currently supported short-term relief operations and there were barely any aid funds devoted to agricultural investment and rural development which could improve long-term food security. The number of climate-related disasters had doubled in the past decade and there were on average 334 events annually. The Food Assistance Convention of 2012 was the only legally binding treaty for donor countries to address the nutritional needs of the vulnerable in emergency situations. Though natural disasters created large-scale human suffering, no holistic multilateral disaster response treaty existed. The World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 was ground breaking, as it had encouraged more flexible funding, greater local ownership and greater accountability.

Reporting on her visit to Zambia, Ms. Elver said that 55 per cent lived below the poverty line. An alarming 40 per cent of children under 5 years of age in Zambia were stunted. The country was blessed with rich fertile lands and water resources. The Government had adopted a range of policies to improve its agricultural sector, but it needed additional efforts to reach diversified and protective policies that would prioritize rural development, while supporting export oriented production. A general legal framework law on the right to adequate food had to be adopted. The current dual land tenure system lacked protection mechanisms to secure access to land for smallholder farmers. It was recommended that Zambia adopt a gender-sensitive, inclusive national land policy and establish an effective monitoring mechanism.

Statements by Concerned Countries

Mongolia, speaking as a concerned country, appreciated a number of recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur, which were in line with its national priorities and programmes. Mongolia was fully committed to meeting its international human rights obligations. However, much remained to be done. In that sense, Mongolia appreciated international cooperation, capacity building and technical assistance.

Uruguay, speaking as a concerned country, said that it had supported the link between human rights and the environment, and particularly the right to information, internationally. It would continue to be active in the area of chemicals and waste, especially with respect to the rights of children. The conclusions and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur would doubtlessly help Uruguay to develop public policies aimed at ensuring the enjoyment of human rights in a safe and clean environment.

Interactive Dialogue

European Union said it had provided for some of the highest environmental standards in legislation and practice, and asked the Special Rapporteur on this issue what were the most pertinent issues he could address in the future. A clear connection existed between natural disasters and food insecurity affecting millions of people, and almost one third of the humanitarian budget of the European Union was for the provision of food. Costa Rica, speaking on behalf of a group of countries, said that millions of children around the world suffered the consequences of environmental degradation, and urged all States to strengthen environmental protection practices. States members of the group were strongly committed to the development of public policies aimed at children’s’ access to environmental education programmes and their participation in decision-making. Togo, speaking on behalf of the African Group, welcomed the report on the impact of the environment on the rights of the child, and said that annually, 600,000 children died from environment-related pollution and 350,000 died from diarrhoea, unhealthy water, and the use of chemical products and other wastes. Togo called upon States to promote in practice the right to food and to a healthy and sustainable environment.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking also on behalf of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas and Haiti, said that the survival of the Caribbean islands was threatened by environmental degradation and climate change, and the priority was to preserve the environment through sustainable practices. A truly global response was needed to address environmental concerns. Slovenia praised the Special Rapporteur on environment for laying down the groundwork in this area over the last six years, and shared his view that children were particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm. What were the biggest gaps and challenges in the implementation of the human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of clean, safe and healthy environment? Haiti took note of the impact of environmental damage on the rights of the child, and asked the Special Rapporteur what were the easiest and the most difficult of the five recommendations he had outlined in his report. Regarding the right to food, Haiti, which currently presided the Caribbean Community, urged the establishment of a new funding mechanism to enable the region to recover rapidly from natural disasters and increase its resilience to climate change. Pakistan recognized the links between childhood exposure to the pollutants and disabilities and premature mortality, and had introduced policies and legislation aimed at protecting the rights of the child in a comprehensive manner. Its judiciary was abreast of the challenges posed by climate change, and it was addressing the human rights obligations in this regard.

On the right to food, human-generated climate change highly impacted food production and food security and particularly affected the children.

Egypt said that, in light of the ever-deteriorating vulnerability to climate change, particularly of children, Egypt stressed the responsibility of developed countries to increase the level of cooperation and make sure that developing countries could adapt to and lessen the impacts of climate change. Climate change also had impact on the enjoyment of the right to food, particularly for children and older people. Switzerland agreed that businesses had to protect the rights of children against the environmental damages caused by their companies, and appealed to all companies to apply the Guiding Principles on Businesses and Human Rights. On the right to food, Switzerland asked what the international community should do to further promote the resilience of vulnerable communities and set up resilient food systems. Senegal welcomed the links between the rights of the child and environmental deterioration and urged all States to step up efforts to ensure that the rights of children were protected in this context. As for the right to food, Senegal had a Food Security Strategy in place and warned that the most developed countries could not cope alone with ensuring food security in the context with natural disasters.

Philippines was proud of its Environmental Awareness Education Act, and the setting up of water quality management areas; its Free Irrigation Service Act exempted small-scale farmers from paying irrigation service fees. Viet Nam had adopted the Law on Disaster Prevention and Control in 2013 and established the Fund for Disaster Prevention and Control; last year, over 40,000 tons of food had reached people in need, but more global support in tackling climate change impacts was essential. Madagascar was one of the four countries most vulnerable to climate change impact – the South and South West area were particularly affected by the El Niño phenomenon causing drought. The absence of rainfall had devastating consequence for agriculture, leaving 850,000 persons affected by hunger.

Climate change was a unique threat for the survival and health of children, said Togo, and urged States to redouble their efforts to protect children in the context of climate change, and also do their utmost to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Cuba appreciated the work of the two Special Rapporteurs and underscored that Cuba was affected by numerous weather phenomena. It had always put emphasis on the protection of life, and it shared its good practices in disaster risk reduction with other countries. France reminded that environmental damage led to the death of 1.5 million children under the age of five annually, which was why environmental protection was one of its priorities. With regard to the right to food, France stressed the crucial importance of the resilience of the most vulnerable in light of natural disasters and asked how local populations could be better included in drafting sustainable disaster risk management strategies.

China said that protecting the environment was the only way to protect human rights and it was working on an international consensus to tackle climate change; on the national level, China stressed solutions for environmental problems and renewable energy approaches. Food was a vital right of humanity as a whole, stressed China and urged developed countries and the United Nations to help developing countries to improve their food producing capabilities and eliminate hunger. Ethiopia agreed that children were among the most vulnerable to climate change and said that the right to a clean and healthy environment for all was enshrined in its Constitution. Ethiopia strongly believed in the necessity of having international and regional cooperative mechanisms to ensure the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. India stated that relief funding to deal with hunger should be geared towards the development of sustainable food security ecosystems, thereby improving the resilience and effectiveness of the relief effort in times of calamities.

Greece said the fight against the direct effects of the environment on human rights required the implication of not just the State but of the society as a whole. Children were among the most vulnerable to environmental hazards, and this silent pandemic must be countered through the collective engagement on the Paris Agenda and the Agreement on Climate Change. Venezuela agreed that food security should be addressed together with other related problems, including climate change, and that those were the priority issues. Despite the economic war imposed by outside, Venezuela concentrated on fighting poverty, ensuring food security and focusing on rural areas and policies of solidarity abroad. Malaysia felt that the greatest contribution of both reports was that they underscored how disasters and environmental pollution disproportionately affected the most vulnerable in societies, including the elderly, women, people with disabilities and children. Malaysia agreed that promoting best practices in ensuring the right to food during natural disasters required the involvement of many parties well beyond the Human Rights Council.

Iraq said an environment where peace and security prevailed was the main pillar that would enable countries to give more attention to food security. The world could not overlook the impact of climate change, nor the lack of suitable technology for food security. Improving access and public investment in rural development was a way to eradicate poverty, including through private investment in technology. Maldives, as a country most impacted by climate change, was saddened that children were the least responsible for climate change and yet the most vulnerable to it. The Maldives had launched programmes in this regard, including the Voice for the Oceans Programme which raised youth awareness on the protection of the oceans. Iran stressed the role of low-cost solutions such as simple filtration and disinfection of water at the household level, in dramatically reducing the risk of diarrhoea and disease. Iran urged all States to remain committed to ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture globally.

Costa Rica urged States to increase their compliance with their obligations and take measures to protect children from environmental damage. Through his work, the Special Rapporteur had created a doctrine that linked human rights to the environment and it was hoped that the next mandate holder would continue the development of best practices. Georgia was undertaking active measures to implement a legal framework on environmental standards that were in children’s best interest, and was implementing a nationwide project to formalize a comprehensive database of eco-migrants. Peru had adopted a national environmental action plan and policies linking human rights and environment. Peru stressed that the 16 Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment had to be implemented globally. Indonesia referred to the protection of women after the 2004 tsunami in Aceh province mentioned in the report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, and said that in a sudden natural catastrophe of such magnitude, the distribution of food assistance would pose a great challenge everywhere and not only in Aceh.

Remarks by the Special Rapporteurs

JOHN KNOX, Special Rapporteur on the issues of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, in answer to the question on future directions of the mandate, said that the norms were clear enough and it was no longer necessary to devote as much time to clarify them; the primary priority going forward therefore should be the implementation and developing good practices. Two areas deserved attention – the first was the relationship of business practices with environmental effects on human rights, where a more systematic approach to responsibilities of businesses would be of value. The second area that deserved more attention was the discriminatory effects of environmental harm, as it had disproportionate impact on those who were already vulnerable and marginalized. In terms of the biggest gaps and challenges, Mr. Knox singled out the continuing failure to adequately protect environmental human rights defenders, noting with alarm that on average, four were killed every week and countless more suffered violence, harassments and threats. States must do more to protect them and ensure that they were not part of the problem by detaining, for example the human rights defenders who were simply drawing attention to a problem; human rights defenders should be viewed as allies to States and not as enemies.

Asked about the easiest and hardest of his recommendations to implement, the Special Rapporteur said that those varied from one State to another, and said that all States should find it possible to broaden their environmental impact procedures to take into greater account of their impact on children. Some States would find it difficult how to include children in decision-making, and the Special Rapporteur noted the guidance by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on how to include children decision making in various issues that concerned them. This was another example on how sharing good practices in this regard would be beneficial to States. On cross-cutting work between special procedures, the Special Rapporteur noted that environment cut across practically all other mandates, and said that the new initiative called the Environmental Rights Initiative would be announced on 6 March which would provide more opportunities for working together.

HILAL ELVER, Special Rapporteur on the right to food, said that putting in place a more comprehensive and cooperative food assistance system that would ease the effects of disaster affected areas, especially on the vulnerable, was very important. Donor countries often focused on the support during and post-disasters, and generally neglected disaster preparations, even if the investment in preparedness reduced the impact of disasters and sometimes helped avoid it altogether. Disaster preparedness was a very effective way to deal with disasters. There were resources available to aid disaster preparedness, for example the disaster risk assessments by the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization, and others. In this regard, resilience building was extremely important, and consequently, prior infrastructure investment. The world was becoming increasingly urban, said the Special Rapporteur and remarked that the countries had to deal with both rural infrastructure and the rural to urban move.

Rich countries had the resources to rebuild and poor countries did not, remarked Ms. Elver, and stressing the importance of funding, urged the search for new ways of dealing with the funding problem. The human rights-based approach had to be a primary principle of resilience building, she stressed and said that the Special Rapporteurs must work on interpreting the responsibilities of the international community in this regard, especially as it was much vaguer than that of States, and more voluntary than mandatory. A clear guidance from the Human Rights Council had to be made in this respect in order to help initiate such a proposal with the Economic and Social Council, said the Special Rapporteur and concluded by emphasizing the critical role of cooperation, coordination and funding in disaster preparedness.

Interactive Dialogue

Botswana agreed that educational programmes had to be used to help children have a better understanding of the environment. Botswana had suffered from persistent droughts, erratic rainfall, heatwaves and floods which continued to undermine efforts towards the attainment of food security. Bolivia affirmed that the right to food was a collective right, needed for strengthening communities and promoting the principle of food security. The Declaration on the Rights of Peasants would help in protecting the rights of this sector and international companies had to abide by protecting human rights principles. Sudan said it had adopted a law on food security and a Presidential Council had been set up to monitor the implementation. Sudan was being subjected to unilateral coercive measures, which had a significant impact on food security.

Burkina Faso noted that with increasing floods and droughts, greater attention must be paid to enhancing the resilience of the communities which had been affected the most. The national council and the appropriate action plans had been set up in Burkina Faso to address those priorities. Djibouti was faced with El-Nino phenomenon, which, combined with drought, had been leading to the loss of cattle as well as to a rural exodus and the creation of slums in cities. What multilateral instrument could be devised to tackle humanitarian emergencies worldwide, was there an example?

Turkey underlined the importance of the right to food, given a recent radical increase of the number of people affected by hunger. The right to food obliged States to implement protective measures and food security measures. Bangladesh stressed that the hard earned development gains of climate vulnerable countries constrained their capacity to implement human rights obligations. The international community should consider the negotiation of a comprehensive, multilateral treaty to respond to disaster situations in a coordinated and effective manner. Ireland noted that the right to food was a priority for the Irish Government and people, adding that conflict was a major driver of hunger. However, climate change exacerbated crises for the poor, making the recovery harder.

Gabon stated that climate change and natural disaster had a particularly negative impact on the production of food, quality of water, deforestation and disappearance of species. Women and children suffered particularly from those negative impacts. United Nations Environment Programme said it would continue to promote the integration of human rights concerns into environmental decision-making and to raise awareness on the interconnection between human rights, including the rights of the child, and the environment. Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations estimated that losses from natural disasters were at a staggering $ 250 to 300 billion a year. Natural and conflict-related disasters disproportionately affected the rural poor, over 75 per cent of whom derived their livelihood from agriculture.

United Nations Economic Commission for Europe said that enabling individuals, civil society, local communities, children, and other vulnerable groups to exercise their right to information, to participate in decision-making and to access justice remained critical in addressing environmental challenges.

Nepal said it attached high priority to the protection of the environment. The world was an ecosystem which suffered from those who polluted the most. Those had the responsibility to clean the environment. The maintenance of proper balance was crucial. Climate change had a serious bearing on the impact on the enjoyment of the right to food. State of Palestine said the Israeli occupying power continued dumping illegal toxic substances on the Palestinian territories. After 10 years of an Israeli-led blockade of Gaza, a high level of dangerous and toxic metals in the soil had been found, causing serious birth defects, and cancer in children. What measures could be undertaken to hold this occupying power accountable? Jordan, speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, commended all efforts to improve the protection of children from environmental impact, but said more serious steps had to be taken since the most serious environmental problems were cross-border problems. Referring to the right to food, it warned that donor countries must not make use of catastrophes to impose their beliefs on the suffering States. A rights based approach must be followed in this respect. Azerbaijan said the international community had long recognized the rights of children, and the ways in which environmental harm impacted their development. A lot was being done in raising awareness on environmental issues, including at the primary and pre-school education levels.

Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain Inc said in Bahrain, the area around the village of Ma’ameer was known for its large industrial complex in which much of Bahrain’s petroleum refinement was centered, along with a number of large factories that handled petrochemicals, concrete and asphalt. Indian Council of South America said the right to self-determination was directly linked to the right to food. Article 1.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that in no case could a people be deprived of their right to subsistence. In this regard, it was necessary for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food put a chapter on the right to self-determination.

Asian Legal Resource Centre agreed that hunger had killed more people than epidemics and terrorism together. Regrettably, in Asian countries the failure to recognize the right to food as an integral human right, and the lack of adequate policies resulted in striking consequences, particularly in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. Franciscans International, in a joint statement, drew the Council’s attention to the malnutrition in West Papua where hundreds of children under five had died. The Government of Indonesia had taken steps to address the crisis but more comprehensive measures were needed, including the visit of the Special Rapporteur to West Papua. Friends World Committee for Consultation - Quakers said that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was the highest in at least 3 million years. What steps could the Council take to further the global recognition of a right to a healthy environment?

Human Rights Watch, in a joint statement, expressed concern that the Council’s steps thus far were inadequate to fully address what was needed for the protection of human rights. Environmental human rights defenders were killed every week, millions of people were denied clean air and water, and deforestation and biodiversity loss were unabated. Make Mothers Matter welcomed the report’s focus on early childhood and warned that environmental damage in a prenatal period could impair a child’s future development. States were called on to adopt a mother and child based approach to the environment. International Federation Terre des Hommes noted that States had heightened obligations to protect children from environmental harm and should ensure that children’s views were taken into account. Member States were called to implement the recommendations issued by the Special Rapporteur.

Earthjustice joined the call for the recognition of the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, and it expressed concern about the arbitrary detention, repression of freedom of expression and even murder of environmental human rights defenders. Amnesty International said that formal recognition of the right to a healthy and sustainable environment would provide a clearer framework for individuals and communities to defend their environmental rights and seek accountability for any violations. The Council had a central responsibility in promoting global recognition of that right. FIAN International appreciated the emphasis given to the need for reforms of the current food aid regime, and to true human rights-based solutions within the framework of food sovereignty.

Song of Cheetah in Desert noted that the unilateral coercive measures imposed on Iran had seriously affected both the people and the environment, depriving the country from access to green and modern technologies. It called on the Council to urge the Special Procedures to study the negative consequences of the sanctions on Iran’s environment. International Human Rights Association of American Minorities (IHRAAM) drew attention to the plight of those people living under occupation, particularly those living in camps in Kashmir. Natural disasters added to their suffering. The people of Yemen, especially children, suffered from food shortage. What kind of pressure could be asserted so that humanitarian assistance could reach those people? World Barua Organization stressed that the equal distribution of food was the crux of the global problem of hunger and malnutrition. India’s casual approach to the right to food was exemplified by its neglect for the issue of food distribution. Organization for Defending Victims of Violence warned that the construction of an illicit dam in Turkey, on Tigris and Euphrates, which violated United Nations conventions, would cause an environmental disaster. Consequences would be felt not only in Turkey but also in Iraq and Iran, causing tensions across the region.

Concluding Remarks

JOHN KNOX, Special Rapporteur on the issues of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, in response to a question from Palestine, said that the Basel Convention governed transboundary trade, so answer had to be sought there. The human rights law in relation to the environment was at this stage familiar enough, though further acknowledgment was welcomed. In order to further the role of the Council in the promotion of the right to a healthy environment, it was suggested to organize a seminar where countries could share best practices and their experiences. The Council could adopt a resolution on the right to a healthy environment, but the greater value would be if the General Assembly would adopt such a resolution, having in mind its wide membership. When renewing the mandate, it would be good to include that the Special Rapporteur had to report to the General Assembly as well as the Council, providing another avenue for discussion.

HILAL ELVER, Special Rapporteur on the right to food, thanked Bolivia for emphasizing that the right to food was a collective right. The questions of Burkina Faso and Djibouti concerning the comprehensive multilateral instrument were addressed, saying that the human rights approach and the question of responsibility had to be invoked globally, as opposed to the current charity approach. The accountability mechanism was extremely important, keeping in mind that humanitarian assistance was very hard to track, with a plethora of actors on the ground.

Right of Reply

Nepal, speaking in a right of reply, stated that civil society was an important partner in the protection and promotion of human rights. The Government of Nepal consulted and involved non-governmental organizations in that respect, but it was dismayed by a comment made by a civil society organization, which lacked in factual foundation. To fully address the issue of transitional justice, the Government had extended the terms of the National Commission for the Missing Persons to ensure justice and accountability. Nepal did not condone impunity.

Indonesia, speaking in a right of reply, clarified the situation in the regions of Asmat and West Papua with respect to the provision of healthcare and food. Remote areas posed their own challenges. But the Government had taken immediate short-term and medium-term steps to improve the situation, namely it had dispatched rapid flying teams to provide healthcare and food supplies to the affected areas, paying special attention to women and children.

The UWW Freestyle World Cup is just a week away, and one of the world's super wrestling powers will, officially, not be attending.

In an announcement on Friday, USA Wrestling, the national governing body for wrestling in the United States, said it has received confirmation ""from contacts in U.S. Congress that the issues affecting the Russian wrestling team’s participation in the Freestyle World Cup will not be resolved.""

As such, Russia has been ruled out of the World Cup, the second major country that was originally invited to the international dual competition but will ultimately not make the trip — Iran made the decision to not send a team.

In their places will be Mongolia and India, two teams USA Wrestling invited earlier this week in case Russia could not make the trip. The visa process for both Mongolia and India is underway, according to a release from USA Wrestling.

""It is extremely unfortunate that Russia will not be able to compete at the Freestyle World Cup this year,"" USA Wrestling Executive Director Rich Bender said in the release. ""With the reality of this situation, USA Wrestling is pleased that the wrestling federations of Mongolia and India have responded to support the World Cup and are making plans to be here for the event.

""We will have an outstanding competition showcasing international wrestling in Iowa City next weekend, and we are excited to host those nations that will be attending.""

The U.S. edged out Russia for the team title at the 2017 Senior World Championships last August. Kyle Snyder, the United States' representative at 97 kilograms (roughly 213 pounds) defeated Russia's Abdusalim Sadulaev for the world title, giving the U.S. 54 points over Russia's 53 for its first Senior world team title since 1995.

Iran was invited as a replacement for Turkey back in January, and only recently told USA Wrestling that it would not be attending. Iran's backing out means there will be a new World Cup champion, as Iran has won the last six Freestyle World Cups. The United States hasn't won since 2003, but took second in 2017 and 2015.

Earlier this week, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the United States was attempting to bar its freestyle team from competing in the World Cup, which is set for April 7-8 at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City.

The ministry claimed the U.S. did not schedule visa interviews, accused the U.S. of ""direct and open discrimination,"" and called it unfit to hold international competitions.

""We estimate this U.S. move as yet another notorious example of efforts to prevent Russian athletes from participating in international competitions,"" the ministry said in a statement.

""We hope that the world sports movement will pay attention to this crying circumstance. It is clearly no longer possible to hold international competitions in the United States —they are playing unfairly there.""

USA Wrestling responded by stating it had not received information from the Russian Wrestling Federation or the international wrestling federation United World Wrestling that Russia is not attending, yet still maintained ""an expectation and hope that Russia will participate,"" according to a statement.

Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley inquired about the situation, and was answered by the Consular Section of the Embassy of the United States of America in Moscow, Russia.

According to a release, Grassley's office was told: ""Due to the staffing reduction forced on the U.S. Mission in Russia by the Russian Federation, there is very limited appointment availability for visa interviews at this time. In the current situation, the Embassy is not able to provide expedited appointments for sporting events.""



The response also stated that the Russian Wrestling Federation's late visa requests didn't allow the U.S. Embassy time to expedite the process for the team.

Iowa City is the ninth U.S. city to host the World Cup. This will be the 30th time the United States has hosted the international dual competition.

USA Wrestling said it will provide complete updates on the composition of the new delegations, the changes to the competition schedule and other important information as it becomes available.

""There will be outstanding competition showcasing amazing athletes and teams at the World Cup,"" Bender said, ""and we look forward to hosting the world in Iowa City next weekend.""

16,mongolia,"* Benchmark cut to 10 pct from 11 pct; 2nd cut in 3 months

* Inflation within target range, growth the priority

* IMF has forecast growth of 5 pct this year, 6.3 pct in 2019 (Adds quotes, details, background)

ULAANBAATAR, March 23 (Reuters) - Mongolia’s central bank on Friday cut its policy interest rate by one percentage point to 10 percent, the second reduction in three months as it seeks to stimulate an economy recovering from a 2016 financial crisis.

It also reduced the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks to 10.5 percent of tugrik deposits, from 12 percent.

On Dec. 25, the policy key was also cut by one percentage point.

B. Bayardavaa, director of the Bank of Mongolia’s monetary policy department, said that as inflation was below its target level, the central bank had decided to cut the benchmark again.

“Decreasing interest rates will reduce the costs in the banking sector and support the economy,” he said. “Inflation allows us to make this decision.”

In February, the annual inflation rate was 6.9 percent. The target for this year is 8 percent.

“Although inflation is slowly increasing due to the economic recovery and rising demand, the yearly inflation rate is likely to stay at the targeted level,” the central bank said in a statement.

Mongolia has some of the world’s highest interest rates, averaging 19.4 percent in January, according to the central bank. The high rates have reduced economic activity and hurt small businesses, analysts say.

Lawmakers have been trying to impose an interest rate cap on banks amid fears that high rates are holding back growth.

After a 2011-2013 boom, Mongolia’s growth slowed considerably as a result of declining foreign investment and falling commodity prices. This cut 2016 GDP growth to 1 percent and left the country at risk of defaulting on its debts.

A collapse in its tugrik currency in the summer of 2016 forced the central bank to hike the benchmark rate to 15 percent and forced Mongolia to turn to the International Monetary Fund for assistance.

Mongolia agreed to a $5.5 billion economic bailout from the IMF last year as part of its efforts to relieve debt pressures and stabilise the currency.

The IMF said last month Mongolia’s economy is projected to grow 5 percent in 2018 and 6.3 percent next year, helped by foreign coal sales and improved domestic demand.

17,mongolia,"Mongolia's president has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump for more trade between their countries, saying an economic downturn has threatened to destabilise the young Asian democracy sandwiched between China and Russia.

ULAANBAATAR: Mongolia's president has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump for more trade between their countries, saying an economic downturn has threatened to destabilise the young Asian democracy sandwiched between China and Russia.

Mongolia's role as an ""oasis of democracy"" in a region where authoritarianism in on the rise ""does not contribute to economic development"", Mongolian President Khaltmaa Battulga said in a letter to Trump dated March 12 and published on his website.

Battulga said prosperity was coming too slowly.

""Ordinary Mongolian citizens have become discouraged by democracy and have begun to doubt our choice,"" he said.

Mongolia is emerging from an economic crisis after agreeing to a US$5.5 billion (£3.9 billion) economic bailout from the International Monetary Fund last year, which helped stabilise its currency and relieve debt pressures.

A resurgence in the coal trade in the region also helped boost growth to 5.1 percent last year compared with just 1 percent in 2016.

But Mongolia exported just US$8.3 million worth of goods to the United States last year, according to Mongolia's National Statistics Office. Its total exports stood at US$6.2 billion, with the bulk going south to China.

Trade with the United States was less than 2 percent of its total last year, and a U.S. decision to allow imports of Mongolian clothing would help ensure economic stability, Battulga said.

He also called for easier visa conditions for Mongolian citizens.

The United States is one of Mongolia's so-called Third Neighbours, which Mongolia uses to balance relations with heavyweight neighbours China and Russia.

Battulga told Trump that U.S. trade and investment could help prevent Mongolia from moving in a more authoritarian direction.

""I am confident that supporting Mongolia's economic security will play a prominent role in your country's foreign policy,"" he wrote.

18,mongolia,"IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review under the Extended Arrangement for Mongolia and Approves US$ 30.55 Million Disbursement

Mongolia’s economy is recovering better than anticipated with strong economic growth and over-performance on key fiscal and reserves targets.

At the same time, there have been some delays and reversals in structural reforms under the program.

With debt still high and the economy exposed to global commodity developments, it is critical that the authorities maintain their strong commitment to the program.

On March 28, 2018, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third review of Mongolia’s performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Completion of the review enables Mongolia to draw the equivalent of SDR 20.9598 million (about US$ 30.55 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 104.8278 million (about US$ 152.79 million).

Mongolia’s performance under the program thus far has been strong. The economy is recovering better than expected, with real GDP growth of 5.1 percent in 2017 and a significant improvement in the fiscal balance of 15 percentage points of GDP. The combination of strong policy implementation and a supportive external environment has helped the authorities over-perform on all end-December 2017 quantitative targets. However, the performance on structural reforms has been mixed with some delays on structural benchmarks under the program and reversals of three fiscal measures considered during previous reviews.

Mongolia’s three-year extended arrangement was approved on May 24, 2017, in an amount equivalent to SDR 314.5054 million, or about US$434.3 million at the time of approval of the arrangement (see Press Release No. 17/193 ). The government’s Economic Recovery Program, supported by the IMF, aims to stabilize the economy, reduce the fiscal deficit and debt, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, introduce measures to mitigate the boom-bust cycle and promote sustainable and inclusive growth.

Following the Executive Board’s discussion of the review, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said:

“Mongolia’s performance under the Fund-supported program has been favorable. The economy is recovering better than anticipated due to good program implementation, buoyant external demand, and a return of confidence. The fiscal deficit fell sharply due to a substantial pick up in revenues and strict expenditure control, yielding a notable improvement in the public debt outlook. External financing costs continue to fall, with external bonds maturing in 2018 rolled over at lower interest rates, and foreign exchange reserves have recovered further.

“All end-December 2017 quantitative targets under the program have been met. Fiscal and banking sector reforms are proceeding, albeit with some deviations and delays. Fiscal results have been significantly better than expected, with a major reduction in the deficit, supported by expenditure restraint and a strong recovery in mining-related revenues. Official reserves have more than doubled over 2017, reflecting a jump in coal exports, capital inflows, and disbursements under the external financing package from donors and the IMF.

“The authorities are moving ahead with ambitious structural reforms designed to sustain growth over the medium term, promote competitiveness and diversification, and mitigate the boom-bust cycle. In the financial sector, the rehabilitation and strengthening of the banking system is underway, building on the recently completed comprehensive Asset Quality Review and several new laws passed by Parliament. Sustaining the reform momentum in this area will be critical. On the fiscal side, the authorities remain committed to the strengthened path of adjustment, with continuing restraint on spending paired with efforts to sustain the recent strong revenue performance. To this end, building on technical assistance from the IMF, they are particularly focused on improving the quality of tax administration.

“With debt still high and the economy exposed to global commodity developments, it is critical that the authorities maintain their strong commitment to the program. Firm program implementation is needed to sustain the virtuous cycle of recovering growth, improving confidence, rising reserves, falling debt, and strong support from the donor community.”",http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/03/28/pr18113-imf-executive-board-completes-third-review-under-the-extended-arrangement-for-mongolia
19,mongolia,"A new analysis is shedding light on drought in Mongolia, both past and future.

By studying the rings of semifossilized trees, researchers constructed a climate history for the semiarid Asian nation spanning the last 2,060 years — going 1,000 years further back than previous studies.

It was suspected that a harsh drought from about 2000 to 2010 that killed tens of thousands of livestock was unprecedented in the region’s history and primarily the result of human-caused climate change. But the tree ring data show that the dry spell, while rare in its severity, was not outside the realm of natural climate variability, researchers report online March 14 in Science Advances.

“This is a part of the world where we don’t know about the past climate,” says Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. “Having this record is a great resource for trying to understand past droughts in the region.”

In recent years, many studies have sought to unsnarl the role of anthropogenic climate change from natural variability on extreme weather events (SN: 1/20/18, p. 6). Such work is necessary for more accurately predicting future climate trends and helping governments prepare for the most severe scenarios, says study coauthor Amy Hessl, a physical geographer at West Virginia University in Morgantown. This is especially true in countries like Mongolia that lack certain infrastructure, such as enough water reservoirs, to ease the impact of events like prolonged drought.

Hessl and her colleagues studied tree rings in hundreds of samples of Siberian pines, well-preserved by Mongolia’s naturally dry climate. A ring’s width indicates how much the tree grew in a year. In wet years, the rings are wider; in dry years, skinnier.

The recent dry spell was the severest in recorded history. But the rings showed that an even more severe drought took place around the year 800, long before anthropogenic climate change began.

Still, computer simulations suggest that about a third of the recent drought’s severity could have been caused by elevated temperatures linked to climate change, the researchers found. The finding is consistent with studies on how climate change has affected other recent droughts in South Africa and California.

Using computer simulations, Hessl and her colleagues conclude that droughts in coming decades may not be any worse than those seen in Mongolia’s past. The team predicts that as global temperatures rise over the next century, Mongolia will first become drier, then wetter. Increased heat initially will dry out the plains. But at a certain point, hot air holds more moisture, leading to increased precipitation.

Those climate patterns will likely guide how Mongolia develops, Hessl says, because they have in the past. In 2014, she and colleagues published a paper detailing how a 15-year period of unprecedented temperate and rainy conditions in 13th century Mongolia may have led to the rise of Genghis Khan (SN Online: 3/10/14).",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-rings-drought-mongolia-climate-change

The Bank of Mongolia (BoM) is now governed by a new central bank law, implemented as part of a rescue package in the wake of the 2016 economic crisis.

Mongolia’s parliament handed three amended regulations to the BoM on March 21, including the central bank law, a banking law and a deposit insurance law. These were first submitted to the parliament in November 2017.

Amendments on money laundering and terrorist-financing prevention law will be released shortly, the BoM said last month.

21,mongolia,"The IFRC said today that with well over half of Mongolia now facing at least a ‘high risk’ of a third consecutive winter dzud, it’s augmenting its operation for the 2016–17 disaster to support preparedness and capacity building with the Mongolian Red Cross Society (MRCS); this follows “close consultation with the affected population and relevant authorities”.

As part of the international response to the last dzud, the MRCS has distributed humanitarian cash totalling nearly a quarter of a million tugriks, or the equivalent of US$ 100 each to 2,740 households, and distributed first aid and veterinary kits to 1,740 households in 11 severely affected provinces.

The IFRC’s February 2017 emergency appeal was increased last October to more than US$ 850,000 from US$ 655,000, to extend the operation for a further three months.

Risk map

Now the new operational update quotes Mongolian scientists as saying that after an unusually hot and dry summer, there’s a risk of a countrywide ‘black dzud’ – a local term for a very cold winter with little precipitation, water or pasture.

“The lack of precipitation withered pasture land throughout the country,” the update says, “and many herder households were unable to prepare an adequate amount of hay and about 60 per cent of livestock were not able to gain enough fat.”

As of the third quarter of last year, it adds, more than 600,000 animals had died from hunger or disease.

In November the National Agency for Meteorology and Environment Monitoring issued a dzud-risk map for this winter showing 12 provinces or some 40 per cent of the country at ‘extreme risk’ of a dzud and about 20 per cent at ‘high risk’.

The MRCS last month distributed 20 bundles of hay to each of 624 vulnerable households in soums (townships) in parts of Tuv and Uvurkhangai provinces assessed from the government map to be at extreme risk of dzud; among other recent interventions, 55 herder households in nine provinces also got help repairing their winter shelters.

Animal kits

Complementing this effort, with support from the UK government through the British Red Cross, the MRCS has now begun implementing a bilateral forecast-based financing operation developed by the Climate Centre to reduce the dzud risk – the first ever in Mongolia.

Two-thousand households in 40 soums at extreme risk are getting unconditional cash grants (photo) and shortly animal-care kits to help them through the worst of the winter.

The MRCS “is now developing an integrated dzud preparedness and contingency plan in close consultation with the National Emergency Management Agency and herder communities,” the IFRC update says.

The Mongolian government has not formally declared a new dzud this winter or requested international assistance.

In the 2016–17 dzud, all but four of the country’s 21 provinces and some 37,000 herder households dependent on livestock in sparsely populated areas were badly affected, with temperatures dropping as low as minus 50°C.

As many as 1.1 million livestock were lost in the winter of 2015–16, and the dzud of 2009–2010, one of the most severe in history, saw nearly 10 million animals die.

MORNING

5 March 2018

The Human Rights Council this morning concluded its urgent debate on the situation in Eastern Ghouta by adopting a resolution in which it requested the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, upon renewal of its mandate, to urgently conduct a comprehensive and independent inquiry into the recent events in Eastern Ghouta, and to provide an update followed by an interactive dialogue on the situation to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-eighth session.

In the resolution, adopted by a vote of 29 in favour, 4 against and 14 abstentions, as orally revised, the Council welcomed the Security Council Resolution 2401 (2018) which had demanded that all parties to the conflict cease hostilities without delay for at least 30 consecutive days to allow safe, unimpeded, and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance and medical evacuations of the critically sick and wounded. The Council also demanded that all parties, particularly the Syrian authorities allow safe, unimpeded and sustained access by the United Nations, their implementing partners, and humanitarian operators to all people in need, including immediate access for aid deliveries and medical evacuations to and from Eastern Ghouta, and protection of medical and other humanitarian personnel, facilities and transport.

The full text of the resolution is available on this link A/HRC/37/L.1.

The Council started the debate on Eastern Ghouta on Friday 2 March, and the summary of discussions is available here.

The United Kingdom introduced some oral revisions to the text.

Speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote were Venezuela, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, United States, Belgium, Pakistan, Egypt, Peru, Iraq, Tunisia, Australia and Cuba.

Action on Resolution on Eastern Ghouta

In a resolution (A/HRC/37/L.1) on the deteriorating situation of Human rights in Eastern Ghouta, in the Syrian Arab Republic, adopted by a vote of 29 in favour, 4 against and 14 abstentions as orally revised, the Council, having held an urgent debate to discuss the deteriorating situation of human rights in Eastern Ghouta, in the Syrian Arab Republic, which is currently under siege by the Syrian authorities, welcomes Security Council Resolution 2401 (2018) which demands that all parties to the conflict cease hostilities without delay for at least 30 consecutive days to allow safe, unimpeded, and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance and medical evacuations of the critically sick and wounded. The Council demands that all parties, particularly the Syrian authorities allow safe, unimpeded and sustained access by the United Nations, their implementing partners, and humanitarian operators to all people in need, including immediate access for aid deliveries and medical evacuations to and from Eastern Ghouta, and protection of medical and other humanitarian personnel, facilities and transport; and requests the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, upon renewal of its mandate, to urgently conduct a comprehensive and independent inquiry into the recent events in Eastern Ghouta, and to provide an update followed by an interactive dialogue on the situation to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-eighth session.

The results of the vote were as follows:

In favour (29): Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States.

Against (4): Burundi, China, Cuba, Venezuela.

Abstentions (14): Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa.

United Kingdom, introducing a number of oral revisions to the draft resolution, said the revisions had been made during the weekend as a response to the amendments presented to more accurately reflect the situation, and accommodate all parties as well as the Secretary General’s approach to the protection of civilians in Syria.

Action on L.2

Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote on L.2, called upon the Human Rights Council to support and vote in favour of the proposed amendment.

Brazil, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, sought clarification on the text of the orally amended version.

Germany, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that the resolution was about the human rights situation in Eastern Ghouta where the vast majority of people were in dire need of protection. There was going to be another resolution on Syria, which would address also the issue of terrorism. The Human Rights Council must not be distracted from the matter at hand and that was why Germany would vote against the amendment.

Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote said that the inclusion of terrorist attacks in the proposed text would suggest that terrorism was the only reason for the humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta. Highlighting the role of indiscriminate attacks against civilians in the situation in Eastern Ghouta, Mexico said it would vote against the amendment.

United Kingdom, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the overwhelming majority of those suffering in Eastern Ghouta were civilians. The draft resolution proposed at the Security Council was in line with the Security Council resolution 2401. The primary aim of the draft resolution was to protect the people from the primary perpetrators in this conflict, which were the Syrian Government. Hence there was no need for an amendment to the draft resolution. The United Kingdom then requested a vote on the draft amendment and said it would vote against it.

The Council then rejected L.2 by a vote of 10 in favor, 19 against and 17 abstentions.

Action on L3

United States, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, stated that amendment L3 which was put forward by Assad’s Russian backers sought to divert the Council’s attention from the issue at hand. At least 20 daily bombing attacks had been occurring by Russian forces. The draft resolution was a balanced text, condemning all violations of human rights, rendering the amendment completely necessary. The United States urged all States to see the amendment for what it was, a diversion.

United Kingdom, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, requested a vote on L3.

The Council rejected L3 by a vote of 9 in favour, 19 against and 18 abstentions.

Action on L.4

United States, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that the amendment was intended to distract the Council from the horrific realities in Eastern Ghouta. The temporary humanitarian corridor proposed by Russia had been criticized by the humanitarian community, including Jan Egeland, the humanitarian advisor to the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, who said that humanitarian corridors were woefully insufficient to take in aid or evacuate civilians. Reminding the Council of the numerous violations of the rights of civilians by Syria in previous ceasefire agreements, the United States said it would vote against the amendment and urged all other Member States to do the same.

United Kingdom, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, requested a vote on the amendment.

The Council rejected L.4 by a vote of 9 in favour, 20 against and 17 abstained.

Action on L.5

Belgium, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the attacks on the civilians in Eastern Ghouta must stop and the perpetrators must be held accountable. This was the aim of the draft resolution and its drafters had aimed to make clear that the Commission of Inquiry would take forward this work. These were the reasons why Belgium would vote against the amendment and called upon others to vote against it.

United Kingdom, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, requested a vote on L.5. The Council then rejected L.2 by a vote of 4 in favor, 23 against and 19 abstentions.

Action on L1 as Orally Revised

Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that the draft resolution could be more balanced concerning the responsibilities of all parties. Still, Mexico would vote in favour, but the gap remained that the draft resolution did not appeal to all States to stop the transfer of weapons to all parties to the conflict which would reduce hostilities and further deterioration of the situation. Moral responsibility to prevent the sale of weapon was necessary.

Pakistan, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, shared the concern on the ongoing mass human rights violations in Syria. The Security Council adopted resolution 2401 as a step towards a collective action and the Council should allow for the resolution to take its due course. The Human Rights Council’s resolution would only politicize the situation further. Seeing how the draft resolution was politicized, Pakistan was forced to abstain from the resolution. If this resolution could save one life Pakistan would vote yes, but when lives became political football it lost its purpose.

Egypt, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, expressed dissatisfaction with how the draft resolution process had been managed. The same topic would be discussed under item 4 in few days, and the resolution on Syria could been issued under item 4. Egypt entered the discussion on the draft resolution, but believed that all delegations had needed more time to consult with their capitals before the adoption. A draft resolution which was more balanced and less politicized would have been more welcome. This draft resolution was not objective and did not name all the perpetrators so Egypt would refrain from voting.

Peru, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, echoed all those in the room who had unanimously expressed serious concern about the humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta. The irrational use of force had resulted in irreparable loss and enormous damage. This situation was a most serious attack on the most basic human rights, and humanitarian international law. An urgent implementation without delay was needed of the Security Council resolution 2401. Peru called upon the Government of Syria to allow humanitarian access to relieve the suffering. The Human Rights Council could not remain impassive to the horror that was happening. Therefore, Peru would support the draft resolution. Peru also asked all parties to stop providing arms and weapons to all parties to the conflict, which spiraled the violence.

Iraq, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, remained gravely concerned about the situation in Eastern Ghouta, which took into account the consequences of terrorism. The price was being paid by the people in Syria and in the region as a whole. The world could not ignore what was happening in Eastern Ghouta. However, the method under which this draft resolution had been led was not the proper way to deal with the situation in Syria. The non-observation of procedural rules had not allowed the delegations to consult their capitals. Despite this, Iraq had submitted observations and would have wanted more of a response from the State sponsoring the draft resolution. Iraq nevertheless said the situation in Eastern Ghouta had great implications for the region and this was why it supported the draft resolution.

Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it would vote against draft resolution L.1 as orally revised. A group of countries had submitted and supported a set of amendments with the aim of striking a balance to draft resolution L.1, in order to remove it from politization and double standards. Unfortunately, the amendments had not been heeded. Venezuela had continuously spoken against the double standards and politicization of the Human Rights Council which did not promote the rights of the victims of violations. It condemned the destabilization policy in Syria. Syria called upon the Council to genuinely help the achievement of an end to the conflict and lasting peace through dialogue among all communities, and the respect of the sovereignty of Syria. For this reason, Venezuela would vote against the draft resolution and called upon all to do the same.

Tunisia, said in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that the humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta has reached unprecedented levels of seriousness and deterioration. All parties in Syria were called upon to seek a political solution and stop targeting civilians as per international humanitarian law. The international community must combat all forms of terrorism in Syria, and put an end to the bloodshed and the suffering of the brotherly Syrian people. The oral revisions to the resolution should be interpreted as a continuation of the resolution 2401 adopted by the Security Council, and that was why Tunisia would vote in favour.

Australia, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that the situation in Eastern Ghouta was dire and it required action. The Council must not remain silent and must clearly and collectively call for accountability. The Human Rights Council must pass a resolution which complemented what the Security Council had done, and Australia would vote in favour.

Cuba, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, requested a vote on L.1 as orally revised and said it would vote against it.

China, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, supported the proposal by Cuba.

The Council adopted resolution L.1 as orally revised by a vote of 29 in favour, 4 against and 14 abstentions.

France, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, welcomed the adoption of the draft resolution. The violations by the Syrian regime were continuing in an appalling fashion. France requested the backers of the Syrian regime to exercise maximum pressure on it so that it heeded its obligations. Some of the crimes committed constituted war crimes and France would not tolerate impunity.

Russia, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said it had commented on the situation in Eastern Ghouta and the background information on Syria in general terms. The media atmosphere was saturated with lies. Part of this information came to the Human Rights Council and was replicated here. As a result, the Council saw debates and votes which were entirely removed from the actual situation on the ground. Russia informed the Council that according to data on the ground, an agreement had been reached, by which militants entrenched in Eastern Ghouta would allow civilians to cross over in order to reach humanitarian aid. A convoy of hundreds of thousands of tons of aid supplies was waiting at the checkpoint. At the same time, many States had rejected a call to militants to allow the civilian population to leave. Clearly these States wished to assist this kind of trend which was hardly consistent with elementary norm ethics, and was hardly compliant with humanitarian principles. Russia had seen the vote and had drawn its conclusions.

Syria, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said once again some countries were adopting through the Human Rights Council resolutions that had nothing to do with human rights. Unfortunately, today, the adoption of a resolution under the pretext of human rights had been achieved with subjective and politicized aims. The amendments to this resolution dealt with the situation in real terms because they condemned terrorism and the indiscriminate shelling of neighbourhoods. The pretext to reject Russian amendments was baseless and indicated that the arguments against the amendments had nothing to do with human rights. They were selective and highly politicized arguments. Last week Syria had approved the entrance of humanitarian convoys into Eastern Ghouta, including 46 trucks and a mobile clinic. However, the present resolution would send a negative message to militants which may stop humanitarian access into Eastern Ghouta.

24,mongolia,"To Fight Pollution, He's Reinventing The Mongolian Tent

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katya Cengel for NPR Katya Cengel for NPR

It takes the taxi driver three tries to find the neighborhood and at least another three wrong turns on narrow unpaved roads before he locates the company's front gate. Each time he gets turned around the driver reaches for a cell phone. On the other end of the line Odgerel Gamsukh directs the driver to Gamsukh's garage door business. Neither man seems bothered by the multiple interruptions and resulting delay. Mongolians are used to it taking a little extra time to get around, especially in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar.

If street addresses mean little in the city center, where residents commonly give directions based on landmarks instead of street names, they mean even less in the surrounding ger areas, named for the circular felt tents in which many residents live. In these neighborhoods, the route that takes you from one place to another is sometimes a grass-covered hill. That is because the government has yet to catch up with the city's rapid growth. Sixty years ago only 14 percent of Mongolia's population lived in the capital of Ulaanbaatar, the country's largest city. Today it is approximately 45 percent, more than one million people. The majority of them, 60 percent, live in ger areas that often lack basic services such as sewer systems, running water and trash collection. The coal that area residents burn to warm their homes is the main cause of winter air pollution that now rivals Beijing's.

It is out of this unplanned and polluted sprawl that Gamsukh is determined to create a green community. If that sounds difficult, his next goal – honoring Mongolia's nomadic past while at the same time creating a sedentary community – seems almost impossible. Yet that hasn't stopped the 34-year-old power plant manager turned architect, just like he didn't let the frozen ground stop him from attempting to install underground pipes last winter.

It did slow him down, just as a lack of funding slowed construction of his company's environmentally friendly office and warehouse. It is Gamsukh's doggedness that others working in the ger areas admire, including Badruun Gardi, whose non-profit social enterprise, GerHub, is also focused on making individual gers and ger neighborhoods more eco-friendly.

Gardi is not an engineer or an architect or even an entrepreneur like Gamsukh. He studied cultural psychology. Like Gamsukh, he is in his 30s and is working in the same district, Songino Khairkhan. He was drawn to the ger areas because of the extreme pollution and a need for a solution. Gamsukh grew up in the ger area where he built the company office and remembers how empty it used to be, a natural playground where he could catch grasshoppers. In time more and more immigrants came, each claiming a little more of the land for their families until the open area was divided into small plots of land marked by large fences. Under Mongolian law, every Mongolian is entitled to a free plot of land, making it hard for the government to control growth.

Blame The Mountains, The Valley — And Coal

In December 2016, Ulaanbaatar experienced pollution levels five times higher than in Beijing, sparking a public outcry. Despite a new national program aimed at reducing air pollution, the situation has not markedly improved. Heavy coal burning combined with unfortunate geography – a valley surrounded by mountains – have helped the city become one of the world's most heavily polluted. According to a 2011 study published in Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health by Ryan Allen, an assistant environmental health professor with Canada's Simon Fraser University, one in ten deaths in the capital can be attributed to air pollution.

Those most affected are children whose immune systems and lungs are not fully developed. Fine particulate matter — PM 2.5 — increases the risk of respiratory infection in children. In Ulaanbaatar PM 2.5 is usually six to seven times the World Health Organization allowance, but can be as much as 25 times higher. One of the leading causes of death for children under 5 here is acute lower respiratory infection, accounting for 15 percent of under 5 childhood mortality cases under age 5.

On January 30, PM 2.5 levels of 3,320 micrograms per cubic meter were reported in the capital, 133 times above WHO recommendations, according to UNICEF Mongolia. A joint report by UNICEF and the Mongolian National Center for Public Health titled ""Mongolia's air pollution crisis: A call to action to protect children's health"" warns that the financial cost of treating air pollution related diseases in children will increase by 33 percent by 2025 if levels do not decrease.

Gardi has a stepson and worries about the future for him and his two young nieces. ""It's so heartbreaking to see"" the physical effects of air pollution on children, he says. ""So I think everyone has to be trying to do something.""

""He's also kind of trying to inspire people,"" says Gardi. ""To show what the possibilities are.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katya Cengel for NPR Katya Cengel for NPR

In Gamsukh's office those possibilities seem endless. Books, papers and sketches cover a desk and table. Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, Gamsukh, whose dark hair has a slight orange tint, comes off as artistic. But the sketches he produces are not dreamy musings. They are technical drawings supported by mathematical calculations. They are solid, like the sturdily built Gamsukh. Many are already being implemented, including a partially completed passive solar heated immobile ger that adds windows, insulation and solar collectors to the traditional model. Passive solar heating design uses windows, walls and floors to collect, store and distribute heat in the winter and reject it in the summer. Designs vary depending on the climate in which they are built, but shade can be used to block the sun in summer without taking away from warmth in winter because the sun is higher in summer.

When it is finished, Gamsukh plans to call it home. He is also testing another modified ger that uses solar power and those underground pipes he tried to dig in winter for heat.

The only project he has not yet attempted to take beyond the drawing board stage is the neighborhood kindergarten. Like other government-provided services, schools are in short supply in ger areas. The design itself is modeled after his company office — his first experiment in sustainable architecture. His inspiration was Earthship, a passive solar house first constructed in New Mexico in the 1970s made of natural and upcycled materials by pioneering architect Michael Reynolds. Gamsukh thought the model would work well in ger areas because it didn't require a lot of infrastructure or outside building materials.

""You can just build wherever you are, like the earth you're sitting on,"" says Gamsukh.

Old Tires Aren't Cheap — But Dirt Is

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katya Cengel for NPR Katya Cengel for NPR

And that is pretty much what he did when he began constructing his office in 2013. Of course, his Mongolian model had a few alterations. Old tires, the material used for exterior walls in original models, are not cheap in Mongolia, so he went with something that was — dirt. Gamsukh points to the inside wall of the office's main room, it is held up by bags of dirt. He moves into the kitchen, pointing out how the ceiling is supported by scaffolding salvaged from a construction site. The strawberries in the sink come from the indoor garden warmed by the south-facing wall made entirely from sheets of salvaged glass.

Because Gamsukh had limited funds — the entire project cost five million Tugriks or about $2,000 – he wasn't able to include as much insulation as he would have liked. As a result the structure is only 70 percent effective at heating itself, which is not enough in an Ulaanbaatar winter when temperatures can fall to 20 below zero Fahrenheit. Gamsukh built a rocket stove, an efficient stove made from found materials that sucks smoke or soot into a burn tunnel where they combust instead of being blown out as they would in a normal fire to make up the difference. He claims the stove is so efficient at burning coal that the end product is not black smoke but a white vapor. Like everything else, he learned about it in a book and through YouTube videos. That is because in Mongolia both the problem, air pollution, and the solution, green building, are relatively new. Although traditional Mongolian culture involved a close relationship with nature, modernization has changed that, says Tungalag Ulambayar, adviser to the Minister of Environment and Tourism.

When nomadic people moved to towns they didn't question whether the ger, perfect for the uncertainty of the Mongolian plateau, would be suitable for urban areas.

""People think, that's our home so we can just bring it, settle in,"" says Ulambayar.

A 21st-Century Ger

Portable, lightweight, cool in the summer and easily warmed in the winter by burning animal dung, gers are the perfect housing for nomadic herders, explains Gardi of GerHub. In the city though, they become ""one of the worst kinds of housing"" options. Without access to livestock and their dung, ger inhabitants rely on coal for heating. It is the same fuel they use to heat the simple wood homes that some build to replace their gers. Because Mongolians lack experience building houses, the buildings are poorly insulated and often lack basic infrastructure, says Gardi.

Instead of starting from scratch, Gardi and his team at GerHub struck on the idea of building off what almost every Mongolian already has, a ger. They plan to slowly make them more efficient by plugging each into an assembly that has a lot of the infrastructure that's missing in the ger district such as a toilet system with gray water recycling, a shower with its own tank and electric heating through a radiator and under floor heating system. Many ger residents can access electricity thanks to a government program that offers free electricity at night to ger area residents in an effort to encourage them to use electricity instead of coal. The plug-in is incremental and affordable, and residents can customize, choosing the features they want ""almost like a Lego,"" says Gardi. Over time he expects owners to remove the ger and use the plug-in as the foundation on which they build a house.

Working with Rural Urban Framework at the University of Hong Kong and other partners, GerHub completed a plug-in prototype in the summer of 2017. The cost, $14,000, is too high in a country where the average annual income was $3,550 in 2016, according to the World Bank. Gardi wants to get it down to $8,000, about what he has seen people pay to build simple wood homes in ger areas. GerHub will not be building dozens of plug-ins, instead they want to use the plug-ins to inspire other individuals and groups to continue to experiment with the model and improve on it.

""We're showing the possibilities,"" says Gardi.

Those possibilities don't end with the plug-in. GerHub is also looking at smaller more affordable fixes like a $20 polycarbonate sheet that can temporarily seal the opening in the top of a ger. The clear seal will allow light in but also keep cold out. Gardi is testing the invention this winter. Even if it fails, Gardi will consider it a success of sorts.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katya Cengel for NPR Katya Cengel for NPR

""I think people just have to try things out,"" he says. ""So for GerHub, what we do at any given time, we want to have say ten projects going in tandem all with different partners. And nine of them may completely fail."" If one project is successful, that is enough for Gardi.

Everybody's Coming To Ulaanbaatar

Gamsukh's company foreman, Chingis, is incorporating a number of heat-saving techniques into the wood home he is building in Songino Khairkhan, including thick insulation and south facing windows. Chingis believes anything that helps reduce the amount of coal burned in winter is worth the effort. Although more coal is burned in the ger areas than in other areas of the city, he still prefers living here.

""I want to build something with my hands. My wife wants to grow vegetables,"" he explains. ""In city center you can't do that.""

Gamsukh also sees the freedom and possibility but recognizes that most outsiders view ger areas in a different light.

""Foreign visitors talk about ger district (area) like a ghetto,"" he says.

That isn't what Gamsukh sees. He sees young men, former nomads like Chingis, who moved to Ulaanbaatar after high school in search of a better future. People filled with energy who understand the danger air pollution poses and want to do something to change the way they live.

Climate change is one reason cited for the migration. In recent years, Mongolia's rate of average temperature increase has been three times higher than the global rate. This dramatic change in temperature has been blamed for an increase in the number of dzuds, extremely cold winters following dry summers that result in the death of a large number of livestock. The dzuds in turn have been cited as one of the driving forces of migration to Ulaanbaatar. The government has tried to prohibit migration to the capital.

Experts like Ulanbayar, with the Ministry of the Environment, believe migration is influenced by a number of factors such as family, education and a general trend toward urbanization. In Ulaanbaatar this urbanization results in ger areas. Although they are often called ger districts, they are in fact neighborhoods or khorros within the city's nine districts, explains Enkhtungalag ""Tunga"" of the non-government Ger Community Mapping Center.

""It's not informal settlement,"" says Tunga. ""It's just unplanned settlement.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katya Cengel for NPR Katya Cengel for NPR

While she hopes the government will eventually service the ger areas, Tunga believes the best solution in the meantime is for residents to be proactive in improving their own living situations. It is the people living in the ger areas after all who know the problems and possible solutions best, she says. People like Ulzii Togtoh who turned a trash-filled crater in the 12th Khorro in Chingeltei District into a scenic lake where people can boat in summer and ice skate in winter.

""Life in the ger area is hard. Starting from the soil there is not much greenery in the ger area,"" says Togtoh.

He wanted a place where children could play in the outdoors so he leased the land from the government and invested his own money in cleaning it and building a lake house for the community. Solutions like this are not something the government is in a position to provide at present, says Tunga.

""You can't really simply expect the government, who's already in a lot of debt, to be providing infrastructure to ger areas,"" she says.

A Shortage Of Kindergartens

Ganbat Badamtsetseg is governor of the 31st Khorro in Songino Khairkhan District where Gamsukh is working. The khorro was founded in 2011 and still doesn't have a paved road, sewage system, running water or adequate schools. There are 2,000 kindergarten-age children and just one kindergarten originally designed for 50 children, says Badamtsetseg. Her annual budget is whatever she can talk the government into providing. This year she asked for about $8,433,000 to pave a road and build a school and kindergarten.

She received about $8,500. Unlike in the khorro where she last worked, which was composed of apartments and not gers, there are no large businesses in the ger area to help fund improvements. There is also no space. Badamtsetseg unfurls a large map of her khorro pointing out where her 13,000 residents live and the lack of empty space.

""The problem with building a kindergarten and school is the public land,"" Badamtceceg says. ""There is no land to build it on.""

Like Tunga, her hope for change lies with local residents, people like Gamsukh.

""Right now, since we can't build a big apartment here and put everyone in it, this passive solar building is our best way to reduce the pollution and give more comfort,"" she says.

She credits Gamsukh with being the first person to unite and organize people toward green and sustainable building to reduce air pollution in the 31st Khorro. For the last half decade he has come to almost every khorro meeting to talk about green building. Now, she believes, people are listening. This year ten 31st Khorro families won a government-funding competition for their proposal for an electrical heating system and another 38 families are applying for non-governmental funding for central heating.

In addition to the groups Badamtsetseg mentions, Gamsukh has established his own neighborhood association. He counts several hundred members, 34 of whom pay dues. One of them is a 43- year-old metal worker who goes by the nickname Bilge. When he first moved to the capital, Bilge stood on the side of the road with a sponge and bucket and washed cars. His home was an empty ger. Now he lives in a wooden house, which includes an adjacent metal working workshop. Having his home and business in the same location is one advantage of the ger area, but Bilge wants to see more resources in the 31st Khorro like internet and banks.

""I'm tired of waiting for the government to take action,"" says Bilge. ""It's like empowerment, we can make change.""

Like Gamsukh, Bilge is a self-starter. When he wanted to incorporate some of the traditional Mongolian culture into his modern life he found someone to teach him archery and someone else to instruct him in throat singing. He has been known to interrupt conversations to demonstrate his skills in the guttural style of singing.

""As Mongolians we have a lot of great traditions, but under communism it was separated,"" says Gamsukh, who is also learning throat singing. ""Now our generation is trying to figure out our traditions.""

That is why even though Chingis will soon have a new efficiently heated wood house he will still keep his ger, ensuring the ger areas maintain their name and cultural history without the pollution. Chingis plans to use his ger as a guesthouse and summer play area for his kids so he doesn't have to ""just lay it down"".

""Me and my wife grew up in a ger,"" says Chingis. ""We want to keep the tradition alive to pass to our children.""

25,mongolia,"By Erik Jay Weber |

WEST LONG BRANCH – The Jersey Shore is going to Mongolia.

Students in the Monmouth University Peace Corps Volunteer Prep Program (PCVPP) have put together a care package of local “artifacts” they hope will give school children in Mongolia a sense of how people live and play here.

The package will be sent to the children through the daughter of Monmouth University professor Frank D. Cipriani, director of the PCVPP, who is currently teaching in Mongolia through with the Peace Corps.

Mongolia is “pretty much as far from an ocean as you can get,” said Cipriani, who visited his daughter, Emma, over Thanksgiving last year. “The concept is so alien, of any sort of shore, or shell, or putting a shell to your ear and listening to the ocean,” he said. Emma’s students already liked some of the concepts they were introduced to from American culture, Cipriani said, but she wanted to show the children how different parts of the United States are from each other.

“My daughter is seen as an American,” said Cipriani, which he feels foreigners often equate to “Hollywood” because that’s what they see. “We wanted to show that there’s this little tiny place of Mongolia that’s maybe different from the rest of Mongolia, and there’s this little tiny place of the United States that’s the Jersey Shore,” he said.

The resulting collection is a “mosaic that could only be the Jersey Shore,” Cipriani said, noting that shells from the beach, salt water taffy and sports items all made it into the package. “You can’t send a bagel. You can’t really send a pork roll,” Cipriani noted about two iconic Jersey Shore foods, but they made sure to include “things that people at a school in Mongolia, kids would want to play with or want to touch.”

Mayo Paco, a sophomore serving as ambassador for the university prep program and enrolled in communications and environmental studies, was excited the Mongolian students will now “have some kind of way to see that there’s a different culture, like totally odd and different from what they’re used to.”

“I think it’s going to be amazing,” said Paco. “We skateboard. I don’t know if they skateboard. I kind of want them to send something back so we can see what they do.”

The Jersey Shore artifacts were on display recently during a Peace Corps Film Festival held in Wilson Hall on Monmouth University’s campus, and included a Jersey Devils hockey stick and puck, a New York Giants football, a horseshoe crab shell, a skateboard with photos of the Forth Union Asbury Park skate spot in the carousel building, postcards, shells, an empty box of Taylor Pork Roll (Taylor Ham) with photos of how the product is eaten, a Wiffle Ball and bat, flip-flops and more. All items will be sent with note cards written by participating PCVPP students to help the Mongolian students understand their use and importance to Jersey Shore residents.

The Monmouth University Peace Corps Volunteer Prep Program operates under a formal agreement between the university and the Peace Corps and is the only such program at any university in New Jersey. It was established in 2016 by Nancy J. Mezey, a returned Peace Corps volunteer who served in Mali, West Africa. The PCVPP at Monmouth is one of over 60 others nationwide that certifies students for the federal service program.

Cipriani said students who join the PCVPP don’t have to enter the Peace Corps, adding that acceptance to the federal service program is competitive and not guaranteed. But most of the general education classes – particularly health and education – are included in the certification, which gives Monmouth students interested in the federal program “a huge leg up,” according to Cipriani.

Monmouth University program participants serve the shore area, from working in local prisons, to helping children in need, to planting trees and engaging in positive agricultural and environmental projects that can benefit other aspects of their chosen majors.

One student in the program is interested in marine studies, said Cipriani, and connected with the American Littoral Society through a seal-watching event last weekend. “The Littoral Society said, ‘Hey, we need somebody to film our fish tagging, so people know how to fish tag,’ ” explained Cipriani, which will give her course credit at the university.
