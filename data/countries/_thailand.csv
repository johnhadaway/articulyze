0,thailand,"It’s time for Thailand to take up a leading role in helping ease the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Failure to do so now would only exacerbate an already grievous problem afflicting the Kingdom and the entire region. Nearly a million refugees from Rakhine, including 700,000 fleeing violence at home since August last year, are now being sheltered in Bangladesh. The number is growing, as people keep moving out of the strife-torn state due to violence that has reportedly been non-stop.

The situation will not easily be resolved. Local authorities are complicit in the violence against the Rohingya, and Rohingya militant groups have taken provocative action of their own. Both sides are begging for further repercussions.

The exodus since last August is just the tip of the iceberg. The United Nations’ rights agency and the global Rohingya diaspora have accused the Myanmar government and military – the Tatmadaw – of wilful ethnic cleansing in Rakhine. The UN agency has urged the Security Council to investigate possible genocide following a series of reported atrocities.

Nevertheless, it would be difficult to bring such a case before an international tribunal due to the diverse stances adopted by the parties involved. As well, international opinion is divided on how best to deal with the crisis. Several countries have strongly criticised the Myanmar authorities, singling out de facto head of state Aung San Suu Kyi, for mishandling the situation. Others though – notably the Association of Southeast Asians, of which Myanmar is a member – have insisted on quiet assistance to the government to cope with, rather than solve, the problem.

While Asean has been repeatedly urged to play a more significant role in resolving the crisis, its member-states are disunited in their assessments of what’s happening and it has refrained from addressing the causes at their root. Malaysia and Indonesia have pressed for action, but others want to stay clear. That leaves Asean incapable of doing any more than dispatching humanitarian assistance to Rakhine. Given its close proximity, Thailand should be stepping into the breach and assuming the leadership in guiding the region’s hand.

Thailand badly needs to speak out about the Rohingya issue, if not out of compassion, then because it could become a problem for the country if more refugees begin coming here in a bid to escape the terrible conditions of the Bangladesh border camps. Tight controls on our own frontier and harsh treatment imposed on trafficking syndicates have lately kept the flow of refugees to a minimum, but those restrictions could ease. Without an effective solution soon, it is highly possible that the Rohingya could resume their southward and eastward flights.

Thailand’s military regime has little or no credibility to defend democracy and human rights, but it could exploit its good relations with the Tatmadaw for the sake of humanitarianism. It is important to note that the assistance Thailand and other countries have sent to Rakhine is patchy and inadequate.

By Asean protocol, Thailand can do little at the moment as a member of the bloc, which Singapore currently chairs, but it could take an important individual role in serving as a bridge connecting Myanmar, the rest of Asean and the international community. Our generals, including Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, might be preoccupied by domestic affairs, but our diplomats in the Foreign Ministry are keen to take the initiative if there is the political will to support them.",http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30341819
1,thailand,"In the tumultuous months after protests and riots wracked Jakarta, bringing down Indonesian president Haji Muhammad Suharto in May 1998, a British political consultancy arrived on the scene.

SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA), says it came to southeast Asia’s most populous nation at the behest of “pro-democratic groups” to “assist with a national campaign of political reform and democratization.” The country was still reeling from the Asian economic crisis that started in 1997 and the exit of a leader who had held on to power for three decades. The British firm’s assignment eventually included surveying thousands of Indonesians, managing communications for politicians and, most curiously, organizing large rallies at universities to help students “let off steam,” according to company documents accessed by Quartz.

The documents, issued around 2013, also highlight SCL’s role in nearby countries. In Thailand, the company claims to have spent nine months surveying voters before staging an intervention on behalf of multiple political parties.

SCL later morphed into CA, which allegedly used the data of some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Its purported ability to affect large numbers of people seems to have been tested and honed a decade and a half earlier, in the political upheaval of southeast Asia. The documents provide a more detailed—if one-sided—insight into the workings of SCL beyond what former employees like Christopher Wylie have described in interviews and testimonies. In total, SCL claims to have worked on more than 100 election campaigns across 32 countries.

After Suharto’s fall

Amid the violence that marked the aftermath of Suharto’s 1998 resignation, SCL was tasked with managing growing frustration with the new administration of president BJ Habibie. To better understand the sentiment of Indonesia’s 220 million people, spread across 33 provinces, the company rolled out a countrywide survey that had 72,000 respondents. The documents outline the findings:

It was clear from the research that it was the younger “university” age-group that were the principle instigators of the unrest and conversely the older generation were weary of insubordination having been suppressed for so long that they had come to tacitly accept their lot in life. Consequently, it was decided to focus on the 18-25 M/F (male/female) segment of the population and to redirect their frustration away from civil unrest.

SCL then focused its research around secondary schools and local universities, and discovered that the rise in insubordination was partly triggered by the increased presence of police and military troops on the streets. Eventually, it decided to sponsor “organized avenues of protests” to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations. This was apparently done with the cooperation of the Indonesian government, which initially had some misgivings about such large gatherings.

“Large rallies were organised at each university. This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country,” the SCL documents said. “The events were so large that there was a general feeling amongst students that their voice really had been heard.”

SCL claims its methods worked, dramatically reducing civil unrest, convincing Habibie to step down, and leading to elections that brought Abdurrahman Wahid to power in 1999.

The documents don’t specify who SCL initially worked for in Indonesia, but they indicate that the company managed the election campaign of Wahid’s National Awakening Party. There is, in fact, a one-line testimony from Wahid: “I am indebted to SCL for their strategic management of my election success.”

However, there are doubts about the effectiveness of SCL’s work. President Wahid, for instance, was impeached in 2001 after presiding over a chaotic administration that failed to stabilise the country. All of SCL’s efforts—including reportedly setting up a slick operations centre with 25 computers and 16 flat-screen monitors—evidently did little to help Wahid’s situation.

Indonesia experts also question if SCL could have made much of a difference in tamping down violence. “I think this is an exaggeration,” said Ian Wilson, a lecturer at Australia’s Murdoch University. “It would have been, at most, one small element among all that were taking place at the time.

“The forces and interests at play and jostling for influence were simply on too big a scale to have been influenced significantly in such a way. The protest also had been going on for months, if not years, at different levels of scale and intensity,” Wilson added.

Before Thaksin’s coming

In Thailand, too, SCL claims to have set up a large operation that went on for months.

The documents don’t provide exact timelines, but the company appears to have got started sometime before the 2001 elections that swept telecom billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra into power. In this case, SCL’s mandate was to ascertain the scale of vote-buying behavior—a longstanding issue in the southeast Asian country—that had inflated the cost of running an election campaign to around $1 billion, according to the company’s estimates.

“The research showed that the vote buying practice had become so endemic that an entire industry of dealers had emerged to broker the voter groups and funders,” the documents said. “It was quite commonplace for voters to sell their votes twice—and then not vote at all!”

As in Indonesia, SCL set up a research project to collate data from all 79 constituencies, using a staff of more than 1,200 that worked over nine months. The objective was to assess the underlying motivation of voters and identify how open a particular constituency was to accepting a change in vote-buying behavior.

In 50% of the constituencies assessed, the research found, vote-buying did not impact the electoral result, a finding that SCL claims was worth $250 million alone. However, the company identified 91 constituencies where money did matter. “In these constituencies a more direct behavioural intervention was required which consisted of a full-spectrum approach (FSA) combining social pressure, economic penalties, legal framework and enhanced monitoring,” the documents suggested.

Apparently, with “the cooperation of most of the major political parties,” SCL implemented a six-month intervention. The result: Shinawatra, one of Thailand’s richest men, won the 2001 polls. SCL also insists that vote-buying dropped by 31%, a result it pegs at around $420 million in value.

Chuan Leekpai, former leader of Thailand’s Democrat Party who served as prime minister twice, wrote a glowing review of SCL’s services. “Winning an election is about choosing your battles carefully. SCL made clear those conflicts that could be won, those that could not, and those that had to be hard fought for,” said Leekpai, according to the documents.

It is entirely plausible that international political consultancies like SCL may have been engaged by Thailand’s major political parties. “There’s no doubt that some Thai political parties have commissioned international consultants to work on improving their electability, and this was certainly the case for Thaksin’s Thai Rak Thai Party in 2001,” said Duncan McCargo, a Thailand expert and professor at the University of Leeds. “Thai political parties want to win elections and some of them brought in whatever expertise they could to advise them.”

However, there is some skepticism about the possibility of multiple parties supporting a project to stop vote-buying, as the SCL documents suggest. “Vote-buying has been a widespread issue of concern in Thailand and was the basis of considerable public interest/moral panic in the 1980s and 1990s… the 1997 constitution included various provisions designed to combat and reduce vote-buying,” McCargo explained. “There was broad popular support for these changes, though I can’t say that translates to ‘cross-party’ support.”

2,thailand,"Authors: John Blaxland and Greg Raymond, ANU

ASEAN member states have different perspectives on the significance of the grouping. As one of the founder member states, the second largest economy and a leading state within ASEAN, Thailand’s view is important. A survey of 1800 former and current Thai officials conducted from 2014–17 on Thailand’s relationship with great powers demonstrates that despite Bangkok’s reputation for hard realism in its foreign policy, ASEAN surprisingly seems to matter a great deal to Thailand in terms of regional security and prosperity.

Respondents considered ASEAN to be very important in terms of regional prosperity, with 72.3 per cent rating it eight or higher (very important) out of ten on the Likert scale. In terms of ASEAN’s importance to security and stability, the rating was not as high but still significant, with 67.36 per cent rating it eight or higher.

Positioned centrally among the mainland Southeast Asian states and with relatively advanced infrastructure, Thailand benefits from closer integration with its Southeast Asian neighbours. That benefit is shared across the region as the reach of transport and infrastructure projects increases.

Not surprisingly, Thai respondents saw the advent of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 as a positive development. Intra-ASEAN trade is now bigger than trade with any single external partner. In Thailand’s case, exports to ASEAN are bigger than exports to China, the United States, Japan or the European Union. As ASEAN’s share of world gross domestic product continues to increase, this market of more than 640 million will offer opportunity to reduce reliance on external powers.

Security is a more complicated question. While the creation of ASEAN was never ostensibly about any form of mutual security pact, its formation always had a security dimension that was internal to ASEAN rather than external. After the US withdrawal from Vietnam and the consolidation of communist regimes in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand decided to prioritise relations with its neighbours. For Thai policymakers, ASEAN has remained integral to Thailand’s security and is perceived as almost an article of faith.

Yet this faith is not blind and Thai respondents frequently pointed out ASEAN’s shortcomings. There is no expectation that ASEAN will present a unified front to the world in political or foreign policy terms. A senior Thai prime ministerial adviser argued that ‘if ASEAN was a nation it would be very mixed. Brunei is a monarchy, others are communist. Some are democracies, some are not. Some are Buddhist, while others are largely Muslim or Christian’. Similarly, a serving Thai military officer declared that making progress on security, humanitarian assistance or even joint task forces would take time because of the differences in politics, economies and levels of prosperity.

Balancing the great powers is a key issue for Thailand. ASEAN now organises a wide range of meetings to help member states’ relations with external powers. One officer declared: ‘In ASEAN I speak with many people. They don’t want the superpowers to come in and dominate. That is the concept. There are various mechanisms to balance the powers’.

This task is complicated further by China’s growing influence across the region, notably in Cambodia and Laos. Like these two countries, Thailand is on a path of integration with the Southeast Asian mainland, including with southern China. The greater interconnectedness with China impinges on member states’ perceived freedom of political and economic action.

History plays a role too. As noted by one senior intelligence official, the unity of ASEAN is ‘a little bit weak and shaken’ because of the past: ‘Thailand, for instance, used to invade Laos and Cambodia, and Myanmar invaded Thailand. That makes achieving consensus within ASEAN all the more difficult’. As suggested by the same intelligence official, ASEAN members will need to learn how to forgive and overcome past grievances if the organisation is to become ‘stronger and more united’.

Despite the enduring reasons for distrust and enmity, countries involved in various ASEAN-related forums remain eager to participate — in part to keep a check on each other’s intentions and initiatives. In the case of the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus) forum, the significant work undertaken by expert working groups feeds into the ADMM Plus summits and provides much of the detail for the practical application and development of ideas to enhance collaboration. Collaboration in the ADMM Plus realm covers the domains of cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, peace-keeping operations, and military medicine and humanitarian mine action.

Progress has been slow and steady but over time these groups have generated significant outcomes, including seminars, workshops, exercises and conferences. Combined, they provide an extraordinary range of opportunities for enhanced cooperation, increased mutual understanding and familiarity with other member states.

In essence, the Thai establishment sees ASEAN as a proto-great power. Thanks to the perpetuation of the notion of ASEAN centrality and despite its remarkable diversity, ASEAN gives comfort to its members that their otherwise relatively insignificant international roles amount to more than the sum of their parts. That sense of centrality, fragile though it is, has been perpetuated through the various forums that have ASEAN at their core. Thais argue that it remains in the interests of the member states for this centrality to continue. But in an era of growing great power contestation that may be increasingly difficult.

3,thailand,"Even though Thailand’s junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha may break his promise to hold elections once again, the prospect of polls being held in February next year has nonetheless at least left some hope for progress in Thailand. As that window of opportunity has opened, news about prospective politicians who might join the race has been surfacing as well.

Of particular note is a young, self-made billionaire named Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Thanathorn, 39, is a vice president of Thai Summit Group, a leading auto parts manufacturer of Thailand. Forced to enter the business world at a young age following the passing of his father, Thanathorn inherited a company and successfully transformed it into a global conglomerate.

Now, Thanathorn is interested in politics. He made sensational headlines in Thailand in the past week with his plan to launch a political party. His political vision has generated significant chatter in Thailand, including on social media among the younger generation. At this hour, nothing seems to be able to stop the Thanathorn fever.

It is no surprise that Thanathorn has rapidly emerged as a darling of the media. On a more superficial level, because of his good looks, charismatic personality, and moral courage, Thanathorn has lightened up a new hope for Thailand. But more substantively, he has vowed to compensate for his country’s “lost decade” by reading out of a new political script, and he has been articulating his agenda on a variety of topics, including promoting democracy, fixing the ailing economy, building a high-tech society, and creating a space for LGBT groups.

Apart from the current sensationalism, it is also worth noting that Thanathorn has in fact long been known within intellectual circles in Thailand as a pro-democracy figure. And in the past, he voiced his strong opinions on controversial political issues, mostly criticizing the old forces for the protracted crisis in Thailand. Today, he vows to challenge the political elite and strives to shift the power structure, supposedly to benefit the underprivileged.

Thanathorn has talked succinctly about the current political crisis in Thailand as the basis of his political narrative. He has explained that the political consensus among key players was broken down, while the new one has not been discovered. This is not news to those familiar with Thailand. Since the downfall of the Thaksin Shinawatra government, as a result of a coup that overthrew him in 2006, Thailand has been battling with its domestic political upheaval. The royal transition that took place in 2016, after the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, has further complicated the political situation, which remains unresolved to date.

Yet challenges lie ahead for Thanathorn despite this early promise and his string of promises. The junta has made sure its legacy will survive past elections, and should any new political force enter the fray, it will have to operate within those parameters. It should not be forgotten that the military took power by staging another coup in 2014—this time to topple Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck—to ensure that it could manage the uncertain royal succession. And in the process, the military drafted a new constitution, which is now perceived to be rather anti-democratic and instrumental to the maintenance of the power of the old elite. The election for Thanathorn is therefore likely to be just the beginning of a process for new political forces to push for change rather than an end to the Thai political crisis in and of itself.

In this broader context, Thanathorn has admitted too that there is a high possibility of a political confrontation between the new and old generations as a ferocious competition plays out to win over the hearts and minds of Thai voters. Instead of shying away from this, Thanathorn has urged the younger generation to be ready to engage in such a battle, even though it is highly risky and possibly fatal. Whether they will heed this call or not remains to be seen.

Additionally, Thanathorn’s opponents are monitoring him closely, and, already, old tactics are being employed to delegitimize him at this early stage. He has been accused of being an anti-monarchist because of his sponsorship of a local journal with contents critical of the monarchy (Thaksin was effectively removed from power because of this kind of accusation). This proves that the journey of Thanathron is not without problems.

A more arduous task for Thanathorn rests on his ability to gain support from the majority of Thailand. So far, he has been well received among the younger population in the urban areas. How he is able to connect his political party with the underprivileged in the countryside is the real challenge. He needs their serious support if he is to become a successful alternative choice in Thailand’s fiercely contested politics.

Fishermen long for justice as Thailand comes under U.N. scrutiny

Beh Lih Yi

SAMUT SAKHON, Thailand (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sold to a boat operator in Thailand for 6,000 baht ($192) two years ago, Win from Myanmar worked as a fisherman until he lost his forearm in an accident on the vessel this year.

Toiling for 19 hours a day, Win said the crew of 30 sometimes would not get any rest during peak season, with a United Nations team in Thailand this week to investigate such reports of abusive working conditions.

“Life is difficult as a fisherman in Myanmar so I thought it would make my life better if I come and work in Thailand,” the father of four, 39, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“The ‘agent’ did not tell me what work I was going to do or how much I would be paid. I just ended up working on the boat.”

The world’s third largest seafood exporter, Thailand’s fishing industry employs more than 300,000 people, many of them migrant workers from neighboring countries, and the sector has long been dogged by allegations of abuses.

The industry is under further international scrutiny this week as a team of United Nations experts undertake their first visit to examine human rights in a wide range of businesses in Thailand, including the fishing and seafood sectors.

Speaking from Samut Sakhon, a major fishing hub one hour drive from the capital Bangkok, Win said he lost his left arm after it was caught in a wheel as he hoisted the net one day.

Unhappy with the offer of 10,000 baht compensation from his employer, Win is now appealing to the Thai authorities for a higher amount.

HIT ON THE HEAD WITH A MACHETE

But even before the incident Win said he felt underpaid.

Starting at about 10,000 baht in the first month, the fisherman said his wages had gradually gone down to 4,000 baht. Thailand’s legal monthly minimum wage is about 9,000 baht.

“Any slight mistakes we made, we would be scolded or beaten up. I was hit twice - one time with a machete to my head,” said Win, who asked that his full name not be published as he fears it will affect his case with the Thai authorities.

Thailand’s multi billion-dollar seafood sector has come under scrutiny in recent years after investigations by the media and human rights groups showed slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and at onshore processing facilities.

The military, which took power in a 2014 coup, has rolled out reforms since the European Union threatened in 2015 to ban fish imports from the Southeast Asian nation unless it cleaned up the industry.

Employers now often complied with new rules, such as paying fishermen a minimum wage and issuing contracts, research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) this month showed.

But the ILO also found signs of continuing forced labor despite pressure from retailers to clean up the industry, including abusive working conditions and excessive overtime, especially among migrants from Cambodia and Myanmar.

More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand were victims of trafficking, according to a study of 260 fishermen by anti-trafficking group the International Justice Mission last year.

A spokesman from the U.N. Working Group on Business and Human Rights said the group would meet officials, activists and migrant workers during its 10-day mission to Thailand to ascertain whether the government measures have been effective.

“Business and human rights issues are becoming more and more prominent, including in Asia,” Surya Deva from the working group, a law professor at the City University of Hong Kong, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“Human rights abuses in supply chains, for example, are a very critical issue. Another area of global concern is the rights of migrant workers.”

The group is expected to urge Thai authorities to adopt a national action plan on dealing with modern slavery and human trafficking in industries from seafood, to manufacturing and tourism at the end of their visit.

An estimated 425,500 people live in conditions of modern slavery in Thailand, according to the Global Slavery Index 2016 by campaign group Walk Free Foundation.

‘I AM NOT HAPPY HERE’

But activists urged the U.N. team to do more than just make recommendations.

“If the U.N. just come do research and collect data that doesn’t really help,” asked Patima Tungpuchayakul from Thai advocacy group, the Labour Rights Promotion Network Foundation, involved in rescuing migrant fishermen from labor abuses.

Back in Samut Sakhon, boats were pulling into a port on a sunny morning and fishermen busy unloading their catch.

Local women and migrant workers from Myanmar quietly sorted sardines and mackerel according to their size before they were loaded onto trucks and sent to nearby processing plants.

But this is a scene that Win would like to forget. All he wants now is to get compensation for losing his arm and go home.

“I am not happy here. At least if I go home, I can be with my wife and children,” he said.

5,thailand,"In this March 4, 2017, photo, tourists enjoy the popular Maya bay on Phi Phi island, Krabi province. Authorities have ordered the temporary closing of the beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” to halt environmental damage caused by too many tourists. (Rajavi Omanee/Associated Press)

BANGKOK — Authorities in Thailand have ordered the temporary closing of the beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” to halt environmental damage caused by too many tourists.

Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the island’s battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.

Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.

The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day.

Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.

“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”

Thon said the temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.

“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.

When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.

The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.

“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”

More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.

Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.

Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.

“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

6,thailand,"–

CHIANG RAI – Research led by the University of Oxford has revealed how the complex cultural and social environment in developing countries can complicate the use of new diagnostic technologies to fight the global superbug crisis.

The research, led by Dr. Marco J Haenssgen at the CABDyN Complexity Centre and the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, involved a new finger-prick blood test (C-reactive protein) to help nurses and doctors decide whether their patients need antibiotic treatment.

The super-bug crisis has arisen because microbes are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics and other antimicrobials. The severity of the problem has been described in a recent World Bank report entitled ‘Drug-Resistant Infections: A Threat to Our Economic Future’, which warns that the current trends of antimicrobial use can entail ‘a reversal of the public-health gains of the past century, and the economic growth, development, and poverty reduction these gains enabled.’

Among the many contributing factors to drug resistance is the unnecessary use of antibiotics for illnesses that can be cured with other medicines or treatments. New funding is being provided to solve this problem, for examples with the Fleming Fund, the Wellcome Trust, and Nesta’s Longitude Prize, providing tens of millions of pounds to identify new diagnostic tests to help healthcare staff to end unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

Exploring cases in Chiang Rai Thailand and Yangon, Myanmar, the studies demonstrated that diagnostic tests for doctors and nurses cannot alone solve the problem of antibiotic over-prescription.

The researchers found that healthcare staff generally trusted the new diagnostic technologies and used it to reassure themselves about their treatment decisions. Yet, patients’ lifestyles, cultural beliefs around illness and treatment, and the vast diversity of public, private, and unregulated healthcare providers were common barriers to accessing or correctly understanding the test.

Thai research team member Nutcha Charoenboon, said: ‘Compared to its neighbours, Thailand is a few steps ahead in reducing antibiotic prescriptions. Healthcare workers (in our case nurses) cannot prescribe antibiotics easily because there is more and more monitoring of prescriptions on the health policy level.

The test does help them to come down to the prescription limits. But there are also other factors that direct them away from the test results, for example when patients cannot afford to come back to the health centre for follow-up visits. Nurses would then rather over-prescribe antibiotics and knowingly contribute to the resistance problem than risk their patients’ lives. These social realities are what makes it tricky.’

Adding to this point, Yuzana Khine Zaw, a Burmese research team member and lead author of one of the articles, said: ‘On the patient side, there are a whole lot of extra complexities, such as cultural ideas of how the body works. If people don’t think about illness in terms of bacteria and viruses, then it’s quite easy to mis-interpret the purpose of the diagnostic test.

‘We saw a lot of patients who believed in it as a comprehensive blood test – not only a test to decide whether they should receive an antibiotic. This could lead to patients thinking they are ‘free of all disease’ when there is a negative result, although this may not be the case. Furthermore, many patients may not even receive the test due to poverty and time constraints. Rather than going to clinics where the test was offered, patients were more likely to buy the much cheaper assorted yet unlabelled medicine sets from grocery shops and pharmacies (so-called “medicine cocktails”) in order to feel better immediately or to avoid taking time off work.’

Lead researcher, Dr. Marco J Haenssgen, said: ‘This study actually reflects a lot of social research on new technologies in low- and middle-income countries. We can see how the local context affects the role of diagnostic tests, for instance in light of healthcare staff’s phenomenally wide range of tactics when they decide to prescribe or not to prescribe antibiotics. A new diagnostic test will therefore always interact with existing behaviours and solutions, which can make the test perhaps more, perhaps less effective than planned – depending on the context.’

The research involved interviews and group discussions with 92 nurses, doctors, and fever patients in Chiang Rai and Yangon. The research was part of a larger clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the C-reactive protein test on the primary care level, for which around 2,400 adults and children participated.

Professor Yoel Lubell, leader of the overall clinical trial based at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, added: ‘A medical intervention such as CRP-testing, while showing promise in the lab or in controlled environments could be used quite differently and have unintended consequences in real life settings. Social research should thus go hand-in-hand with clinical research to ensure that medical interventions introduced into routine care have the desired and intended positive impact.’

7,thailand,"More than 40 percent of mothers said they had experienced some form of abuse or physical violence

By Rina Chandran

BANGKOK, March 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women migrant construction workers and their children in Thailand are exposed to violence and abuse in hazardous living conditions, the United Nations said on Thursday.

The report by the U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) underscores the risks to labourers from some of the poorest countries in Asia.

Besides physical abuse and limited access to healthcare and education, the 60,000 or more migrant children living in construction site camps are particularly vulnerable to child labour, according to the report.

Nearly a third of the children surveyed said they had started working before turning 15, the legal minimum age. Almost 90 percent had suffered some form of physical violence.

""These experiences of violence are severe barriers to the children's physical, emotional and social development, in addition to being threats to their basic safety and well-being,"" said Thomas Davin, UNICEF's Thailand representative.

""That is not a childhood for any child.""

Thailand has more than 3 million migrant workers, according to the International Organization for Migration, with rights groups putting the figure higher.

Construction is the top employer of migrant workers, with women from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos making up about 40 percent of the nearly 600,000 documented migrants in the sector, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).

They are a rarity in an industry generally dominated by men. But they are paid less than men, get few maternity or childcare benefits, and are more exposed to safety risks, the ILO said.

Families live in refashioned containers or flimsy shacks of tin and plywood at the sites, with poor sanitation and limited access to potable water, according to the survey of 119 migrant parents and children in 21 sites in northern Thailand.

More than 40 percent of mothers said they had experienced some form of abuse or physical violence, it said.

""I was shocked at the extent of the violence faced by women and children,"" said Nicola Crosta of Baan Dek Foundation, a non-profit which helps to provide education and healthcare to migrant workers at construction sites.

""But many companies are stepping up to provide better facilities and services, which can help reduce the incidence,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Since taking power in a 2014 coup, Thailand's ruling junta has had varying degrees of success in regulating the foreign workforce, spurred partly by media reports that unregulated workers faced exploitation by employers.

Thai industries are under international scrutiny this week as a team of UN experts undertake their first visit to the country to examine human rights in a range of businesses.

8,thailand,"BANGKOK (THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The popularity of Thai period TV series Love Destiny has jokingly been said to empty the normally congested roads on the days it broadcast. Now it gets to be aired in prison at the plea of inmates.

Krit Krasaethip, chief of the Bangkok Remand Prison, said the prisoners normally go to the dormitory at 3pm, where they will be shown TV programmes for their recreation and to encourage behaviour change following a session of religious activities.

Inmates are allowed to watch TV programmes until 9pm, so they were unable to catch the talk-of-the-town historical series that broadcasts every Wednesday and Thursday for an hour starting from 8.20pm.

The prison authorities last weekend yielded to the calls from inmates who wished to watch the series by showing them the recorded versions. The inmates were happy to be able to watch the show, so the administrators then allowed them to watch the series on Wednesdays.

Krit said that he considered the content of the series as causing no harm and has value in educating prisoners about the country's history.

""Some prisoners have no education. But they could learn about the history of the country, so they are allowed to watch the broadcast,"" he said.

In the future, if there is similar programming, the prisoners will be allowed to view it as it is better than watching broadcasts of football matches which could result in gambling among the prisoners.

The series has been a big hit, leading many Thais, particularly women, to dress up in ancient costumes and visit various historical locales, especially the Ayutthaya temples, which have served as shooting locations for the TV drama.

The series that will end next month is about a vicious woman with a bad habit living in historical Ayutthaya, and her kindhearted woman reincarnation in the current time.

When the current time soul lives in the body of the ancient woman she meets her destined love. The cute and funny character as portrayed by the leading actress, and the way she was perceived by old-time Ayutthaya people as she introduced them to modern-day technology and lifestyles, has helped make the series a mega hit.

Inpired by the success of the show, Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha has encouraged Thai citizens to wear period outfits in public places.

""I want to see this phenomenon taking place throughout the country on different occasions, at tourist attractions. We should preserve this Thai tradition (wearing period costume) as a national treasure for the next generation,"" Gen Prayut said.",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/prisoners-in-thailand-get-to-watch-mega-drama-hit-love-destiny-by-popular-demand
9,thailand,"The Thai beach used in Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach is to close because of a large number of visitors it receives a day.

Thailand's National Parks and Wildlife Department announced on Wednesday (28 March) that Maya Bay, situated on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all tourists for four months annually.

The decision - which will be enacted in June - has been made so damaged coral reefs and sea life, which AP reports has “virtually disappeared,” can recover.

Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development, compared the worn beach to “...someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped.”

“Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone,” he added, stating: “We need a timeout for the beach.”

Maya Bay has been attracting an enhanced number of tourists ever since its usage in Danny Boyle film The Beach (2000), an adaptation of Alex Garland's 1996 backpacker novel of the same name. It follows Richard (DiCaprio), a young American who assimilates into a secret community residing on a hidden island.

The beach has remained open all year-round since 1999 (when The Beach was filmed) due to visitor demand and remains the only Thai marine national park to do so. According to AP, it receives an average of 4,000 visitors daily. When it reopens, a set limit of 2,000 will be put in place while boats will have to anchor on the opposite side of the island.

Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department, said: “If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late.”

Thailand has since a boost of over 25m tourists since The Beach was released with more than 35m visiting the country last year compared with 10m in 2000.

Thamrongnawasawat added: “I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist.”

11,thailand,"–

BANGKOK – Mon began dating her boyfriend when she was 14 years old. They met online. A few months in, “he wanted to have sex,” she recalled. “He did not use any protection. I was scared at first, but he said he would take all responsibility.”

Soon after, Mon learned she was pregnant.

But her boyfriend did not keep his word; he left her to deal with the pregnancy on her own.

Mon’s mother took her to a local hospital, which recommended she go to an emergency home – a shelter for young mothers.

–

Mon ended up in a UNFPA-supported emergency home in northern Bangkok, run by the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women. The home provides counseling, food, antenatal care, childcare classes, as well as vocation classes and other services.

Many residents come to hide their pregnancies from the community, which places a strong stigma on unmarried motherhood.

“I was so stressed out before coming here,” Mon recalled. “I think society outside [this place] is so bad, always criticizing… Here I can talk to social workers and everyone else. They cheer me up and that makes me feel good.”

Help for teen moms

Since it opened in 1974, the emergency home has assisted more than 50,000 women and children from all over Thailand. On any given day, there are about 150 women and children sheltering at there.

Fang was one of them. She became pregnant at 16. “When I found out I got pregnant, I was shocked,” she said. “I told my boyfriend and we were clueless. We weren’t ready for this.”

Her mother brought her to the emergency home. “No mother wants to deal with this problem. My daughter is too young to have a child,” Fang’s mother told UNFPA.

“They provided therapy activities, which involve drawing and talking session between mothers and teen moms,” Fang said.

These counseling sessions bring together pregnant teens and their parents, encouraging them to exchange views and support one another.

–

“We have worked with parents over the years,” said Nattiya Thongsrikate, director of the emergency home. “We have learned that we can’t only work with teen moms in order to solve teen pregnancy. Teenagers can’t cope this problem alone. They need adults for consultation and assistance.”

Since these sessions began, fewer girls and families have chosen to leave their babies at the orphanage.

“Also, we learn how to take care of our baby,” Fang said. Today, she and her 11-month-old daughter live at home with Fang’s parents.

Learning about sexual and reproductive health

–

About 30 per cent of the shelter’s cases involve unintended pregnancies, mainly from sexual exploitation and unprotected sex.

To help girls avoid further unintended pregnancies, the emergency home teaches them about family planning and reproductive health.

“Here we teach sex education, especially for those under 20. We teach them about precautions, such as contraceptive implants, that can prevent pregnancy for five years,” Ms. Thongsrikate explained. “For example, a 14-year-old girl who got pregnant now – it should take her another five years to get pregnant again. By then she would be more mature.”

A struggle returning to school

The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women also offers child care for teen mothers who are ready to go back to school. But returning to school is often a challenge.

Mon dropped out of the 10th grade when she got pregnant. Now, she is planning to take vocational classes one day a week. “On Sundays, my mother will look after my baby,” she said.

She is grateful for her parents’ support. “I know now that my parents are the only people who truly love me—not men. I want my story to be a lesson for all girls: When men say they love you, they don’t always mean it.”

Fang’s parents are also supportive, insisting that she complete her studies.

“All my children have to graduate at some point, no matter what crisis they have,” her father said. “We have to support them because we know not many successful people can succeed in life without education.”

12,thailand,"Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has also promised more funds for the humanitarian assistance of the Rohingya people who have taken shelter in Bangladesh from Myanmar.

“Bangladesh and Thailand are long-standing friends and connected by the Bay of Bengal and maritime routes. We should intensify cooperation in trade, investment and regional connectivity”, the prime minister was quoted as saying during a meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali.

The foreign ministry said during the meeting on Thursday in Bangkok, Chan-o-cha pledged his “full support” to strengthen relations with Bangladesh.

He particularly mentioned his support for Bangladesh’s bid for membership in MGC forum and the ASEAN Sectoral Partnership.

He termed Bangladesh a ‘gateway and connectivity hub’ between South Asia and South East Asia, and proposed that Bangladesh’s ‘Look East Policy’ and Thailand’s ‘Look West Policy’ “may be synchronised to create new trade and economic connectivity corridors”.

He also offered to establish coastal shipping connectivity between Thailand’s Ranong Port and Chittagong Port.

The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation or MGC is an initiative by six countries – India and five ASEAN countries, namely Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – for cooperation in tourism, culture, education, as well as transport and communications.

It was launched in 2000 at Vientiane, Lao PDR.

Both the Ganga and the Mekong are civilisational rivers, and the MGC initiative aims to facilitate closer contacts among the people inhabiting these two major river basins.

The MGC is also indicative of the cultural and commercial linkages among the member countries of the MGC down the centuries.

Thailand’s strategic location makes it an investors’ gateway to Asia.

It is at the centre of most ASEAN countries, including Myanmar on the west, Cambodia and Lao PDR on the east, and Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore on the south.

The prime minister also proposed creation of institutional framework with Bangladesh on security cooperation to prevent transnational crimes in the region.

He congratulated Bangladesh on assuming Chairmanship of the OIC and said he looked forward to working closely with Bangladesh as an OIC observer.

Mahmood Ali thanked him for all of his support pledges and assured him of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s full cooperation in advancing Bangla-Thai trade, economic and connectivity cooperation.

He offered Thailand a dedicated economic zone for its investors and all-out support to Thai companies that have invested in Bangladesh.

To facilitate the bilateral trade, Ali reiterated Bangladesh’s request for duty and quota-free access of 36 items from Bangladesh to the Thai market.

He invited more Thai investment in Bangladesh, particularly in tourism and agriculture.

He updated the prime minister about the Rohingya crisis and sought Thailand’s engagement with Myanmar for sustainable return of the forcibly displaced Myanmar citizens.

He also thanked him for Thailand’s humanitarian assistance to the tune of $40,000 through UNHCR for the Rohingyas and Thailand’s position in the international forum on this issue.

Chan-o-cha committed further support of $100,000 through UNHCR and wished success of the repatriation process agreed between Bangladesh and Myanmar, the foreign ministry said.

Ali is in now Bangkok now on a two-day visit at the invitation of his Thai counterpart Don Pramudwinai to inaugurate the ‘Bangabandhu Chair’ at Thailand’s leading technology institute, the Asian Institute of Technology.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid is accompanying him.

13,thailand,"BANGKOK: Malaysia and Thailand have agreed to strengthen their cooperation to ensure their common borders are not exploited by violent extremists and terrorists, according to Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein.

Hishammuddin, who was here to attend the 54th Malaysia-Thailand General Border Committee (GBC) meeting, said both neighbours would counter these menacing threats together.

""We agreed that it is crucial for us to maintain and enhance the close relations between our two nations at all levels in order for us to avoid the exploitation of our common border by violent extremists and terrorists,"" he said in a statement released after his meeting with Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha, here today.

According to him, he and the Prime Minister had a very productive discussion where both of them deliberated over issues of common interest, which further strengthened the existing cooperation between Malaysia and Thailand.

In the meeting held in Prayut's office, Hishammuddin said the Prime Minister had highlighted Malaysia's efforts in spearheading humanitarian efforts to assist the Rohinga refugees.

""We both agreed that the humanitarian crisis must be solved collectively by countries in Southeast Asia to diminish the risk of these refugees being exploited by extremist groups such as the so-called Islamic State (Daesh group of militants),"" he added.

Malaysia and Thailand, said the Defence Minister, were committed to assist the humanitarian situation on the ground in Bangladesh to ensure it did not serve as a foundation for potential conflict.

Hishammuddin and Prayut also agreed defence cooperation between both countries should be enhanced, focusing on other dimensions such as economic, social, cultural, cyber security and defence and international matters.

To this end, he said Malaysia and Thailand would establish a direct hotline between the agencies concerned to ensure communication lines remained constant and timely.

Earlier in the day, Hishammuddin and Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan held a closed-door meeting prior to the GBC meeting, which was held alternately between the two countries.

According to him, he and Prawit, who is also Defence Minister, spoke at length on the growing threat of Daesh in the region, post-Marawi and expressed their commitment to increase defence cooperation in ensuring this region remained safe for the people.

During the meeting, he and his counterpart instructed the ministries and armed forces to begin planning for the 4th Joint/Combined Exercise Malaysia-Thailand which will focus on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations. — Bernama",http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2018/03/16/msia-thailand-ensure-borders-free-terrorists-extremists-hishammuddin

KORAT, Thailand — U.S. and Thai service members who are participants in Cobra Gold 18 at Camp Friendship and Korat Air Force Base, here, spent their morning presenting flowers, singing and dancing with residents of a nursing home, Feb. 14.

Service members in attendance were U.S. Soldiers with 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division; U.S. Sailors with Marine Wing Support Squadron 171; U.S. Marines with Marine Aircraft Group 36; and Airmen from Wing 1, Wing 6 and Headquarters, Royal Thai Air Force.

The visit brought smiles to the faces of the elderly, as well as the service members. It bridged the gap between cultures, ages, branches of the military and the two countries.

“I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Andrew Forester, the command chaplain for Marine Wing Support Squadron 171. “Their energy, hospitality and their warmth made it so that we were the ones who benefited from this exchange.

“It is great to see people who have lived a lot of life, but still have a lot of life in them,” Forester continued. “I think it is easy for service members to lose sight of the long range and what life is all about, and to see people who have figured out how to be joyful and happy and to enjoy what they have, it’s pretty fantastic.”

Humanitarian civic assistant programs conducted during Cobra Gold 18 demonstrate a mutual commitment to the humanitarian interest of friends and partner nations, and aim to improve the quality of life and the general health and welfare of civilian residents in the exercise areas.

“Community relations events show that we are not just interested in training with their military, but also that we are interested in making genuine contributions to the welfare of their country and increasing the positive relationships developed during the exercise,” said Forester.

Throughout the exercise, more community relations events like this are scheduled to take place.

19,thailand,"British political consultancy SCL Group claims to have arrived in Indonesia after president Suharto was brought down in 1998, according to company documents issued around 2013 that were accessed by Quartz.

SCL eventually became CA, which is now alleged to have used the data of 50 million Facebook users to influence voters during Mr Donald Trump's 2016 United States presidential campaign.

SCL said it began operating in Indonesia at the request of ""pro-democratic groups"" to ""assist with a national campaign of political reform and democratisation"" in a country reeling from the Asian economic crisis, as well as the loss of a leader who had been in power for over 30 years, the Quartz report said. Quartz is owned by Atlantic Media, publisher of The Atlantic, National Journal and Government Executive.

In total, SCL claims to have worked on more than 100 election campaigns across 32 countries, Quartz reported. Previous media reports say these included claims that it had helped political parties in Malaysia, India, Kenya and Brazil.

INDONESIA CIVIL UNREST

In Indonesia, according to the SCL documents, the firm went on to survey thousands of Indonesians, manage communications for politicians and even organise large rallies at universities to help students ""let off steam"".

SCL said it was tasked with managing growing frustration with the new administration of president B.J. Habibie and surveyed 72,000 of the country's 220 million people.

In Indonesia in 1998, SCL said it decided to sponsor ""organised avenues of protests"" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations. But Indonesia expert Ian Wilson of Australia's Murdoch University said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an ""exaggeration"".

The documents seen by Quartz show that the younger ""university"" age group mainly instigated the unrest, while the older generation was wary of insubordination, having been suppressed for so long.

SCL decided to focus on 18-to 25-year-old Indonesians and direct their frustration away from civil unrest. Research in schools and universities found many of them were unhappy about the increased police and military presence on the streets.

SCL made the decision to sponsor ""organised avenues of protests"" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations - apparently with the cooperation of the Indonesian government.

""This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country,"" the SCL documents said.

""The events were so large that there was a general feeling among students that their voice really had been heard.""

SCL claims its methods dramatically reduced civil unrest and convinced then President Habibie to step down, leading to the 1999 polls that brought Mr Abdurrahman Wahid to power. The documents, Quartz said, indicate SCL ran the election campaign of Mr Abdurrahman's National Awakening Party.

Indonesia expert Ian Wilson, a lecturer at Australia's Murdoch University, said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an ""exaggeration"".

""It would have been, at most, one small element among all that were taking place at the time,"" he told Quartz. ""The forces and interests at play and jostling for influence were simply on too big a scale to have been influenced significantly in such a way.""

THAI ELECTION DATA

The SCL documents say the company entered Thailand some time before the 2001 elections that saw telecoms billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra taking power.

SCL was tasked with gauging the scale of vote-buying behaviour that had inflated the cost of an election campaign to an estimated US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion).

""Vote buying had become so endemic that an entire industry of dealers had emerged to broker the voter groups and funders,"" the documents said, as quoted by Quartz.

""It was quite commonplace for voters to sell their votes twice - and then not vote at all!""

SCL claimed to have employed more than 1,200 staff who collected data from over nine months and found that in half of the constituencies, vote buying did not impact the electoral result, a discovery that the company claimed was worth US$250 million alone.

However, in the other constituencies ""a more direct behavioural intervention was required"", which the SCL papers suggested could involve ""social pressure, economic penalties, legal framework and enhanced monitoring"".

SCL said it intervened for six months, apparently with ""the cooperation of most of the major political parties"", and Thaksin went on to win the 2001 election.

Thailand expert and University of Leeds professor Duncan McCargo told Quartz: ""There's no doubt that some Thai political parties have commissioned international consultants to work on improving their electability, and this was certainly the case for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party in 2001.""

He was sceptical, however, that different parties could have supported a project to stop vote buying. ""The 1997 Constitution included various provisions designed to combat and reduce vote buying,"" he explained. ""There was broad popular support for these changes, though I can't say that translates to 'cross-party' support.""

Quartz said it had contacted CA and SCL for comment.",http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/asean-plus/30342159
20,thailand,"BANGKOK (THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION) - More popular South-east Asian islands will be off limits to visitors this year as officials seek to protect eco-systems crumbling from warming seas and unchecked sprawl, despite the risk to tourism revenues and tens of thousands of jobs.

Thailand will shut Maya Bay, which famously featured in ""The Beach"", starring Leonardo DiCaprio, for four months a year, from June. In the Philippines, officials plan to close Boracay island for six months at the end of April.

""Islands have very fragile eco-systems that simply cannot handle so many people, pollution from boats and beachfront hotels,"" said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine expert in Bangkok.

""Coral reefs have been degraded by warmer seas and overcrowding. Sometimes, a complete closure is the only way for nature to heal,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

More than three-quarters of Thailand's coral reefs have been damaged by rising sea temperatures and unchecked tourism, said Thon, who last week recommended limiting visitors to its 22 marine parks to 6 million a year to enable their recovery.

Currently, they number about 5.5 million, he said.

Thailand closed dozens of dive sites to tourists in 2011, after unusually warm seas caused severe damage to coral reefs in the Andaman Sea, one of the world's top diving regions. It also shut some islands in 2016.

The country's sandy beaches helped draw record numbers of tourists last year, with revenues contributing about 12 per cent of the economy. The government expects 38 million visitors this year.

South-east Asia is expected to bear the brunt of rising damage to coral reefs, depriving fishermen of incomes and leaving nations exposed to incoming storms and damage from surging seas, recent research showed.

In the Philippines, which is among the most vulnerable to climate change, about 2 million people visited Boracay last year, celebrated for its white-sand beaches.

On a visit last month, President Rodrigo Duterte called the island a ""cesspool"" because of sewage dumped directly into the sea, and warned of a looming environmental disaster with buildings constructed too close to the shore.

Government agencies have recommended closing the island for six months to fix the problems.

Tour operators say more than 36,000 jobs are at stake.

""We support the government in adopting responsible and sustainable tourism practices ... but not in shutting down the whole island,"" the Philippine Travel Agencies Association said.

But Thailand's Thon warned against short-term fixes.

""Tourism is important, but we need to preserve these spaces for our future generations, for future livelihoods,"" he said.",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/south-east-asia-closes-island-beaches-to-recover-from-climate-change-and-tourism

If she had a million dollars, these are the people she would help.

Then the pastor of her church—that’s me—asked her another question. Why wait until you have a million dollars?

“That’s how we started the Calvary Baptist Clean Water Crew,” Petrillo said.

The CWC youth group of Calvary Baptist Church in Hopewell is raising $12,000 to support a clean water and sanitation project for a hill tribe village in northern Thailand managed by the Integrated Tribal Development Program. ITDP is a nongovernmental organization in Chiang Mai, Thailand dedicated to providing and improving village drinking water, irrigation and sanitation systems.

As pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, I felt it was important to choose an organization that had a successful track record of project completion, fiscal accountability and sustained community relationships. I want these kids to care about making a difference in the world, but I also want them to learn how to do it effectively. It is important to choose organizations that have the largest and most lasting impacts on people’s lives.

Setting a fiscal target of $12,000 wasn’t the only goal. The small youth group also wants to raise awareness about the current global water crisis. “So we made a rule,” Petrillo said. In order to reach at least 1,000 people, no one can contribute more than $12 to their project.

Petrillo said they don’t want one person writing a big check. “It is more important to make this the mission of many, instead of the charity of a few,” Petrillo said, adding that if people wanted to contribute more, they could help by asking others to donate.

In order to reach their goal, the group needed to partner with other community organizations. The Hopewell Council of Churches has been a great support to their group — particularly the youth group of Hopewell Presbyterian Church, which has already organized several fundraisers for the project.

Another invaluable partner has been the Global Connections Club at Hopewell Valley Central High School mentored by science teacher, Dr. David Angwenyi. The club agreed to collaborate with the small youth group on a 14-day “water challenge.”

Students and community members are asked to drink nothing but water for 14 days and donate the money they save from not buying coffee, soda and other soft drinks. The challenge began in March to commemorate World Water Day on March 22. The day focuses on advocacy for creating and sustaining clean water resources in developing countries.

‘It was heartbreaking to see people traveling miles over difficult terrain just to fill a jug of water.’

Senior Jeremy Borges, who is a member of the Global Connections Club, said two weeks without their morning coffee would be difficult for many students, but raising awareness about this issue is important. Borges has traveled to Kenya with a student group led by Angwenyi. He has seen first-hand how difficult it is for some people in the world to have access to clean water.

“It was heartbreaking to see people traveling miles over difficult terrain just to fill a jug of water,” he said, adding that it sometimes took several hours to fill one jug because the only water source came out a few drips at a time.

Angwenyi, who was born and raised in a small village in western Kenya, helped found the Hopewell Keroka Alliance. The group supports efforts to promote health, education and infrastructure improvements in western Kenya —including clean water resources. He said creating partnerships with other groups that have a shared mission increases the ability to help because it brings in more resources and broadens the groups areas of expertise.

“Collaboration with the community outside the school is very important because it makes it more realistic and not just an academic exercise,” he said. He added that outside partnerships also provide opportunities for mentorship and continuing support.

“We want service to others to be a life-long experience for these students,” he said.

Freshman Jane Bellaus. who is also a member of the CBCWC, said another important part of their project is getting people to be more responsible about their own water use. At first, it was hard for her to imagine not having access to something that she has taken for granted every day of her life. But when she learned how difficult it is for millions of people to get clean water, she reflected on how careless she had been with her own water use.

“Everybody can make a difference by just taking an extra second to think about how you can conserve water by making small changes in the way you do things — like washing your hands,” Bellaus said.

She added that helping the villagers in Thailand makes her feel like she is making up for her past wastefulness, adding that it is a good feeling to know that she will be helping to change lives in a single village for generations to come.

Emma Bean is the youngest member of the CBCWC. The precocious six-year-old is a kindergartner who attends Hopewell Elementary School and has already made personal changes to her own water use.

‘People who donate need to know they are making a difference in the world. Even though it’s only 12 dollars, they are saving lives.’

She said she only runs the shower long enough to get wet then turns it off. She soaps up without the water running and only then turns the shower back on to rinse off. Her mother, Samantha Bean, said that Emma is quick to remind her not to leave the water running at home and is also quick to remind classmates and teachers not to leave the water running when they are cleaning up at the end of the day.

“I’ve told everybody in my class about our water project,” Emma said. “I’ve told my teachers and even my principal.”

Emma and other CBCWC members — 6th grader Sara Petrillo and 5th grader Kevin Petrillo — turned their last birthday parties into water project celebrations. Instead of birthday gifts, they asked guests to make $12 donations.

Anna Petrillo said the CBCWC is building a website and planning a number of events to help raise awareness and reach their goal of $12,000 — including bake sales, benefit concerts and a 5-mile “Walk for Water” event this June. The group is also trying to optimize their use of social media and hopes that people will share information about their project with others.

Anna Petrillo says it’s a sad and serious thing that people don’t have access to clean water and are dying from water-born diseases — especially children.

“People who donate need to know they are making a difference in the world,” Petrillo said. “Even though it’s only 12 dollars, they are saving lives.”

23,thailand,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women migrant construction workers and their children in Thailand are exposed to violence and abuse in hazardous living conditions, the United Nations said on Thursday.

The report by the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF) underscores the risks to laborers from some of the poorest countries in Asia.

Besides physical abuse and limited access to healthcare and education, the 60,000 or more migrant children living in construction site camps are particularly vulnerable to child labor, according to the report.

Nearly a third of the children surveyed said they had started working before turning 15, the legal minimum age. Almost 90 percent had suffered some form of physical violence.

“These experiences of violence are severe barriers to the children’s physical, emotional and social development, in addition to being threats to their basic safety and well-being,” said Thomas Davin, UNICEF’s Thailand representative.

“That is not a childhood for any child.”

Thailand has more than 3 million migrant workers, according to the International Organization for Migration, with rights groups putting the figure higher.

Construction is the top employer of migrant workers, with women from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos making up about 40 percent of the nearly 600,000 documented migrants in the sector, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).

They are a rarity in an industry generally dominated by men. But they are paid less than men, get few maternity or childcare benefits, and are more exposed to safety risks, the ILO said.

Families live in refashioned containers or flimsy shacks of tin and plywood at the sites, with poor sanitation and limited access to potable water, according to the survey of 119 migrant parents and children in 21 sites in northern Thailand.

More than 40 percent of mothers said they had experienced some form of abuse or physical violence, it said.

“I was shocked at the extent of the violence faced by women and children,” said Nicola Crosta of Baan Dek Foundation, a non-profit which helps to provide education and healthcare to migrant workers at construction sites.

“But many companies are stepping up to provide better facilities and services, which can help reduce the incidence,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Since taking power in a 2014 coup, Thailand’s ruling junta has had varying degrees of success in regulating the foreign workforce, spurred partly by media reports that unregulated workers faced exploitation by employers.

24,thailand,"The Centre aims to develop the cybersecurity workforce in ASEAN, particularly in governmental agencies and Critical Information Infrastructure operators in ASEAN, training at least 700 cybersecurity personnel in the region in four years.

The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES) of Thailand and Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) of Japan are partnering for the establishment of a ASEAN-Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre (AJCCBC) in Thailand in June. The Centre is expected to play the key role in mitigating cybercrime in the region as well as getting ready for the establishment of ASEAN-CERT.

According to Bangkok Post, at the ASEAN Telecommunications and IT Ministers meeting (Telmin) meeting in Cambodia in December 2017, Thailand was chosen to be the hub of ASEAN cybersecurity training and tasked with improving the skills of security-related agencies of 10 countries.

The objective of the project is to develop cybersecurity workforce particularly in governmental agencies and Critical Information Infrastructure operators in ASEAN with the aim of enhancing cybersecurity awareness, strengthening information security and data protection, and promoting information sharing. All elements are essential for the development of standardised Incident Reporting Framework across the region and the establishment of ASEAN-CERT. This is in line with the ASEAN ICT Master Plan 2020 Strategic Thrust 8: Information Security and Assurance, which is directed towards creating a trusted ASEAN digital economy and improving cyber emergency responses and collaboration.

The project has received funding from Japan (JAIF: Japan-ASEAN Integration Fund) and supports in terms of technical expertise to enable effective delivery of cyber training for ASEAN Member States. MDES has mandated the Electronic Transactions Development Agency or ETDA to be the lead agency on this project, taking into consideration its extensive experience in cybersecurity workforce development.

ETDA announced the planned launch of 3 courses at the upcoming Centre to prepare the cybersecurity workforce in ASEAN to face the rising threats of cyber-attacks.

The courses to be conducted are: 1) CYDER (Cyber Defense Exercise with Recurrence) focuses on handling cybersecurity incidents. This course has been adopted by the Government of Japan to train cybersecurity personnel across the country during the past five years, with over 5,000 participants from more than 1,500 organizations; 2) Forensics deals with digital evidence of cyber-attacks; and 3) Malware Analysis covers the analysis of various types of malware according to the trend of cyber threats.

All courses are designed to allow participants to learn the theory as well as gain hands-on experience. Content of the courses will be updated at least on an annual basis to keep up with the evolving cyber threat landscape. The Centre aims to develop at least 700 cybersecurity personnel in ASEAN in four years.

In addition to conducting the courses, the Centre will also organise an annual Cyber SEA Game, a regional cybersecurity contest to nurture young talent in the field. The winning team will receive the opportunity to attend international competition in Japan. During the initial 4 years of this project, Japan will help ASEAN develop cybersecurity personnel and provide essential knowledge transfer for the long-term management and sustainability of this Centre.

Dr. Pichet Durongkaveroj, Minister of MDES, said, “MDES has been working in parallel with ASEAN and Japan. While Japan is preparing for financial capital, Thailand is proceeding with the approval of project detail that is under review by ASEAN and Japan. In the meantime, Thailand is getting the people, process, and location ready to take immediate action upon approval of the budget. This includes action plan, course curriculum, and other logistics. We expect to officially launch the Centre this June and conduct the first training for ASEAN altogether.”

Surangkana Wayuparb, CEO of ETDA stated that the Centre is going to deliver cybersecurity training every two months or at least six times a year targeting government officials and Critical Information Infrastructure personnel.

The Thai Government’s press release notes several advantages for Thailand having been selected the host country. It offers an opportunity for Thailand to learn and adapt international practices in cybersecurity workforce development to benefit the country, while also building a network of cybersecurity experts in ASEAN for better cooperation in the future.

According to the press release, the future of this Centre is a matter of discussion for the whole of ASEAN to discuss and decide. Thailand will continue to promote and support this Centre by exploring future partnership and sponsorship from other sources such as ASEAN dialogue partners, private companies, and the ASEAN ICT Fund.

ASEAN focusing on cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a key area of focus for ASEAN. Singapore is the chair of ASEAN for 2018. Singapore’s Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has emphasised that ASEAN countries “need to step up, and to step up urgently, collaboration on cybersecurity, because you can’t have a smarter world, you can’t have e-commerce, you can’t have seamless digital transactions if you don’t have cybersecurity. It’s the flip side of the coin.”

An ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (ACID) is held annually. The latest edition was held in Vietnam in September 2017, involving the ten members of ASEAN as well as five dialogue partners – Australia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea.

At the 2nd ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity, it was revealed that Singapore will set aside S$1.5 million of the ASEAN Cyber Capacity Programme (ACCP) to build technical capability among incident responders and operators in the ASEAN region. The S$10 million ACCP was announced at the Opening Ceremony of the inaugural ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity during the first Singapore International Cyber Week in 2016. Through a modular, multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary approach, the ACCP seeks to develop technical, policy and strategy-building capabilities within ASEAN Member States through workshops, seminars and conferences organised, in collaboration with partners such as Government agencies, industry players and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), including the US Department of State, the MITRE Corporation, Cyber Law International and the ICT4Peace Foundation.

At the same conference, ASEAN Member States expressed their support for the development of basic, operational and voluntary norms of behaviour to guide the use of ICTs in a responsible manner, in line with the 2015 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.

25,thailand,"There are recurring fears of a jihadist threat in Southern Thailand. Although Thailand suffers from a long-running insurgency in the deep south, the issue has often been branded as a ethno-nationalist struggle rather than as part of global jihad. However, with a series of ISIS-linked activities in Southeast Asia, compounded by returning ISIS fighters from the Middle East, there are renewed concerns about jihadist elements taking advantage of the existing vulnerability in Southern Thailand.

The jihadist elements might not be focusing on fighting the Thai state, but could be concentrating on neighboring Malaysia. There is a historical precedent from back in the Cold War when the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) took refuge in Southern Thailand but planned for attacks targeting Malaysia. There are fears that returning ISIS fighters could take the same approach. Nevertheless, these fears remain unfounded as the ethno-nationalist character of the conflict is strong enough to withstand jihadist influence.

Background

The insurgency in Southern Thailand remains a localized conflict over territory and identity, rather than one staged as part of the global jihad. The narrative of the Southern Thailand insurgents conjures up historical memories of the Sultanate of Patani in mythical proportions. The Sultanate of Patani was claimed to be a trading hub and a center for excellence in Islamic studies before the painful subversion by Siamese colonization. By incorporating the Malay Sultanate into Siam, it meant not only the end of national sovereignty but also the Malay identity.

As it can be seen, the narrative bears a strong ethno-nationalist character and there is no mention of a fight in the name of global jihad. The role of Islam in the narrative pertains only to an image of Patani as a sacred Islamic land that has fallen under the rule of the “non-believer.” The struggle is to free Patani from Thai rule rather than defending the worldwide Muslim community and liberating all Muslim lands.

Religious leaders in Southern Thailand also rejects the Salafi-jihadist ideology espoused by groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda. Rather, Malay Muslims there adhere to traditional forms of Sunni Islam of the Shafi’i school. Therefore, this misalignment in the religious interpretation between the transnational terrorist groups and the Malay Muslims there serves as an obstacle to jihadist influence.

The insurgent leaders are also not prepared to work with these transnational jihadists. Jemaah Islamiyah had previously tried to work with the Southern Thailand insurgents but failed to gain traction. More recently, the main insurgent group, Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), has made it clear that ISIS is not welcome in the deep south.

At this moment, the insurgents’ priority is to gain legitimacy, particularly from the international community, for their separatist cause. By working with jihadist groups, any form of legitimacy the insurgents had would be gone. As such, it is not conceivable that the insurgents would take that risk.

Future Trajectory

That said, there are some factors that might have a significant impact on the current status quo of non-jihadist influence. First, there is still a possibility that young Malay Muslims could fall prey to jihadist ideology via social media, although there is no concrete evidence yet to prove such a trend in the deep south. But in the information age, it is hard to have a monopoly over the information consumed by the Malay Muslims there.

In other words, self-radicalization can likely happen among the youth, particularly when Malay Muslims in the deep south lack sufficient knowledge about ISIS. This is a result of local intellectuals and academics failing to discuss ISIS publicly, out of fear and reluctance. They fear that authorities might associate them with ISIS if they talked about it openly. Some imams also tend to minimize any discussion of jihadism.

The Malay Muslim populace’s ignorance about ISIS and its ideology should be a concern for the authorities. Representatives of BRN’s Information Department have already voiced concerns that it is possible for young Malay Muslims to be influenced by online jihadist propaganda in part because of this lack of knowledge. Hence, this is an area which can change the status quo very quickly.

Second, it is also plausible that splinter groups could emerge and these groups may find advantages in aligning with the jihadists. Stalemate in the current peace dialogue could result in some disgruntled followers of the BRN splintering off to join forces with the jihadists.

To date, that prospect is still highly unlikely. Even if terrorist tactics are adopted, the aims of the Malay Muslim insurgents remain narrowly focused on Patani-nationalist goals rather than global jihadist ones. But since nothing has been achieved in alleviating the current plight, there is still a small possibility of the jihadist ideology gaining greater traction among younger Malay Muslim insurgents.

Overall, the deep south of Thailand has been able to withstand jihadist influence, but the current status quo can change. The only way to manage possible jihadist influence is to work on the current peace dialogue in Southern Thailand.

Ending the conflict should be a priority. The Thai military government must take serious effort to hold discussions with the main insurgent group, BRN and accept that a decentralized political order that respects Malay Muslim identity while protecting the rights of local Buddhists remains the best solution.
