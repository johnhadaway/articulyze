This report is the eleventh in the series of Protection Trends reports prepared by the South Sudan Protection Cluster, with inputs from Child Protection, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), and Mine Action sub-clusters. This paper is a departure from previous Trends reports, instead providing an overview of the protection trends for the entire year. The paper provides an overview of the protection situation followed by a discussion of trends based on data collected during reporting period for general protection trends, child protection, GBV, and mine action. This includes an overview of the context, access to basic services, forced displacement and population movement patterns, family tracing and reunification, grave violations of child rights, sexual and gender based violence (SGBV), and explosive hazards.

This report is not an exhaustive overview of the context in South Sudan in 2017, rather it highlights trends and observations of the serious protection trends impacting the civilian population in South Sudan to inform the response of both humanitarian and political actors. For more detail on protection trends relating to specific periods, please refer to previous quarterly trends reports. To contextualize the reporting period, the paper uses data going back to 2013, to understand the progressive impact of conflict and insecurity on protection concerns. The information presented in the report is based on a broad range of sources. The operational environment currently limits the availability of data on some key protection concerns. Furthermore, lack of humanitarian presence and reliance on remote data collection for some locations present major challenges in providing an accurate and comprehensive depiction of the protection situation in some areas.

Context Overview

The continued armed conflict in South Sudan in 2017 has dire consequences for civilians resulting in civilian deaths, separation, and conflict related sexual violence. These issues are compounded by growing food insecurity, limited basic services, widespread health issues, and exacerbated by heavy rains and flooding. There was little improvement in the overall protection environment and civilians continued to flee from active conflict and reports of fighting across the country. ACLED data showed that the highest number of conflict incidents occurred in April, when reported incidents of violence against civilians reached unprecedented levels. The severity of the conflict continued to follow seasonal patterns with a decline in the number of incidents by half in the rainy season. The rainy season had less impact than in previous years in limiting fighting, and fighting expanded into areas that had been comparatively calm throughout the conflict.

Steps towards political resolution of the conflict were taken in 2017, but had not made significant impact on the level of conflict by the end of the year. President Kiir officially launched the National Dialogue, on 22 May, with the swearing in of a 94 member steering committee. The potential effectiveness of the National Dialogue remained uncertain with widespread active conflict, access challenges, unclear engagement of affected populations, and concerns over the ability for open dialogue and inclusiveness, necessary for a reconciliatory process. Kiir marked the occasion of the inauguration of the National Dialogue by declaring a unilateral ceasefire. This had little to impact on the active conflict.

The reporting period also saw increased fractionalization among opposition forces, particularly in the Greater Equatorias and Greater Upper Nile. Several opposition groups issued a statement in May announcing a united approach; however, little coordination or cooperation was demonstrated by the end of the year. Despite their announcement, there were several clashes between opposition armed groups, particularly in the Equatorias. The emergence of Taban Deng allied opposition forces, resulted in splitting and defection of the opposition aligned to Reik Machar in Unity State and Upper Nile. Exacerbated by the proliferation of armed actors, forced recruitment was identified a serious protection concern for men and boys in Greater Equatoria, Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile. There were high profile resignations and dismissals of SPLM and SPLA leadership in the first half of the year. On 9 May, the Chief of General Staff, Paul Malong Awan, was dismissed. President Kiir later announced a restructuring of the SPLA. Malong remained under house arrest in Juba until the situation was mediated and he was permitted to travel to Kenya in November. The repercussions of this events are still unfolding.

On 12 June, IGAD announced a process to revitalize the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS) of August 2015, and endorsed a High-Level Revitalization Forum (HLRF) to mediate a political settlement for peace. The primary objectives of the HLRF were threefold: first, restoration of a permanent ceasefire; second, implementation of ARCSS; third, revise the timeline of ARCSS for democratic elections at the end of the implementation period (which was initially scheduled to end in October 2018). ARCSS has three signatories: the former Government of South Sudan, SPLM-IO, and SPLM-FD. Circumstances in the country have significantly changed since the signing of ARCSS, with increases in the geographic scope of conflict and the number of armed groups. The HLRF was tasked with identifying key stakeholders and groups for consultations, which began at the end of September 2017.

The first of the 4,000 Regional Protection Force (RPF) troops began arriving in August and were initially accommodated in the UNMISS base in Tongping. The deployment of the RPF caused friction with the Government. The RPF was transitioned to a base outside of Juba. The full deployment was stalled and by the end of 2017, only 731 had arrived. In the second half of the year, UNMISS took steps towards re-opening its former base in Yei as part of efforts to increase protection throughout the country.

On 14 December the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2392, which extended the mandate of UNMISS until 15 March 2018, pending the ongoing strategic review. The Security Council statement supported the IGAD HLRF, calling for inclusive participation of civil society, women and youth. The resolution reiterated JMEC findings that “the parties to the conflict have failed to implement substantive elements of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, and that conditions for credible election do not presently exist.” The Security Council urged that parties agree to strong monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, take steps to improve human rights, accountability measures, and humanitarian access. This included addressing the issue of military use and occupation of schools and hospitals, which, as reported under the grave violations monitoring and reporting framework for South Sudan directly affected over 16,501 children in 2017. The resolution went on to call for measures for representation of all South Sudanese in governance structures, and restated the Government’s agreement to fully cooperate with UNMISS.

IGAD HLRF talks began in Addis, on 15 December 2017, and culminated with the signing of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (ACoH) on 21 December. The signatories included representatives from: TGoNU, SPLA/M-IO, NAS, SPLM-FD, NDM, FDP/SSAF, SSUM, SSPM, SSNMC, SSLM, and PDM as well as other political groups and representative for youth, women, and other civilian representatives. The ACoH came into effect on 24 December. According to CTSAMM reports, the agreement was violated by the SPLA-IO in Koch with attacks on 24 December, and SPLA movements in Mundri, with multiple subsequent violations documented by CTSAMM. The Government questioned whether the reports were objective, and issued a warning to NGOs that only CTSAMM has a mandate to report on military operations and violations of the ACoH.

The economic situation in South Sudan continued to deteriorate, having a severe impact on the civilian population. Oil production, the primary source of gross domestic product, decreased. The costs of the conflict and security resulted in printing additional money, which further exacerbated inflation. The consumer price index officially increased 155 percent between July 2016 and June 2017, which was significantly less than the previous year in which there was a 480 percent price increase. On the parallel market, the rate for SSP against the dollar continued to depreciate: with the exchange rate increasing from 18.5 December 2015, 7 August 2016, 172 August 2017, to 220 December 2017. Nearly all basic food staples experienced an above normal price increase over 2017 in assessed markets across the country. These factors, combined with limited livelihood options, resulted in the price of basic goods and the minimum food basket being unaffordable for the vast majority of South Sudanese.",Protection Trends - South Sudan: January - December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/protection-trends-south-sudan-january-december-2017
1,south+sudan,"Background

Moyo District in the West-Nile Sub-Region of Uganda is a major hosting area for people displaced from Kajo-Keji County in Central Equatoria, South Sudan after fighting spread though he county in the second half of 2016. Due to ongoing insecurity, Kajo-Keji County has been mostly inaccessible to humanitarian actors since July 2016.

As part of an ongoing assessment of regional displacement from South Sudan, REACH began primary data collection in Moyo District in September 2017. This consisted of focus group discussions (FGDs) with displaced South Sudanese living in host communities across Moyo District, and Key Informant (KI) interviews of South Sudanese living in Moyo District, humanitarian actors working in Kajo-Keji County and host community government officials of Moyo and Yumbe Districts. This was intended as an initial step to understanding factors influencing returns to South Sudan and to begin linking the humanitarian response across East Africa through the development of cross-border information streams.

In January 2018, REACH expanded data collection efforts in Moyo District in order to fill information gaps on humanitarian needs in Kajo-Keji County. As part of its Area of Knowledge (AoK) methodology, REACH began collecting data from a network of KIs who have sector-specific knowledge about hard-to-reach settlements through regular direct or indirect contact, or recent displacement. These interviews were primarily conducted by phone with people living in Kajo-Keji County; some were conducted inperson in Moyo District with people recently arrived from Kajo-Keji County or in close contact with people still residing there.

Metuli town and surrounding areas of northwestern Moyo District were not assessed due to persistent insecurity. Although current AoK coverage is still limited and its findings are not generalizable, it provides an indicative understanding of the needs and current humanitarian situation in assessed areas of Kajo-Keji County.

Demographics and Livelihoods

Kajo-Keji County historically had one of the highest population densities in South Sudan; population projections based on 2008 Sudanese census numbers estimated that by 2018 the population of Kajo-Keji county would be 290,656. This number is not representative of the current population, but is an indicator of the potential population in the area if conflict had not displaced so many people. Like most of Greater Equatoria, farming is reported to be the primary livelihood activity; however, semi-pastoral cattlekeeping is widely utilized as well.

Moyo District, across the border immediately to the south, has reportedly hosted people from Kajo-Keji County for generations. Many FGD participants described establishing businesses, purchasing land and building homes in Moyo District in the past, particularly during previous times of conflict in South Sudan in the 1970s, 1990s and in 2013. Some even reported intermarrying with the Ugandan host community. Population projections based on 2014 Ugandan census numbers estimated the 2017 population of the district to be 147,600.","Regional Displacement of South Sudanese - Kajo-Keji County, Central Equatoria, South Sudan and Moyo District, West Nile Sub-Region, Uganda (March 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/regional-displacement-south-sudanese-kajo-keji-county-central-equatoria-south-sudan

Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

This is the second incident involving an attack on aid workers by armed groups in April alone and the third in the last six months in South Sudan.",South Sudan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 04 | 30 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-04-30-april-2018

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Nyal town is located in Northern Panyijiar County, Unity State, along the banks of the Sudd, the third largest swamp in the world. Since the beginning of the crisis, IDPs from Unity and Jonglei States have perceived Nyal as a safe location with ample resources. Recently, Nyal has also become a key location for people travelling to and from nearby islands.

Since 1 November 2016, REACH has monitored three ports in Nyal - Gap Port, Nyal Port and Katieth Port - to record the arrivals and departures on a daily basis. The information gathered covers household (HH) demographics, key push and pull factors, health concerns, vulnerable populations, and general transportation routes. The daily data was synthesised to provide evidence for more effective humanitarian planning.

The REACH team collected information from 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to ensure complete coverage of Nyal’s three ports. REACH teams attempt to interview all arrivals and departures at the household level using a contextualised survey. However, the data presented here is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population. This factsheet is based on data on 626 people departing (150 HHs), 429 people arriving (103 HHs), and 8 people transiting (3 HHs), which was collected from 5 to 29 March 2018.","South Sudan Displacement Crisis: Nyal Port Monitoring - Panyijiar County, Unity State, South Sudan (March 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-displacement-crisis-nyal-port-monitoring-panyijiar-county-unity-6

There has been fighting here in the capital of South Sudan's Unity State since the country's civil war began in 2013.

Today, after a year of relative calm, violence has again surged between government forces and the opposition.

The head of the United Nations Mission in Unity, Hiroko Hirahara, believes that this is linked to an upcoming round of peace talks.

""People started becoming a bit more political because they wanted to position themselves,"" she told Euronews' reporter in South Sudan, Monica Pinna.

""That doesn’t only mean politically but also what they occupy. Because if and when the peace process starts talking about the implementation of the agreement, these questions will come up: 'Where is your territory?' 'Who are you?' 'Which party are you representing?'""

Five years of civil war

The civil war has entered its fifth year.

Today armed conflict is ongoing and potentially expanding in the states of Unity, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Upper Nile. What's more, the west of the country could easily flare up again, according to NGOs.

The conflict has triggered a desperate humanitarian situation with over two million refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries and two million more people internally displaced (IDPs).

The biggest camp for internally displaced people is in Bentiu. Some 120,000 people live in the so-called 'Protection of Civilians' settlement, watched over by the UN and assisted by NGOs and agencies like UNICEF.

""The humanitarian situation is becoming almost unbearable, with areas remaining cut off for weeks,"" UNICEF's Field Office head in Bentiu, Mustapha Ben Messaud, told Euronews.

""Since 2013, we've had 100 humanitarian workers lose their lives. The population suffers this on a daily basis. They face violence. Over the past six weeks, unfortunately, 30,000 children have been unable to go to school because of the latest fighting in this geographic area.""

Active hostilities impacting humanitarian operations have led to record levels of food insecurity. Last year, famine was declared in parts of Unity State, meaning 100,000 people faced starvation.

""Over 6 million South Sudanese people are suffering from severe food insecurity as a result of the conflict,"" Monica Pinna said from outside the local hospital.

""Malnourushed children are an early indicator. Here at Bentiu's hospital, the numbers are growing, each week.""

""Currently, we have 120 cases admitted for severe acute malnutrition and these cases have been increasing on a monthly basis,"" explained Gitau Nicholas Chege, Nutrition Program Manager with Care International.

""This is in regard to the influx of IDPs who come here. If these children are not screened, they end up dying.""

South Sudan's government urged the United States on Wednesday not to ""abandon"" the country after Washington said it would review its assistance programs because it could not continue a partnership with leaders perpetuating ""endless war"".

The US is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Its funding provides aid to millions of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda and lifesaving assistance such as food to people still inside the war-torn country.

Washington's statement says the US is committed to saving lives but does not want its assistance to ""prolong the conflict"" or facilitiate corrupt behaviour by elites.

""The Government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,"" the White House declared.

""I saw many bodies on the ground, but nobody buried them""

More mothers are coming with their children for hospital treatment in Bentiu from Leer, a county in southern Unity that is currently under fire.

Nyajiel Pech is 30-years-old and has 5 children. She had to walk for six days without food to reach the hospital. Her son is severely malnourished.

""Many people died, many people escaped and went to the bush but have disappeared since,"" she said.

""I saw many bodies on the ground, but nobody buried them. We ran away when we saw this.""

Fought largely along ethnic lines, the war started just two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011.

The world's youngest state plunged into crisis when President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer.

Rampant sexual violence is also used as a weapon of war in South Sudan.

Akobo town is located in the eastern side of Akobo County, Jonglei State, close to the land and river border crossings with Ethiopia. Akobo is a key point of trade and transit between South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Since the beginning of the crisis, this route has been used by South Sudanese heading to or coming back from refugee camps in Ethiopia. In two locations, Tirgol Port and Market Port, REACH staff has recorded arrivals and departures of South Sudanese on a daily basis since May 2015. In order to provide an indication of wider trends, data is collected on the volume of movement, as well as the motivations and intentions of those travelling.

The following findings are based on primary data collected between 1 and and 28 February 2018, with pauses on 12 February, and between 19 and 22 February due to insecurity. REACH teams interview arrivals and departures at the household (HH) level using a contextualized survey. During February,

REACH interviewed 74 HHs who were arriving in and 147 HHs who were departing from Akobo town.

A statement from the United Nations said the aid workers, all from South Sudan, disappeared on Wednesday during a trip through the southern part of the country. The statement gave no details on the armed group that seized them or its demands.

This is the third time in six months that aid workers have been held by militants in South Sudan, the world’s youngest country. At least 98 aid workers have been killed in South Sudan since it devolved into civil war in 2013, two years after it was founded. The majority of the aid workers killed since the conflict began are South Sudanese.

The United Nations statement called for the release of the workers “without condition so that their work can continue.”","10 South Sudan Aid Workers Are Abducted, U.N. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/africa/south-sudan-aid-workers-abduction.html
10,south+sudan,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration threatened Tuesday to cut aid to South Sudan unless the country's civil war ends and peace is restored.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. will begin reviewing its assistance to the East African nation to ensure the money does not contribute to or prolong the conflict, or enable predatory or corrupt behavior.

The U.S. is South Sudan's largest donor, giving over $3.2 billion in humanitarian assistance since civil war broke out in December 2013, according to the U.S. Embassy.

Sanders' announcement means $110 million in aid planned for South Sudan in 2018 could be in jeopardy.

""The United States Government will not continue in a partnership with leaders who are only interested in perpetuating an endless war characterized by ethnically motivated atrocities,"" Sanders said.

The loss of U.S. humanitarian assistance would deal a severe blow to a country where millions are malnourished and famine threatens to make a return.

Tuesday's announcement came amid rising international frustration over the civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis in years. More than 2 million people have fled South Sudan in what amounts to Africa's largest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

The most recent attempt at a cease-fire took effect in December but was violated within hours. Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

Another round of peace talks, to be mediated by a regional bloc in neighboring Ethiopia, is scheduled to start May 17.

The U.S. in recent months imposed a unilateral and largely symbolic arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctioned the oil-rich country's state-run oil company and oil ministry.

Christine Monaghan is research officer, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict

May 4 2018 (IPS) - When I visited South Sudan last year, I heard story after story about health professionals and humanitarian workers being prevented from doing critical work. Government officials regularly increased fees for nonprofits trying to alleviate the effects of conflict, stopped humanitarian convoys from delivering life-saving supplies, and erected bureaucratic obstacles designed to impede access to civilians in need.

“There are ‘sitting fees’ you need to pay to government and the opposition when negotiating access to deliver aid,” one aid worker told me. “There are ‘airport fees’ for landing at the airstrip; to carry cash into the field – anything more than $100 requires an authorization from at least five different ministries. You line everything up and then they will say something is missing or something has changed.”

These are just some examples of obstacles the South Sudanese government has created to prevent humanitarian workers from doing their vital work in a conflict zone. Government officials – and the opposition – have blatantly denied humanitarian aid, preventing civilians from accessing essential services and NGOs from functioning. This strategy is being used as a war tactic, and contributing to the spread of disease, injury and death.

The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance.





In a new report , Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict found that in 2016 and 2017, there were at least 750 incidents involving denial of humanitarian access, many of them committed by government authorities. In dozens of interviews with health, humanitarian and NGO workers I conducted in South Sudan and neighboring Uganda, I heard about many disturbing steps the government has taken to block access for humanitarian workers and NGOs.

In recent years, I have investigated denials of humanitarian access in many conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Yemen. But the extent to which this is happening in South Sudan is far beyond anything I have seen.

In March 2017, for example, the government increased work permits for foreigners from $100 to a staggering $10,000. Two months later, it increased registration fees for international NGOs, from $2,000 to $3,500. Government officials have also interfered in the recruitment of NGO staff by reviewing candidate lists and even sitting in on interviews and vetoing choices. They have frequently changed license and registration requirements, making it difficult for NGO staff to travel for work.

“The government has required new license plates at least three times, which also requires new driver’s licenses and new registrations,” a humanitarian worker told me. “They announce the new procedure on Thursday and then pull you over on Friday if you haven’t complied and make you pay a fee.”

All this is taking place in a country that is in desperate need of humanitarian aid. As of December, at least 20 percent of South Sudan’s 1,900 hospitals had closed, and about half were functioning with extremely limited capacity, according to the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Warring parties were responsible for at least 50 attacks on medical facilities in 2016 and 2017 – another part of the war strategy and a vicious way to prevent civilians from accessing care. As a result, malnutrition, cholera and famine are gripping parts of the country.

The strategy behind these actions is clear – it is part of the war arsenal. The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance. Since 2013, humanitarian organizations have provided up to 80 percent of all health care services in the country, according to OCHA.

As is often the case in conflict zones, children and women are disproportionately affected by these war tactics. Of the four million people who have been displaced, children and women make up to 85 percent of this number, according to OCHA.

At Watchlist, we are calling on South Sudanese government to uphold its obligations to allow for unimpeded humanitarian access. A dedicated independent body should be established to investigate incidents of denials of humanitarian access, and all procedures for humanitarian and NGO workers should be made consistent and transparent.

Even in wartime, there are rules to be followed. They are designed to limit the impact of conflict on children, women and civilians at large, and allow the most vulnerable to access humanitarian assistance. The government of South Sudan has shamelessly violated these rules and gone out of its way to endanger the lives of its own citizens.

The international community must take immediate action to end this insidious tactic of war that has had devastating consequences for the children of South Sudan.

Intensified fighting in Unity displaces populations, exacerbates needs

Armed actor attacks result in at least three aid worker deaths during April

USAID provides $103 million in additional funding to support emergency operations in South Sudan

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- Increased fighting between government and opposition forces in Jonglei and Unity states since mid-April has generated population displacement, disrupted relief operations, and exacerbated needs. Violence associated with clashes in Unity resulted in at least three South Sudanese humanitarian worker deaths during April; the UN has recorded at least 100 aid worker deaths in South Sudan since the beginning of the crisis in December 2013.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- The recent violence against humanitarian personnel and assets in Unity has prompted relief organizations to evacuate more than 30 staff and suspend humanitarian operations across central Unity, according to the UN.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- USAID recently provided more than $103 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan, bringing total USG assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan to more than $991 million from FY 2017–2018.","South Sudan - Crisis Fact Sheet #7, Fiscal Year (FY) 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-crisis-fact-sheet-7-fiscal-year-fy-2018

Japan’s funding will help UNHCR work with the Government of Sudan to address the increasing humanitarian needs of South Sudanese refugees who have sought safety in Sudan due to the continued violence in their country.

“We are very grateful to the people of Japan for their support. This contribution is yet another show of Japan’s solidarity with South Sudanese refugees and Sudanese host communities,” said UNHCR Representative, Ms. Noriko Yoshida. “UNHCR is committed to working together with Japan to ensure that the assistance reaches vulnerable refugees, but also, importantly, to find solutions for their situation.”

Japan’s funding will help UNHCR provide urgent life-saving assistance and international protection to 160,000 refugees and host communities in White Nile and East Darfur States. The assistance will include access to safe water, emergency shelter, and core relief items, such as jerry cans, kitchen tools and sleeping mats. It will also allow UNHCR to support the registration of South Sudanese refugees by the Commissioner for Refugees (COR) and to provide protection and assistance to unaccompanied and separated children.

“The Japanese Government, recognizing the scale of the crisis, supports this project which is the continuation of intervention for South Sudanese refugees,” said Ambassador of Japan to Sudan,

Mr. Shinji Urabayashi. He also said “I highly appreciate the generosity of the government and the people of Sudan and the important role they play in response to this refugee crisis.”

Sudan is one of the countries hosting the largest number of refugees and asylum-seekers in the region, including from South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen. This funding comes at a critical time, with UNHCR’s operations in Sudan only 14 per cent funded for 2018 – leaving a US$ 224 million shortfall.",Japan provides USD 2 million to support UNHCR’s activities in Sudan,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/japan-provides-usd-2-million-support-unhcr-s-activities-sudan
14,south+sudan,"In response to the Statement from the Press Secretary on the Civil War in South Sudan on May 8, 2018, Ciaran Donnelly, senior vice president of international programs at the International Rescue Committee, said:

“For most of its young life, South Sudan and its people have been trapped in a vicious cycle of conflict punctuated by flawed and failed peace attempts. As an operational humanitarian agency working to alleviate the conflict-driven suffering of the South Sudanese people, we share the US government’s frustration at the unwillingness to reach a speedy and peaceful resolution to the conflict and the heartbreaking disregard for human life displayed by all parties to this conflict.

The IRC welcomes US efforts on conflict resolution and inclusive and accountable political process – both are essential foundations for durable peace and inclusive development. And only focused and determined US and international diplomacy can make these long-sought goals a reality.

But while the South Sudanese people wait for and work toward the government they deserve, independently-delivered humanitarian aid is the last remaining lifeline for the long-suffering civilian population – over half of whom are dependent on humanitarian assistance (7.6 million). This conflict has driven 4 million, mostly women and children, from their homes and left more than five million people on the brink of starvation, resulting in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

The IRC recognizes the US’s generosity as the largest humanitarian donor to South Sudan, and we urge the US government to use this review as an opportunity to recommit to the people of South Sudan by affirming that life-saving humanitarian assistance, delivered by credible international partners, will not be affected by the review.

The South Sudanese people, caught between an intensifying conflict and deepening food insecurity crisis, must not be used as a political bargaining chip or forced to pay an even higher price for the failings of their leaders. Through our staff on the ground — almost all of whom are South Sudanese themselves — we see the hopes and potential of the people of South Sudan. We see beyond their suffering and understand that while humanitarian assistance can be the difference between life and death today, they yearn to play an active role in rescuing their communities and eventually their country from catastrophe.

While frustration and anger with the Government of South Sudan is justified, the US and the international community must not give up on the people of South Sudan. Halting or cutting humanitarian aid would only punish innocent civilians, not their leaders who are responsible for the ongoing crisis.

The only way to ease the suffering of the South Sudanese people is to end this conflict. Cutting humanitarian assistance will not hasten an end to war - it will only lead to further suffering and certain, yet preventable, death of South Sudan’s most vulnerable.”

15,south+sudan,"South Sudan's government urged the United States on Wednesday not to ""abandon"" the country after Washington said it would review its assistance programs because it could not continue a partnership with leaders perpetuating ""endless war"".

""We are asking the United States not to abandon this country because we need them … their role to assist the population of South Sudan is crucial and cannot be ignored,"" said Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mawien Makol Ariik.

The Trump administration threatened Tuesday to cut aid to South Sudan unless the country's civil war ends and peace is restored.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. will begin reviewing its assistance to the East African nation to ensure the money does not contribute to or prolong the conflict, or enable predatory or corrupt behaviour.

The U.S. is South Sudan's largest donor, giving over $3.2 billion in humanitarian assistance since civil war broke out in December 2013, according to the U.S. Embassy.

Sanders' announcement means $110 million in aid planned for South Sudan in 2018 could be in jeopardy.

""The United States government will not continue in a partnership with leaders who are only interested in perpetuating an endless war characterized by ethnically motivated atrocities,"" Sanders said.

Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of South Sudan President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

""The government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,"" the White House declared in a statement.

The loss of U.S. humanitarian assistance would deal a severe blow to a country in which millions are malnourished and famine threatens to make a return. In addition to the money that goes inside the country, U.S. funding provides aid to millions of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda

More than 2 million have fled

Tuesday's announcement came amid rising international frustration over a war that has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis in years. More than two million people have fled South Sudan in what amounts to Africa's largest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

In recent months, the U.S. imposed a unilateral and largely symbolic arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctioned the oil-rich country's state-run oil company and oil ministry.

Producton in some of South Sudan's oilfields has been shut down due to the conflict, but the government says around 130,000 barrels per day of oil are being produced. Juba spends well more than half its budget on weapons and paying soldiers, according to UN experts.

Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

The government is fighting a war with a number of rebel groups, some of them loyal to former vice-president Riek Machar, who is under house arrest in South Africa after he was fired by Kiir.

The warring parties signed a ceasefire in December in the Ethiopian capital, but it was violated within hours. A new round of talks is scheduled to begin May 17 after delays, but there is little hope among diplomats it will end the war.","South Sudan pleads with U.S. not to cut aid, as White House is threatening",http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-sudan-reaction-us-aid-1.4654672
