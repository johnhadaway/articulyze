HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

During the first quarter, the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) allocated US$21 million through the 2018 first standard allocation.

Funding went to 62 partners to kick-start top priority front-line activities under the 2018 HRP, at a time when the compounding effects of displacement, disease, food insecurity, malnutrition and protection concerns continue to worsen. Funding was also provided to ensure the continuity of common logistics services.

Funds were prioritised across nine clusters including Health (17.6 per cent), Nutrition (15 per cent), Protection (14.1 per cent), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) (11.9 per cent), Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) (10 per cent), Logistics (9.5 per cent), Education (9.5 per cent), Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items (ES-NFIs) (8.6 per cent), and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM)

(3.8 per cent). Geographical prioritisation reflected those areas facing greatest severity of humanitarian needs, and locations where affected people faced the risk of destitution due to the actual or imminent absence of humanitarian services. Jonglei (29.5 per cent), Unity (19 per cent), Upper Nile (17.1 per cent) and Western Bahr el Ghazal (9.5 per cent) received the largest investments.

During the quarter, contributions were received from Canada and Sweden. Funds were also committed by Belgium. Following donor deposits late in 2017, US$19.4 million was also available as carry-over. Further contributions are urgently needed to provide support to address top priority humanitarian needs throughout the remainder of 2018.",South Sudan: Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) Dashboard (First Quarter 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-sshf-dashboard-first-quarter-2018

KANDAK, South Sudan — “I’m afraid I’ll starve to death,” said Gatdin Bol. Curled on a dirt floor, the frail 65-year-old said he survives only by eating fruit from the trees in this remote South Sudanese town in the shadow of civil war.

Three months ago when government troops attacked Bol’s hometown in Jonglei state they stole everything he owned, including his food, he said. He fled with his wife and four children, walking for two months until they reached Kandak in Ayod County. They remain hungry. The planting season has yet to begin and they missed the United Nations’ food registration and aren’t eligible for assistance.

Five years into South Sudan’s civil war more than 7 million people are facing severe hunger without food aid, according to the latest analysis by the U.N. and the government. Aid workers warn that a recent surge in fighting could once again plunge thousands of people into famine.

“In the places where there is displacement and we can’t get there, it’s a cause for concern,” Adnan Khan, the World Food Program country director, said during a food distribution last week in the rebel-held town of Kandak.

Ayod is one of 11 counties in South Sudan that face extreme hunger. Remote and lacking basic resources like water and health care, the majority of its residents subsist on food aid.

During the visit to Kandak, several people said they had nothing to eat. “The army looted my garden and took my food. If I don’t find food I can go days without eating,” Puot Kuony said.

South Sudan’s government is doing what it can to ensure that “normalcy” returns to its people, said spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. In the worst-affected areas the government asks aid workers to step in and provide relief, including opposition-held areas, he said.

But the international community’s patience is wearing thin as reports continue of aid workers being blocked from carrying out their work, and as peace talks yield little progress. The next round of talks begins May 17.

“Earlier this year it felt like we were moving in the right direction,” said the chief of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, David Shearer. “But after seeing the effects on civilians of this conflict, I believe there is a real risk that the situation will further undermine the chance for lasting peace.”

Food Assistance: In February, WFP dispatched 18,122 mt of food and nutrition commodities by road, air and river to provide food and nutrition assistance to 1.72 million people in South Sudan. People have also been assisted in hard-to-reach areas through WFP integrated rapid response missions (IRRM), a partnership between WFP and UNICEF that uses mobile teams and partners to first register populations – which also allows for mass screening to trigger services in nutrition and other sectors – and then deliver food to the entire community.

Africa Day of School Feeding: On March 1, 2018, WFP and the Ministry of General Education and Instruction held a commemorative event at a primary school in Juba, highlighting school meals as an important safety net to help break the cycle of hunger and poverty. 600 students attended the event together with government officials. This year, WFP plans to provide 380,000 primary school children with daily school meals in 780 schools across South Sudan through its School Feeding programme.

CIC Insurance Group #ticker:CIC is pursuing more deals with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in South Sudan to tap extra income from medical cover business.

Tom Gitogo, the CEO, said the NGO world in South Sudan is driving the economy, with high demand for medical cover.

“We want to work with NGOs to enrol medical cover in South Sudan. This is one of our growth strategy and just last week we won the medical scheme of the biggest oil producer in South Sudan – DAR Petroleum Operating Company Ltd worth $4.3 million (Sh430 million),” said Mr Gitogo during a financial analysts briefing session in Nairobi.

The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)-listed insurer’s CEO said many South Sudanese are also getting medical services in Kenya and Uganda.

South Sudan was the only regional subsidiary which generated income in 2017 — profit of Sh10 million largely from investment income.

“The problem we have with South Sudan is political instability. For us we are there to stay, but we’ll not invest heavily for the time being,” said Mr Gitogo. The group’s other subsidiaries are in Uganda and Malawi. CIC also plans to expand to Tanzania once the regional businesses stabilises.

The insurer recorded higher premium and commission making a 154 per cent growth in net profit to Sh478.5 million for the year ended December 2017.

REGIONAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

South Sudan remained engulfed in conflict throughout 2017. Actions on the part of government and opposition actors continue to create an insecure environment, leading to significant protection concerns for the civilian population. The conflict also interfered with planting activities creating a food security crisis which led to a declaration of famine in early 2017. The deepening economic crisis compounded this situation and eroded the coping capacity of the people. Cumulatively, these factors drove internal displacement and large scale population movement to surrounding countries.

In 2017, Uganda received the largest number of arrivals (354,556) and Sudan received triple the expected number of arrivals (195,599) . Arrivals to Sudan spiked between January and May, likely linked with the food security shortages which led to a famine being declared in the northern Leer and Mayendit counties in February 2017. Ethiopia also received an increased number of arrivals compared with the previous year due to renewed fighting in the states of Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity states in 2017. Kenya received similar figures to those of 2016 (23,288), while the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR) received reduced, but not insignificant, numbers of new arrivals, with 22,017 and 414 arriving respectively.

Across the region, what can be observed is that this emergency is disproportionately affecting children. 65% of the refugee population in Sudan are children, 61% in Uganda and 65% in the DRC. This highlights the need for a strong child protection and education response. Child protection response has been strengthened in the region with a focus on identifying risks, providing family tracing services, specialized psychological support and facilitating access to birth registration. However, countries which received large numbers of new arrivals have struggled to cope with the scale of response required. Gaps include lack of deployment of protection staff to the border for on-the-spot assessment of protection risks facing new children arriving, limited follow up on cases due to increasing caseloads, lack of trained staff, lack of capacity to identify protection risks in children beyond the unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) category and the existence of community based protection structures whose effectiveness is sometimes undermined due to lack of resource input. Overall, this is an area requiring continued and strengthened support in order to fully protect vulnerable refugee children.

Robust efforts on behalf of both governments in the region and humanitarian responders are being undertaken to respond to the educational needs of refugee children. Yet the scale of the crisis, the overstretched capacity of existing systems and inadequate funding have led to the reality that less than half of all refugee children from the South Sudan crisis are not enrolled in primary school.

Enrollment in Uganda stands at 57%, in White Nile, Sudan at 47%2, in the DRC at 58% and in Ethiopia at 54%. Secondary level education is even more problematic with just 12% of young refugees enrolled in Uganda and only 2.68% in Sudan. Kenya has made significant strides this year reducing the number of out of school children to around 35% and witnessing a 3-fold increase in the number of students enrolled in higher education programs. However the gender equality gap persists, particularly in secondary level education, with both Kenya and Uganda reporting lower access to education for girls.",South Sudan - Regional RRP - 2017 End of Year Report - December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-regional-rrp-2017-end-year-report-december-2017
7,south+sudan,"The announcement by the regional bloc, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) postponing the second round of South Sudan talks, was a signal to the region and the millions of the suffering South Sudanese that the conflict in South Sudan is still far from over.

The South Sudanese who for decades have suffered because of the conflict, will again painfully wait for the resumption of the seemingly unending negotiations.

Though all the actors in the conflict principally agreed to the urgent need for peace, the difficult demands, accusations and counter-accusations are diverting them from the grail.

It’s not only finger-pointing that is derailing the process. It is increasingly becoming difficult to even keep following which opposition party(ies) are negotiating with the government because the list of opposition parties is on the increase and each has come with more difficult demands.

When the talks began three years ago, there were only three parties in the talks — the government, SPLM-IO and the former four political detainees; Pag’an Amum Okiech, the former secretary general of the ruling SPLM party, former deputy defence minister Majak D’Agoot, Oyai Deng Ajak, former national security minister, and Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, who served as head of the government liaison office in the United States.

But now, 11 parties are involved in the talks. These include Juba government, SPLM-IO and nine opposition parties under the South Sudan Opposition Alliance.

There are unconfirmed reports that even former army chief, Gen Paul Malong, and his supporters who have been mobilising for war against government might join the negotiations.

Complicated position

With these increasing numbers that come with all sorts of demands, Igad is now in a complicated position because the parties have failed to agree on the “Declaration of Principles” where the parties were supposed to agree on how the negotiations should go. With this stalemate, Igad is now pursing shuttle diplomacy to build consensus.

The chairperson of the council of minister, Mr Workneh Gebeyehu, announced the postponement of the talks two weeks ago, saying there were many gaps that needed to be filled.

But as pre-talks meetings and consultations go on, one thing still remains clear-South Sudan is still hurting and the people are hurting the more.

During the SPLM-IO leaders’ meeting with their supporters in Uganda on Thursday in Bugolobi, a South Sudanese woman broke down and cried.

Tired of war

She said, “We are tired of our war, our children our suffering, we are refugees! When will this end?”

Another one followed suit. She told the SPLM-IO leaders to go to Juba and directly talk to the Salva Kiir regime instead of “running around regional capitals.”

These two women received tumultuous applauds from the members. This was clear—people are tired of being refugees. They are tired of war. South Sudan has been in conflict since 1955 when the first Sudanese separatist army waged war commonly known as Anyanya rebellion against Khartoum government.

During the same meeting, the SPLM-IO listed its demands to President Kiir government on the economy, security and politics, which the Juba regime has dismissed.

Ms Angelina Jany Teny, the wife of the opposition leader Riek Machar, says if her husband is not released from “incarceration” in South Africa, and prisoners of war and political detainees also released, they will not go back to Juba.

“Juba is not willing to release political detainees. Maj James Gatdet has been sentenced to death. This is clear evidence that they are not interested in peace. The Cessation of Hostilities Agreement collapsed. What’s happening in South Unity State is unfortunate. Soldiers are raping women,” she says.

Treason

Maj Gatdet, the former spokesman of rebel leader Riek Machar, was in February sentenced to death over treason and incitement against the state. This was after he was deported from exile in Kenya and taken to South Sudan, a move that was criticised by the human rights activists.

The reason for his deportation was not well explained but it came after he supported the sacking of the Kenyan military general who was the commander of UN troops in South Sudan.

The other prominent political detainees that the opposition is pushing for their release include Samuel Dong Luak, Aggrey Idri and Micheal Kuodor.

Ms Teny says for the last one week, some people in the Nuer dominated State have been stuck in swamps where they have been hiding.

“Someone was eaten by big fish the other day. Even those in hiding are being targeted. The reason [for targeting them] is that because chairman [Dr Machar] happens to come from there,” she says.

She says Kiir regime has lost legitimacy and therefore it should be dismantled. This is one of the hardest demands the opposition is making. In response, President Kiir has sworn not to go.

“They [opposition] think that I am the obstacle to peace, and if I am removed after signing the agreement, then there will be no problem. They want me to sign the agreement and then step down immediately …What will be my incentive in bringing peace?” Mr Kiir was quoted by South Sudan media last week.

“What is my incentive if it is peace that I will bring and then step aside? Nobody can do it,”

Kiir says his opponents are making “impossible” demands. But during the same meeting, when SPLM-IO deputy chairman Henry Dilah Iluya Odwar, took the microphone after Ms Teny’s address, the attendees were in high spirits chanting; viva Odwar viva, Riek Machar Viva, SPLM-IO viva. He told supporters that the opposition is well grounded and will not be defeated.

Talks with Museveni

On the previous night, President Museveni had held talks with Mr Odwar, Ms Teny and eight others.

“Last night, we met President Museveni and we had a good exchange. Today [on Friday], he is going to Juba, that’s if he is not already there! He will be speaking in the ears of Salva Kiir. He will be speaking words of peace,” the soft-spoken Geophysicist paused for a minute and chanted SPLM-IO viva, and the attendees replied in unison, viva.

He said SPLM-IO had been “maligned” and described as an organisation of warmongers.

“But if we were not interested, why would we go to Addis Ababa for talks? he asked, referring to the Igad Council of Ministers’ statement issued recently, telling the SPLM-IO to denounce violence.

“This is the point the Igad Council of Ministers has missed,” he said.

Mr Odwar says SPLM-IO is only defending itself and its people because violence was imposed on them.

“Even after signing the agreement, the government was on the offensive, killing people, torturing civilians. The devastation in terms of looting is unimaginable and this, we continue to protest, not only to the Igad summit but also at the international arena.”

But government has dismissed these allegations.

Mr Odwar says they went for the peace process with conviction that peace would return but the government has become an “obstacle”.

He, however, warned: “Those who think we have no guns, are mistaken.”

What opposition wants

The opposition insists on having an all-inclusive national army. They say the current army is tribal and this is the cause of the turbulence.

The opposition also wants a federal system with a lean central government.

Currently, South Sudan has a Cabinet of over 30 ministers and 400 MPs. But there are reports that government wants to increase the number of MPs to 440.

For SPLM-IO to return to Juba, they want 3,700 of their fighters deployed there and also have international community offer security to its leaders.

In 2016, when Dr Machar returned to Juba, only 1,500 soldiers were deployed, a number that could not defend him when fighting started in July 2016. But this time, the opposition wants assurances that this cannot happen again. Those security assurances the opposition wants include; cantoning all military personnel, demilitarising all big towns, big guns be put in stores and guarded by the international agencies.

Drop violence

As Odwar and Ms Teny were holding this meeting in Kampala, President Museveni was on the plane to Juba where he later addressed the Fourth Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) National Liberation Council Meeting.

Mr Museveni told warring factions to drop violence as a means of conflict resolution, saying it was inappropriate.

“When it comes to a political disagreement like we have here (South Sudan), we must have a scientific approach to its resolution, should it be resolved by force or other ways? Force should be reserved for the enemy. A disagreement among brothers should not be resolved by force,” President Museveni said.

Whatever the political differences, President Museveni told the South Sudan leaders to embrace dialogue and work towards having national elections.

“Some people have been coming to Uganda. Malong [Paul] and others. They come and talk to our people. They want to start a war because they claim Salva Kiir is being controlled by some elders. But should that be cause for war?” Museveni asked.

He described the deployment of Ugandan troops in 2013 to protect President Kiir as an opportunity he could not turn down to help SPLM reunite after Kiir asked him to help.

Christine Monaghan is research officer, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict

May 4 2018 (IPS) - When I visited South Sudan last year, I heard story after story about health professionals and humanitarian workers being prevented from doing critical work. Government officials regularly increased fees for nonprofits trying to alleviate the effects of conflict, stopped humanitarian convoys from delivering life-saving supplies, and erected bureaucratic obstacles designed to impede access to civilians in need.

“There are ‘sitting fees’ you need to pay to government and the opposition when negotiating access to deliver aid,” one aid worker told me. “There are ‘airport fees’ for landing at the airstrip; to carry cash into the field – anything more than $100 requires an authorization from at least five different ministries. You line everything up and then they will say something is missing or something has changed.”

These are just some examples of obstacles the South Sudanese government has created to prevent humanitarian workers from doing their vital work in a conflict zone. Government officials – and the opposition – have blatantly denied humanitarian aid, preventing civilians from accessing essential services and NGOs from functioning. This strategy is being used as a war tactic, and contributing to the spread of disease, injury and death.

The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance.





In a new report , Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict found that in 2016 and 2017, there were at least 750 incidents involving denial of humanitarian access, many of them committed by government authorities. In dozens of interviews with health, humanitarian and NGO workers I conducted in South Sudan and neighboring Uganda, I heard about many disturbing steps the government has taken to block access for humanitarian workers and NGOs.

In recent years, I have investigated denials of humanitarian access in many conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Yemen. But the extent to which this is happening in South Sudan is far beyond anything I have seen.

In March 2017, for example, the government increased work permits for foreigners from $100 to a staggering $10,000. Two months later, it increased registration fees for international NGOs, from $2,000 to $3,500. Government officials have also interfered in the recruitment of NGO staff by reviewing candidate lists and even sitting in on interviews and vetoing choices. They have frequently changed license and registration requirements, making it difficult for NGO staff to travel for work.

“The government has required new license plates at least three times, which also requires new driver’s licenses and new registrations,” a humanitarian worker told me. “They announce the new procedure on Thursday and then pull you over on Friday if you haven’t complied and make you pay a fee.”

All this is taking place in a country that is in desperate need of humanitarian aid. As of December, at least 20 percent of South Sudan’s 1,900 hospitals had closed, and about half were functioning with extremely limited capacity, according to the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Warring parties were responsible for at least 50 attacks on medical facilities in 2016 and 2017 – another part of the war strategy and a vicious way to prevent civilians from accessing care. As a result, malnutrition, cholera and famine are gripping parts of the country.

The strategy behind these actions is clear – it is part of the war arsenal. The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance. Since 2013, humanitarian organizations have provided up to 80 percent of all health care services in the country, according to OCHA.

As is often the case in conflict zones, children and women are disproportionately affected by these war tactics. Of the four million people who have been displaced, children and women make up to 85 percent of this number, according to OCHA.

At Watchlist, we are calling on South Sudanese government to uphold its obligations to allow for unimpeded humanitarian access. A dedicated independent body should be established to investigate incidents of denials of humanitarian access, and all procedures for humanitarian and NGO workers should be made consistent and transparent.

Even in wartime, there are rules to be followed. They are designed to limit the impact of conflict on children, women and civilians at large, and allow the most vulnerable to access humanitarian assistance. The government of South Sudan has shamelessly violated these rules and gone out of its way to endanger the lives of its own citizens.

The international community must take immediate action to end this insidious tactic of war that has had devastating consequences for the children of South Sudan.

Their convoy was en route to Tore from Yei town, early on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being are unknown. The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou demanded their swift return.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being,” said Mr. Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff, are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The ten humanitarian staff, all nationals, include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, one from the South Sudanese Development Organisation, (SSDO), two from ACROSS, three from Plan International and one from Action Africa Help (AAH).

“I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conducive to the delivery of assistance,” said Mr. Noudehou.

This is the second incident involving aid workers being held by armed groups in April alone, and the third in six months.

13,south+sudan,"Military expenditure in the region continued to drop last year, with South Sudan cutting back its spending by more than 50 per cent, as its economy struggled from the effects of the prolonged political crisis.

The region used $2.73 billion on military-related expenses, down from $2.78 billion in 2016, and a high of $3.6 billion in 2015, according to data released on Tuesday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).

South Sudan spent just $72 million on its military, down from its all-time high of $1.1 billion in 2014 at the height of hostilities between the government and rebels led by former vice-president Riek Machar.

Kenya remained the region’s top military spender, at $963.5 million last year, up from $933.1 million the previous year.

Tanzania spent $593.1 million, up from $544.2 million, while Uganda saw a drop from its 2016 high of $523.4 million to $444.6 million.

Rwanda’s 2017 spending marginally rose to $111 million from $107.3 million the previous year, while Burundi continued to be the region least military spender at $63.9 million in 2017, down from $66.5 million.

Kenya’s National Treasury gave $90 million to the military for weapons acquisition ($74 million) and personnel emoluments ($16 million) to the end of June this year.

Slashed spending

Last month, Sipri reported that Kenya had slashed its spending on military hardware by half to $13 million from $28 million in 2016.

Last year, Nairobi purchased a second-hand naval gun, AK-630 30mm, from Montenegro for modernisation of Jasiri OPV (offshore patrol vessel), Sipri records shows. And this year, the navy received the last six Metal Shark patrol boats.

The other four were handed over last year, with their total cost being $4.9 million.

As part of its military partnership with Jordan, Kenya also received an unknown number of AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters.

The country also received its last two deliveries of the Huey II helicopter in July 2017, which is powered by a new Honeywell T53-L-703 engine, enabling it to have an improved hover performance in hot conditions, mirroring its needs in Somalia.

Light helicopters

Kenya’s 2018 spending is expected to rise as it is expecting the delivery of 12 MD 530F armed light helicopters at a cost of $253 million. The orders placed in May 2017 included the provision of MD 530F ‘cayuse warrior’ light attack helicopters, 24 HMP 400 machine gun pod systems, 24 M260 rocket launcher systems, and assorted ammunition.","Kenya’s military bill rises as Uganda’s, South Sudan’s fall",http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kenya-military-bill-rises-Uganda-South-Sudan-fall/688334-4548136-ttpfpv/

Nyal town is located in Northern Panyijiar County, Unity State, along the banks of the Sudd, the third largest swamp in the world. Since the beginning of the crisis, IDPs from Unity and Jonglei States have perceived Nyal as a safe location with ample resources. Recently, Nyal has also become a key location for people travelling to and from nearby islands.

Since 1 November 2016, REACH has monitored three ports in Nyal - Gap Port, Nyal Port and Katieth Port - to record the arrivals and departures on a daily basis. The information gathered covers household (HH) demographics, key push and pull factors, health concerns, vulnerable populations, and general transportation routes. The daily data was synthesised to provide evidence for more effective humanitarian planning.

The REACH team collected information from 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to ensure complete coverage of Nyal’s three ports. REACH teams attempt to interview all arrivals and departures at the household level using a contextualised survey. However, the data presented here is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population. This factsheet is based on data on 626 people departing (150 HHs), 429 people arriving (103 HHs), and 8 people transiting (3 HHs), which was collected from 5 to 29 March 2018.","South Sudan Displacement Crisis: Nyal Port Monitoring - Panyijiar County, Unity State, South Sudan (March 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-displacement-crisis-nyal-port-monitoring-panyijiar-county-unity-6

NEW YORK — Continued attacks on health facilities and blocked access to aid organizations are worsening the humanitarian situation in South Sudan, according to the international human rights coalition Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict.

At least 20 percent of South Sudan’s 1,900 hospitals had closed as of December 2017, and about 50 percent were functioning at a very limited capacity, according to Watchlist’s report “Everyone and Everything Is a Target,” released Monday. The report looks at the conflict’s impact on health care and aid from Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2017 through interviews with refugees, humanitarian personnel, and aid actors.

The new findings come as 10 South Sudanese aid workers — including three United Nations staff — were declared missing this week by the U.N.

Seventy percent of South Sudanese lack access to adequate health care. And more than 7 million people in South Sudan — nearly two-thirds of the population — are in need of humanitarian aid, and risk becoming food insecure in the coming months without sustained humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Some health facilities have been attacked during the 5-year-old civil conflict between government and opposition forces, while others have been directly targeted. Meanwhile, relief efforts by international and local nonprofit organizations are severely complicated by the restrictions and access issues aid workers face.

“We were not surprised on the number of attacks [in South Sudan]. There have been fairly routine stories coming out on targeting NGO-run facilities. But we were surprised by the number of denials [of access] and different forms denials have taken,” said Christine Monaghan, a research officer at Watchlist and the report’s author.

These denials of access go beyond aid convoys being turned back at a checkpoint.

“It’s conceivable you have an NGO in Juba trying to fly to a smaller town. On the way to the airport they might be pulled over because the government yesterday put in new requirements for NGO vehicles. They don’t have a license plate, and they have to pay a fine,” Monaghan said. “At the airport, the authorization they were told was required might have changed. They might have to pay a fee or denied access to board the flight entirely. They have to pay a fee to land the plane. The list goes on and on.”

Last year, aid agencies reported 1,159 humanitarian access incidents in South Sudan — the highest number of incidents reported during the conflict, and an increase from the 908 estimated in 2016, according to OCHA.

During Watchlist’s reporting period there were at least 50 attacks on medical facilities and personnel in the form of arson, looting, and kidnapping and 750 denials of humanitarian access — although numbers are likely an underestimate, according to the coalition, which includes Human Rights Watch and World Vision.

Insecurity and access issues are blocking millions of South Sudanese from receiving health care. In some cases, medical facilities are operational even when civilians have fled from the region.

In this case, “It is an NGO-funded project, keeping a facility open, providing them medical equipment — but the only people there to treat are party to the conflict,” Monaghan said.

The healthcare shortages are contributing to preventable illnesses — such as malnutrition, respiratory infections, and diarrhea — becoming epidemics.

The number of people suffering from malnutrition is expected to rise from 5 million to 5.5 million people this year. Famine was declared in two districts in north-central Sudan last year, impacting approximately 100,000 people. The country again faces the risk of famine, aid officials warned this week.

The South Sudan report is Watchlist’s latest analysis of conflict, following similar reports on Yemen and Afghanistan last year. While the conflicts are all quite different, some of their effects on civilians are comparable, Monaghan says.

“The impact on children winds up being similar. Children are the most impacted and the most vulnerable. Women, particularly pregnant and lactating women, are at high risk as well,” she said.","Attacks on aid workers, health facilities leave millions in South Sudan without care, report finds",https://www.devex.com/news/attacks-on-aid-workers-health-facilities-leave-millions-in-south-sudan-without-care-report-finds-92633

Akobo town is located in the eastern side of Akobo County, Jonglei State, close to the land and river border crossings with Ethiopia. Akobo is a key point of trade and transit between South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Since the beginning of the crisis, this route has been used by South Sudanese heading to or coming back from refugee camps in Ethiopia. In two locations, Tirgol Port and Market Port, REACH staff has recorded arrivals and departures of South Sudanese on a daily basis since May 2015.

19,south+sudan,"Black market fuel prices surged on Saturday in Khartoum and other Sudanese towns as petrol and diesel shortages forced residents to queue for hours outside gas stations.

Fuel supplies began dwindling in early April, with officials blaming maintenance delays at a key refinery, although foreign currency shortages have also played a role.

The crisis has since escalated despite official pledges to resolve it.

The shortage has hiked prices of petrol on the black market, with a gallon costing 150 pounds ($5.30, 4.40 euros) in Khartoum, over five times the official price of 27 pounds.

""I purchased two gallons at this high cost from the black market,"" said Mohamed Abbas, a resident of a working class neighbourhood in the capital.

""I bought it from someone who had filled his car tank after waiting the whole night at a fuel station.""

Another Khartoum resident told AFP that he too had waited through the night outside a fuel station to fill his tank.

""From 11:00 pm Friday until 7:00 am today I was waiting in my car at a fuel station,"" he said.

Most petrol stations were receiving less than their alloted quotas of petrol and diesel, with attendants often keeping the outlets shut once they sold their stock.

Farmers too complained that they were unable to transport their products to market as hundreds of trucks had been grounded.

""My entire crop of tomatoes is destroyed,"" said Ali Khider, a farmer from the state of Jazira.

""For a week now I have been unable to transport it to the main market because there is no vehicle.""

Officials promised a quick end to the crisis, saying it was caused by a delay in maintenance work at the country's main refinery north of Khartoum.

But an acute shortage of foreign currency has also aggravated the situation.

""There are some oil tankers waiting at Port Sudan to be unloaded but there's a delay in paying them,"" Minister of State for Oil Saadeddin Bushra told lawmakers this week.

21,south+sudan,"""I'm afraid I'll starve to death,"" said Gatdin Bol. Curled on a dirt floor, the frail 65-year-old said he survives only by eating fruit from the trees in this remote South Sudanese town in the shadow of civil war.

Three months ago when government troops attacked Bol's hometown in Jonglei state they stole everything he owned, including his food, he said. He fled with his wife and four children, walking for two months until they reached Kandak in Ayod County. They remain hungry. The planting season has yet to begin and they missed the United Nations' food registration and aren't eligible for assistance.

Five years into South Sudan's civil war more than 7 million people are facing severe hunger without food aid, according to the latest analysis by the U.N. and the government. Aid workers warn that a recent surge in fighting could once again plunge thousands of people into famine.

""In the places where there is displacement and we can't get there, it's a cause for concern,"" Adnan Khan, the World Food Program country director, told The Associated Press during a food distribution this week in the rebel-held town of Kandak.

Ayod is one of 11 counties in South Sudan that face extreme hunger. Remote and lacking basic resources like water and health care, the majority of its residents subsist on food aid.

""Ayod remains precarious as people heavily rely on food drops, which they then have to share with displaced kin. With very few of them cultivating and the rainy season set to disrupt humanitarian activities the situation can only get worse,"" said Nicholas Kerandi, food security analyst for the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

During the visit to Kandak, several people told AP they had nothing to eat.

""The army looted my garden and took my food. If I don't find food I can go days without eating,"" said Puot Kuony, hanging his head.

In March, the 45-year-old said he saw soldiers shoot and kill his uncle and run over him with a truck before stealing Kuony's food while attacking his hometown of Wau. He fled to Kandak with his wife and three children, but unable to cultivate and without a food registration card he begs for rations from neighbors.

Authorities in Kandak estimate that half the population, about 9,000 people, have been displaced from other parts of Jonglei state, which has been at the heart of the fighting. Since March about 1,800 people have arrived, straining the community's few resources.

Residents blame South Sudan's civil war for their deteriorating situation.

""We want peace so people can move around and cultivate and not feel trapped. Everyone across South Sudan relies on food relief and as a leader of the country you can't say that's OK,"" said Jung Gony Yut, humanitarian coordinator for the opposition in Magok County.

South Sudan's government is doing what it can to ensure that ""normalcy"" returns to its people, said spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. In the worst-affected areas the government asks aid workers to step in and provide relief, including opposition-held areas, he said.

But the international community's patience is wearing thin as reports continue of aid workers being blocked from carrying out their work, and as peace talks yield little progress. The next round of talks begins May 17.

Thousands of people had fled to the swamps, surviving on wild vegetables and fruit alone, the chief of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, David Shearer, said in a statement.

""Earlier this year it felt like we were moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""But after seeing the effects on civilians of this conflict, I believe there is a real risk that the situation will further undermine the chance for lasting peace.""

Tom Gitogo, the CEO, said the NGO world in South Sudan is driving the economy, with high demand for medical cover.

“We want to work with NGOs to enrol medical cover in South Sudan. This is one of our growth strategy and just last week we won the medical scheme of the biggest oil producer in South Sudan – DAR Petroleum Operating Company Ltd worth $4.3 million (Sh430 million),” said Mr Gitogo during a financial analysts briefing session in Nairobi.

The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)-listed insurer’s CEO said many South Sudanese are also getting medical services in Kenya and Uganda.

South Sudan was the only regional subsidiary which generated income in 2017 — profit of Sh10 million largely from investment income.

“The problem we have with South Sudan is political instability. For us we are there to stay, but we’ll not invest heavily for the time being,” said Mr Gitogo. The group’s other subsidiaries are in Uganda and Malawi. CIC also plans to expand to Tanzania once the regional businesses stabilises.

South Sudan’s peace pact monitoring team is proposing a stronger mandate for the regional protection force to ensure the revised agreement is implemented in full once signed.

In its latest proposal, the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) says the situation in South Sudan, where armed groups have sprouted, will make it difficult for stakeholders to take part in the peace bid, unless their security is assured.

""The deployment of the Regional Protection Force (RPF), accompanied by the right mandate, is pivotal in ensuring the inclusive implementation of the peace agreement,"" JMEC, chaired by former Botswana President Festus Mogae, says in its latest report.

The Commission says the RPF should be let to protect the entire South Sudan as opposed to the situation now where they mainly guard installations in Juba, in order to contain the armed groups terrorising civilians and violating the ceasefire agreements reached last year.

""The effective implementation of the revitalised peace implementation with full participation of all South Sudanese stakeholders can be realised, inter alia, by the security and safety to be provided by the RPF.""

MILITANT GROUPS

Formed to monitor the peace agreement signed between President Salva Kiir and his nemesis Riek Machar, the Commission formed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) admits some portions of that agreement have collided with reality.

For example, while the deal was between two top adversaries, splinter groups have increased.

The most recently launched group is that by former South Sudan military chief Paul Malong, the South Sudan United Front.

Malong has staked claim on the negotiation table.

The main facilitators at Igad have yet to accommodate him, although a meeting scheduled for talks at the end of April was postponed to mid-May to allow for ""shuttle diplomacy"" between mediators and parties, according to a statement released by the Igad secretariat last week.

SOLDIERS

The RPF was formed in 2016 through a UN Security Council Resolution (UNSC) following violence in Juba that saw Dr Machar flee from his post as First Vice President.

According to UNSC Resolution 2304 of 2016, the RPF is to protect key facilities and routes in and out of Juba as well as secure the UN installations and personnel helping those displaced by the violence.

The UNSC allowed the RPF, numbering 4,000, ""to use all necessary means, including undertaking robust action where necessary, and actively patrolling to accomplish the RPF mandate"".

The RPF is to be a part of the current UN Mission in South Sudan, sourced mainly from the Mission’s troop contributing countries, but with an extra mandate of combat.

Currently led by Rwanda's Brig-Gen jean Mupenzi, the RPF includes soldiers from Rwanda, Nepal and Bangladesh.

ELECTIONS

Known as the High-Level Revitalisation Forum, the talks which take place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, are supposed to revise the 2015 Agreement after it failed to end the violence.

Specifically, it is supposed to include all the warring parties, include more civil society groups and women, restore permanent ceasefire, implement the agreed deal in full and develop a realistic timeline from the transitional government to that formed through free and fair elections.

But the process has been affected by infighting.

For example, some opposition groups and the government accuse one another of armed attacks thus violating the ceasefire.

There are also questions on who should attend the event.

President Kiir does not want Dr Machar to take part in the talks and there is the problem of growing humanitarian crises.

STARVATION

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Unocha), the violence has displaced about 4.3 million within the country, 2.4 million to neighbouring countries and 5.3 million have no food.

At least one million people are at risk of starvation.

The JMEC report covers the challenges faced between December last year and March this year even though the shelling began in December 2013.

The Commission says South Sudan is also facing a cash crunch, delaying any formation of structures necessary to return normalcy.

For example, high inflation and low revenues from oil (its main export) means it cannot gather MPs to pass relevant laws to create reconciliation teams, amend the laws on military structures and permanent legal bodies to punish culprits.

In addition, despite the agreement requiring all armed groups to declare their weapon stocks, troop numbers and lay down arms, both sides have been uncooperative, indicating further violence is possible.",S Sudan peace team pushes for tough security measures,https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/S-Sudan-peace-team-proposes-tough-security-measures/1066-4547142-fowjd2/index.html
