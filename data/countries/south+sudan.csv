0,south+sudan,"South Sudan's former military chief, Paul Malong, on Tuesday announced the formation of a new opposition party to challenge President Salva Kiir.

Malong said the South Sudan United Front (SS-UF) was founded to ""arrest the carnage"" of South Sudan's ongoing civil war.

In a statement, the former ally of Kiir accused the president of plundering the country ""with reckless impunity.""

A new player in the upcoming peace talks

Malong said he wants the new party to participate in peace talks, which are due to take place later this month in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

""For these talks to yield a long-lasting solution to South Sudan, we must discuss the root causes of the conflict,"" Malong said. ""This is the only way we will achieve peace for posterity.""

Malong also said Kiir should ""not be entrusted with midwifing"" any agreement from the talks.

The new party is the 14th opposition group which plans to participate in the peace talks. Ahmed Soliman, a research associate with the Africa Program at Chatham House, told DW that Malong will likely play a significant role in the discussions.

""Given that he has backing and he has support, he is clearly going to be one of the actors that has to be looked at as part of an overarching deal,"" he said.

Former South Sudanese military chief, Paul Malong, and President Salva Kiir were once allies and are both members of the ethnic Dinka community

Military chief turned rebel

Malong was appointed military chief in January 2014 and attempted to stamp out the rebel group of former president Riek Machar.

He was dismissed from his position in May 2017 and placed under house arrest. He was later released for medical treatment and fled to neighboring Kenya. He never returned, prompting Kiir to declare him a rebel.

""Malong has confirmed what we have been saying from the day he left Juba,"" said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. ""We have said time and time again Malong is a rebel. This is what he has been working for.""

Chatham House's Soliman believes Malong's latest move is indeed a form of rebellion against his former allies and is likely to draw plenty of support.

""As a military man he will have an armed backing, but we don't know what that armed backing will look like in terms of size, or in terms of those who join his group,"" he said, ""We know that they are an additional actor in an very fragmented and hostile conflict where active fighting is taking place. Malong's history would seem to suggest that he would have armed support and this won't simply be a political undertaking.""

As a member of the ethnic Dinka community — like Kiir — Malong continues to enjoy significant support. South Sudan's conflict has increasingly involved a variety of ethnic groups in the region, although it initially pitted the Dinka and Machar's Nuer against one another.

During his time as military chief, Malong was accused of controlling an ethnic militia known as ""Dot Ke Beny"" (Rescue the President) or ""Mathiang Anoor"" (Brown caterpillar), which carried out human rights abuses against civilians.

In September last year, the US Treasury Department accused Malong and other senior South Sudanese officials of ""destabilizing South Sudan"" and enforced sanctions on them.

A country at war

South Sudan has remained in a state of civil war since the end of 2013 after seceding from Sudan in 2011. Since the beginning of the conflict, more than four million inhabitants have fled and tens of thousands have been killed.

A ceasefire was signed on December 24, however it was broken only hours later. The most recent talks held in February failed to yield results.

PEOPLE TARGETED IN 2017: 6.2 M

PEOPLE REACHED BY THE END OF 2017: 5.4 M

In 2017, South Sudan’s conflict was in its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Nearly 4.3 million people – one in three South Sudanese – have been displaced, including more than 1.8 million who are internally displaced and about 2.5 million who are in neighbouring countries. About 700,000 people left South Sudan in 2017.

Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, the crisis was driven by both intensified clashes in Koch and Mayendit and food insecurity, which reached dire conditions. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit counties most affected. Hundreds of thousands of people fled to Uganda, where the population of South Sudanese refugees peaked at over one million in August.

Food insecurity and malnutrition in South Sudan reached record levels in 2017. In February, famine was declared in parts of Unity, meaning some 100,000 people faced starvation. Even though a concerted multi-sector response was able to halt the localized famile in Leer and Mayendit, some 4.9 million people were severely food insecure in South Sudan during that period. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles and kala-azar continued to spread in 2017. Cholera was most severe, with over 20,000 cases reported, including 436 related deaths.

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, making it the deadliest year for aid workers on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access incidents were reported, the highest number of incidents in a year, representing a significant increase, compared to 908 in 2016 and 909 in 2015. Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated in 54 incidents from multiple locations across the country.

Despite these challenges, aid agencies assisted over 5.4 million people in 2017. This included: more than 5.1 million people who received food assistance; over 2.8 million people vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped to access clean water; 930,000 people assisted with vital non-food items; around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis who were supported with access to education.

The 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion received. Clusters with the most significant funding gaps included Health, Protection, and Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items.",2017 South Sudan Humanitarian Response in Review,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/2017-south-sudan-humanitarian-response-review
2,south+sudan,"The two aid workers have been killed in separate attacks over the weekend in civil war-torn South Sudan, the United Nations said on Tuesday.

A statement says armed men shot at a ""clearly marked"" aid vehicle near Bentiu town in Unity state, killing a local worker with the Hope Restoration organisation. And a local worker with the UNIDO organisation was killed near Leer town in Unity state.

They are the first two aid workers to be killed this year in South Sudan, which is one of the world's most dangerous places for aid workers. At least 98 have been killed since the fighting began in December 2013, most of them local workers.

The UN also says seven local workers with the SSUHA aid organisation were abducted March 25 by opposition forces while delivering health supplies in Morobo county in Central Equatoria. The UN is demanding their unconditional release.

The opposition says the aid workers weren't abducted but were taken because they didn't have ""proper clearance.""

""Our investigation says some of them are government agents,"" opposition spokesperson Lam Paul Gabriel told The Associated Press. He said they were trying to ""clear the case"" so the workers can be released.

In November, President Salva Kiir ordered unimpeded access for aid organisations throughout the country but attacks have persisted.

Rights groups have called on all sides in the conflict to protect civilians and aid workers.

""The brutal killing and abductions of aid workers are possible war crimes and should not be tolerated,"" Jehanne Henry, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the AP.

3,south+sudan,"The former head of the South Sudan army, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has formed a new rebel group known as the South Sudan United Front (SSUF).

General Paul Malong Awan released a statement Monday outlining the objectives of his new group, which he said will fight ""systemic corruption, stop ongoing carnage, steer the country [South Sudan] toward democracy, justice, equality and freedom.""

Awan also pledged to respect the cessation of hostilities agreement signed in December last year by the various warring parties and he urged the regional bloc, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to allow his new group to be part of the high-level revitalization forum meeting scheduled April 26 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

A spokesman of the South Sudan United Front, Sunday De John, told VOA's ""South Sudan in Focus"" program Monday from Nairobi, Kenya, that the new group will work toward achieving peace in South Sudan.

""The real change that would be impacted on the lives of people [in South Sudan] through good governance and the rule of law. The current state of South Sudan is not commensurate with the principles on which South Sudanese went to the bush to [fight] for 21 years.'' John said.

South Sudan Information Minister and government spokesman Michael Makuei declined to comment Monday. He scheduled an interview with VOA on Tuesday.

Sanctions

The European Union imposed sanctions in February on Awan and three current South Sudanese officials implicated in human rights violations and obstructions of their country's peace process.

John said the sanctions imposed on Awan by the U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union are not justified. He said the former chief of staff was carrying out orders from President Salva Kiir, who is the commander in chief of the South Sudan army.

Awan had been a longtime governor of Northern Bahr el Ghazal before he was appointed chief of general staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army by Kiir. His appointment followed mass resignations by senior generals who claimed the SPLA was involved in ethnic cleansing and war crimes.

Awan was fired by Kiir in May 2017, and attempted to return to his hometown of Aweil. However, his convoy was intercepted at Yirol. He was persuaded by the elders in Yirol to return to Juba to talk with Kiir, and was placed under house arrest there.

The former army chief was released in November 2017 to seek medical treatment in Kenya after one of his wives and community leaders pleaded for his release.

Rebel groups

Awan's statement expressed interest in joining various rebel groups that have been meeting at the Ethiopia capital in an effort to end the conflict in South Sudan.

""It is not an opportunistic move. It is the comprehensive peace that is desired by South Sudanese,'' John said.

It is not immediately clear how many people have joined Awan's new rebel group. John said the size and the structure of the forces of South Sudan United Front will remain a secret.

The conflict has devastated the country, causing a humanitarian, political and economic crisis. More than 1.5 million people are on the brink of famine — twice as many as the same time last year. More than 4 million people, or a third of South Sudan's population, have fled their homes, causing Africa's largest refugee crisis.

A rebellion by South Sudan’s former army chief signals a further escalation in the more than four-year civil war, complicating peace talks just as Africa’s youngest nation faces a looming famine.

The announcement by Paul Malong, who led President Salva Kiir’s forces before being fired last year, adds yet another armed group to a conflict that’s claimed tens of thousands of lives, has been marked by widespread atrocities and caused Africa’s largest refugee crisis since it erupted in December 2013.

Malong’s rebellion comes amid “what is already a boiling situation in the country,” said Augustino Ting Mayai, director of research at the Sudd Institute, a think tank in the capital, Juba. “He has added fuel to the current crisis.”

Malong, who moved to neighboring Kenya after his dismissal, was among three current or former South Sudanese officials sanctioned by the U.S. in September for their alleged roles in destabilizing the country. The army he controlled has been repeatedly accused by the United Nations of atrocities including the rape and killings of civilians.

His insurgent group, the South Sudan United Front, on Monday decried “systematic corruption which has devastated the lives of all citizens on a daily basis.”

Economic Chaos

A slump in oil production and lower global prices has caused economic chaos in South Sudan, which depends on crude for almost all its revenue. Some areas of the country are on the brink of famine and two-thirds of the 12 million population may face food shortages by May.

Peace talks are due to resume in Ethiopia on April 26 between the government and nine opposition groups, not including Malong’s. The negotiations seek to revive a 2015 agreement that shattered in mid-2016 weeks afters its enactment, ushering in more violence and fresh rebellions in the southern Equatoria region.

Malong in his statement didn’t say how many fighters he commands. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said by phone that Malong’s declaration was “overdue” and the ex-army chief had “never worked on anything good for the country.”

“If he is going to fight South Sudan, he should understand that the same people that he was using to fight the rebels are the same people who will fight him,” Ateny said.

Analyst Mayai said that although Malong may find it difficult to muster large-scale support because of South Sudan’s ethnic divisions, any rebellion he does organize is likely to extend the conflict.

It “is going to be tough for him in terms of human resources to wage a full-scale war,” Mayai said by phone.",Ex-Army Chief's Rebellion Adds Fuel to Fire in South Sudan's War,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/ex-army-chief-s-rebellion-adds-fuel-to-fire-in-south-sudan-s-war
5,south+sudan,"South Sudan's former army chief, Paul Malong, recently formed his rebel group, the South Sudan United Front, as a result of political ambition, a government spokesman told VOA News on Tuesday.

""We have been monitoring his activities in Nairobi,"" spokesman Michael Makuei told South Sudan in Focus. ""He had started recruitment, and he went to Khartoum, where he also did recruitment. Some of his followers here followed him, and according to our sources he has now declared his movement to overthrow the government and is charging the government with atrocities and corruption.""

Malong, once one of President Salva Kiir's closest allies, was fired by Kiir in May 2017 and placed under house arrest in Juba. In November, he was granted permission to leave the country on medical grounds. He now lives in Nairobi.

Makuei said Malong was removed from his post because he was planning to stage a coup against Kiir. He said Malong had formed his new movement because of personal grudges against the Kiir administration.

""It was observed that he had suspicious activities that would lead to something like what he has declared now. He wanted to make a coup, but the government moved faster than him and he was released,"" Makuei told VOA.

Malong's spokesman told South Sudan in Focus on Monday that the former army chief had founded the South Sudan United Front to end what he called ""the suffering of the South Sudanese people and to restore democracy and the rule of law.""

'Nest' of corruption

In a statement Monday, Malong said: ""The country has become a nest for systematic corruption, which has devastated the lives of all citizens on a daily basis."" He cited nepotism, ongoing conflict, poor health care and a collapsed economy as evidence that Kiir had failed.

Makuei accused Malong of similar wrongdoing, saying he had presided over widespread atrocities as army chief.

""He is actually at the top of the corruption. He is at the top of atrocities ever committed, because all that he did during his time as chief of general staff were atrocities that were beyond anything. He has destroyed the army through corruption,"" said Makuei.

Makuei said the Kiir administration would not reach out to Malong and strongly warned him against mounting attacks on government positions. He advised Malong to the join the opposition during the next and final phase of peace talks known as the High Level Revitalization Forum, scheduled to take place at the end of April in Addis Ababa.

Malong said in his statement that his group would sign the Cessation of Hostilities agreement, which the government and various armed groups signed in December. He also asked the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which is serving as mediator for the talks, to include his group in the opposition coalition that will negotiate with the government in Addis Ababa.",S. Sudan: 'Political Ambition' Behind Ex-Army Chief's New Rebel Group,https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-former-army-chief-rebel-group-stems-from-political-ambition/4341194.html
6,south+sudan,"In South Sudan, the causes of famine run deeper than just food shortage. Since gaining independence from its northern neighbor in 2011, South Sudan has seen its long-sought peace dissolve rapidly into bitter conflict, turning the world’s youngest country into one of its most unstable. The conflict has thrown South Sudan’s already-fragile institutions into disarray and left much of the nation fearing for its safety, as government and opposition forces clash across the country. In this climate, food has become increasingly scarce. Crops are looted, roads are destroyed, and government forces continue to block food shipments to opposition-controlled regions.

Though it is clear that war has limited peoples’ access to food, social issues help fuel the acute hunger in South Sudan and perpetuate the cycle of famine and violence: polygyny—one man marrying multiple women—and forced marriages. With more than 4.8 million people in South Sudan facing food insecurity—almost half the country’s population—many families have turned to dowry payments to put food on the table. With hunger now gripping much of the country, activists report that South Sudanese families are coming under increased pressure to force young women and girls into marriage in order to obtain cattle, which serve as a source of food, financial security, and social status. For many young South Sudanese women and girls, marriage is not a choice but a tragic obligation.

The issue of forced marriages is as much linked to hunger and violence as it is to the unequal and abusive treatment of women. In South Sudan, the practice of polygyny is both legal and widespread. Girls as young as 12 years old are pushed into marriages with men many years older, many of whom meet dowry demands by marrying off women in their own family. Educated women are viewed as arrogant, disrespectful, and promiscuous, so families usually attempt to marry their daughters before they have even completed school in order to maximize the dowry they receive. Unsurprisingly, these practices cause women to suffer physical and emotional abuse: Child brides can suffer acutely from the trauma of separation from their families and the expectation to engage in a sexual relationship before they are willing. Famine has not so much created these problems as it has further skewed marriage incentives, adding fuel to an already raging fire.

In addition to threatening the well being of young women in South Sudan, polygyny also perpetuates civil conflict in the region. Polygyny inevitably creates a class of unmarried, usually poorer, men. Constrained by their socioeconomic status and unable to find wives, these men are pushed out of their home communities. With the promises of a bride and heightened social status, joining the armies of the civil war’s opposing factions becomes increasingly appealing. At times, it may seem like the only way for a young man to escape polygyny’s underclass.

International interventions in this civil war have consisted of humanitarian responses, as well as diplomatic and economic pressure. A recent arms embargo imposed by the United States joins other targeted sanctions, but with Russian and Chinese resistance on the Security Council, there is little hope for significant UN pressure on South Sudan. Humanitarian assistance, specifically food aid, remains the most effective international tool in alleviating the effects of the conflict. The United States has allocated over a billion dollars towards food aid—over $500 million in 2017 alone—which, along with contributions from other countries, comprises the single largest sector of international humanitarian spending on South Sudan.

Although food aid helps to alleviate food insecurity in the short term, it fails to address the underlying economics of forced marriages that contribute to the problem. A systemic imbalance in the marriage market created by polygynous marriages will continue to pull young girls out of schools and force young men into a future of instability and violence. Thus, while remaining an important immediate response to South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis, food aid falls short of creating the meaningful social stability required for peace and prosperity in the country.

The key to a long-lasting solution is education. Families who rely on their daughters’ dowries for security see education as a threat, so they treat educated young women as economic objects. It is imperative for families to look toward education rather than away from it. Having a more educated female population generally leads to later marriages, lower fertility rates, lower maternal and infant mortality rates, and greater social mobility. Through education, daughters can become valuable workers who contribute to their families using their skillsets rather than through just the value of their marriage.

Challenging cultural norms requires significant commitment of time and effort, but change is both possible and necessary. A unique opportunity to achieve this shift lies in pairing food aid with education; by doing so, the international community can implement targeted interventions, as aid workers decide how and where to distribute food. Policy makers can draw inspiration from publicly and privately funded Food for Education programs, such as the US Department of Agriculture’s McGovern-Dole Program, which incentivize school attendance by providing school meals along with training to teachers and other support activities. These successes illustrate a potential plan for a similar program which boosts girls’ education, challenges the practice of forced marriages, and serves as the first step toward finding a long-term solution to South Sudan’s food shortage crisis.

The situation in South Sudan is dire: The vicious cycle of the country’s civil war and its polygynous traditions have led to ever-deepening hunger and violence. Both a cause and a consequence of South Sudanese force marriage practices, the current food crisis calls for a re-evaluation of current aid efforts in the region. Food aid, though effective in the short-run, fails to offer a sustainable, long-term solution to forced marriages and the marginalization of women in South Sudanese society. True progress will only come when both the country’s immediate and deep-rooted issues are tackled in a way that acknowledges and addresses the indivisible link between the two.

In February 2018, population displacement was reported in Unity and Central Equatoria following clashes between government and opposition forces. From 16 to 17 February, fighting in Bauw, Koch County (Unity), led to civilian deaths, destruction of homes and displacement. Brief clashes were also reported in Leer town. In Central Equatoria, over 3,360 IDPs (653 households) were displaced from Makaia to Yei town, after fighting broke out.

During the same month, the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis estimated that in the worst case scenario, 6.3 million people, or 57 per cent of the population of South Sudan, would be severely food insecure from February to April 2018. In Eastern Equatoria, health partners reported suspected cases of meningitis, with 162 suspected cases and 30 deaths in Iyire and Imurok payams, Torit County. In February, South Sudan declared the end of its longest and largest cholera outbreak, with no new cases of cholera reported in over seven weeks. Since June 2016, over 20,000 suspected cholera cases and 436 deaths had been reported.

During February, aid agencies assisted over 1.4 million people out of the 6 million people targeted in 2018. This included: more than 1.2 million who received food assistance and emergency livelihoods; more than 382,000 who were provided with access to clean water; nearly 9,000 people assisted with vital non-food items, including blankets and mosquito nets; nearly 61,000 children and pregnant and lactating women provided with emergency nutritional assistance; nearly 216,000 children supported with access to education in emergencies; more than 153,000 people who received health care services; and nearly 60,000 people who received gender-based violence, child protection and mine awareness education services",South Sudan: Humanitarian Dashboard (as of 28 February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-dashboard-28-february-2018

In the coming days, IOM will begin the second round of an oral cholera vaccination campaign in Malakal and Wau, South Sudan. The first round in March reached over 60,400 people above one year of age.

Also, in March, IOM led an eight-day reactive measles vaccination campaign in Aweil East, reaching over 83,700 children following an outbreak that began in February. IOM’s health rapid response team worked in close partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the State Ministry of Health, the International Rescue Committee and other health agencies.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can become life-threatening if complications, such as pneumonia, arise. The campaign, which involved over 117 teams of five people each, targeted children aged six to 59 months.

“Children are extremely vulnerable to outbreaks of measles and other contagious diseases, particularly in areas such as Aweil East where health conditions are further compromised by severe food insecurity and poor living conditions,” explained Derebe Tadesse, IOM Migration Health Officer. “The measles vaccine will save lives. With just one dose, 85 percent of children over nine months and 95 percent of children over twelve months of age are immune.”

Protracted displacement, access constraints and poor health and water and sanitation infrastructure have contributed to yearly cholera outbreaks in South Sudan since the crisis began in 2013; the longest lasted from June 2016 to February 2017, killing 436 people.

As a preventive measure, IOM completed the first round of several two-round oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Malakal and Wau, reaching approximately 24,300 and 36,100 individuals respectively in late March. The second-round campaigns are slated to begin in both locations in the coming days. The campaigns target both internally displaced persons within the Malakal and Wau protection of civilian sites and displaced and host communities in Malakal and Wau towns.

In 2017, IOM completed oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Unity, Warrap, and Eastern Equatoria, reaching more than 469,800 people with the vaccine.

Humanitarian Coordinator calls for urgent action to avert worsening food crisis in South Sudan

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Alain Noudehou, led a high-level delegation of donors, heads of humanitarian agencies and partners to Leer in Unity on 7 March to see firsthand the plight of the 90,000 people living in the area. The delegation also met with the Governor of Leer, community leaders and aid agencies who are currently assisting tens of thousands of people across the region.

""Due to seasonal time pressure, we need funding now to reach millions of people with multisectoral assistance during the dry season, through road transport and prepositioning life-saving aid supplies. These same activities will be many times more costly if done by air transport during the rainy season,” said Mr. Noudehou. The Humanitarian Coordinator noted his concern regarding the potential effects of taxes and fees on humanitarian organizations and staff, which not only take much needed-resources from front line operations, but are often unpredictable and disruptive to the humanitarian response.

“Once again, I strongly urge all parties to the conflict to stop the fighting and to ensure that humanitarian agencies are given free, safe and unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan,” said Mr. Noudehou. Leer was one of two counties affected by famine in 2017. Although the famine was stopped, the situation remains fragile, with about 85 per cent of the population predicted to reach crisis and emergency food insecurity conditions (IPC Phases 3 and 4) by the end of April 2018.

Almost two-thirds of the South Sudan population at risk of rising hunger

More than 7 million people in South Sudan—almost two-thirds of the population—could become severely food insecure in the coming months without sustained humanitarian assistance and access, three United Nations agencies warned on 26 February.

If this happens, it will be the highest ever number of food insecure people in South Sudan. The period of greatest concern will be the lean season, between May and July. Particularly at risk are 155,000 people, including 29,000 children, who could reach the most extreme levels of hunger if assistance is not provided and sustained.

Improved access and a concerted humanitarian response succeeded in halting famine last year. Despite this, the scale and scope of food insecurity are reaching new highs, while crop production is compromised.

FAO, UNICEF and WFP warn that progress made could be undone, and more people than ever could be pushed into severe hunger conditions during May-July, unless assistance and access are maintained. Close monitoring of the situation, particularly in counties most at risk, will remain critical

""The situation is extremely fragile, and we are close to seeing another famine. The projections are stark. If we ignore them, we will be faced with a growing tragedy. If farmers receive support to resume their livelihoods, we will see a rapid improvement in the country's food security situation due to increased local production,"" said Serge Tissot,

11,south+sudan,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is gravely concerned that South Sudan’s civil war continues to fuel horrific levels of violence in which civilians are injured and killed and property vital to their safety and survival is destroyed.

“My wife was shot,” said Ruey. “My children were shot…I was also shot. All of us became vulnerable.”

Ruey, his wife Nyalual, and two of their children were all injured by gunfire when fighting flared around their village near Nassir in February. One of the children—a seven-year-old boy—died as a result of the gunshot wound.

Ruey and his family members were among 44 patients who the ICRC evacuated by air earlier this year from Nassir to its field hospital in Ganyliel, South Sudan. One-third of them were women and children. Most of the injuries were gunshot wounds that required the care of ICRC’s surgical teams. For Nyalual, her leg could not be saved and she required on amputation.

“What you see a lot is bullet wounds, big injuries, mostly in the legs,” said Guido Serge Verslout, a physiotherapist for the ICRC based in Ganyliel. “Most of the wounds…were already infected…We had to do a lot of debridement to clean the wounds, heal the fractures.”

The conflict is also destroying civilian property and livelihoods—causing forced displacement and leaving people vulnerable to hunger and disease. As a result, food insecurity is widespread, with more than five million people in South Sudan estimated to be facing life-threatening levels hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.

Nyalual, who is now recovering at ICRC’s newly opened field hospital in Udier, says she is uncertain what she and her family will do to feed themselves when they return home. “The international community are the ones with the idea to give us food,” said Nyalual. “Without this food, we gather wild fruits and leaves, but now this food has [also] finished.”

So far this year, the ICRC has evacuated 180 people with war injuries. This follows an extremely volatile year in which the ICRC evacuated 834 war-wounded people and treated 1,685 patients in ICRC-supported hospitals. This was twice the number evacuated with war wounds in 2016.

The ICRC is fighting hunger in South Sudan by providing food rations and distributing seeds, farming tools, fishing kits, and other activities such as cattle vaccination that help families feed themselves and restore their livelihoods.

“There is no way we can leave a country like this and its population,” said Celine Degen, ICRC’s Head of Office in Ganyliel. “There are needs. They need to be addressed and as long as peace cannot be established, we cannot have proper services rendered by the authorities or even development agencies that may come longer term. There is absolutely a need for ICRC to be here.”

12,south+sudan,"JUBA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The UN migration agency said on Tuesday that it will begin the second round of oral cholera vaccination campaign in South Sudan's Malakal and Wau regions.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the first round in March reached over 60,400 people above one year of age.

""The second-round campaigns are slated to begin in both locations in the coming days,"" said the IOM in a statement released in Juba.

The UN agency said the campaigns target both internally displaced persons within the Malakal and Wau protection of civilian sites and displaced and host communities in Malakal and Wau towns.

According to the UN, protracted displacement, access constraints and poor health and water and sanitation infrastructure have contributed to yearly cholera outbreaks in South Sudan since the crisis began in 2013; the longest lasted from June 2016 to February 2017, killing 436 people.

As a preventive measure, IOM said, it completed the first of a two-round oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Malakal and Wau, reaching approximately 24,300 and 36,100 individuals respectively in late March.

The UN agency said it completed oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Unity, Warrap and Eastern Equatoria in 2017, reaching more than 469,800 people with the vaccine.

IOM said it also led an eight-day reactive measles vaccination campaign in Aweil East, reaching over 83,700 children following an outbreak that began in February.

The campaign, which involved over 117 teams of five people each, targeted children aged six to 59 months.

""Children are extremely vulnerable to outbreaks of measles and other contagious diseases, particularly in areas such as Aweil East where health conditions are further compromised by severe food insecurity and poor living conditions,"" said Derebe Tadesse, IOM Migration Health Officer.

13,south+sudan,"In March at the Carter Center in Atlanta, South Sudan’s minister of health announced that Guinea worm transmission had been stopped within South Sudan. It has been fifteen months since the last reported case, and the disease has a life cycle of twelve months. That means the disease is gone from South Sudan, though it could be reintroduced from elsewhere. The World Health Organization is expected to certify South Sudan as free of Guinea worm. Elimination of Guinea worm is a massive, even spectacular, achievement orchestrated by an American non-governmental organization, the Carter Center, working with African ministries of health, numerous local partners, and a veritable army of village volunteers.

In 2016, there were twenty-five reported cases of Guinea worm in the world, in South Sudan, Mali, Chad, and Ethiopia, but now, the disease is found only in the last three. Those three countries have a better health infrastructure than South Sudan, with its ongoing civil war and massive displacement of population. Hence, if the disease can be eliminated in South Sudan, it is likely soon to be entirely eliminated from the face of the earth. That would make it the second human disease after smallpox to be eliminated. It is to be hoped that polio will be the third.

When the Carter Center began its campaign in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases worldwide. Present in ancient Egypt and mentioned in the Old Testament, Guinea worm is (or was) a scourge of the poor. It is a parasite, the larvae of which are transmitted in water. After the larvae is ingested by a human body, a three-foot worm develops. The worm then makes its way out of the body through a sore, often on a foot, by excreting an acid. Guinea worm itself is not fatal, but it is excruciatingly painful, debilitating, and increases vulnerability to other diseases. There is no cure for the disease. Modern treatment is the same as it was for the ancient Egyptians: the emerging worm is carefully wrapped around a stick to prevent infection. Guinea worm can be prevented through the filtering of water. That requires a public education campaign.

The Carter Center had the imagination to take as its focus a disgusting but non-fatal disease that almost exclusively plagues the poor. With its campaign against Guinea worm, it might be argued that the Carter Center has done more than most official assistance programs to mitigate the lives of the African poor.

A UN publication announcing the end of Guinea worm in South Sudan noted that former president Jimmy Carter, the founder of the Carter Center, announced in 2015 that he had been diagnosed with cancer: “He said he was responding well to treatment and he expected to outlive the last case of Guinea worm. President Carter is now 95 and cancer free, and Guinea worm disease just lost the fight in South Sudan.”

14,south+sudan,"(Juba, 10 April 2018): The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, has strongly condemned the killing of an aid worker in Bentiu, Unity, and called for the immediate and unconditional release of seven others abducted by an armed group in Morobo County,

Central Equatoria.

Over the weekend, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, transporting five aid workers along Nhialdlu-Bentiu road, killing one national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO. CARE International staff were robbed at gunpoint while travelling in the vicinity on the same day.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 98 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013. Most have been South Sudanese nationals.

In a separate incident in Central Equatoria on 25 March, seven national staff from SSUHA, a national aid organization, were taken by SPLA-IO forces while travelling in a 3-vehicle convoy from Kupera County to Lainya County. The convoy was delivering supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Kupera, Limuro, Wuji and Koyoki.

Mr. Noudehou called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need. These events are a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance each day.","Humanitarian Coordinator condemns killing of aid worker, calls for the release of seven others held by armed group",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/humanitarian-coordinator-condemns-killing-aid-worker-calls-release-seven-others

Information obtained by this reporter indicate that Okwir, a resident of Starch Factory, Adyel Division in Lira Municipality has been working in South Sudan with JDF as a programmes director.

Intelligence and police Flying Squad team arrested Okwir, 39, on Sunday night following a tip-off by a concerned resident that he was in possession of a rifle.

During interrogation, Okwir told police that he had legally bought the gun from someone in an open market in South Sudan for his personal security.

According to police a charge of illegal possession of firearms with case file CRB 12/33/2018 has been preferred against him as they continue with their investigations.

Mr David Ongom Mudong, the North Kiyoga regional police spokesperson said: “The suspect admitted and directed us to where he was hiding the firearm. We found a 9MM Pistol model; BLOW P99 A CALL with serial NO. 8-002377 loaded with 4 rounds of live ammunitions,” Mr Ongom said.

Although he claimed he legally acquired the firearm from South Sudan, police have said it was illegal in Uganda since he was not registered.

“That is illegal, the law only permits security agencies to possess firearms, however, individuals who wish to acquire firearms should follow the right procedures as required by the Ugandan law within the Firearms Act,” Mr Ongom added.

When Daily Monitor contacted JDF president, Mr Deng Dhieu Leek, he confirmed that Mr Okwir was the organization’s employee.

16,south+sudan,"JOHANNESBURG — The two aid workers have been killed in separate attacks over the weekend in civil war-torn South Sudan, the United Nations said Tuesday.

A statement says armed men shot at a “clearly marked” aid vehicle near Bentiu town in Unity state, killing a local worker with the Hope Restoration organization. And a local worker with the UNIDO organization was killed near Leer town in Unity state.

They are the first two aid workers to be killed this year in South Sudan, which is one of the world’s most dangerous places for aid workers. At least 98 have been killed since the fighting began in December 2013, most of them local workers.

The U.N. also says seven local workers with the SSUHA aid organization were abducted March 25 by opposition forces while delivering health supplies in Morobo county in Central Equatoria. The U.N. is demanding their unconditional release.

The opposition says the aid workers weren’t abducted but were taken because they didn’t have “proper clearance.”

“Our investigation says some of them are government agents,” opposition spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told The Associated Press. He said they were trying to “clear the case” so the workers can be released.

In November, President Salva Kiir ordered unimpeded access for aid organizations throughout the country but attacks have persisted.

Rights groups have called on all sides in the conflict to protect civilians and aid workers.

“The brutal killing and abductions of aid workers are possible war crimes and should not be tolerated,” Jehanne Henry, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the AP.

UNICEF, in coordination with partners, responded to a suspected Meningitis outbreak (173 suspected cases; 31 deaths reported) in Eastern Equatoria, first reported 15 February. UNICEF supported with case management through the provision of essential drugs/supplies, establishing a treatment center, and community engagement and social mobilization through UNICEF’s partner (South Sudan Red Cross) whose trained volunteers conducted house-to-house sensitizations on meningitis and community surveillance.

Food insecurity and the nutrition situation remains dire, with further deterioration projected in May/July if appropriate, timely and integrated interventions are not taken. UNICEF has actioned a 180-day response plan but funding is critical for scale up efforts, especially in WASH and Health.

Ten Integrated Rapid Response Missions (IRRMs) with WFP have been conducted in most affected counties including Panyijaar, Baggari, Nassir, Raja, and Rubkona, reaching 131,819 people, including 28,317 children under the age of five. The UNICEF and WFP IRRM partnership has expanded to include FAO, providing beneficiaries with additional life-saving services.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Despite February’s declaration of the end of South Sudan’s longest and largest cholera outbreak, there is high risk of a new outbreak in South Sudan with the oncoming rainy season, coupled with poor sanitation condition, poor water and food handling practices. Children and women are the most vulnerable to an outbreak. The deteriorating food insecurity and nutrition situation could decrease the immunity of malnourished children, thereby increasing the consequences of a cholera outbreak. Other disease outbreaks (e.g. measles, and malaria) could also worsen the morbidity and mortality of children. The outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues to evolve in Eastern Lakes State, South Sudan, with another county affected. As of 9 March 2018, a total of 40 cases and four deaths have been reported from Yirol East (37 cases, 4 deaths) and Yirol West (3 cases, no deaths) counties. Of these, a total of six confirmed, three probable and 12 suspect RVF cases (with pending laboratory results) have been reported. Nineteen suspected cases were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. The majority of suspected cases have been women (57.1 per cent), and individuals aged 20-39 years make up the majority (72.2 per cent) of cases.

A suspected meningitis outbreak in Eastern Equatoria, first reported on 15 February, is on the decline with only two suspected cases reported in week 12 (19-25 March). A total of 173 cases with 31 deaths (CFR= 17.92 per cent) have been reported since the index case.

The February 2018 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projected 6.3 million (57 per cent) and 7.1 million (63 per cent) of the population are facing crisis and emergency (IPC Phases 4 and 3 respectively) acute food insecurity in the absence of humanitarian assistance in February-April and May-July 2018, respectively. 55,150 people are projected to face catastrophic nutrition conditions in February-April and May-July 2018, respectively.","UNICEF South Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, 28 February – 31 March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unicef-south-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-28-february-31-march-2018

Rebel general Moses Lokujo was in his element. The burly commander paced back and forth in front of an audience of roughly 100 civilians who had gathered at an elementary school in the tiny settlement of Pure near South Sudan’s border with Uganda, and gave an impassioned speech about the latest battle his men had fought in Kajo Keji county. The opposition fighters had suffered sizable losses, but it was a price they were willing to pay for a better South Sudan, he told the crowd in December. “If we were here for the money and the positions, we wouldn’t be here anymore,” he preached. Ad Policy

Lokujo had delivered many similar performances in order to galvanize grassroots support for the SPLM-IO, the main opposition movement, led by exiled rebel-leader Riek Machar. For much of 2017, the orations seemed to be working. The SPLM-IO had won over many South Sudanese who suffered at the hands of President Salva Kiir’s government, which has committed widespread human-rights abuses in the southern Equatoria region where Kajo Keji is located.

When I first came to Kajo Keji a year ago, locals spoke fondly of the opposition. They called the rebels “our boys,” and Lokujo referred to them as “my civilians.” People willingly donated food and money, hoping that the rebels would protect and eventually free them from an oppressive government. Many saw the SPLM-IO as a viable alternative to govern South Sudan, a country that gained independence in 2011 but has since been plagued by a brutal civil war, the biggest humanitarian crisis on the continent, massive corruption, and what many call a tribalistic government.

But when I returned in December, the mood had changed. Visibly tired of multiple displacements brought about by the latest battle, people looked at Lokujo and his men with skepticism, even disdain. They still clapped when the general paused his sermon to woo their applause—but only after being prompted by one of his soldiers. When the soldiers struck up a call-and-reply war song, only a handful of people joined in. After the spectacle was over and when we moved out of earshot, they told me about their frustrations.

NAIROBI — As the rainy season descends on South Sudan, an unprecedented number of people face severe food insecurity. Access to people in need is already difficult in the country, where a civil war has raged for more than four years. With the rains, access to these populations will now be further hampered as flooded roads become impassable, leaving populations isolated in pockets throughout the country and unable to receive emergency aid.

This year, some 5.3 million people — or 48 percent of the population — are estimated to be facing severe food insecurity in the post-harvest season in South Sudan, meaning that they are somehow dependent on humanitarian food aid. This is a 40 percent increase from last year. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification has warned that at its peak, this figure could reach 7.1 million people in need of assistance in the coming months.

The spread of the conflict has resulted in a higher number of people in need than previous years, said Simon Cammelbeeck, World Food Programme acting South Sudan country director. In the past, there were parts of the country that to a certain extent escaped the conflict. But over the past two years, the conflict has spread to essentially the whole country, leading to an escalating number of people in need. A famine situation is likely without an urgent increase in aid, according to a recent press release from the Norwegian Refugee Council.

“South Sudan’s food crisis levels are shocking,” said Rehana Zawar, NRC country director in South Sudan, in the release. “Alarm bells are ringing as the threat of famine is now more widespread than this time last year. Tens of thousands of families are at risk of starvation.”

As the fighting spread, it reached the nation’s breadbasket of Equatoria in 2016, causing farmers to flee their land. This has caused a severe decrease in the overall food production in the country. There is currently an estimated deficit of more than 1 billion pounds of locally produced cereal, according to a crop and food security assessment from WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This is a 26 percent increase from last year. This is compounded by an economic crisis, where civil servants have also not been paid for months.

“In the past, traders came to Equatoria to buy sorghum and maize and then moved it to parts of the country which had deficits,” said Cammelbeeck. “But the production is less and the trade is hampered because of the conflict. The traders cannot access where there is a little bit of surplus.”

Newly displaced populations are also trying to situate themselves out of the reach of armed militants, which means that they are harder to access for humanitarian actors, said Elizabeth White, policy adviser at Oxfam.

Towns and urban areas have also seen large arrivals of displaced populations, increasing pressure on already limited food sources, said Geno Teofilo, regional head of communications and advocacy for East Africa and Yemen for the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The coming rains

The rainy season has started in parts of the country and is spreading to other areas, which will push the country into its “lean” months and last until November. The rains are a major hindrance to access in outlying areas, which cannot be reached by road once the rains have started. The food security crisis is expected to be at its worst in the next few months because after the initial rains, there is expected to be some local food production. This makes May to July the most critical period to reach vulnerable populations, said Cammelbeeck.

“We have to continue providing at a large scale or there is the risk that people will fall back into some kind of emergency, or famine-like situation, like what happened last year,” said Cammelbeeck. “If we drop support, very quickly people will get into bad shape in a relatively short time, starting with the children and pregnant and lactating women.”

During the rainy season, the humanitarian sector has to depend heavily on airplane drops of emergency aid to reach remote communities, which is an expensive way to deliver aid. This is coupled with the fact that the crisis is underfunded. The crisis has only been funded 8.3 percent, with a $1.6 billion deficit, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Because of this, wide-scale use of air drops is not financially feasible.

The humanitarian sector is scrambling to pre-position supplies in strategic locations in the lead-up to the rains so that it can still reach the most vulnerable. Beyond road and air transport networks, rivers are also used to reach populations. As the water table rises, more communities will be accessible by boat, which is a cheaper option than air dropping supplies. Because of limited resources, agencies such as WFP have not yet been able to deliver the total pre-positioned tonnage of food, as planned, said Cammelbeeck. Without an increase in resources, WFP food rations will need to be reduced.

“There is a big concern that if we have to cut the rations, [the situation] will worsen quickly,” he said. “We hope that we will not get to the situation that we had last year where we had famine-like situation.”

Beyond reaching populations with food, it is essential that these population also receive water, sanitation, and hygiene services, so that their bodies are in conditions where they can absorb that food, said White. Last year, WASH needs were only 35 percent funded, as compared to almost 70 percent funded for food security, she said.

“You’ve got new arrivals in areas, now hosted by communities that might have access to a certain number of boreholes for clean water, a certain number of latrines,” said White. “Now you’ve got considerably more people using those resources, which inherently brings challenges in the ability to uphold safe hygiene and sanitation practices.”",Rainy season in South Sudan threatens to further isolate populations,https://www.devex.com/news/rainy-season-in-south-sudan-threatens-to-further-isolate-populations-92497

The regionally coordinated policy of isolating the (SPLM/A (IO) since the breakdown of ARCISS on July 8, 2016, was syndicated by subjecting its leader, Dr Riek Machar to indefinite solitary confinement in South Africa. Initially, the publicity of his ordeal was that he was in Pretoria as a guest of the Republic of South Africa. South African authorities later disputed that without disclosing who actually detained him while on a medical visit in that country. To our disbelief and relief, the IGAD Council of Ministers Resolution dated March 26, 2018, has cleared the clouds that Dr Riek Machar was indeed and is still a political detainee of IGAD. The catchword in the wording of that document is “relocation”(not “release”) which could be legally interpreted as a transfer to another indefinite detention in another country chosen by his captors against his will. To anyone connecting the dots, it all makes sense as a manifestation of IGAD’s failure to abide by the rule of law and the cardinal ethos that qualify the regional organization to mediate the peace process aiming at resolving the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. Among so many elements of injustice, in this case, the following spectral violations stand out:

1. It goes without first and foremost invoking the basic tenet of the criminal justice that deprivation of human liberty is subject to due process of law. In accordance with that universal standard, even initially lawful detention becomes arbitrary if it is not subject to speedy trial or periodic review. Hence, under the existing international law, the circumstances of Dr Machar’s indefinite detention in South Africa contravene Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That international humanitarian right covenant prohibits inhumane treatments such as kidnapping, indefinite detention, being “disappeared” with no access to court, family or friends all of which depict Dr Machar’s ordeal in every jurisdiction under the existing international criminal justice system.

2. Pursuant to Article 9 (a&c) of the Cessation of Hostility Agreement (CoHA) brokered by none other than the IGAD itself, the implementation of the CoHA assigned on December 21, 2017, commences with the unconditional release of all the political detainees. This legally covers Dr Riek Machar as a political detainee of IGAD, which of course includes Kiir’s regime. It must also be discerned that the tone of IGAD Council of Ministers Resolution is loaded with discordant prejudice and overt hostility against the person and persona of Dr Riek Machar in violation of Article 4(1) of CoHA, which abhors belligerent or hostile communication during this time of revitalizing ARCISS. This prejudicial tone comes out even louder in the self-incriminating coercion against Dr Machar to unilaterally renounce violence. This infers hostile prejudice portraying Dr Machar as the sole catalyst behind the ongoing violence in South Sudan.

3. Dr Riek Machar has not been formally charged with violation of any law under the IGAD jurisdiction. This makes his detention illegal by all standards of modern criminal law. The technical term for that illegal practice is” false arrest”. The mockery of justice in that political kangaroo court of IGAD is best illustrated by the conditions attached to even the relocation of this political detainee from one confinement to another under the same status. One of those conditions reads: “Riek Machar must renounce violence for IGAD to relocate him to another location to be determined by his self-appointing judges including his erstwhile political enemy( Kiir’s regime). Any jurist or student of criminal law can easily discern this case of Dr Machar versus the IGAD as a malicious political persecution vanquished by the victors. It is a spectre of injustice where the victim of violence is arbitrarily victimized and the violent offender (Kiir) who has been an orgy of pogrom and genocide since December 2013 is elevated to the status of a judge to condemn his political enemy to rot in IGAD political jails.

4. Volumes of records surrounding the ongoing crisis in South Sudan have exonerated Dr Machar as a victim of political violence since December 2013. In pursuit of peace and dialogue with Salva Kiir, Dr Machar has escaped death twice from Salva Kiir who pursued him up to Gadiang in December 2013 and again up to the Grampa Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2016. Under that the sun, nothing can demonstrate Kiir’s violence than those hot pursuits involving drones and warplanes. Yet, nobody is asking Salva Kiir to renounce violence. The records must also be informed that it was Dr Machar who signed the ARCISS first without any reservation and risked his own life to return to Juba under pressure and assurance by the leadership of IGAD-PLUS as guarantors that they would do everything in their power to ensure that ARCISS is implemented to that letter and spirit. Nobody needs to be reminded here that IGAD failed to do its part leading to the collapse of ARCISS. In a betrayal of Dr Machar and the people of South Sudan, IGAD did not only condone the violation of the agreement it brokered but also recognized that junta of Kiir and Taban as TGONU in violation of Article 6 (4) of ARCISS.

5. Despite all the betrayals by the IGAD and the international community, Dr Machar maintained his pursuit for peaceful settlement of the ongoing conflict even in his South African jailhouse and has written several letters to all the well placed regional and world leaders to intervene in the South Sudanese crisis by resuscitating the ARCIS. He continued with his relentless search for peace amidst military offensive by Kiir’s regime until the commencement of HRF that he supported and sent high-level delegation under the leadership of his Deputy, Honorable Hennery Odwar in December 2017.

6. Dr Machar was again the first to embark on the full implementation of COHA by instructing his forces to release all POWS and stranded civilians under their custody. This has been done and witnessed by the international organizations concerned including the UNOCHA, International Red Cross and the International Rescue Committee. Kiir failed to reciprocate. The fascist regime has done the gross opposite by executing the POWs and sentencing detainees and abductees to death in violation of Article 6( a&c) of CoHA and the Geneva Convention. To date, the fascist regime has continuously attacked the opposition-held areas obstructing the delivery of the humanitarian relief and causing untold suffering to innocent civilians again in violation of Article 8(1&4) of the CoHA. It was also sensational that the IGAD Council of Ministers expressed “extreme concern on the report submitted by CTSAMM reporting flagrant violations of the CoHA by Kiir’s regime during the 61st Extraordinary Meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers without asking Salva Kiir to renounce violence.

7. During the Phase II of the HLRF peace talks, the SPLM/A (IO) signed the Declaration of Principles (DoP) which Salva Kiir’s regime adamantly declined to sign in protest of article 28, which provides for punitive action against the violator and spoilers. This can be easily understood as the regime’s audacity to pursue violence and obstruction of the peace process. Again Salva Kiir was not asked to renounce violence and negotiate in good faith. Instead of doing the needful, the IGAD mediating team succumbed to Kiir’s intransigence and made the signing of that roadmap document optional.

8. As broadly evidenced by its continued cooperation and collaboration with Kiir’s regime, the IGAD has legitimized Kiir’s violence by condoning all the war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed by Kiir’s regime since December 2013. This is policy is pursued in deliberate denial of the crude reality on the ground that the people of South Sudan are currently protected from the genocidal violence of Salva Kiir’s regime by the United Nations within their own states capitals and the national capital, Juba where they are confined to POCs of UNIMISS. Furthermore, there is no stronger evidence of Kiir’s violence than the testimonies of the refugees and IDPs that have confirmed the ugly truth that Kiir’s violence is responsible for refugee and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. In any case, it is desolate that the IGAD member states hosting the victims of Kiir’s violence as refugees have miserably failed to ask this violent warlord to renounce violence.

9. The delicate point this region and the international community keep missing is the cold and bitter truth that the ongoing civil war in South Sudan is a popular armed uprising against the oppressive and genocidal policies of Kiir’s ethnocentric regime. So, reducing it to the person of Dr Riek Machar is a public insult to the collective intelligence and the dignity of the people of South Sudan who are humanly obliged to resist Kiir’s oppression with Dr Machar in the fences or outside the fences of IGAD jails. If anything, it is Dr Machar’s physical participation in the peace process that could bring the light closer to the end of this long dark tunnel of political violence in South Sudan. That is why the region and the world must subscribe to Dr Machar’s wisdom that the only sure and practical way to permanently end the ongoing violence is signing and implementing agreements such as COH that the SPLM (IO) has so far implemented. Anything else will only prolong the suffering of the people of South Sudan.

10. Given the mountain of factual evidences presented afore, it is hereby submitted that the judgment in that political kangaroo court of IGAD is fraught with gross violation of international humanitarian and human right law, violation of CoHA, double standards and conflict of interest legally and morally disqualifying the regional organization from its current status as a mediator in the peace process to resolve the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. In the light of this overwhelming credibility crisis, the IGAD must expressly take the following actions to save whatever little credibility it might still have to continue with mediating the peace process in South Sudan: Unconditional release of Dr Riek Machar to freely participate in the peace process, putting Salva Kiir where he belongs as a warring party (not a judge or mediator), holding him responsible for violation of CoHA and obstruction of the peace process since the year 2014 and ask him to renounce violence. With this submission, I rest my case and I look forward to hearing from the IGAD kangaroo court and the verdict in the court of public opinion.
