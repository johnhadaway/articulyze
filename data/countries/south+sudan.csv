Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

REGIONAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

South Sudan remained engulfed in conflict throughout 2017. Actions on the part of government and opposition actors continue to create an insecure environment, leading to significant protection concerns for the civilian population. The conflict also interfered with planting activities creating a food security crisis which led to a declaration of famine in early 2017. The deepening economic crisis compounded this situation and eroded the coping capacity of the people. Cumulatively, these factors drove internal displacement and large scale population movement to surrounding countries.

In 2017, Uganda received the largest number of arrivals (354,556) and Sudan received triple the expected number of arrivals (195,599) . Arrivals to Sudan spiked between January and May, likely linked with the food security shortages which led to a famine being declared in the northern Leer and Mayendit counties in February 2017. Ethiopia also received an increased number of arrivals compared with the previous year due to renewed fighting in the states of Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity states in 2017. Kenya received similar figures to those of 2016 (23,288), while the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR) received reduced, but not insignificant, numbers of new arrivals, with 22,017 and 414 arriving respectively.

Across the region, what can be observed is that this emergency is disproportionately affecting children. 65% of the refugee population in Sudan are children, 61% in Uganda and 65% in the DRC. This highlights the need for a strong child protection and education response. Child protection response has been strengthened in the region with a focus on identifying risks, providing family tracing services, specialized psychological support and facilitating access to birth registration. However, countries which received large numbers of new arrivals have struggled to cope with the scale of response required. Gaps include lack of deployment of protection staff to the border for on-the-spot assessment of protection risks facing new children arriving, limited follow up on cases due to increasing caseloads, lack of trained staff, lack of capacity to identify protection risks in children beyond the unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) category and the existence of community based protection structures whose effectiveness is sometimes undermined due to lack of resource input. Overall, this is an area requiring continued and strengthened support in order to fully protect vulnerable refugee children.

Robust efforts on behalf of both governments in the region and humanitarian responders are being undertaken to respond to the educational needs of refugee children. Yet the scale of the crisis, the overstretched capacity of existing systems and inadequate funding have led to the reality that less than half of all refugee children from the South Sudan crisis are not enrolled in primary school.

Enrollment in Uganda stands at 57%, in White Nile, Sudan at 47%2, in the DRC at 58% and in Ethiopia at 54%. Secondary level education is even more problematic with just 12% of young refugees enrolled in Uganda and only 2.68% in Sudan. Kenya has made significant strides this year reducing the number of out of school children to around 35% and witnessing a 3-fold increase in the number of students enrolled in higher education programs. However the gender equality gap persists, particularly in secondary level education, with both Kenya and Uganda reporting lower access to education for girls.",South Sudan - Regional RRP - 2017 End of Year Report - December 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-regional-rrp-2017-end-year-report-december-2017

Nyal town is located in Northern Panyijiar County, Unity State, along the banks of the Sudd, the third largest swamp in the world. Since the beginning of the crisis, IDPs from Unity and Jonglei States have perceived Nyal as a safe location with ample resources. Recently, Nyal has also become a key location for people travelling to and from nearby islands.

Since 1 November 2016, REACH has monitored three ports in Nyal - Gap Port, Nyal Port and Katieth Port - to record the arrivals and departures on a daily basis. The information gathered covers household (HH) demographics, key push and pull factors, health concerns, vulnerable populations, and general transportation routes. The daily data was synthesised to provide evidence for more effective humanitarian planning.

The REACH team collected information from 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to ensure complete coverage of Nyal’s three ports. REACH teams attempt to interview all arrivals and departures at the household level using a contextualised survey. However, the data presented here is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population. This factsheet is based on data on 626 people departing (150 HHs), 429 people arriving (103 HHs), and 8 people transiting (3 HHs), which was collected from 5 to 29 March 2018.","South Sudan Displacement Crisis: Nyal Port Monitoring - Panyijiar County, Unity State, South Sudan (March 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-displacement-crisis-nyal-port-monitoring-panyijiar-county-unity-6

Despite the continued conflict in South Sudan, accountability for human rights violations can be initiated drawing on the recent UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan investigative report.

An air of impunity pervades the conflict in South Sudan, which shows no sign of ending while the humanitarian costs continue to mount. To counter this perception, observers should keep in mind that the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan announced in February that it had collected enough evidence to hold more than 40 South Sudanese officials accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Drawing from events in four of South Sudan’s original 10 states (Western Bahr el Ghazal, Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, and Upper Nile) from 2016 and 2017, the report found egregious violations of human rights, humanitarian law, and international criminal law committed primarily by government forces and its affiliated militia, but also by armed opposition.

The Commission’s conclusion that war crimes and crimes against humanity are still occurring affirms earlier findings by the Commission, UN Mission in South Sudan (2014), the African Union (2015), the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2015), and several nongovernmental organizations. The report contains harrowing stories of crimes including:

Killing of civilians

Sexual violence including rapes of men and women, gang rape, castration, forced nudity, and genital mutilation

Pillaging and destruction of property

Forced displacement

Denial of due process

Censoring of speech and media

Attacks on humanitarian workers including killing, harassment, and looting; in 2017, 30 aid workers were killed

The searing brutality of these decidedly ethnically targeted crimes leaves little to the imagination. For instance, the Commission recounts through the words of a surviving son, the story of a woman whose eyes were gouged out by SPLA soldiers with a spear when she sought to protect her 17-year-old daughter from being gang raped. After being blinded, she was gang raped by 17 soldiers. Her husband was then castrated, his genitals were mutilated, and then he was beheaded.

The Commission identifies, for the first time, individuals suspected of planning, ordering, facilitating, and abetting international crimes and human rights violations. In particular, the report adopts command responsibility as a legal framework for establishing the criminal responsibility of military and political leaders. This framework is used to apportion responsibility to individuals named in a confidential list submitted to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to be maintained pending legal action. This list will be transmitted to the prosecutor of the hybrid court for South Sudan once he or she is appointed. The resolution that authorized the Commission allows individual states to access preserved evidence should they wish to prosecute individuals in their national courts.

The report findings highlight that the conflict is marked by a progressive deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Tens of thousands of people were dislodged—repeatedly in some cases—by the counterinsurgency operations launched by the SPLA and affiliated militia in each of the four areas assessed. According to the Commission, the number of people displaced has passed 2.4 million refugees and 1.9 million internally displaced. Of these, over 1 million have taken refuge in Uganda alone.

Humanitarian agencies reported systematic impediments to access that have exacerbated food insecurity, resulting in some deaths by starvation. Barriers to access include exorbitant work visa fees, denial of permits to access areas of need, bureaucratic obfuscation, roadblocks, looting of supplies and facilities, and the killing and harassment of aid workers. There were 1,159 humanitarian access incidents in 2017 alone. Forty-seven percent of these involved violence. According to the Commission, humanitarian aid has become a “political football,” with multiple sides in the fragmented conflict seeking to manipulate distribution of assistance in favor of certain communities or toward themselves.

Action Points

The Commission’s report demonstrates that the peace agreement signed in 2015 has failed to end egregious abuses and create conditions that allow the implementation of measures to return the country to normalcy. To protect civilians and humanitarian workers from continuing intimidation, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) has called for adherence to the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians, and Humanitarian Access signed by the parties on December 21, 2017.

Ceasing attacks on humanitarian workers by all parties is imperative and should be backed up by punitive measures in case of violations. The Terrain Hotel trial involving the prosecution in a military court of 12 soldiers who had gang raped several foreign aid workers and killed John Gatluak, a Nuer journalist, in July 2016 is instructive in this regard. The case was brought to trial after strong international pressure compelled the Government of South Sudan (GOSS) to take action. The case shows that even in a context of limited capacity to pursue justice domestically, ways can be found to hold trials for egregious crimes committed during the course of the conflict. It also demonstrates the importance of external pressure to facilitate domestic action to ensure accountability for abuses.

A future hybrid court should prioritize investigation and prosecution of war crimes against the humanitarian sector, including the killings of 97 aid workers since the fighting began in 2013. The GOSS should also facilitate the delivery of assistance by eliminating permit fees and removing bureaucratic red tape and other impediments to access.

Attacks on the humanitarian sector have taken place in a context of increased intimidation of civil society and the media through murder, detention, and dismissals. Some of the abuses documented in a recent UNMISS-OHCHR report include censorship of articles, confiscation of newspapers, closure of media houses, and blocking of websites. The GOSS intelligence organization, the National Security Services, is responsible for more abuses than any other institution, committing 33 percent of incidents. Other institutions cited are the police, SPLA, local officials, and the South Sudan Media Authority.

Given the government’s continued perpetuation of these actions, the process of establishing the proposed hybrid court should be accelerated. The AU should consider appointing the prosecutor prior to the signing of the memorandum of understanding envisaged in the peace agreement between the AU and GOSS. Juba should fast track national legislation that affirms cooperation between the hybrid court and the GOSS, including with regard to access to witnesses, review of documents in the custody of the government, and sites of burials, among other issues. Should the AU’s Peace and Security Council’s calls for the adoption of national legislation fail to elicit a response, and if the prosecutor is unable to proceed for lack of cooperation, consideration should be given to establishing an UN-backed ad hoc international tribunal or triggering the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

The GOSS has also delayed establishing the Commission on Truth, Reconciliation, and Healing and the Reparations Authority provided for in the 2015 peace agreement. Accordingly, donor support for civil society efforts to document violations and crimes should be enhanced.

In the face of the continuing GOSS obfuscation, despite the serious criminal allegations and deteriorating humanitarian conditions, the international community, primarily consisting of the UN, AU, and Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, must exert maximum leverage—diplomatic, political, and military—to precipitate remedial action on human rights, humanitarian access, and justice. The GOSS’s active suppression of these tenets of the rule of law, as documented by the Commission’s assessment, compels regional actors to enforce sanctions adopted by the UN, EU, and bilaterally to exert pressure on political and military decisionmakers in South Sudan to change course.

KANDAK, South Sudan — “I’m afraid I’ll starve to death,” said Gatdin Bol. Curled on a dirt floor, the frail 65-year-old said he survives only by eating fruit from the trees in this remote South Sudanese town in the shadow of civil war.

Three months ago when government troops attacked Bol’s hometown in Jonglei state they stole everything he owned, including his food, he said. He fled with his wife and four children, walking for two months until they reached Kandak in Ayod County. They remain hungry. The planting season has yet to begin and they missed the United Nations’ food registration and aren’t eligible for assistance.

Five years into South Sudan’s civil war more than 7 million people are facing severe hunger without food aid, according to the latest analysis by the U.N. and the government. Aid workers warn that a recent surge in fighting could once again plunge thousands of people into famine.

“In the places where there is displacement and we can’t get there, it’s a cause for concern,” Adnan Khan, the World Food Program country director, said during a food distribution last week in the rebel-held town of Kandak.

Ayod is one of 11 counties in South Sudan that face extreme hunger. Remote and lacking basic resources like water and health care, the majority of its residents subsist on food aid.

During the visit to Kandak, several people said they had nothing to eat. “The army looted my garden and took my food. If I don’t find food I can go days without eating,” Puot Kuony said.

South Sudan’s government is doing what it can to ensure that “normalcy” returns to its people, said spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. In the worst-affected areas the government asks aid workers to step in and provide relief, including opposition-held areas, he said.

But the international community’s patience is wearing thin as reports continue of aid workers being blocked from carrying out their work, and as peace talks yield little progress. The next round of talks begins May 17.

“Earlier this year it felt like we were moving in the right direction,” said the chief of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, David Shearer. “But after seeing the effects on civilians of this conflict, I believe there is a real risk that the situation will further undermine the chance for lasting peace.”

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Government officials regularly increased fees for nonprofits trying to alleviate the effects of conflict, stopped humanitarian convoys from delivering life-saving supplies, and erected bureaucratic obstacles designed to impede access to civilians in need.

“There are ‘sitting fees’ you need to pay to government and the opposition when negotiating access to deliver aid,” one aid worker told me. “There are ‘airport fees’ for landing at the airstrip; to carry cash into the field – anything more than $100 requires an authorization from at least five different ministries. You line everything up and then they will say something is missing or something has changed.”

These are just some examples of obstacles the South Sudanese government has created to prevent humanitarian workers from doing their vital work in a conflict zone. Government officials – and the opposition – have blatantly denied humanitarian aid, preventing civilians from accessing essential services and NGOs from functioning. This strategy is being used as a war tactic, and contributing to the spread of disease, injury and death.

The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance.





In a new report , Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict found that in 2016 and 2017, there were at least 750 incidents involving denial of humanitarian access, many of them committed by government authorities. In dozens of interviews with health, humanitarian and NGO workers I conducted in South Sudan and neighboring Uganda, I heard about many disturbing steps the government has taken to block access for humanitarian workers and NGOs.

In recent years, I have investigated denials of humanitarian access in many conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Yemen. But the extent to which this is happening in South Sudan is far beyond anything I have seen.

In March 2017, for example, the government increased work permits for foreigners from $100 to a staggering $10,000. Two months later, it increased registration fees for international NGOs, from $2,000 to $3,500. Government officials have also interfered in the recruitment of NGO staff by reviewing candidate lists and even sitting in on interviews and vetoing choices. They have frequently changed license and registration requirements, making it difficult for NGO staff to travel for work.

“The government has required new license plates at least three times, which also requires new driver’s licenses and new registrations,” a humanitarian worker told me. “They announce the new procedure on Thursday and then pull you over on Friday if you haven’t complied and make you pay a fee.”

All this is taking place in a country that is in desperate need of humanitarian aid. As of December, at least 20 percent of South Sudan’s 1,900 hospitals had closed, and about half were functioning with extremely limited capacity, according to the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Warring parties were responsible for at least 50 attacks on medical facilities in 2016 and 2017 – another part of the war strategy and a vicious way to prevent civilians from accessing care. As a result, malnutrition, cholera and famine are gripping parts of the country.

The strategy behind these actions is clear – it is part of the war arsenal. The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance. Since 2013, humanitarian organizations have provided up to 80 percent of all health care services in the country, according to OCHA.

As is often the case in conflict zones, children and women are disproportionately affected by these war tactics. Of the four million people who have been displaced, children and women make up to 85 percent of this number, according to OCHA.

At Watchlist, we are calling on South Sudanese government to uphold its obligations to allow for unimpeded humanitarian access. A dedicated independent body should be established to investigate incidents of denials of humanitarian access, and all procedures for humanitarian and NGO workers should be made consistent and transparent.

Even in wartime, there are rules to be followed. They are designed to limit the impact of conflict on children, women and civilians at large, and allow the most vulnerable to access humanitarian assistance. The government of South Sudan has shamelessly violated these rules and gone out of its way to endanger the lives of its own citizens.

The international community must take immediate action to end this insidious tactic of war that has had devastating consequences for the children of South Sudan.
