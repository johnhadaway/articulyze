0,myanmar,"The international and Rohingya communities have consistently urged Asean to play a greater role in helping end the crisis in Myanmar’s Rakhine state after some 700,000 people fled from the conflict to Bangladesh since August last year.

While the United Nations has viewed the issue seriously due to atrocities and hinted at “ethnic cleansing”, Asean, of which Myanmar is a member, has confined its involvement to humanitarian assistance.

Asean leaders said they continued to support Myanmar’s humanitarian relief programme in Rakhine and welcomed the ongoing work of the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to deliver humanitarian assistance to all displaced persons without discrimination, according to the chairman’s statement issued at the meeting last month in Singapore.

“I hope Asean in the near future can develop things beyond the humanitarian dimension, but Myanmar’s trust must be earned,” Marty told a group of editors and senior journalists at the Asean Media Forum held in Singapore on Friday.

Non-interference, which is the main principle of the regional grouping, is no longer an excuse for Asean to refrain from getting involved in the crisis in Myanmar since the group has played crucial roles in political developments in the country for a long time, he said.

“It is certainly an internal issue of Myanmar but that does not mean there is no potential for regional contribution,” Marty said.

Asean used to work intensively to have the Myanmar authority and the military deliver on its seven-step road map towards democracy and reconciliation, which eventually ended up with the 2008 constitution and a historic election in 2010.

The process paved the way for the current government under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi.

On the Rohingya issue, Marty said many Asean countries – notably Indonesia – used to play a key role to facilitate communication with the government in Nay Pyi Taw to the tackle the problem in 2013.

The communal conflict in Myanmar’s Rakhine state took place as the Muslim Rohingya have been discriminated against by the authorities and the Buddhist majority. By calling them Bengali, the Myanmar authorities have denied them citizenship.

Another relevant issue for Asean is the territorial disputes in the South China Sea where many members of the group including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam are contestants with China for a long time.

The way Asean dealt with the issue over the past decades is to prolong the problem, rather than resolve it with drastic action, Marty said, and added that the group had spent time, resources and energy to produce the non-binding Declaration of the Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002. But, the situation in the contentious sea has only aggravated since then.

The group is now producing another document known as the code of conduct which, Marty said, was based on a draft he has seen and would not be any different from the DOC.

“I mean diplomats cannot just sit in the room to discuss where to put a comma and hyphen, since things happen at sea, otherwise the code of conduct would be obsolete on the very day it is adopted,” he said.","Drastic action needed to tackle Rohingya crisis, says Marty",http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/asean-plus/30344758

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Rakhine

UNICEF remains concerned about the conditions of crowded IDP camps in central Rakhine where 129,000 people remain reliant on humanitarian assistance. UNICEF clusters/sectors are working with the CCCM/Shelter/NFI clusters to identify actions that—with appropriate funding—can be quickly taken to improve living conditions in IDP camps. The camps, erected in 2012, were constructed based on technical guidelines provided by the Government of Myanmar. Agencies note that space allotments in camps are inadequate, leading to overcrowding of houses, people, and social service points. Current concerns include the need for rehabilitation or reconstruction of shelters, access pathways within the camps, and improvements to WASH and education facilities. Addressing some of the identified challenges willrequire additional allocations of land by the government as the current space is not sufficient for implementation of the proposed solutions. However, improved access to livelihoods opportunities for IDPs, as well as increased access for humanitarian service providers, would also lead to improvement in camp conditions.

In Maungdaw District—comprised of Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships—accurate figures of the population of Rakhine and ethnic minorities are still unavailable. UNICEF does not have access or permission from the Government of Myanmar to conduct basic needs assessments. Access constraints for UNICEF —particularly international staff—remain the biggest hurdle to assessments, implementation, and programme monitoring. Currently,travel authorization—which takes approximately two weeks to process—when granted, is valid for only a two-week period. The constant reapplication process, in addition to significant requests for information on activities, hampers effective response activities. Working through local partners, UNICEF continues to provide basic health, nutrition, WASH and child protection services in Maungdaw District where possible.

Kachin and Shan

Throughout April, armed clashes between the Myanmar military forces and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) escalated affecting Tanai, Hpakant, Sumprabum, Moegaung and Momauk townships as well as Laiza. Intense fighting continued with aerial bombings and use of heavy artillery. UNICEF field staff estimate that an additional 3,500 people have been displaced including over 1,000 people who are sheltering in a nearby forest. Local organizations including church groups, civil society groups and NGOs are advocating with the Kachin State Government and Myanmar military for evacuation of trapped and displaced people. Access to active conflict areas remains extremely difficult for UNICEF staff and international partners, as well as Myanmar NGOs. Outside the areas of active conflict, national staff and national partners have access and provide basic humanitarian services to those most in need.

UNICEF also remains extremely concerned about the situation in northern Shan State. Armed clashes in March and April were reported in Namtu, Hseinni, Kutkai and Manton with additional landmine cases reported in Kyaukme and Hsipaw townships. Furthermore, there has been a recent increase in military presence in Kokang, Special Administrative Zone. In Shan, displacement patterns show many people flee areas of fighting for several days seeking shelter in monasteries, churches or neighbouring villages and return home within a period of weeks. Throughout Shan, the Government and local partners have been providing support to those displaced. Should the fighting be sustained and lead to prolonged displacement, additional assistance will likely be required. Access to newlyaffected areas remains restricted due to insecurity.",UNICEF Myanmar Humanitarian Situation Report - 4 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-4-may-2018

Community leaders from the Christian ethnic Kachin community have called for urgent medical attention for about 2,000 civilians, including pregnant women and the elderly, trapped in the jungle where they fled to escape clashes between the Myanmar's army and the Kachin guerrillas in the country's north. (Labram Hkun Awng via AP Photo), The Associated Press

BANGKOK (AP)  Community leaders from the Christian ethnic Kachin community have called for urgent medical attention for about 2,000 civilians, including pregnant women and the elderly, trapped in the jungle where they fled to escape clashes between the Myanmar's army and the Kachin guerrillas in the country's north.

The latest fighting in Kachin state's Tanai region  an area known for amber and gold mining  began in early April with government shelling and airstrikes in response to threats by the rebel Kachin Independence Army to retake lost territory.

The Rev. Mung Dan, a Baptist community leader, said Wednesday the civilians trapped without medicine or sufficient food include five pregnant women, two women who just gave birth, 93 old people, and other villagers wounded by mortar shelling. They are ""in dire need of medical treatment as well as rations,"" he said by phone.

""Even today, it's been raining the whole day in our region and these civilians do not have any shelter yet and they are suffering from sickness as well,"" he added.

A non-governmental organization based in Kachin state has sent an open letter to the Kachin State Minister on Wednesday, asking for the permission to rescue civilians but the permission has not been granted yet.

""We have been asking permission to rescue people who are trapped in the jungle and they are in a very critical condition,"" said Awng Ja, a member of Kachin State Women Network, which helps displaced women. ""But the state minister said only if the military granted us access, we can rescue these civilians.""

Rights and aids groups said the Myanmar government and the military have dramatically increased restrictions on humanitarian assistance to some 100,000 displaced people. The government has denied virtually denied all access for the United Nations and other international humanitarian groups.

Some civilian have already been killed by the government's offensive, the Kachin say.

""At least three civilians were killed by the army's mortar shells and airstrikes in three different places since April 11,"" said Naw Bu, the head of the information department of the Kachin Independence Organization, the political organization to which the Kachin Independence Army is affiliated.

The Kachin Independence Army, like other ethnic minority armed groups, has been fighting on and off for decades against the central government for greater autonomy. Combat between the Kachin rebels and the government military resumed in 2011, ending a 17-year ceasefire agreement. The clashes have left hundreds dead and more than 100,000 civilians displaced.

Myanmar's military has long been accused of grave human rights violations against ethnic minority groups in different parts of the country.

Most recently, it has been accused of abuses against the Muslim ethnic Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine that critics say amounts to ""ethnic cleansing,"" as violent counter-insurgency sweeps by the army helped drive about 700,000 Rohingya across the border to neighboring Bangladesh, where they stay in refugee camps.","2,000 Kachin trapped by Myanmar fighting lack food, medicine",http://www.tampabay.com/-kachin-trapped-by-myanmar-fighting-lack-food-medicine-ap_world7fbe9173fe9b47a4b2449797997160b2
3,myanmar,"Australia is chipping in an extra $13 million in aid to help people from Myanmar ethnic minority groups fleeing violence at the hands of the country's military.

The plight of Rohingya people in Rakhine state has received much international attention, following an exodus of more than 700,000 people to neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown last August.

An estimated 500,000 Rohingya people remaining behind in Myanmar are in need of humanitarian relief.

Human rights abuses and conflict in Kachin and the northern Shan states have also ramped up.

Since early April, an estimated 5000 people in the northern Kachin state have fled their homes because of intensified fighting between the military and rebels.

""The Australian government calls on all parties to end the fighting, protect civilian populations, and allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to affected communities,"" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.

Ms Bishop said the $13 million would go to aid groups such as Save the Children and the UN's refugee agency to help provide health care, shelter and schooling in Rakhine state.

Save the Children will receive $1 million to train teachers and expand an existing education program in Rakhine state which works with displaced kids.

In Kachin and Shan states Australia's support would help protect families fleeing violence.

Last week, Ms Bishop announced an extra $15 million of assistance for the Rohingya refugee camps at Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

4,myanmar,"The Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued a joint statement Sunday at the end of a two-day conference in Bangladesh, which has taken in more than 700,000 Muslims from northern Rakhine who have fled violence in Myanmar since August.

The statement said the grouping will continue to work the UN and other global platforms to address the rights violations taking place in Myanmar. The grouping echoed previous international statements saying ethnic cleansing is taking place in Myanmar.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.H. Mahmood Ali said delegates pledged solidarity with his country amid the influcx of Muslims from northern Rakhine “with its humanitarian and security consequences.”

Security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launched a scorched-earth campaign in late August in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the crackdown, which many rights activists believe was a calculated attempt to drive Muslims in northern Rakhine from the country.

Muslims from northern Rakhine are denied citizenship in Myanmar, where they have long faced persecution. Many in Myanmar see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Most have long lived in poverty in Rakhine, which is next to Bangladesh.

6,myanmar,"Myanmar’s leaders deny human rights abuses against its Rohingya Muslim population. But international organizations like Amnesty International have documented systematic, military-led violence against the country’s religious minority following insurgent attacks in August 2017.

“What we've seen over the last seven months is the Myanmar military has really launched an attack on the [Rohingya] population as a whole,” said Matt Wells, a human rights investigator with Amnesty International.

Listen to Matt Well's interview about his work in Myanmar with Amnesty International.

Wells’ job involves documenting and corroborating human rights abuses. During recent trips to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, he spoke directly with survivors of attacks that range from sexual violence to the burning of entire villages. His organization has corroborated firsthand accounts using technologies like satellite imagery.

“We've documented more than 350 villages that have been totally or partially destroyed in the last seven months. And the results of this has been more than 670,000 people have been forced across the border into Bangladesh in the span of seven months.”

The UN Security Council visited Myanmar for the first time on April 30. Following the delegation’s visit, the United Nations called for the safe and voluntary repatriation of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh. Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a resettlement agreement in January, but many Rohingya say they fear going back and the agreement has not been implemented.

In order to guarantee safe conditions for the Rohingya, Wells wants to see action from powerful actors, like the United States. In December 2017 the United States imposed sanctions on general Maung Maung Soe, who oversaw the most recent violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Still, Wells is urging the consideration of a bill authored by Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, which would impose additional sanctions, provide humanitarian aid and prohibit certain types of military cooperation between the United States and Myanmar.

INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:

Matt Wells provides context to the Rohingya crisis:

This is a population, the Rohingya, that has been subjected to really systemic discrimination for years, in a way that we have saidamounts to apartheid. They have been denied the ability to move around. They have to get specific travel authorization simply to move from village to village. They're denied access to education. They are denied access to healthcare… So what's happened over the last seven months, this very acute violence that's been perpetrated against them, comes on the heels of what has been a whole system of persecution that's existed for a long time to the authorities in Myanmar.

They are considered to be to be foreigners, to not actually be part of the fabric of the country even though they have lived in this part of Myanmar for generations… And so you have this deep-seated racism, really, that has been unlocked over the last year or two, in particular by the rise of populism in Myanmar. You had a rise of really Buddhist nationalist populist movement that is has? then helped fuel a lot of the suspicion and actually outright hatred towards the Rohingya population.

Matt Wells describes one Rohingya victim he met in Bangladesh in September 2017:

I interviewed a 12-year-old girl named Fatima. She had been in a village in Myanmar where the military had surrounded it. She was at home with her family as the soldiers came in, surrounded her house. She saw as her father was shot and killed. She saw her younger sister, a 10-year-old, was shot and killed. She herself was shot in the thigh. When I saw her, she still had the gunshot wound in her thigh. A neighbor had fortunately picked her up and carried her to a neighboring village, and then ultimately onto to Bangladesh. And it is a story that I heard again and again, in which in response to these attacks by an armed group, the Myanmar military made no effort to distinguish between the actual attackers and the broader civilian population, and instead launched an attack on the population as a whole, through killing, through sexual violence against women and girls, and through the systematic burning of villages across this region.

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

Suzette Grillot: Matt Wells, welcome to World Views.

Matt Wells: Thank you for having me.

Grillot: Well, let's see. You work for Amnesty International now, but your background, educational background is in history, psychology and law, and then you've gotten off into human rights. You actually study and engage on issues of mass human rights violations, along the lines of atrocities, you know, horrible things like genocide.

Wells: I was working with Human Rights Watch at the time of the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire in 2010-2011, and through that, you know, documented horrific abuses that were committed by both sides of that conflict. And with that really started down the path of developing a specialty in investigating mass atrocities and particularly in situations of armed conflict. I worked in South Sudan. I worked in D.R. Congo. And, most recently, I focused on Myanmar and the ongoing crisis related to the Rohingya Muslim population there.

Grillot: We've talked a lot about the Rohingya crisis on the show. And so we're definitely going to get to that. But when you say that you you've witnessed abuses, human rights abuses, I mean, what are you talking about? What are the things that you have been witnessing? What are the kinds of tools that these combatants in civil war are engaging in?

Wells: So in many of these places we're talking about, you know, civilians are really being targeted by armed groups on both sides. It obviously depends very much on the country, you know, what exactly is happening. But, you know, in many instances I'm directly, you know, interviewing people who have been victims themselves to human rights abuses or who have directly witnessed often, you know, a family member who's been killed, who's been, you know, taken to detention and subjected to torture. And so the work is often rooted in speaking with direct victims and witnesses to human rights violations that have taken place and coupling that with new technologies that help us really corroborate what we're hearing from witnesses, from satellite imagery, to photos and videos that we can verify in terms of what's happening in particular places. And we can bring all of that together, and then, you know, present a really tight picture of exactly what's happened and who is responsible for the violations.

Grillot: And when you say “present that information,” who are you presenting it to? Tell us about that step of gathering that information. What do you do with it? Who does it go to?

Wells: You know, often there are kind of two different targets. There's a wider, more general audience who want to be engaged on a particular issue, that want to take interest in, you know, major human rights situations that are going on around the world. And then the other thing is, you know, targeted advocacy with policymakers, whether that's in Washington D.C., or in Brussels with the European Union, or, you know, in London with the U.K. governments. We speak with, meet with those who have the ability to influence governments around the world and try to force them to change the practices that are leading to these human rights violations.

I'm based in D.C. so I spend a lot of time, for example, doing advocacy with different parts of the U.S. government and particularly on Myanmar. Right now, trying to get them to do things like imposing targeted financial sanctions on military officials who were implicated in the atrocities against the Rohingya, to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar. And so it's pushing for practical policy recommendations that we believe can reduce the human rights violations that are taking place and ultimately ensure accountability for the people who are responsible for them.

Grillot: You've written a piece about how all the civilians suffer. You've written quite a bit, actually, about what, you know, civilians experience... Refugees. You mentioned that obviously, civilians are the targets of a lot of this. As far as, like, all the civilians suffer, you know, what else are we talking about here? Displacement? You know, having to flee? I mean, is this kind of a broader picture? Not just suffering torture and, you know, armed conflict, but actually, like, losing their homes? What does is? the bigger picture there?

Wells: So we take Myanmar, for example, and what's happening right now with the Rohingya Muslim population in Rakhine state in Myanmar. What we've seen over the last seven months is the Myanmar military has really launched an attack on the population as a whole, in response to attacks that were carried out by an armed group. They have gone into villages, often surrounded villages, opened fire on men, women and children as they flee. They have systematically burned down villages. We've documented more than 350 villages that have been totally or partially destroyed in the last seven months. And the results of this has been more than 670,000 people have been forced across the border into Bangladesh in the span of seven months.

And just, you know, one specific example... During one of my first trips to Bangladesh back in September, which was right after this crisis broke out, I interviewed a 12-year-old girl named Fatima. She had been in a village in Myanmar where the military had surrounded it. She was at home with her family as the soldiers came in, surrounded her house. She was with her father, her siblings. Soldiers opened fire from behind. She saw as her father was shot and killed. She saw her younger sister, a 10-year-old, was shot and killed. She herself was shot in the thigh. When I saw her, she still had the gunshot wound in her thigh. A neighbor had fortunately picked her up and carried her to a neighboring village and then ultimately onto Bangladesh. And it is a story that I heard again and again, in which in response to these attacks by an armed group, the Myanmar military made no effort to distinguish between the actual attackers and the broader civilian population, and instead launched an attack on the population as a whole, through killing, through sexual violence against women and girls, and through the systematic burning of villages across this region.

Grillot: Tell us... Give us some background here, now that we we’re talking about the Rohingya crisis, but what is the the back story about why this is happening?

Wells: This is a population, the Rohingya, that has been subjected to really systemic discrimination for years in a way that we have set said? amounts to apartheid. They have been denied the ability to move around. They have to get specific travel authorization simply to move from village to village. They're denied access to education, they are denied access to healthcare. People who fall sick or suffer injuries have to get permission from local authorities simply to go to the hospital.

And even then, if they do get to the hospital, they are segregated there. There's a ward just for the Muslim population. So what's happened over the last seven months this very acute violence that's been perpetrated against them comes on the heels of what has been a whole system of persecution that's existed for a long time to the authorities in Myanmar. They are considered to be to be foreigners, to not actually be part of the fabric of the country, even though they have lived in this part of Myanmar for generations. The Myanmar government considers them Bengali, that they are actually from Bangladesh as opposed to Myanmar, again, despite the fact that families have been there for generations. And so you have this deep-seated racism, really, that has been unlocked over the last year or two in particular by the rise of populism in Myanmar. You had a rise of really Buddhist nationalist populist movement that has then helped fuel a lot of the suspicion and actually outright hatred towards the Rohingya population.

Grillot: But this is all… I think some of us are so shocked about this because Myanmar's leader... She fought for democracy for so long. She was imprisoned in her home. She was under house arrest. She, too, was persecuted. She, you know, suffered great things. How is this happening under her watch? I mean, she's won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Wells: Right.

Grillot: So how does that happen?

I think there are two key things here. One is she exercises no control over the military. The military has complete power over its operations with no civilian oversight. There is no civilian oversight of investigations, for example, so the military controls its own judicial processes, which has fed this complete impunity in Myanmar in which the military operates entirely above the law and there is almost never any accountability no matter how horrific the atrocities. And so, on one hand, Aung San Suu Kyi does not control the military, and what we are seeing is a military-led campaign to drive the Rohingya out of the country.

Now the second thing, though, is that she has failed in terms of moral leadership. Even if she doesn't control the military, not only has she not said the right things, not only has she not condemned the horrific atrocities, but her office has, at times, made things worse. Her spokesperson has said things that border on hate speech or incitement. They have blocked, along with the military, humanitarian access to this part of Myanmar, making it difficult to get aid to the Rohingya who remain in the country. They blocked access to journalists, to human rights groups like our own. And they have cracked down on journalists who report on the atrocities. There are two Reuters journalists who have been arrested, who have been in detention since December for doing their work as journalists, for exposing a particular massacre. And you know the civilian governments and Aung San Suu Kyi herself has failed to do enough to even protect things like the freedom of the press and free expression in the country.

Grillot: Well this obviously raises, you know, the responses. I mean, you mentioned the work that you do, the advocacy work, trying to establish some sort of practical action. I mean, obviously everything you're doing is largely coming from the outside, right? I mean, what are you going to do about the leadership in Myanmar, the military in Myanmar?

But there are powerful actors who can do something about this, and so, you've also written other pieces about, you know, people that are afraid and forgotten. And it just… the Rohingya crisis really, really seems to underscore this notion of people that are forgotten, even though they're on the front pages and in the headlines and we see the evidence we see what's going on. So what has the response been? How confident are you that there's going to be much more response from, again, powerful actors elsewhere that can perhaps put some pressure on Myanmar, particularly on the military? You know? And how hopeful are you that that's going to actually happen in terms of any kind of way forward on this crisis?

Wells: You know, there has been outcry around the world. There's been condemnation from governments around the world, but we haven't seen enough action. The US government has imposed sanctions on a specific general in the Myanmar military who we and others have implicated for his role in leading a unit that has carried out a lot of this. So that's a positive first step, but it's nowhere near enough. We need additional targeted financial sanctions against senior military officials who are responsible for human rights violations. You know, there is a bill that pushes for accountability, that pushes for additional sanctions, that demands that the Myanmar military reform before it gets the benefits of U.S. military engagement with it in the future. It is bipartisan. The lead drafter is Sen. McCain. It has a number of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. It would, in terms of U.S. leadership, go a long way towards starting to address the situation. It provides additional humanitarian funds for the refugees in Bangladesh and to begin to address this culture of impunity that exists in the Myanmar military and that underpins so many of these atrocities that have been committed.

Grillot: Well Matt, thank you so much for being here today and for sharing.

Wells: Thanks for having me.

7,myanmar,"Yangon: Myanmar's government said it has repatriated the first family of Rohingya out of some 7,00,000 refugees who fled to Bangladesh to escape a brutal military campaign, despite UN warnings that a safe return is not yet possible.

The stateless Muslim minority has been massing in squalid Bangladesh camps since the Myanmar army launched a ruthless crackdown on the community in northern Rakhine state last August.

The UN says the campaign amounts to ethnic cleansing, but Myanmar has denied the charge, saying its troops targeted Rohingya militants.

Bangladesh and Myanmar were supposed to begin repatriation in January but the plan has been repeatedly delayed as both sides blame the other for a lack of preparation.

According to a Myanmar government statement posted late on Saturday, one family of Rohingya refugees became the first to return earlier in the day.

""The five members of a family... came back to Taungpyoletwei town repatriation camp in Rakhine state this morning,"" said a statement posted on the official Facebook page of the government's Information Committee.

Authorities determined ""whether they were once living here or not"" and provided the family with National Verification Cards, a form of ID that falls short of citizenship and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders who want full rights.

Photos posted alongside the statement showed one man, two women, a young girl and a boy receiving the ID cards and getting health checks.

It said that the family had been sent to stay ""temporarily"" with relatives in Maungdaw town.

The post did not mention any plans for further returnees in the near future.

The move comes despite warnings from the UN and other rights groups that a mass repatriation of Rohingya would be premature, as Myanmar as yet to address the systematic legal discrimination and persecution the minority has faced for decades.

On Saturday, the UN's refugee agency said in a statement that conditions ""are not yet conducive for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of refugees"".

The Rohingya are reviled by many in the Buddhist-majority country, where they are branded as illegal ""Bengali"" immigrants from Bangladesh, despite their long roots in Rakhine state.","Myanmar refugee crisis: First among 7,00,000 Rohingya families who fled to Bangladesh repatriated, says govt",https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-refugee-crisis-first-among-700000-rohingya-families-who-fled-to-bangladesh-repatriated-says-govt-4432219.html

The delegation, including Security Council President Gustavo Meza-Cuadra, met in Myanmar's capital with Suu Kyi and military commander Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing. They are to travel to Rakhine State, the area from which the Rohingya fled.

They are expected to see the aftermath of the army's crackdown there as well as the government's preparations for taking back the refugees from Bangladesh.

“The ministers will discuss in detail the repatriation of the refugees agreed by the two countries and resettlement plans for the returnees,” Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Myint Thu told The Associated Press. He said the UN delegates would be taken to refugee reception centers as well as villages in northern Rakhine.

The UN delegates will travel by helicopter today over the scarred landscape of northern Rakhine state, the scene of an army campaign starting last August that drove around 700,000 of the minority into neighbouring Bangladesh.

Their visit to Myanmar comes after an emotionally-charged stay in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees told delegates of their trauma, rape, killing and burning of houses in Rakhine where they have been denied citizenship and other basic rights including healthcare since 1982.

Demands from the refugees and rights bodies are growing louder for referring Myanmar's atrocities to the International Criminal Court as the Southeast Asian country's security forces are accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the minority group.

The UNSC has so far failed to take concrete actions against Myanmar mostly because of oppositions from China and Russia.

As the delegation left Dhaka yesterday after a two-day visit, they said they would press Myanmar to ensure the safe return of those who fled into Bangladesh.

However, deputy Russian ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy, whose country has supported Myanmar, warned on Sunday that the council did not have a “magic stick” solution.

“We are not looking away from this crisis, we are not closing our eyes,” he said.

They also focused on implementation of the bilateral deal signed by Myanmar and Bangladesh in November. No refugees have returned so far.

The UN Refugee Agency negotiated for a tripartite agreement on repatriation, but Myanmar so far refused it. Recently, Bangladesh signed a deal with UNHCR on safe and voluntary repatriation of the Rohingya. Myanmar is supposed to sign a deal, but that has not been done yet.

Myanmar's military has kept Rakhine in a lockdown since August, blocking access to independent observers, journalists and many aid groups except on tightly-controlled chaperoned trips.

Rights groups say freedom of movement of the Rohingyas and their access to the marketplaces in Rakhine is limited.

Myanmar's Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Myint Thu told The Associated Press, “The ministers will discuss in detail the repatriation of the refugees agreed by the two countries and resettlement plans for the returnees.”

He said that on Tuesday, the UN delegates would be taken to refugee reception centers as well as villages in northern Rakhine.

Some human rights activists would like to see more aggressive action by the UN.

“The other thing the Security Council should do is refer the situation in Rakhine State to the International Criminal Court,” Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said Friday in a speech to journalists in Yangon.

“The crimes against humanity that were committed against the Rohingya population were clearly of the gravity and severity that they warrant prosecution by the ICC. If impunity were to prevail it would be an enormous injustice to the victims and their families, and it would only encourage a repetition of these kinds of mass atrocities,” Roth said.

Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson described the visit as “symbolically quite important” but doused hopes of any immediate diplomatic breakthrough.

He said Suu Kyi's government was grudgingly showing “some semblance of cooperation with the West” to “avert further pressure from international justice initiatives”.",UNSC team in Myanmar,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/unsc-team-myanmar-1570189

YANGON, Myanmar

A senior UN official on Sunday called on the government of Myanmar to grant humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people affected by conflicts in the country.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, concluded her six-day mission to the country on Sunday. She visited several conflict-torn ethnic areas of Myanmar including western Rakhine state, northern Kachin state and northeastern Shan state.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan states,” said Mueller in a statement.

“When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” she said.

In Rakhine’s Maungdaw Township where a military operation forced nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee cross-border to neighboring Bangladesh, she witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed, said the statement.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” she said.

She also visited a refugee return transit site that the government is constructing in Maungdaw.

In meeting with Rakhine regional government officials, she called for an end to movement restrictions and for practical measures to allow humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.",Humanitarian access worsening in Myanmar: UN official,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/humanitarian-access-worsening-in-myanmar-un-official/1112060

In the Rohingya refugee camps of southern Bangladesh, where flimsy bamboo shelters sprawl across the steep hillsides and flood prone valleys, there has been a desperate effort to make ready for the coming cyclone and monsoon season. But the almost 900,000 refugees here remain very vulnerable.

The BBC's Justin Rowlatt has spent weeks in the camps since the refugee crisis began in August last year.

Here's his summary of who the Rohingya refugees are, how well prepared the world's largest and most densely populated refugee settlement is for the coming storms and when - if ever - the refugees will be able to return to their homes.

Who are the Rohingya?

The Rohingya are a more than a million-strong population of Muslims from majority-Buddhist Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma.

They have been described as ""the world's most persecuted minority"". The government of Myanmar stripped them of citizenship in the 1980s and has imposed many restrictions on them since then. It has also subjected them to periodic waves of terrible violence.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?

Even the country's de facto leader, Aung San Su Kyi, refuses to use the term Rohingya. In official speeches she describes them as ""Bengalis"", suggesting that the Nobel peace laureate, like many Burmese, regards them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

The Rohingya, meanwhile, insist they are native to Myanmar.

Why are so many Rohingya in Bangladesh?

The UN estimates that just under 700,000 Rohingya fled their homes in the western coastal state of Rakhine to Bangladesh last year after a vicious military crackdown which began in late August after deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts.

Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground and there was widespread rape and murder. The head of the UN's watchdog on human rights has said the possibility that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya could be genocide cannot be ruled out.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground

This latest wave of refugees joined some 200,000 Rohingya who were already in Bangladesh, having fled their homes following earlier waves of persecution.

What is the worry about storms?

Bangladesh suffers terrible cyclonic storms and some of the most intense monsoon rains on earth.

Cox's Bazar, where the refugee camps are, has one of the highest rainfall totals in the entire country.

The monsoon season begins in earnest in May and it is expected to bring yet more destruction and disease to the camps.

How vulnerable are the Rohingya to the monsoon and cyclones?

The exodus of Rohingya was unexpected. The refugees built shelters wherever they could, stripping the vegetation from muddy hills and building flimsy shelters on earth platforms they dug out of the slopes of the low hills the government allocated for them.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The refugee camps are vulnerable to heavy rain

Most of these homes are little more than tents which could easily blow away in the high winds that are expected in the coming weeks. They are also susceptible to landslides and flash floods.

A UN guide to strengthening buildings in the camps is brutally clear about the risks, saying: ""It is very unlikely that any bamboo community shelter will survive a cyclone.""

Factor in the risk of disease and there could be a ""massive loss of life"", the World Health Organization has warned.

So what is being done to help them?

A huge amount of work has been done. There are classes to train the refugees how to strengthen their bamboo shelters. Hillsides and paths have been bolstered with sandbags and there are new roads and bridges to make the transport network more resilient.

New culverts and drainage channels have been dug in to try to limit flooding, while emergency depots have been set up to store food and equipment in case areas of the camps are completely cut off by flood water or as a result of storm damage.

At the same time 50 hectares of new land is being cleared and the hills levelled to create stable ground for the 15,000 refugees most vulnerable to monsoon damage.

Can't the camps be evacuated if a cyclone strikes?

No. Bangladesh does have a good early warning system for cyclones but, say UN agencies, there are no plans to evacuate the refugees. There are just too many people and nowhere safe for them to go.

What about the plan to send some Rohingya refugees to a remote island?

Bangladesh has been building roads, sea defences and shelters on Bhasan Char, a silt island that emerged from the muddy waters of the Bay of Bengal less than two decades ago.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption UN agencies are anxious about plans to relocate refugees to the island of Bhasan Char

In April the Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, confirmed that her government planned to move 100,000 Rohingya refugees to the low-lying island. ""The camps are unhealthy,"" she said. ""We have prepared a better place for them to live, with houses and shelters where they can earn a living.""

The UN and aid agencies remain very anxious about the plan. They fear that any refugees relocated to Bhasan Char would be isolated, trapped at the mercy of cyclones, floods and human traffickers.

So when are the Rohingya refugees likely to return to their homes in Myanmar?

That is what most refugees in the camps say they want to happen.

A repatriation agreement was signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar in November last year. Almost six months on and not a single refugee has yet returned home - with a claim by Myanmar that it had repatriated a family of five dismissed by Bangladesh as a ""farce"".

Bangladesh says the fault lies with Myanmar. ""Myanmar says they are ready to take back the Rohingya but they are not taking the initiative,"" Sheikh Hasina has said.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims?

Myanmar, on its part, says it has been verifying refugees for repatriation, but Bangladesh has not provided all the information required.

It says it will allow UN agencies to help with the return of some of the refugees, and that it will ensure that refugees can come back ""without fear"".

A few refugees may be repatriated in the coming months but the truth is that no-one expects the bulk of the Rohingya in Bangladesh to go back to Myanmar anytime soon.

What effect is this having on people in the camps?

An assessment of the mental health needs of the populations of the camps makes depressing reading.

Only a third of respondents felt safe in the camps and two-thirds of adults said they experienced constant grief for lost family members and their previous lives.

Three-quarters of adults said they felt sad all the time.",Myanmar Rohingya refugees brace for monsoon deluge in Bangladesh camps,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43991930

YANGON – Fighting between Myanmar forces and a rebel group in the remote northeast could escalate, a spokesman of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) told Reuters on Friday, worsening a humanitarian crisis that has displaced more than 4,000 people.

One of Myanmar's most powerful rebel groups, the KIA has regularly clashed with government troops in the mountainous region bordering China and India since 2011, when a 17-year-old ceasefire broke down.

Since early April, the conflict has escalated, driving more than 4,000 people from their homes, civil society groups based in Kachin have said.

Clashes have been reported in half of the 18 townships in the region, where the Myanmar military has sent about 2,000 infantry troops, fighter aircraft and helicopters to combat KIA forces, said the spokesman, Col Naw Bu.

""The army is sending more troops from the lower part of Myanmar and that's why the fighting will be more intense,"" he said.

""The number of refugees could increase and they could suffer more challenges,"" he added, calling the clashes ""the worst conflict"" since Kachin soldiers started fighting the government in the early 1960s.

He declined to give details of the casualties sustained by the KIA or its military deployment.

Myanmar's military and civilian government officials did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.

Aid groups have urged the government to allow access to the village of Aung Lawt, where about 2,000 people have been trapped in a remote forest with no access to humanitarian aid for two weeks.

""The longer it takes, the more challenging it is for them. And most of the people are elderly, women and children,"" said Gum Sha Aung, an official of a coalition of Kachin-based humanitarian groups.

The United States embassy in Yangon said it was ""deeply concerned"" about intensified fighting in Kachin.

In a Twitter message on Friday, it urged the government and military to ""protect civilian populations and allow humanitarian assistance"" to those affected by the recent conflicts.

A coalition of 32 groups in Kachin this week urged the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the international criminal court, citing recent deaths and displacement of civilians in Myanmar army operations.

""Women, children, elderly people forced to flee their homes because of the relentless fighting in Kachin,"" Mark Cutts, the head of a U.N. agency coordinating humanitarian affairs in Myanmar, said in a Twitter message on Thursday.

""Local humanitarian organizations doing outstanding work trying to help. But when will this decades-old conflict end?""

Reaching a comprehensive peace deal with Myanmar's ethnic minorities has been leader Aung San Suu Kyi's stated top priority, but the Buddhist-majority country has seen the worst fighting with rebels in years since she took office in 2016.

Ending the civil war, eclipsed in media coverage by the plight of nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, is key to further development of the resource-rich country.

— As the Myanmar army's bombs started falling near her home in Kachin state, Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbors decided they had no choice but to grab what they could and scatter into the jungle.

""We were in so much trouble, I couldn't even swallow my food,"" the 92-year-old recalled. ""If we stayed in the village, we didn't know what could happen to us.""

She climbed onto her grandson's back and he carried her to a river where she and nearly 800 other villagers boarded boats to reach the state capital, part of a wave of 6,800 people who have fled their homes in Kachin since a fresh government offensive began in early April.

The onslaught is part of a decades-long government campaign to defeat Kachin rebels fighting for greater autonomy for the largely Christian minority group in Myanmar's far north. The intensified offensive has renewed accusations that the army is creating a similar humanitarian crisis in Kachin to the one spawned by its violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country's west.

""What we are seeing in Kachin state over the past few weeks is wholly unacceptable, and must stop immediately,"" Yanghee Lee, the U.N.'s human rights expert for Myanmar, said last week. ""Innocent civilians are being killed and injured, and hundreds of families are now fleeing for their lives.""

""All parties must take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security,"" she demanded.

A 17-year cease-fire between the government and Kachin Independence Army was broken in 2011, when the army entered rebel territory and attacked one of their outposts. Since then, sporadic fierce combat has uprooted villagers and left hundreds of civilians dead.

The fresh exodus of villagers is adding to the 100,000 people previously displaced in Kachin and neighboring Shan state, many of whom live in camps where people already have difficulty obtaining food and clean water due to military restrictions on aid.

Gumsha Awng of the Joint Strategy Team for Humanitarian response, a coalition of humanitarian groups in Kachin, said the army has been blocking international aid shipments to the region, a similar tactic it used with the Rohingya.

The government has denied virtually all access to the area for the United Nations and international humanitarian groups.

Those fleeing their rural villages try to seek the relative safety of the state capital, Myitkyina, which is under government control, or rebel-held cities where they can seek aid from church groups. Some who have fled, however, have found themselves stuck in a jungle no man's land unable to find a safe route out of the war zone.

One group of 2,000 villagers has been trapped in the jungle since mid-April without proper food, water, shelter and medical care, unable to get through army roadblocks to safer refuge.

Lamai Gum Ja of the Peace Talk Creation Group, comprising Kachin notables who attempt to mediate between the community and the army, said the military is intentionally blocking civilians from being rescued because they accuse them of having connections to the rebels.

Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the government has been helping with food, shelter and medical supplies and is working to ""rescue any trapped civilians.""

""We are hearing that the Kachin rebels have been pretending their civilians and that's why we have to verify the civilians very carefully,"" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

There were hopes that when Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government took power in 2016 that there might be a greater chance for peace. But Kachin support for Suu Kyi and her party has so far failed to pay a dividend, with the military still flexing its constitutionally ensured powers over security and border affairs.

Thousands of Kachins rallied in Myitkyina last week to demand humanitarian relief for those stuck in the jungles, and on Friday the central government-appointed state minister, Hkyet Awng, joined community leaders in a march to attempt to reach one group of trapped civilians. The military stopped them.

""Stopping the minister and Christian leaders from rescuing those civilians shows that the army is more powerful than the civilian government,"" said Lagang Zegyung, a lawmaker representing Kachin state. ""The army controls everything, especially in the ethnic regions, which makes it almost impossible for us to help civilians in the conflict zone.""

For those who do eventually reach safety, they often end up in church halls like the one at Trinity Baptist Church just outside Myitkyina. That's were Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbors ended up after their escape by boat.

""Our small church is hosting nearly 800 people who had fled from their village and now the church is overcrowded with the elderly, children, pregnant women, widows and disabled people,"" said La Hkawng, a church pastor.

He said they are providing food and shelter and what medical care they can. But some of the wounds are unseen.

Heavily pregnant Htu Hkam Ndu said her two young children are traumatized by the fighting.

""My children are even scared of planes flying around, any kind of planes,"" she said. ""My children keep telling me to flee every time they heard the sound of a plane flying. That's why when these children grow up, they will always remember what happened.""",Crisis in Myanmar's Kachin means jungle treks to escape war :: WRAL.com,https://www.wral.com/crisis-in-myanmar-s-kachin-means-jungle-treks-to-escape-war/17538624/

DHAKA, Bangladesh – The Associated Press

A grouping of Islamic countries said Myanmar’s treatment of Rohingya Muslims is a “serious and blatant violation of international law” and it is calling for international support in solving the crisis.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued a joint statement May 6 at the end of a two-day conference in Bangladesh, which has taken in more than 700,000 Rohingya who have fled violence in Myanmar since August.

The statement said the grouping will continue to work the U.N. and other global platforms to address the rights violations taking place in Myanmar. The grouping echoed previous international statements saying ethnic cleansing is taking place in Myanmar.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.H. Mahmood Ali said delegates pledged solidarity with his country “in the face of the huge Rohingya influx with its humanitarian and security consequences.”

Security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launched a scorched-earth campaign in late August in response to attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the crackdown, which many rights activists believe was a calculated attempt to drive Rohingya from the country.

Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, where they have long faced persecution. Many in Myanmar see them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh, and deride them as “Bengalis.” Most have long lived in poverty in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, next to Bangladesh.

The hundreds of thousands who fled now live in squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society estimates that at least 100,000 refugees will be exposed to extreme dangers during the coming monsoon season.",Islamic countries call Rohingya crisis ‘ethnic cleansing’,http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/islamic-countries-call-rohingya-crisis-ethnic-cleansing-131442

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remained fragile with the continuation of the protracted humanitarian crises in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan; the aggravation of the humanitarian context in the northern part of Rakhine State; new internal displacement in Kachin and Shan; and natural disasters hitting already vulnerable people. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to protracted denial of rights, limited access to basic services, conflict, insecurity and climatic shocks. The people directly affected by the different humanitarian crises in Myanmar (including the refugees hosted in Thailand and Bangladesh) are estimated at 1.8 million (3 per cent of the total population).

Protracted humanitarian needs

About 240,000 people remained internally displaced in camps or camp-like settings in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine States. This includes around 91,000 in Kachin and 15,000 in Shan respectively who were displaced because of the armed conflict that resumed in 2011. It also includes about 128,000 in Rakhine who were displaced as a result of violence that erupted in 2012 and who remain unable to access basic services or enjoy the full spectrum of their human rights. In addition, there are particularly vulnerable non-displaced people who continue to require special attention and support because of different factors including, amongst others, armed conflict, restrictions on movement, discriminatory practices and severe malnutrition. The country’s vulnerability to natural disasters results in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government is building its disaster management capacities with the support of the international community.

Crisis in northern Rakhine State

Following the 25 August 2017 attacks of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police posts and subsequent security operations by the Myanmar military and security forces in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung Townships, a massive outflow of people resulted in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. As of 16 March 2017, it is estimated that more than 671,000 persons, the vast majority of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, had fled to neighbouring Bangladesh seeking refuge. In addition, over 25,000 persons were internally displaced, although most of these have since returned. Although severe restrictions on access have made an adequate assessment impossible, large numbers of people in northern Rakhine remain in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in the sectors of protection, health and food security. According to estimates made by the Maungdaw Inter-Agency Group (MIAG), around 159,000 stateless people remain in the three northern townships, all of which can be considered to have been directly affected. In addition, around 55,000 non-stateless people can be considered to have been directly affected in the three northern townships, particularly in Maungdaw and Buthidaung. This includes non-stateless displaced people who have largely returned now from Sittwe and other areas; and members of the economically disadvantaged Mro, Thet, Dynet, and Rakhine communities.

New displacements in Kachin and Shan

In Kachin and Shan states, as a result of continuing and intensified conflict between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in 2017, close to 8,000 people were newlydisplaced, bringing the total number of people in camps in these two states to over 100,000. Since November 2017, more frequent and intense clashes between ethnic armed groups and Myanmar Military have resulted in displacement and re-displacement of larger numbers of people in both states. The displacement situation across both states remain very fluid and numbers are difficult to confirm given access challenges. Humanitarian access, particularly to people staying in areas beyond government control, remains severely curtailed in both states.

Natural disasters

Myanmar’s vulnerability to natural disasters resulted in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government continues to build its disaster management capacities with the support of OCHA and other partners. In 2017, Cyclone Mora brought strong winds and heavy rains in Myanmar, destroying over 16,000 houses in Rakhine and Chin states and Ayeyarwady Region.

Rakhine was the most-affected state and, in addition to the houses that were destroyed, over 60 per cent of the temporary shelters in IDP camps were damaged or destroyed. During the 2017 monsoon season, Myanmar also experienced heavy flooding and over 320,000 people were temporarily displaced. In addition, about 30 earthquakes (all with a magnitude lower than 5) were registered.

Security and access constraints

Crisis affected people in Myanmar often have restricted access to services and livelihoods for a variety of reasons including insecurity and restrictions on their movement. Independent and impartial humanitarian organizations, both national and international, aim to meet the resulting needs to the extent possible. However humanitarian actors themselves have varying levels of access to crisis-affected people in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states, resulting in difficulties and delays in implementing and monitoring humanitarian activities. For example, humanitarian activities are sometimes cancelled or delayed as a result of lengthy approval processes and nonissuance of travel authorizations.",Myanmar Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
