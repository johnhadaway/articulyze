0,myanmar,"A U.N. official has called for unfettered humanitarian access to several crisis-hit states of Myanmar including restive Rakhine where large numbers of the Rohingya Muslim minority have fled security forces for Bangladesh since August.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement April 8 that restrictions on humanitarian access in Myanmar have ""significantly worsened"" in the past year.

Mueller said it was not only a problem in Rakhine State but also in Kachin and Shan States where some humanitarian aid efforts have been hampered.

""When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,"" Mueller said as she concluded a six-day Myanmar visit.

In Rakhine, humanitarian assistance by the U.N. and non-governmental organizations has been restricted since violence in the state's north broke out on Aug. 25 after Rohingya militants attacked a number of border posts. Since then more than 688,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar's military to become refugees in neighboring Bangladesh.

""There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world's largest group of stateless people,"" said Mueller.

""The unfolding tragedy in the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar rightly captured the world's attention, but we cannot, and must not, forget the plight of over 400,000 Muslim people still living in Rakhine State who continue to face a life of hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions.

""These restrictions [on humanitarian access] severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education and other essential services.""

The Myanmar government has so far only allowed the World Food Program (WFP) and the Red Cross to access Rakhine State.

The Red Cross said it has been providing more than 200,000 people with aid in the state's affected regions.

Numar, a Rohingya resident from Pan Taw Pyin village, Maungdaw township in northern Rakhine, said villagers have received food items from WFP and the Red Cross.

""It is just enough for survival,"" Numar told ucanews.com. ""People here have no employment opportunities.""

Kachin and northern Shan States

Aid workers say there are restrictions on providing humanitarian assistance to the camps for internally displaced persons (IDP), especially in non-governmental control areas in Kachin and northern Shan States.

But Eddie, a program manager of Karuna (Caritas) Myanmar's Lashio branch, said as a church-based organization it has not been facing any difficulties in providing humanitarian assistance to the IDP camps in northern Shan State.

""For the U.N. and INGOs, there are more restrictions on providing humanitarian assistance and more of a need to inform the respective authorities,"" Eddie told ucanews.com.

""Humanitarian workers who are foreigners are mostly based in Lashio as they need to await long process for permission to go beyond Lashio.""

1,myanmar,"At least 21 fatalities have been reported in the clashes in Hpakant and Tanai townships of Kachin State, according to local residents.

Neither the Tatmadaw (military) nor the KIA would confirm the reports.

Police Colonel Myo Thura Naung of the Kachin State Police Department confirmed to The Myanmar Times on Sunday that clashes between the KIA and Tatmadaw were reported on Friday and Sunday in Hpakant and Tanai townships.

“We heard fighting in the area. The security forces were increased,” he said. “We do not know the details of the clashes as we cannot go there. We do not have new information about the fighting.”

A villager said he saw 18 Tatmadaw troops and three KIA fighters killed during an ambush launched by KIA fighters near a Tatmadaw camp along Myitkyina-Hpakant road on Friday.

He said Tatmadaw used helicopter gunships in retaliation for the KIA’s offensive.

The Tatmadaw took away dead and wounded soldiers by car with the help of militia in Nan Yar and Nan Tane villages, the residents added.

KIA spokesperson Naw Bu admitted that his troops launched offensives against a Tatmadaw camp near Tada Nyinaung area on the Myitkyina-Hpakant road on Friday, but would not confirm casualties on their side.

A 17-year-old ceasefire between the Tatmadaw and the KIA broke down in 2011, resulting in sporadic clashes between the two forces since then, not only in Kachin State but also in northern Shan State, where the armed ethnic group has a presence.

Tensions between the Tatmadaw and KIA are high in Hpakant, Mansi, Tanai, Bhamo, Sumprabum and Puta-O townships and fighting may break out at anytime, according to KIA spokesperson Naw Bu.

The Tatmadaw’s True News department could not be reached for comment about the fighting in Hpakant and Tanai, but the Commander-In-Chief of Defence Services Office announced on April 3 that there were three battles between the Tatmadaw and KIA from March 31 to April 2 in Mansi.

Due to Tatmadaw military operations in 2017, the KIA had to retreat from bases in Hpakant, which was then run by Battalion No 6.

The Tada Nyinaung area, where a fierce battle took place on Friday, was also a KIA area that is now occupied by the Tatmadaw.

On Thursday, the KIA issued a statement that it would launch offensives to recapture lost territories. It said it will launch a guerrilla operation in Hukawng valley starting on April 10. The KIA warned all workers at gold and amber mines to leave the areas.

The KIA has not signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with the government. Since 2011, over 100,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting between the two forces.

Although there were attempts to hold ceasefire talks initially, the Tatmadaw and KIA could not yet reach agreement.

Ursula Mueller, UN assistant secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs, who visited Kachin during a weeklong visit to the country that ended Sunday, called on the government and KIA to ensure the protection of civilians in line with international law.

“Kachin has one of the world’s longest-running conflicts, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Mueller in a statement. “Clashes break out near displacement camps and civilian areas, landmines are still being placed in the fields and roads of Kachin and Shan, and people continue to flee their homes.”

At least 10,000 people have been newly displaced or re-displaced by fighting between the military and armed ethnic groups in Kachin and Shan since the beginning of the year, and about 100,000 people remain displaced as a result of the conflict between the military and the KIA that restarted in 2011, according to a statement by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Sunday.

Mueller was particularly impressed by the work of local civil society organisations and was also encouraged to see that the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels more than 40 percent of its funding via national organisations, the statement said.

“I was able to go to northern Rakhine and to some of the camps in Kachin, but what matters most is that the people affected by violence and restrictions in these areas are themselves given access to the assistance and services they so desperately need,” she said.",UN appeals to fighters to spare civilians,https://www.mmtimes.com/news/un-appeals-fighters-spare-civilians.html
2,myanmar,"The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has asked it to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingya people ""from Myanmar to Bangladesh"", a possible crime against humanity, according to a filing published on Monday.

A ruling affirming jurisdiction could pave the way for Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate the deportation of many thousands of Rohingya, though Myanmar is unlikely to cooperate.

""This is not an abstract question but a concrete one, affecting whether the Court may exercise jurisdiction... to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute,"" Bensouda said in the filing.

The main reason for doubt over jurisdiction is that, while Bangladesh is a member of the court, Myanmar is not.

Bensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favour of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established legal principles.

But she acknowledged uncertainty around the definition of the crime of deportation and limits of the court's jurisdiction.

Her request is the first of its kind filed at the court. She asked the court to call a hearing to hear her arguments, as well as those of other interested parties.

The magistrate assigned to consider the request, Congolese judge Antoine Kesia-Mbe Mindua, will have considerable leeway in determining how to proceed.

According to the United Nations, some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya fled their homes into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations has said constitutes ethnic cleansing.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against Rohingya who attacked government forces.

3,myanmar,"The Reuters journalists were arrested Dec. 12 after they left a northern Yangon restaurant where they met with two police officers, who handed them some rolled-up papers. Human rights groups have accused the police of entrapping the two journalists by handing them the documents. The reporters’ lawyers say they never had a chance to look at them.

This is the method of Myanmar’s judicial system, where speed and fairness are not necessarily the goal.

“It is not a just system,” a lawyer for the journalists, Khin Maung Zaw, said during a recent break in the court proceedings. “There are many obstacles.”

The case has highlighted the suppression of free speech in Myanmar under the government of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the state counselor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She has yet to speak out on behalf of the Rohingya, and has instead blamed “terrorists” for an “iceberg of misinformation” about the crisis in Rakhine.

During the 15 years she spent under house arrest by the country’s military rulers, her plight was widely covered by the same international news media that her government now seeks to punish. Many top officials in her government also were political prisoners during military rule.

But today, efforts to suppress criticism of the government have blossomed under her party, the National League for Democracy, including through the use of a harsh criminal defamation law that targets online speech.

Two of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s top appointees have enabled the prosecution of Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo. Shortly after they were arrested, the country’s president at the time authorized the police to proceed with the case. The attorney general, a former military officer, oversees the prosecution.

Not everyone in the National League for Democracy favors such harsh treatment.

U Nyan Win, secretary of the party’s central executive committee, said in an interview that the charges against Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo should be dismissed because they never reported on any official secrets. He recommended that the journalists appeal to the Supreme Court to quash the proceedings.

“By law, they have not committed any offense at the time they were arrested,” he said. “They had not released any information about the news they collected. They have not committed any offense.”

Human rights advocates here and abroad have expressed concern about the growing crackdown on free speech by Myanmar’s government.

In October, two ethnic Kachin Baptist community leaders, Dumdaw Nawng Lat and Langjaw Gam Seng, were found guilty of unlawful association and sentenced to 27 months in prison after they helped reporters document damage from military airstrikes near a Catholic church in the eastern state of Shan. Mr. Dumdaw Nawng Lat got an extra two years for defaming a military officer.

Last month, a former child soldier, Aung Ko Htway, 27, was sentenced to two years of hard labor after he described in an interview with Radio Free Asia how the military abducted him at 14 and forced him to serve as a soldier for nearly a decade. He was prosecuted for circulating information that could cause public fear or alarm.

“We have no rule of law in this country,” he told reporters as the police took him away.

One of the most powerful tools for stifling dissent has been a section of the telecommunications law, 66d, which allows anyone to file charges of online defamation, even if they have no connection to the supposed victim.

Under the previous government of President Thein Sein, which enacted the law, 11 such cases were brought. But in two years under Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, more than 100 such cases have been filed, including against journalists and government critics.

One target is U Swe Win, a co-founder of the news website Myanmar Now. He is charged with defamation for criticizing hateful comments spread by a Buddhist nationalist monk. He faces two years in prison.

An occasional contributor to The New York Times and other foreign publications, Mr. Swe Win served seven years in prison for taking part in a 1998 demonstration that protested military rule and backed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.

He said he has had to attend court hearings in his case every other week for nearly a year, but the case has moved so slowly he has never had a chance to present his defense.

“This is a very dangerous place to speak the truth,” he said.

In the case of the two Reuters journalists, the evidence presented by the prosecution has not been compelling.

Prosecution witnesses have disagreed on whether the journalists were arrested outside the restaurant or at a traffic checkpoint some distance away. One police officer admitted that he burned his notes of the arrest. Another testified that he was unfamiliar with police arrest procedures.

A local official who testified that he was present during the arrest admitted under cross-examination that he had written the checkpoint location on his hand so he would not forget it while he was testifying.

One police witness acknowledged that the information in the documents had already been published in newspaper reports before the journalists’ arrest.

Sean Bain, a legal adviser in Yangon for the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, attended the hearing last week and said the prosecution had not produced credible evidence. He urged the government to step in and dismiss the case.

“The outcome of these hearings doesn’t rest solely on the judge,” he said. “The government should instruct prosecutors to immediately drop the charges.”

Reuters has mounted a vigorous campaign to keep the case before the public eye. The human rights lawyer Amal Clooney recently announced that she would assist in their defense.

The reporters’ coverage has been honored with several awards since their arrest, including the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award.

“No journalists in the history of our country betrayed the country,” Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo told reporters after one hearing. “We reported the news to get the right information.”

At last week’s hearing, the defense argued that none of the prosecution’s 17 witnesses had produced evidence of a crime and that the case should be dismissed.

The prosecution countered that the documents found in the journalists’ possession were secret and that this was evidence they intended to harm Myanmar’s security. At one recent hearing, some 30 guards surrounded the journalists as they escorted them to and from the courtroom.

Officers allowed Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo to hold his 2-year-old daughter for a few minutes, though with his handcuffs on.

4,myanmar,"Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar, she said, must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organizations and the Government.

At the outset of her mission, the senior UN relief official met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, discussing the importance of ending conflict and to strengthen peace and reconciliation efforts in Myanmar.

Ms. Mueller also met with a number of senior Government officials for discussions of the humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states.

‘Humanitarian crisis on both sides of Bangladesh-Myanmar border’

Ms. Mueller, also the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, visited Rakhine state – where widespread violence last year forced hundreds of thousands of minority Muslim Rohingyas to flee their homes for safety, with most finding refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Other senior UN officials including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have condemned what they describe as the systematic persecution and murders of Rohingyas by elements of the Myanmar military.

In Maungdaw township, located near the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, Ms. Mueller met with local communities affected by the violence, visited a refugee return transit site that the Government of Myanmar is constructing some new housing projects and witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Ms. Mueller, noting that while the crisis facing Rohungya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, Banladesh, has captured the world’s attention, over 400,000 Rohingyas still living in Rakhine state continue to face hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions.

“These restrictions severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education, and other essential services,” she stressed.

Humanitarian workers have also been barred from access restrictions to violence-torn parts of Rakhine.

Furthermore, the situation in Myanmar’s Kachin state, in the country’s far north and Shan, in the east, has also deteriorated since the beginning of this year, with some 100,000 people displaced as a result of conflict between the military and armed groups.

“The conflict in Kachin is one the world’s longest running, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Ms. Mueller, calling on all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians in line with international law.

Implement recommendations of Rakhine panel ‘in the spirit’ they were written in

Ms. Mueller also underscored the need for the total and impartial implementation of recommendations made by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State “in the spirit that they were written.”

That panel, headed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, outlined long-term solutions to help end the violence and marginalization for all communities in Rakhine. It also focused on issues of citizenship and freedom of movement.

The senior UN aid official also noted that the conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees as well as internally displaced people can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, employment and access to services are addressed.

“The lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities of Rakhine state, whether they are ethnic Rakhine, Muslim, or from other minority groups, will be profoundly transformed if each recommendation is genuinely addressed and implemented,” she said.","No one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path to a better future, stresses UN official",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1006861
5,myanmar,"While the recent Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal is the main focus for American lawmakers questioning Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg today, the company’s record beyond the U.S. raises even more alarms.

During the hearing, Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy brought up the company’s role in the ongoing ethnic violence in Myanmar, citing one incident where death threats against a Muslim journalist did not violate the platform’s rules. In Myanmar, journalists are regularly arrested and even killed for reporting on the government’s activities.

“Six months ago I asked your general counsel about Facebook’s role as a breeding ground for hate speech against Rohingya refugees,” Leahy said. “Recently, U.N. investigators blamed Facebook for playing a role in inciting the possible genocide in Myanmar, and there has been genocide there.”

Using screenshots mounted on a poster, the Senator cited a specific threat calling for the death of Muslim journalists in the country:

That threat went straight through your detection systems. It spread very quickly and it took attempt after attempt after attempt and the involvement of civil society groups to get you to remove it. Why couldn’t it be removed within 24 hours?

Leahy interrupted Zuckerberg when he began to opine about the country’s tragedy. “We all agree it’s terrible,” Leahy said, pressing the Facebook founder for substantive answers.

Zuckerberg cited the language barrier as one of the main obstacles to proper moderation of hate speech and calls for violence.

“Hate speech is very language specific. It’s hard to do it without people who speak the local language and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically,” Zuckerberg said.

He mentioned the company’s plan to hire “dozens” of Burmese language content reviewers as the first part of a three-pronged approach in Myanmar, also noting a partnership with civil society groups to identify hate figures in the country rather than focusing on removing individual pieces of content.

Third, Zuckerberg stated that Facebook is “standing up a product team to do specific product changes in Myanmar” and other countries with similar situations, though he did not delve into the specifics of those changes.

Leahy’s line of questioning about Facebook’s influence in Myanmar is not speculative. In March, United Nations investigators concluded that disinformation campaigns facilitated by Facebook have played a “determining role” in inciting violence against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority ethnic group.

As Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar, stated those findings:

[Social media] has …substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media.

On April 5, a group of six NGOs working in the country addressed a critical letter to Zuckerberg, citing “issues that have been rife on Facebook in Myanmar for more than four years now,” criticizing the company for crediting its own systems with catching violent messages when in fact it had been these organizations doing the moderation work. When Zuckerberg responded to that letter just a day before he appeared before Congress, the NGO group dismissed his apology as “grossly insufficient.” It’s unlikely that they’ll be pleased with his lackluster testimony on the issue.

Last October, Facebook told TechCrunch that it works with NGOs and the local community in Myanmar to communicate its policies there, though its efforts seemed fairly toothless. At the time, the focus of that initiative was to “empower people in Myanmar to share positive messages online,” and one component offered local education on fake news. But by October of last year, incitements to violence on Facebook were already being connected to real-world acts against the country’s Rohingya population — a group facing systemic violence that’s widely regarded as a genocide.

For Facebook users in Myanmar, a country in which the platform is synonymous with the internet itself, the stakes couldn’t be higher. With the NGOs Facebook relies on in the Southeast Asian country deeply dissatisfied, it’s clear that words alone will no longer suffice.","In Senate hearing, Zuckerberg faces blame over violence in Myanmar",https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/myanmar-facebook-zuckerberg-senate-hearing-genocide/
6,myanmar,"Analyst says: ‘I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night’ after evidence emerges of a spike in posts inciting violence

Hate speech exploded on Facebook at the start of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar last year, analysis has revealed, with experts blaming the social network for creating “chaos” in the country.

Young lives hang by a thread as past haunts Rohingya mothers Read more

Evidence of the spike emerged after the platform was accused of playing a key role in the spread of hate speech in Myanmar at a time when 650,000 Rohingya refugees were forced to flee to Bangladesh following persecution.

Digital researcher and analyst Raymond Serrato examined about 15,000 Facebook posts from supporters of the hardline nationalist Ma Ba Tha group. The earliest posts dated from June 2016 and spiked on 24 and 25 August 2017, when ARSA Rohingya militants attacked government forces, prompting the security forces to launch the “clearance operation” that sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya pouring over the border.

Serrato’s analysis showed that activity within the anti-Rohingya group, which has 55,000 members, exploded with posts registering a 200% increase in interactions.

“Facebook definitely helped certain elements of society to determine the narrative of the conflict in Myanmar,” Serrato told the Guardian. “Although Facebook had been used in the past to spread hate speech and misinformation, it took on greater potency after the attacks.”

The revelations come to light as Facebook is struggling to respond to criticism over the leaking of users’ private data and concern about the spread of fake news and hate speech on the platform.

Alan Davis, an analyst from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who led a two-year study of hate speech in Myanmar, said that in the months before August he noticed posts on Facebook becoming “more organised and odious, and more militarised”.

I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night. Alan Davis, analyst

His research team encountered fabricated stories stating that “mosques in Yangon are stockpiling weapons in an attempt to blow up various Buddhist pagodas and Shwedagon pagoda”, the most sacred Buddhist site in Yangon in a smear campaign against Muslims. These pages also featured posts calling Rohingya the derogatory term “kalars” and “Bengali terrorists”. Signs denoting “Muslim-free” areas were shared more than 11,000 times.

When the monitors working with Davis called officials about the signs, they were told the officials knew nothing about them. When he tried to fund a team of local journalists to investigate and report on them, the journalists all declined for reasons of safety.

Davis said this was the defining moment. “People just thought ‘oh well, we can just keep on doing what we do.’”

Facebook the only source of information

Among Myanmar’s 53 million residents, less than 1% had internet access in 2014. But by 2016, the country appeared to have more Facebook users than any other south Asian country. Today, more than 14 million of its citizens use Facebook. A 2016 report by GSMA, the global body representing mobile operators, found that in Myanmar many people considered Facebook the only internet entry point for information, and that many regarded postings as news.

One cyber security analyst in Yangon, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of online attacks, said: “Facebook is arguably the only source of information online for the majority in Myanmar.”

In early March, UN Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee warned that “Facebook has become a beast.” “It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,” she said.

Myanmar has agreed to a visit by the UN security council after months of resistance, but it remains unclear whether ambassadors will be allowed to go to Rakhine state, the body’s president said Monday.

A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was ramping up efforts to remove hate content and people who repeatedly violate the company’s hate-speech policies. “We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,” she said.



“We now have around 14,000 people working across community ops, online ops and our integrity efforts globally – almost double where we were a year ago – and will have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.”

On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Vox that the spread of hate speech on the platform in Myanmar was “a real issue”.

Serrato called on Facebook to be more open with its data. “Right now, we have no way of knowing which people like or share certain posts so we cannot track how disinformation or hate speech spreads on the platform.”

But Davis said the damage was done. “I think things are so far gone in Myanmar right now ... I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night. If they had any kind of conscience they would be pouring a good percentage of their fortunes into reversing the chaos they have created.”

Facebook has been accused of fomenting violence elsewhere in the region. In March the Sri Lankan district of Kandy was the site of mass riots and arson by Buddhist nationalist fanatics.

The Sri Lankan minister for telecommunication, Harin Fernando, told the Guardian the government ordered Facebook and other social media services to be shut down at the height of the violence. “This whole country could have been burning in hours,” Fernando told the Guardian.

""We now we have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe,"" Zuckerberg said.

However, the activists who originally called Zuckerberg out said his response did not ""change our core belief that your proposed improvements are nowhere near enough to ensure that Myanmar users are provided with the same standards of care as users in the US or Europe,"" reiterating the heightened stakes in the Southeast Asian country.

8,myanmar,"The ministry said in a statement that 51 Myanmar workers were aboard the ill-fated bus when it crashed in a roadside ditch late Monday.

“Twelve of 30 workers suffered serious injuries but none were life-threatening,” U San Maung Oo, labour attaché of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok said Tuesday.

The victims were among 200 workers sent in four buses to work at an electronics factory in the Thai capital by the Golden Royal Mandalay Overseas Employment Agency under an agreement between the two countries.

One of the buses that was carrying 51 Myanmar women workers plunged into a roadside ditch after one of its wheels broke.

Myanmar Embassy officials in Bangkok said that two of its labour attachés went to the accident site to assist the victims.

The Myanmar military attaché and the Thai military commander in the region cancelled meetings and went to the accident area to help the workers.

The company that insured the buses has promised to pay 700,000 baht (US$22,241/K29.65 million) to the families of each of the six workers who died in the accident, according to to a local migrant rights group and Myanmar Embassy officials.

Labour attaché U San Maung Oo said they would delay sending more workers from Myanmar to prevent such accidents, as hundred of thousands of Myanmar migrant workers are now returning home for the Thingyan Festival.

He said that passenger vehicles are rushing from Mae Sot to Bangkok, without rest and without undergoing maintenance checks, to accommodate workers who want to go home to Myanmar for the Thingyan Festival as well as for new workers coming to Thailand.

He said there have been at least four vehicular accidents in the area recently. Fourteen Myanmar workers who were returning home for Thingyan luckily escaped from a van fire in the area on Monday.

A prominent Myanmar attorney has agreed to handle the case of a former child soldier sentenced to two years of hard labor following his conviction for describing his abduction and forced military service as a minor in an interview last year with RFA’s Myanmar Service.

In late March, Dagon Seikkan Township Court in Yangon convicted Aung Ko Htway, 27, who spent nearly a decade as a child soldier, for public incitement under Section 505(b) of the country’s Penal Code.

Aung Ko Htway appeared before judge Chit Ko Ko at the same court on Tuesday along with three others accused of desecrating the country’s seal during a previous hearing in January when they trampled on a copy of the military-drafted 2008 constitution in a sign of protest.

All four face a maximum sentence of three years in prison if found guilty.

Legal activist and human rights lawyer Robert San Aung, who attended the hearing, said he is taking up Aung Ko Htway’s case and will represent him in future court hearings.

In 2015, Robert San Aung received the annual Martin Ennals Award in recognition of his work as one of Myanmar’s top human rights defenders.

Aung Ko Htway was abducted by a Myanmar army sergeant in 2005 when he was 14 years old and later imprisoned after he and two others escaped and robbed the owner of a motorcycle. One of the other boys had strangled the man, though Aung Ko Htway maintains that he did not participate in the murder.

He served seven months at a prison camp in Lashio, the largest town in Myanmar’s northern Shan state, where he was shackled and fed a mixture of rice and sand until he agreed to sign a confession.

Though Aung Ko Htway was originally sentenced to death, he had his sentence reduced twice under presidential amnesties. He was finally released on July 15, 2017, and returned home where he started a business with his sister’s help selling cotton clothing in Kalawae village in Yangon region’s Thanlyin township.

Interviewed about his experiences by RFA in August 2017, he was arrested about a week after his story aired.

11,myanmar,"When the world’s fastest-growing refugee crisis barreled into a sleepy coastal town in southern Bangladesh last August, the prime minister in Dhaka pledged that her impoverished country would go without food if that was what it took to help the Rohingya fleeing violence from the army in Myanmar. Almost nine months later, that welcome is starting to wear thin as the exodus far exceeds past influxes of Rohingya refugees and settles into a prolonged, seemingly intractable situation, taxing one of the world’s poorest and most densely populated countries.



Bangladesh, no stranger to the Myanmar military’s paroxysms of ethno-nationalist violence, has historically provided shelter to the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority from next door. Desperate masses arrived in 1978, followed by more in 1991 when a quarter of a million Rohingya fled violence in overwhelmingly Buddhist Myanmar. Sectarian clashes in 2012 prompted another wave.

13,myanmar,"Nearly 700,000 Rohingya people, a minority Muslim group from Myanmar, have arrived in Bangladesh since August 2017, fleeing violence and persecution. The overwhelming majority continue to live in crowded refugee camps, where they join hundreds of thousands of other Rohingya refugees that arrived in years prior. More than half of the recent arrivals are children — and they’re severely malnourished, according to a new study released today by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The study focused on 268 children living at the Kutupalong refugee camp, a government-run settlement in Cox’s Bazar in southeast Bangladesh that is the world’s largest refugee camp, and found that 43.4 percent are experiencing chronic malnutrition, while 47.9 percent are suffering from anemia.

Globally, malnutrition is the largest contributor to disease, particularly among children, according to the World Food Program. Eva Leidman, MSPH, an epidemiologist with the CDC’s Emergency Response and Recovery Branch and the lead researcher behind the study, told The Outline that child malnutrition can lead to severe health complications and death.

“Malnutrition is known to increase the severity and duration of many infectious diseases, including, for example, measles — a particular concern given ongoing circulation of measles in the camps,” Leidman said.

The new arrivals in Bangladesh joined an estimated 200,000 Rohingya refugees who had previously fled Myanmar, where members of the Muslim ethnic group are considered illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, denied citizenship, and regularly subject to discrimination. The August 2017 exodus began after a small group of Rohingya militants attacked police posts in the Rakhine province, according to the Myanmar government. Following the attacks, Myanmar’s, backed by local mobs, burned Rohingya villages and killed civilians. The recent wave of refugees caused the population of the camps to more than double, according to the CDC study.

The problem in the Rohingya refugee camps isn’t a lack of food — it’s the kind of food that was being distributed, Leidman found. “The Rohingya are primarily dependent on food by the humanitarian community. These distributions early on contained limited micronutrients,” Leidman said, adding that humanitarian groups have since altered the kinds of foods they distribute.

Malnutrition and disease are just two problems Rohingya refugees are facing in Bangladesh. As monsoon season approaches, the refugee camps — crowded tent cities — are at risk of being destroyed by floods and landslides. The Guardian reported in January that an estimated 100,000 people will have to relocate from the Kutupalong camp, the focus of the CDC’s study.

But the Rohingya can’t return to Myanmar yet, even though the country’s government has verified a few hundred Rohingya for possible repatriation, Reuters reports. Ursula Mueller, the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, told Reuters that Myanmar’s government remains hostile to the Muslim minority group.

“I witnessed areas where villages were burned down and bulldozed,” Mueller said. “From what I’ve seen and heard from people — no access to health services, concerns about protection, continued displacements — conditions are not conducive to return.”",Children in the world’s largest refugee camp are severely malnourished,https://theoutline.com/post/4121/rohingya-refugee-children-severely-malnourished-cdc-study
14,myanmar,"Minister U Win Myat Aye told The Myanmar Times on Monday that he is scheduled to meet with refugees, humanitarian workers and Bangladeshi authorities to discuss the delayed repatriation process during his visit.

Deadly attacks on government security outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and a brutal counterinsurgency campaign by Myanmar’s security forces prompted the exodus to Bangladesh of hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from northern Rakhine State. The government designates ARSA as a terrorist group.

According to the UN, the number of people who have fled the conflict could number more than 700,000.

U Win Myat Aye said the visit intended to help speed up the stalled repatriation of refugees and hasten the citizenship verification process.

“The rainy season is approaching. We want this process to move fast. While (in Cox’s Bazar), I will meet with families residing in the camps and pass on a message that our side is ready for repatriation,” he said.

He also said he has asked Bangladeshi authorities to set up a meeting with the families whose names are on Myanmar’s list of the first batch of refugees for repatriation.

“I will also visit the camps. I will assure of Myanmar’s readiness for repatriation,” U Win Myat Aye said.

Following the postponement of planned repatriation on January 23, Bangladesh provided a list of 8032 refugees for repatriation after talks between the two countries in February.

In mid-March, the government announced it was ready to take 374 refugees that had been verified as residents of Myanmar.

However, international organisations, including the UN, have expressed concerns that Myanmar is not ready for the return of hundreds of thousands of refugee families.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), who visited Myanmar from April 2-8, said the Myanmar government needs humanitarian assistance and was not ready yet for repatriating refugees.

During her visit, she went to Maungdaw township, which is at the centre of the conflict in northern Rakhine, as well as refugee camps in the Rakhine capital of Sittwe. She also met with displaced people in Kachin and Shan states.

“Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organisations and the government,” Ms Mueller said in a statement after her visit.

“Wherever they are in the country and regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status, we need to work together to ensure that no vulnerable conflict-affected people are deprived of safe and sustained access to humanitarian protection and assistance. No one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path toward a better future,” she said.

She also called for the implementation of the recommendations by the Rakhine Advisory Commission led by former UN chief Kofi Annan, which would transform the “lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities” in Rakhine regardless of race and religion.

Ms Mueller expressed concern over the continued restrictions imposed by the government on the free movement of Muslims and humanitarian workers in northern Rakhine.

She stressed the urgent need for more funding of the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, which is estimated at US$183 million (K243.68 billion) to meet the needs of more than 830,000 people in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan and Kayin states.

YANGON, Myanmar

A senior UN official on Sunday called on the government of Myanmar to grant humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people affected by conflicts in the country.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, concluded her six-day mission to the country on Sunday. She visited several conflict-torn ethnic areas of Myanmar including western Rakhine state, northern Kachin state and northeastern Shan state.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan states,” said Mueller in a statement.

“When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” she said.

In Rakhine’s Maungdaw Township where a military operation forced nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee cross-border to neighboring Bangladesh, she witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed, said the statement.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” she said.

She also visited a refugee return transit site that the government is constructing in Maungdaw.

In meeting with Rakhine regional government officials, she called for an end to movement restrictions and for practical measures to allow humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.",Humanitarian access worsening in Myanmar: UN official,http://aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/humanitarian-access-worsening-in-myanmar-un-official/1112060
18,myanmar,"In a letter obtained by The New York Times, Mark Zuckerberg responded to a group of Myanmar activists who have criticized Facebook’s handling of material meant to incite violence in the country. But the groups continue to say Facebook isn’t doing enough.

Last week, Zuckerberg was interviewed by Vox’s Ezra Klein. During the interview, Zuckerberg was asked about violence in Myanmar, where investigators say Facebook drives hate speech against the minority Rohingya population. To illustrate Facebook’s work in the country, Zuckerberg described a situation where Facebook “systems” successfully flagged attempts to spread violence.

After the interview was published, Myanmar civil society groups released an open letter addressed to Zuckerberg, which said the groups themselves uncovered the messages. The letter further criticized the CEO’s characterization of Facebook’s work in Myanmar, saying the events showed the company had “an over-reliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency.”

Zuckerberg said the groups have an “important role”

Zuckerberg’s new response to the groups’ letter apologized for the slight and highlighted their “important role” in the country. He said Facebook was adding dozens of Burmese-language reviewers, and that the company was bringing on more people dedicated to Myanmar issues.

But the groups, in another response, immediately criticized Zuckerberg’s letter, saying it “doesn’t change our core belief that your proposed improvements are nowhere near enough to ensure that Myanmar users are provided with the same standards of care as users in the U.S. or Europe.”

“When things go wrong in Myanmar, the consequences can be really serious — potentially disastrous,” the groups write. “You have yourself publicly acknowledged the risk of the platform being abused towards real harm.”

Here is a copy of Mark Zuckerberg’s email response:

Dear Htaike Htaike, Jes, Victoire, Phyu Phyu and Thant, I wanted to personally respond to your open letter. Thank you for writing it and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues, including the September incident you referred to. In making my remarks, my intention was to highlight how we’re building artificial intelligence to help us better identify abusive, hateful or false content even before it is flagged by our community. These improvements in technology and tools are the kinds of solutions that your organizations have called on us to implement and we are committed to doing even more. For example, we are rolling out improvements to our reporting mechanism in Messenger to make it easier to find and simpler for people to report conversations. In addition to improving our technology and tools, we have added dozens more Burmese language reviewers to handle reports from users across all our services. We have also increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues and we now we have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe. There are several other improvements we have made or are making, and I have directed my teams to ensure we are doing all we can to get your feedback and keep you informed. We are grateful for your support as we map out our ongoing work in Myanmar, and we are committed to working with you to find more ways to be responsive to these important issues. Mark

19,myanmar,"Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to step up efforts to block hate messages in Myanmar as he faced questioning by the US Congress about electoral interference and hate speech on the platform.

Facebook has been accused by human rights advocates of not doing enough to weed out hate messages on its social-media network in Myanmar, where it is a dominant communications system.

""What's happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more,"" Zuckerberg said during a five-hour joint hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.

More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown last August.

United Nations officials investigating a possible genocide in Myanmar said last month that Facebook had been a source of anti-Rohingya propaganda.

Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, said in March that social media had played a ""determining role"" in Myanmar.

Zuckerberg said Facebook was hiring dozens more Burmese-language speakers to remove threatening content.

""It's hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically,"" he said, adding that Facebook was also asking civil society groups to help it identify figures who should be banned from the network.

20,myanmar,"The disagreement centers on a chain letter that spread on Facebook Messenger in Myanmar in September. The messages warned Buddhist communities of an imminent Muslim attack. Meanwhile, Muslim populations received a separate message cautioning them of violence from militant Buddhist groups.

Civil society groups say the messages paralyzed major cities in Myanmar and raised fears of a violent clash. Such incitement and scaremongering have become far too typical on Facebook, according to the groups, which say Facebook has repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to devote more resources to the issues.

In an interview last week, Mr. Zuckerberg appeared to hold up the September episode as a model of Facebook’s effectiveness, and said the company’s systems had detected the messages and stopped them. In fact, the activists said, they flagged the messages repeatedly to Facebook, barraging its employees with strongly worded appeals until the company finally stepped in to help.

Mr. Zuckerberg’s personal email did not quell the activists’ frustration. The groups say the biggest obstruction to their attempts to push back against a torrent of dangerous hate speech is not their lack of resources but Facebook itself. They said Facebook had a history of pledging to do more to help quell ethnic violence in Myanmar but had not fulfilled its promises.

“It’s great that he’s engaging personally with this, but the stuff he’s talking about is really not that much different from what they’ve been saying for the past few years,” said Jes Petersen, the chief executive of Phandeeyar, an innovation lab in Myanmar that has worked with Facebook to produce localized versions of its community standards.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, confirmed the authenticity of Mr. Zuckerberg’s email, and said Facebook was planning to continue engaging with the activists.

Years after civil society groups first began flagging hate speech in Myanmar, the company still has no permanent office or staff in the country and seems to be struggling to give its platform sufficient oversight. In Germany, where hate speech laws require vigilant attention from content reviewers, Facebook has hired about 1,200 moderators. In order to achieve the same ratio of users to moderators in Myanmar, Facebook would need to have around 800 reviewers in the country, Mr. Petersen calculated.

“Dozens of content reviewers is not going to cut it,” he said.

The civil society groups have already responded to Mr. Zuckerberg’s reply, asking for hard data about Facebook’s efforts in the region, including how many Burmese-speaking reviewers the company has, how many accounts the company has taken down in Myanmar and how long, on average, it takes for Facebook to respond to reports of hate speech.

“A lot of what they’ve been doing is cosmetic — it’s not the tangible improvement we’re looking for,” said Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in Myanmar who was named in Mr. Zuckerberg’s reply.

Activists in other developing countries have raised similar complaints about Facebook’s behavior. In Indonesia, politicians have called Facebook executives to account for the spread of disinformation. In the Philippines, critics of President Rodrigo Duterte have faced barrages of threatening posts. Last month, the government of Sri Lanka ordered Facebook blocked in an attempt to stem mob violence against Muslim communities.

Last month, Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s News Feed head, said in an interview that he and other Facebook executives “lose some sleep” over the possibility that Facebook had led to real-world violence.

Mr. Petersen said he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg’s appeal would spur actual change and not just expressions of worry. “I wonder how he spent those sleepless nights — because we didn’t see that much change,” he said.

Here is the full text of Mr. Zuckerberg’s email to the civil society groups, followed by the groups’ response:

From 11 November – 9 December, the public donated more than $5.3 million dollars to these agencies, which include the Australian Red Cross, Australia for UNCR, CARE Australia, Caritas Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia.

The Australian Government provided $5 million in matched donations to the Australian Red Cross and Australia for UNHCR, as part of its $31.5 million contribution in response to the crisis. This brings the total amount of the joint appeal to more than $10.3 million.

Impact of joint funding

These funds are helping deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by recent violence in Myanmar, including the more than 655,000 people who have fled to Bangladesh.

Public donations are supporting life-saving aid such as the provision of shelter, clean water, sanitation, food, health care, psychological first aid and child protection.

Donations to UNHCR has helped the organisation provide 231,000 displaced people with access to clean water, and 155,000 people with medical care. UNHCR has also delivered more than 800,000 humanitarian relief items to families affected by this crisis.

Donations to the Australian Red Cross are helping to operate one field hospital, five mobile and three fixed clinics in Cox’s Bazar, which is home to the majority of the displaced Rohingya. These health facilities have treated almost 50,000 people since August 2017.

Australia’s support

Since 25 August 2017 when the violence in Rakhine State escalated, Australia has committed $31.5 million towards relief efforts. This funding is in addition to over $95 million that we have provided since 2013 to respond to humanitarian needs in Myanmar and for people displaced to Bangladesh.

22,myanmar,"(Yangon/New York, 8 April 2018): At the conclusion today of a six-day mission to Myanmar, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Ursula Mueller called for strengthened humanitarian action based on the rights and needs of all communities, in line with international law and humanitarian principles.

“Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organizations and the Government,” said Ms. Mueller. “Wherever they are in the country and regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status, we need to work together to ensure that no vulnerable conflict-affected people are deprived of safe and sustained access to humanitarian protection and assistance. No-one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path towards a better future.”

At the outset of her mission, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. They discussed the importance of ending conflict and of strengthening peace and reconciliation efforts. Ms. Mueller reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to supporting peace, stability, and development in Myanmar. She offered the continued support of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners to ensure that all people affected by conflict and natural disasters get the humanitarian protection and assistance they need. They agreed on the importance of strengthening national capacities. Ms. Mueller noted the efforts being made by the UN to strengthen the nexus between humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts.

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator also met with the Ministers of Defence, Border Affairs, International Cooperation, and the Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. The meetings with the Union Government were an opportunity to discuss humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states as well as the collaborative efforts of the international community and the Government on disaster preparedness efforts.

In Rakhine State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator visited camps where about 130,000 people, most of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, remain confined in deplorable conditions after almost six years of displacement. In Maungdaw Township, she met with local communities affected by last year’s violence. Ms. Mueller also visited a refugee return transit site that the Government is constructing, some new housing projects, and witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Ms. Mueller. “The unfolding tragedy in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar rightly captured the world’s attention, but we cannot, and must not, forget the plight of over 400,000 Muslim people still living in Rakhine State who continue to face a life of hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions. These restrictions severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education, and other essential services.”

“The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has provided an important roadmap towards a better future for all communities in Rakhine State, but its recommendations need to be implemented holistically and impartially, in the spirit that they were written,” said Ms. Mueller. “The lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities of Rakhine State, whether they are ethnic Rakhine, Muslim, or from other minority groups, will be profoundly transformed if each recommendation is genuinely addressed and implemented. The conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees and positive outcomes for internally displaced people in camps slated for closure can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, social cohesion, livelihoods, and access to services are addressed.”

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator welcomed the access that she was granted by the Government to visit communities in different parts of Rakhine. She was concerned, however, by the continued restrictions imposed by the authorities on the movement of the Muslim population, as well as the continued restrictions faced by humanitarian workers.

In her meeting with officials in the Rakhine State Government, Ms. Mueller called for movement restrictions to be dropped and for practical measures to be taken to allow humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, in line with the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan States. When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” said Ms. Mueller. “I was able to go to northern Rakhine and to some of the camps in Kachin State, but what matters most is that the people affected by violence and restrictions in these areas are themselves given access to the assistance and services they so desperately need.”

In Kachin State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with representatives of international and national humanitarian organizations and visited camps where she spoke with displaced people. She also met with a group of women and girls who were taking action to respond to the needs of women in displaced communities, including preventing gender-based violence. The women emphasized the importance of prevention and education in building stronger, safer communities, and presented a joint letter to the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator raising critical concerns shared by displaced women across Kachin.

At least 10,000 people have been newly displaced or re-displaced by fighting between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in Kachin and Shan States since the beginning of the year, while about 100,000 people remain displaced as a result of the conflict between the Myanmar Army and the Kachin Independence Army that restarted in 2011. Ms. Mueller was particularly impressed by the work of local civil society organizations. She met with representatives of a number of different local organizations and commended them on their outstanding work. She was encouraged to see that the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels more than 40 per cent of its funding through national organizations.

“The conflict in Kachin is one the world’s longest running, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Ms. Mueller. “Clashes break out near displacement camps and civilian areas, landmines are still being placed in the fields and roads of Kachin and Shan States, and people continue to flee their homes. I call on all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians wherever they are, in line with international law.”

During her mission, Ms. Mueller also discussed ways of strengthening disaster preparedness and response. “Myanmar is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and the last time I was here was nearly ten years ago in the tragic aftermath of Cyclone Nargis,” said Ms. Mueller. “I see that much has changed since then and while disaster risk reduction efforts need to be further enhanced, the Government and national organizations have made excellent progress in recent years in building national capacity for disaster preparedness and response.”

More funding is urgently required for the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, which calls for $183 million to meet the needs of 832,000 people in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and Kayin States.

23,myanmar,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts investigating a possible genocide in Myanmar said on Monday that Facebook had played a role in spreading hate speech there.

Facebook had no immediate comment on the criticism on Monday, although in the past the company has said that it was working to remove hate speech in Myanmar and kick off people who shared such content consistently.

More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown last August. Many have provided harrowing testimonies of executions and rapes by Myanmar security forces.

The U.N. human rights chief said last week he strongly suspected acts of genocide had taken place. Myanmar’s national security adviser demanded “clear evidence”.

Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told reporters that social media had played a “determining role” in Myanmar.

“It has ... substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,” he said.

U.N. Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee said Facebook was a huge part of public, civil and private life, and the government used it to disseminate information to the public.

“Everything is done through Facebook in Myanmar,” she told reporters, adding that Facebook had helped the impoverished country but had also been used to spread hate speech.

“It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,” she said.

“I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.”

The most prominent of Myanmar’s hard-line nationalist monks, Wirathu, emerged from a one-year preaching ban on Saturday and said his anti-Muslim rhetoric had nothing to do with violence in Rakhine state.

Facebook suspends and sometimes removes anyone that “consistently shares content promoting hate”, the company said last month in response to a question about Wirathu’s account.

“If a person consistently shares content promoting hate, we may take a range of actions such as temporarily suspending their ability to post and ultimately, removal of their account.”",U.N. investigators cite Facebook role in Myanmar crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN
24,myanmar,"YANGON (Reuters) - Seven Myanmar soldiers have been sentenced to “10 years in prison with hard labor in a remote area” for participating in a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in a village in northwestern Rakhine state last September, the army said on Tuesday.

The military said in a statement published on Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing’s office Facebook page that seven soldiers have had “action taken against them” for “contributing and participating in murder”.

The massacre was being investigated by two Reuters journalists - Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - who were subsequently arrested in December and are still behind bars facing charges of violating the country’s Official Secrets Act.

The authorities told Reuters in February the military opened an internal investigation independently and that it is unrelated to the Reuters reporters who are accused of obtaining unrelated secret government papers.

The Rohingya men from the northern Rakhine village of Inn Din were buried in a mass grave in early September after being hacked to death or shot by Buddhist neighbors and soldiers. Reuters published its story on the murder in February.

The murders were part of a larger army crackdown on the Rohingya, beset by allegations of murder, rape, arson and looting, unleashed in response to Rohingya militant attacks on security forces in late August. The United Nations and the United States described it as ethnic cleansing - an accusation which Myanmar denies.

“Four officers were denounced and permanently dismissed from the military and sentenced to 10 years with hard labor at a prison in a remote area. Three soldiers of other rank were demoted to the rank of ‘private’, permanently dismissed from the military and sentenced to 10 years with hard labor at a prison in a remote area,” read the military statement.

It added that legal proceedings against the police personnel and civilians “involved in the crime” are still under way.

On Jan. 10, the military said the 10 Rohingya men belonged to a group of 200 militants who had attacked security forces. Buddhist villagers attacked some of them with swords and soldiers shot the others dead, the military had said.

The military’s version of events is contradicted by accounts given to Reuters by Rakhine Buddhist and Rohingya Muslim witnesses published in the February story.

Buddhist villagers reported no attack by a large number of insurgents on security forces in Inn Din. And Rohingya witnesses told Reuters that soldiers plucked the 10 from among hundreds of men, women and children who had sought safety on a nearby beach.

Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine state and crossed into southern Bangladesh since August, creating one of the world’s largest refugee camps.

A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether the two Reuters reporters will be charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

On Wednesday, the judge will rule on a motion by defense lawyers for dismissal of the case.
