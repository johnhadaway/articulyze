0,myanmar,"Dhaka: Islamic foreign ministers on Sunday launched a campaign to mobilise international support for action against Myanmar over the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials said.

Foreign ministers and diplomats of the 53-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) set up a campaign committee during two days of talks in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka.

OIC secretary-general Yousef bin Ahmed Al-Othaimeen called the move a key step toward ending a crisis caused by the exodus of about 7,00,000 Muslim Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar into camps in Bangladesh.

He said the new committee would ""mobilise and coordinate international political support for accountability for human rights violations against the Rohingya community.""

""This is very important. This is one of the concrete steps that has been taken to alleviate the problem for our (Rohingya) brothers and sisters,"" he said.

A military campaign launched in Myanmar's Rakhine state in August last year set off the massive influx of the Muslim minority into Bangladesh where they joined 3,00,000 refugees already living in squalid camps following previous violence.

The United Nations and the United States have said the crackdown amounted to ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar army has said it only targeted militants.

Rohingya civilians have told of murders and rapes as they fled. They say the army burned hundreds of Rohingya villages to the ground.

Al-Othaimeen said Muslim nations had to ""pressure the international community"".

""This is not religious, this is human basic rights of our brothers and sisters in the last 50 years,"" he said.

The International Criminal Court prosecutor has already called for the tribunal to rule on whether it can investigate the allegations of mass rape and killings.

Bangladesh has put huge diplomatic effort into pressuring Myanmar to take back the refugees in safety.

The two nations signed a repatriation deal in November, but nobody has since returned.

The Rohingya have been persecuted for decades in Myanmar, where they are regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.

Last month a UN Security Council delegation visiting the camps called for the safe return of the Rohingya and an end to discrimination against them.

Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland also called for ""accountability"" when she toured the Rohingya camps this week.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali said the OIC meeting had urged ""strong action against the Myanmar government"" on the Rohingya crisis.",Organisation of Islamic Cooperation seeks global pressure on Myanmar over Rohingya refugee crisis,https://www.firstpost.com/world/organization-of-islamic-conference-seeks-global-pressure-on-myanmar-over-rohingya-refugee-crisis-4458167.html
1,myanmar,"The international and Rohingya communities have consistently urged Asean to play a greater role in helping end the crisis in Myanmar’s Rakhine state after some 700,000 people fled from the conflict to Bangladesh since August last year.

While the United Nations has viewed the issue seriously due to atrocities and hinted at “ethnic cleansing”, Asean, of which Myanmar is a member, has confined its involvement to humanitarian assistance.

Asean leaders said they continued to support Myanmar’s humanitarian relief programme in Rakhine and welcomed the ongoing work of the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to deliver humanitarian assistance to all displaced persons without discrimination, according to the chairman’s statement issued at the meeting last month in Singapore.

“I hope Asean in the near future can develop things beyond the humanitarian dimension, but Myanmar’s trust must be earned,” Marty told a group of editors and senior journalists at the Asean Media Forum held in Singapore on Friday.

Non-interference, which is the main principle of the regional grouping, is no longer an excuse for Asean to refrain from getting involved in the crisis in Myanmar since the group has played crucial roles in political developments in the country for a long time, he said.

“It is certainly an internal issue of Myanmar but that does not mean there is no potential for regional contribution,” Marty said.

Asean used to work intensively to have the Myanmar authority and the military deliver on its seven-step road map towards democracy and reconciliation, which eventually ended up with the 2008 constitution and a historic election in 2010.

The process paved the way for the current government under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi.

On the Rohingya issue, Marty said many Asean countries – notably Indonesia – used to play a key role to facilitate communication with the government in Nay Pyi Taw to the tackle the problem in 2013.

The communal conflict in Myanmar’s Rakhine state took place as the Muslim Rohingya have been discriminated against by the authorities and the Buddhist majority. By calling them Bengali, the Myanmar authorities have denied them citizenship.

Another relevant issue for Asean is the territorial disputes in the South China Sea where many members of the group including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam are contestants with China for a long time.

The way Asean dealt with the issue over the past decades is to prolong the problem, rather than resolve it with drastic action, Marty said, and added that the group had spent time, resources and energy to produce the non-binding Declaration of the Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002. But, the situation in the contentious sea has only aggravated since then.

The group is now producing another document known as the code of conduct which, Marty said, was based on a draft he has seen and would not be any different from the DOC.

“I mean diplomats cannot just sit in the room to discuss where to put a comma and hyphen, since things happen at sea, otherwise the code of conduct would be obsolete on the very day it is adopted,” he said.","Drastic action needed to tackle Rohingya crisis, says Marty",http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/asean-plus/30344758

3,myanmar,"Myanmar’s leaders deny human rights abuses against its Rohingya Muslim population. But international organizations like Amnesty International have documented systematic, military-led violence against the country’s religious minority following insurgent attacks in August 2017.

“What we've seen over the last seven months is the Myanmar military has really launched an attack on the [Rohingya] population as a whole,” said Matt Wells, a human rights investigator with Amnesty International.

Listen to Matt Well's interview about his work in Myanmar with Amnesty International.

Wells’ job involves documenting and corroborating human rights abuses. During recent trips to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, he spoke directly with survivors of attacks that range from sexual violence to the burning of entire villages. His organization has corroborated firsthand accounts using technologies like satellite imagery.

“We've documented more than 350 villages that have been totally or partially destroyed in the last seven months. And the results of this has been more than 670,000 people have been forced across the border into Bangladesh in the span of seven months.”

The UN Security Council visited Myanmar for the first time on April 30. Following the delegation’s visit, the United Nations called for the safe and voluntary repatriation of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh. Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a resettlement agreement in January, but many Rohingya say they fear going back and the agreement has not been implemented.

In order to guarantee safe conditions for the Rohingya, Wells wants to see action from powerful actors, like the United States. In December 2017 the United States imposed sanctions on general Maung Maung Soe, who oversaw the most recent violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Still, Wells is urging the consideration of a bill authored by Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, which would impose additional sanctions, provide humanitarian aid and prohibit certain types of military cooperation between the United States and Myanmar.

INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:

Matt Wells provides context to the Rohingya crisis:

This is a population, the Rohingya, that has been subjected to really systemic discrimination for years, in a way that we have saidamounts to apartheid. They have been denied the ability to move around. They have to get specific travel authorization simply to move from village to village. They're denied access to education. They are denied access to healthcare… So what's happened over the last seven months, this very acute violence that's been perpetrated against them, comes on the heels of what has been a whole system of persecution that's existed for a long time to the authorities in Myanmar.

They are considered to be to be foreigners, to not actually be part of the fabric of the country even though they have lived in this part of Myanmar for generations… And so you have this deep-seated racism, really, that has been unlocked over the last year or two, in particular by the rise of populism in Myanmar. You had a rise of really Buddhist nationalist populist movement that is has? then helped fuel a lot of the suspicion and actually outright hatred towards the Rohingya population.

Matt Wells describes one Rohingya victim he met in Bangladesh in September 2017:

I interviewed a 12-year-old girl named Fatima. She had been in a village in Myanmar where the military had surrounded it. She was at home with her family as the soldiers came in, surrounded her house. She saw as her father was shot and killed. She saw her younger sister, a 10-year-old, was shot and killed. She herself was shot in the thigh. When I saw her, she still had the gunshot wound in her thigh. A neighbor had fortunately picked her up and carried her to a neighboring village, and then ultimately onto to Bangladesh. And it is a story that I heard again and again, in which in response to these attacks by an armed group, the Myanmar military made no effort to distinguish between the actual attackers and the broader civilian population, and instead launched an attack on the population as a whole, through killing, through sexual violence against women and girls, and through the systematic burning of villages across this region.

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

Suzette Grillot: Matt Wells, welcome to World Views.

Matt Wells: Thank you for having me.

Grillot: Well, let's see. You work for Amnesty International now, but your background, educational background is in history, psychology and law, and then you've gotten off into human rights. You actually study and engage on issues of mass human rights violations, along the lines of atrocities, you know, horrible things like genocide.

Wells: I was working with Human Rights Watch at the time of the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire in 2010-2011, and through that, you know, documented horrific abuses that were committed by both sides of that conflict. And with that really started down the path of developing a specialty in investigating mass atrocities and particularly in situations of armed conflict. I worked in South Sudan. I worked in D.R. Congo. And, most recently, I focused on Myanmar and the ongoing crisis related to the Rohingya Muslim population there.

Grillot: We've talked a lot about the Rohingya crisis on the show. And so we're definitely going to get to that. But when you say that you you've witnessed abuses, human rights abuses, I mean, what are you talking about? What are the things that you have been witnessing? What are the kinds of tools that these combatants in civil war are engaging in?

Wells: So in many of these places we're talking about, you know, civilians are really being targeted by armed groups on both sides. It obviously depends very much on the country, you know, what exactly is happening. But, you know, in many instances I'm directly, you know, interviewing people who have been victims themselves to human rights abuses or who have directly witnessed often, you know, a family member who's been killed, who's been, you know, taken to detention and subjected to torture. And so the work is often rooted in speaking with direct victims and witnesses to human rights violations that have taken place and coupling that with new technologies that help us really corroborate what we're hearing from witnesses, from satellite imagery, to photos and videos that we can verify in terms of what's happening in particular places. And we can bring all of that together, and then, you know, present a really tight picture of exactly what's happened and who is responsible for the violations.

Grillot: And when you say “present that information,” who are you presenting it to? Tell us about that step of gathering that information. What do you do with it? Who does it go to?

Wells: You know, often there are kind of two different targets. There's a wider, more general audience who want to be engaged on a particular issue, that want to take interest in, you know, major human rights situations that are going on around the world. And then the other thing is, you know, targeted advocacy with policymakers, whether that's in Washington D.C., or in Brussels with the European Union, or, you know, in London with the U.K. governments. We speak with, meet with those who have the ability to influence governments around the world and try to force them to change the practices that are leading to these human rights violations.

I'm based in D.C. so I spend a lot of time, for example, doing advocacy with different parts of the U.S. government and particularly on Myanmar. Right now, trying to get them to do things like imposing targeted financial sanctions on military officials who were implicated in the atrocities against the Rohingya, to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar. And so it's pushing for practical policy recommendations that we believe can reduce the human rights violations that are taking place and ultimately ensure accountability for the people who are responsible for them.

Grillot: You've written a piece about how all the civilians suffer. You've written quite a bit, actually, about what, you know, civilians experience... Refugees. You mentioned that obviously, civilians are the targets of a lot of this. As far as, like, all the civilians suffer, you know, what else are we talking about here? Displacement? You know, having to flee? I mean, is this kind of a broader picture? Not just suffering torture and, you know, armed conflict, but actually, like, losing their homes? What does is? the bigger picture there?

Wells: So we take Myanmar, for example, and what's happening right now with the Rohingya Muslim population in Rakhine state in Myanmar. What we've seen over the last seven months is the Myanmar military has really launched an attack on the population as a whole, in response to attacks that were carried out by an armed group. They have gone into villages, often surrounded villages, opened fire on men, women and children as they flee. They have systematically burned down villages. We've documented more than 350 villages that have been totally or partially destroyed in the last seven months. And the results of this has been more than 670,000 people have been forced across the border into Bangladesh in the span of seven months.

And just, you know, one specific example... During one of my first trips to Bangladesh back in September, which was right after this crisis broke out, I interviewed a 12-year-old girl named Fatima. She had been in a village in Myanmar where the military had surrounded it. She was at home with her family as the soldiers came in, surrounded her house. She was with her father, her siblings. Soldiers opened fire from behind. She saw as her father was shot and killed. She saw her younger sister, a 10-year-old, was shot and killed. She herself was shot in the thigh. When I saw her, she still had the gunshot wound in her thigh. A neighbor had fortunately picked her up and carried her to a neighboring village and then ultimately onto Bangladesh. And it is a story that I heard again and again, in which in response to these attacks by an armed group, the Myanmar military made no effort to distinguish between the actual attackers and the broader civilian population, and instead launched an attack on the population as a whole, through killing, through sexual violence against women and girls, and through the systematic burning of villages across this region.

Grillot: Tell us... Give us some background here, now that we we’re talking about the Rohingya crisis, but what is the the back story about why this is happening?

Wells: This is a population, the Rohingya, that has been subjected to really systemic discrimination for years in a way that we have set said? amounts to apartheid. They have been denied the ability to move around. They have to get specific travel authorization simply to move from village to village. They're denied access to education, they are denied access to healthcare. People who fall sick or suffer injuries have to get permission from local authorities simply to go to the hospital.

And even then, if they do get to the hospital, they are segregated there. There's a ward just for the Muslim population. So what's happened over the last seven months this very acute violence that's been perpetrated against them comes on the heels of what has been a whole system of persecution that's existed for a long time to the authorities in Myanmar. They are considered to be to be foreigners, to not actually be part of the fabric of the country, even though they have lived in this part of Myanmar for generations. The Myanmar government considers them Bengali, that they are actually from Bangladesh as opposed to Myanmar, again, despite the fact that families have been there for generations. And so you have this deep-seated racism, really, that has been unlocked over the last year or two in particular by the rise of populism in Myanmar. You had a rise of really Buddhist nationalist populist movement that has then helped fuel a lot of the suspicion and actually outright hatred towards the Rohingya population.

Grillot: But this is all… I think some of us are so shocked about this because Myanmar's leader... She fought for democracy for so long. She was imprisoned in her home. She was under house arrest. She, too, was persecuted. She, you know, suffered great things. How is this happening under her watch? I mean, she's won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Wells: Right.

Grillot: So how does that happen?

I think there are two key things here. One is she exercises no control over the military. The military has complete power over its operations with no civilian oversight. There is no civilian oversight of investigations, for example, so the military controls its own judicial processes, which has fed this complete impunity in Myanmar in which the military operates entirely above the law and there is almost never any accountability no matter how horrific the atrocities. And so, on one hand, Aung San Suu Kyi does not control the military, and what we are seeing is a military-led campaign to drive the Rohingya out of the country.

Now the second thing, though, is that she has failed in terms of moral leadership. Even if she doesn't control the military, not only has she not said the right things, not only has she not condemned the horrific atrocities, but her office has, at times, made things worse. Her spokesperson has said things that border on hate speech or incitement. They have blocked, along with the military, humanitarian access to this part of Myanmar, making it difficult to get aid to the Rohingya who remain in the country. They blocked access to journalists, to human rights groups like our own. And they have cracked down on journalists who report on the atrocities. There are two Reuters journalists who have been arrested, who have been in detention since December for doing their work as journalists, for exposing a particular massacre. And you know the civilian governments and Aung San Suu Kyi herself has failed to do enough to even protect things like the freedom of the press and free expression in the country.

Grillot: Well this obviously raises, you know, the responses. I mean, you mentioned the work that you do, the advocacy work, trying to establish some sort of practical action. I mean, obviously everything you're doing is largely coming from the outside, right? I mean, what are you going to do about the leadership in Myanmar, the military in Myanmar?

But there are powerful actors who can do something about this, and so, you've also written other pieces about, you know, people that are afraid and forgotten. And it just… the Rohingya crisis really, really seems to underscore this notion of people that are forgotten, even though they're on the front pages and in the headlines and we see the evidence we see what's going on. So what has the response been? How confident are you that there's going to be much more response from, again, powerful actors elsewhere that can perhaps put some pressure on Myanmar, particularly on the military? You know? And how hopeful are you that that's going to actually happen in terms of any kind of way forward on this crisis?

Wells: You know, there has been outcry around the world. There's been condemnation from governments around the world, but we haven't seen enough action. The US government has imposed sanctions on a specific general in the Myanmar military who we and others have implicated for his role in leading a unit that has carried out a lot of this. So that's a positive first step, but it's nowhere near enough. We need additional targeted financial sanctions against senior military officials who are responsible for human rights violations. You know, there is a bill that pushes for accountability, that pushes for additional sanctions, that demands that the Myanmar military reform before it gets the benefits of U.S. military engagement with it in the future. It is bipartisan. The lead drafter is Sen. McCain. It has a number of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. It would, in terms of U.S. leadership, go a long way towards starting to address the situation. It provides additional humanitarian funds for the refugees in Bangladesh and to begin to address this culture of impunity that exists in the Myanmar military and that underpins so many of these atrocities that have been committed.

Grillot: Well Matt, thank you so much for being here today and for sharing.

Wells: Thanks for having me.

5,myanmar,"Yangon: Myanmar's government said it has repatriated the first family of Rohingya out of some 7,00,000 refugees who fled to Bangladesh to escape a brutal military campaign, despite UN warnings that a safe return is not yet possible.

The stateless Muslim minority has been massing in squalid Bangladesh camps since the Myanmar army launched a ruthless crackdown on the community in northern Rakhine state last August.

The UN says the campaign amounts to ethnic cleansing, but Myanmar has denied the charge, saying its troops targeted Rohingya militants.

Bangladesh and Myanmar were supposed to begin repatriation in January but the plan has been repeatedly delayed as both sides blame the other for a lack of preparation.

According to a Myanmar government statement posted late on Saturday, one family of Rohingya refugees became the first to return earlier in the day.

""The five members of a family... came back to Taungpyoletwei town repatriation camp in Rakhine state this morning,"" said a statement posted on the official Facebook page of the government's Information Committee.

Authorities determined ""whether they were once living here or not"" and provided the family with National Verification Cards, a form of ID that falls short of citizenship and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders who want full rights.

Photos posted alongside the statement showed one man, two women, a young girl and a boy receiving the ID cards and getting health checks.

It said that the family had been sent to stay ""temporarily"" with relatives in Maungdaw town.

The post did not mention any plans for further returnees in the near future.

The move comes despite warnings from the UN and other rights groups that a mass repatriation of Rohingya would be premature, as Myanmar as yet to address the systematic legal discrimination and persecution the minority has faced for decades.

On Saturday, the UN's refugee agency said in a statement that conditions ""are not yet conducive for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of refugees"".

The Rohingya are reviled by many in the Buddhist-majority country, where they are branded as illegal ""Bengali"" immigrants from Bangladesh, despite their long roots in Rakhine state.","Myanmar refugee crisis: First among 7,00,000 Rohingya families who fled to Bangladesh repatriated, says govt",https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-refugee-crisis-first-among-700000-rohingya-families-who-fled-to-bangladesh-repatriated-says-govt-4432219.html
6,myanmar,"UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council will pay a visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar beginning Saturday (April 28) as it weighs next steps to address one of the world's worst refugee crises, stemming from the forced exodus of Muslim Rohingya.

Myanmar has come under international scrutiny since a military campaign launched in August drove more than 700,000 Rohingya from their homes in northern Rakhine state and into crowded camps in Bangladesh.

The council is urging Myanmar to allow their safe return and take steps to end decades of discrimination that the Muslim minority has suffered in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.

The visit kicks off in the camps of Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh where ambassadors will meet refugees, whose harrowing accounts of killings, rape and the torching of villages at the hands of Myanmar's military and militias have been documented in UN human rights reports.

Led by Kuwait, Britain and Peru, the four-day visit is expected to include a trip by helicopter to Rakhine to allow ambassadors to tour villages affected by the violence, including Pan Taw Pyin and Shwe Zar.

The council will hold talks with Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticised for failing to speak out in defence of the Rohingya, and with Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Kuwait's Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi said the visit was not about ""naming and shaming"" Myanmar, but that ""the message will be very clear for them: the international community is following the situation and has great interest in resolving it.""

""We are coming to see how can we help, how can we push things forward,"" he said, stressing that the current situation was ""not acceptable."" ""700,000 people have fled their country and they cannot go back. It's a humanitarian disaster."" .

'ALMOST NO ACTION'

After months of deliberations, Myanmar finally agreed this month to allow the council to visit as the government rejected accusations from the United Nations and Western countries that the attacks against the Rohingya were ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar has said the military operation in Rakhine is aimed at rooting out extremists.

British Ambassador Karen Pierce said it was ""incredibly important"" for the council to see the situation on the ground as it considers ""what needs to be done next to help Myanmar develop as a modern, political and economic entity.""

The United States and its European partners in the council have faced strong opposition to action on the Rohingya crisis from China, a supporter of Myanmar's former ruling junta.

The council adopted a statement in November that called on Myanmar to rein in its military, but there has been no resolution, a stronger measure that China would likely block as one of the veto-wielding permanent members.

""This trip represents an opportunity for the council to press the reset button,"" said Akshaya Kumar, UN deputy director for Human Rights Watch.

""They have taken almost no action,"" she said.

""So if this trip is what is needed to spur them to actually respond to the gravity of an ethnic cleansing on their watch, then we'll be waiting for a resolution when they return.""

The president of the International Red Cross, which is providing aid to those affected by the violence in Rakhine, said the Myanmar government is rebuilding villages and taking steps to allow the Rohingya to return.

The refu­gee shoved sandbags into the edge of a cliff in a sprawling Bangladeshi camp, a likely futile effort to hold together the loose soil where his hut of bamboo and plastic sheets was perched precariously.

Days earlier, a few feet of the hillside had broken away in a cascade of earth. No one was hurt, but it was a wake-up call.

“I cannot stay here. I have children,” said Hamit Hussein, a Rohingya Muslim who has lived in the camp since August. “The hill is collapsing in the dry season. If it rains even a little, it will be destroyed.”

In Bangladesh, the world’s largest refugee camp is literally falling apart. With the annual cyclone and monsoon seasons approaching this month and next, hundreds of thousands of refugees are steeling themselves for the camp’s further collapse.

But most, like Hussein, have nowhere else to go.

Since August, some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from ­Buddhist-majority Burma have poured onto a thin spit of land in southeastern Bangladesh, fleeing a brutal crackdown by Burma’s army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

[How Bangladeshis are coping with influx of Rohingya refugees]

Rohingya survivors and human rights groups accuse Burmese forces of torching villages, raping women and killing civilians in response to a series of attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group. Doctors Without Borders estimated in December that at least 6,700 were killed in the first month of the crackdown. Burma has denied many of the allegations.

Now the Rohingya face another threat. The Bangladeshi camps — carved out of jungle — have become overcrowded slums of flimsy shelters teetering on steep, unstable slopes. Aid groups warn that the approaching storm seasons could prove deadly. Last year, before the latest influx of refugees, a cyclone damaged 70 percent of the shelters in the camps.

“Our initial mapping study showed 120,000 at grave risk of floods and landslides,” said Fiona MacGregor, spokeswoman for the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration. But she added: “Pretty much everyone is at risk to some extent.”

In recent weeks, the season’s first few squalls turned valleys into swamps and shredded dozens of shelters.

“The tarp was stripped off by wind and the house was destroyed. Dishes, my stoves, everything,” Rukiya Begum said while standing in the frame of her hut, a loose plastic sheet flapping overhead. “I’m afraid to stay here.”

The earth here is fine sand packed into hard dunes that disintegrate at a touch. Small landslides are common on the deforested slopes and have killed at least two children. Many areas have no proper drainage or access roads for ambulances.

“The fact that it looks unprepared is absolutely how it really is,” said Tess Elias, country director in Bangladesh for the Danish Refugee Council, an aid group managing parts of the camps.

With worse weather to come, Doctors Without Borders is stockpiling bandages and intravenous fluids for mass-casualty events and warns of disease outbreaks if floodwaters overflow latrines, turning low-lying areas into festering pools of rainwater and human waste.

Marcella Kraay, the aid group’s project coordinator in the region, warned of outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea, also known as cholera: “It’s going to be humid, wet, unsanitary conditions.”

For now, Bangladesh’s government has refused to allow refugees the freedom of movement that might allow them to find safer places to live beyond the camp’s boundaries.

[Bangladesh is now home to almost 1 million Rohingya refugees]

Aid workers complain that the authorities, wary of establishing a long-term presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees in an already densely populated nation, have mostly banned the use of stronger building materials such as cement, relegating the refugees to shelters made of bamboo and plastic.

But if the government appears inflexible, foreign aid groups suffer from their own troubles.

A March report by a consortium of British aid groups called the Disasters Emergency Committee described a “substandard” and “chaotic” response to the Rohingya refugee crisis, with a cumbersome bureaucracy amid confusion about which U.N. relief agency should be in charge.



Rohingya refugee workers flatten hilltops on the western edge of the Kutupalong camp in southeastern Bangladesh to make space for families to relocate to escape potential flooding and landslides. (Jason Patinkin)

Still, the biggest issue is a lack of space. So far, some 14,000 of the most vulnerable refugees have been moved to safer areas within the camp, but more land is needed for all at-risk people to find safer ground.

Work crews on the camp’s western boundary are flattening 123 acres for further relocations, but that space, meant to be finished by June, will hold only 13,000 to 16,000 people.

“That’s clearly not enough, but that’s where we are,” said Mark Pierce, head of the Save the Children aid group in Bangladesh.

Another option, floated by Bangladesh’s government, is to move 100,000 refugees to an island in the Bay of Bengal. The Bangladeshi navy is overseeing construction of what the government says will be a better home for the Rohingya.

But the plan is controversial. The island, called Bhasan Char, is more of a massive sandbar cut by canals and in constant flux amid shifting ocean currents. Serazul Mustafa, a Rohingya leader in the largest camp, called Kutupalong, said he feared the sea journey to the island would be dangerous.

In internal reports, first revealed by Reuters and confirmed by The Washington Post, aid groups including the U.N. refugee agency raised concerns that the island might become a trap for refugees, where they could be exposed to storms and be at risk of human trafficking.

Caroline Gluck, spokeswoman for the U.N. refu­gee agency in Bangladesh, said the agency had not yet visited Bhasan Char and so could not confirm that it was habitable. She called for an independent assessment of the island to ensure that it is safe and said the refugees should have freedom of movement on the island and to and from the mainland.

Wherever land is made available, however, many refugees, traumatized by their first displacement from Burma, are refusing to move again.

Kabir Ahmed said he declined a chance to move west, even though his home was threatened by a crumbling wall, because he feared elephants and thieves near the camp’s outskirts.

Instead, he opted to shift his shelter just a few meters away, safe from the wall, but downhill from a latrine with no drain and above a stagnant wastewater ditch.

“What can I say?” he said. “We were forced to flee here. We just need to deal with it.”

Over the weekend, Myanmar's mung beans RC fetched 454,000 kyats (333.8 U.S. dollars) per ton, while mung beans special quality (SQ) were worth some 616,000 kyats, up respectively from 382,000 kyats and 520,000 kyats over the previous days, according to market survey at the Bayintnaung commodity depot.

A total of 135 containers of the crops were traded on the weekend days.

India announced restriction of the import quota of three major pulses from Myanmar in August last year affecting the local pulses market.

Prior to India's move, mung beans RC fetched 757,000 kyats per ton, while the SQ was worth 887,000 kyats per ton.

India has now reportedly allowed an import quota of 150,000 tons of mung beans and green gram each for the 2018-19 financial year.

In the last fiscal year of 2017-18, Myanmar exported some 600,000 tons of various peas including 300,000 tons of mung beans.

9,myanmar,"Work on a massive hydropower dam appears to be picking up in eastern Myanmar as the electricity-starved nation seeks ways to light more homes amid protests from locals and environmentalists.

Locals say employees of a Chinese state-owned power firm in Shan state have been working under heavy guard at the Mong Ton Hydropower project along the Salween river. The Mong Ton dam is backed by a consortium, including the China Three Gorges Corporation and a subsidiary of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.

In its original form, the dam would have been the tallest in the country and created a reservoir larger than Singapore. But its design was reportedly modified to reduce local impact.

Typically, large dams displace thousands of villagers, still rivers and block the flow of nutrient-rich silt downstream.

Over the past decade since its inception, the project has run up against intense local and international opposition, not least because it threatens to inundate pristine wetlands featuring hundreds of islets, and escalate the conflict between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups active in that area.

Myanmar's Ministry of Electricity and Energy did not respond to queries from The Straits Times. But the Mong Pan Youth Association, which recently conducted interviews with villagers near the Mong Ton project, told The Straits Times that movement in the vicinity is now heavily restricted by security forces.

Its director, Mr Nang Shining, said: ""One way or other, people will be impacted by the dam, whether it's through increased security measures or environmental impact.""

27 Number of power stations from which Myanmar's electricity is mostly drawn.

15% Rate at which Myanmar's electricity consumption is growing every year.

3,000 Myanmar's power production in megawatts, set to be doubled after government approval for private investment in four gas-fired plants.

A Burmese-language BBC report early last month quoted a resident as saying that a militia member was shot dead while on a boat on the Salween.

The river, called the Thanlwin in Myanmar and the Nu river in China, originates in the Tibetan plateau and then drains into the Andaman Sea via Myanmar and Thailand.

Several sites along the major waterway have been earmarked for hydropower dams. Besides southern Shan state, where the Mong Ton project is located, other sites include Kunlong, Manntaung and Nong Pha in Shan state, Ywathit in Kayah state, and Hat Gyi in Kayin state.

Off the Salween, but also in Shan state, dams in the area of the Myitnge and Shweli rivers are already under construction to meet the country's increasing demand for electricity.

Appliance-sapping brownouts are common in Myanmar, where some two-thirds of the population are not connected to the power grid.

With electricity consumption growing at 15 per cent every year, the government in January gave the green light for private investment in four gas-fired plants, which will double the country's power production of some 3,000MW. Solar powered mini-grids are also in the works.

Most of Myanmar's electricity is currently drawn from 27 hydropower stations.

The previous military government was blamed for allowing hydropower projects that exported electricity to neighbouring countries like China and Thailand rather than directing power inward.

In 2011, then President Thein Sein, heeding protests, suspended work on the China-backed Myitsone dam on the Irrawaddy river in Kachin state. The fate of the dam is still unclear despite talks between Naypyitaw and Beijing.

Myanmar's Electricity and Energy Minister U Win Khaing told Reuters last year that mega hydropower projects were not a priority of his administration, compared with liquefied natural gas and small-scale hydropower projects. ""Up to 2025, we don't put (large dams) in our plan. They have to be considered later on,"" he said.

Yet locals in Mong Ton remain wary, given how little information officials have disclosed about their plans for the dam.

While they are touted by Naypyitaw as signs of progress, large infrastructure projects like these are held up by local activists as evidence that the government is trying to centralise control of resources, even as peace talks with ethnic minority armed groups are ostensibly aimed at creating a federal union.

In conflict zones, ethnic armed groups allege that the projects are pretexts for militarisation.

Mr Sai Thum Ai, a Shan-based activist in Burma Rivers Network, told The Straits Times: ""The resources are managed by the central government and only a little power is given to the state. It's not fair. Even if we have federal democracy, the states would have nothing.""",Work on Myanmar dam goes on under heavy guard,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/work-on-myanmar-dam-goes-on-under-heavy-guard
10,myanmar,"(Yangon/New York, 8 April 2018): At the conclusion today of a six-day mission to Myanmar, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Ursula Mueller called for strengthened humanitarian action based on the rights and needs of all communities, in line with international law and humanitarian principles.

“Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organizations and the Government,” said Ms. Mueller. “Wherever they are in the country and regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status, we need to work together to ensure that no vulnerable conflict-affected people are deprived of safe and sustained access to humanitarian protection and assistance. No-one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path towards a better future.”

At the outset of her mission, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. They discussed the importance of ending conflict and of strengthening peace and reconciliation efforts. Ms. Mueller reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to supporting peace, stability, and development in Myanmar. She offered the continued support of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners to ensure that all people affected by conflict and natural disasters get the humanitarian protection and assistance they need. They agreed on the importance of strengthening national capacities. Ms. Mueller noted the efforts being made by the UN to strengthen the nexus between humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts.

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator also met with the Ministers of Defence, Border Affairs, International Cooperation, and the Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. The meetings with the Union Government were an opportunity to discuss humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states as well as the collaborative efforts of the international community and the Government on disaster preparedness efforts.

In Rakhine State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator visited camps where about 130,000 people, most of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, remain confined in deplorable conditions after almost six years of displacement. In Maungdaw Township, she met with local communities affected by last year’s violence. Ms. Mueller also visited a refugee return transit site that the Government is constructing, some new housing projects, and witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Ms. Mueller. “The unfolding tragedy in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar rightly captured the world’s attention, but we cannot, and must not, forget the plight of over 400,000 Muslim people still living in Rakhine State who continue to face a life of hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions. These restrictions severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education, and other essential services.”

“The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has provided an important roadmap towards a better future for all communities in Rakhine State, but its recommendations need to be implemented holistically and impartially, in the spirit that they were written,” said Ms. Mueller. “The lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities of Rakhine State, whether they are ethnic Rakhine, Muslim, or from other minority groups, will be profoundly transformed if each recommendation is genuinely addressed and implemented. The conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees and positive outcomes for internally displaced people in camps slated for closure can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, social cohesion, livelihoods, and access to services are addressed.”

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator welcomed the access that she was granted by the Government to visit communities in different parts of Rakhine. She was concerned, however, by the continued restrictions imposed by the authorities on the movement of the Muslim population, as well as the continued restrictions faced by humanitarian workers.

In her meeting with officials in the Rakhine State Government, Ms. Mueller called for movement restrictions to be dropped and for practical measures to be taken to allow humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, in line with the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan States. When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” said Ms. Mueller. “I was able to go to northern Rakhine and to some of the camps in Kachin State, but what matters most is that the people affected by violence and restrictions in these areas are themselves given access to the assistance and services they so desperately need.”

In Kachin State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with representatives of international and national humanitarian organizations and visited camps where she spoke with displaced people. She also met with a group of women and girls who were taking action to respond to the needs of women in displaced communities, including preventing gender-based violence. The women emphasized the importance of prevention and education in building stronger, safer communities, and presented a joint letter to the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator raising critical concerns shared by displaced women across Kachin.

At least 10,000 people have been newly displaced or re-displaced by fighting between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in Kachin and Shan States since the beginning of the year, while about 100,000 people remain displaced as a result of the conflict between the Myanmar Army and the Kachin Independence Army that restarted in 2011. Ms. Mueller was particularly impressed by the work of local civil society organizations. She met with representatives of a number of different local organizations and commended them on their outstanding work. She was encouraged to see that the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels more than 40 per cent of its funding through national organizations.

“The conflict in Kachin is one the world’s longest running, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Ms. Mueller. “Clashes break out near displacement camps and civilian areas, landmines are still being placed in the fields and roads of Kachin and Shan States, and people continue to flee their homes. I call on all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians wherever they are, in line with international law.”

During her mission, Ms. Mueller also discussed ways of strengthening disaster preparedness and response. “Myanmar is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and the last time I was here was nearly ten years ago in the tragic aftermath of Cyclone Nargis,” said Ms. Mueller. “I see that much has changed since then and while disaster risk reduction efforts need to be further enhanced, the Government and national organizations have made excellent progress in recent years in building national capacity for disaster preparedness and response.”

More funding is urgently required for the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, which calls for $183 million to meet the needs of 832,000 people in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and Kayin States.

YANGON, Myanmar

A senior UN official on Sunday called on the government of Myanmar to grant humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people affected by conflicts in the country.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, concluded her six-day mission to the country on Sunday. She visited several conflict-torn ethnic areas of Myanmar including western Rakhine state, northern Kachin state and northeastern Shan state.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan states,” said Mueller in a statement.

“When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” she said.

In Rakhine’s Maungdaw Township where a military operation forced nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee cross-border to neighboring Bangladesh, she witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed, said the statement.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” she said.

She also visited a refugee return transit site that the government is constructing in Maungdaw.

13,myanmar,"Thousands of civilians remain displaced in northern Myanmar amid renewed fighting in recent weeks, many with little access to aid, bringing fresh concerns that the country’s peace process has stalled under the current government.

Fighting between the Myanmar army, known as the Tatmadaw, and the Kachin Independence Army, has seen local residents flee in at least three townships in Kachin State in recent weeks, local sources told VOA. Others have been pinned down by the fighting.

More than 150 people have been unable to leave an area of heavy fighting near Hpakant, a remote area renowned for the quality of its jade, local parliament representative Oo Choo told VOA by telephone.

“They haven’t been able to leave for a week,” he said.

Humanitarian aid

David Baulk, a human rights specialist with Fortify Rights, said thousands have been displaced by fighting in the past month.

“A lot of Kachin State is a war zone right now, and that’s what’s leading people to run for their lives,” Baulk told VOA. “The real issue when it comes to displacement in Tanai and other areas of Kachin State, is that the Myanmar government continues to systematically prevent aid groups from visiting these areas to provide basic services to people.”

Knut Ostby, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar, released a statement last week condemning the latest violence in Kachin.

“I appeal to all parties to the conflict to allow displaced people and other civilians who may remain in the areas of conflict to be permitted to move to a more secure location of their choice and to allow for humanitarian assistance to reach these populations as a matter of urgency,” he said in the statement.

But government spokesperson Zaw Htay denied the military was denying access to aid for civilians caught up in the conflict.

“The government is already supporting humanitarian assistance for the Christians in the conflict,” he told VOA by telephone, before referring further questions to the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, who could not be reached for comment.

​‘War crimes’

On April 23, a coalition of more than 30 Kachin civil society groups published a letter urging the United Nations Security Council to refer the Myanmar army to the International Criminal Court for its actions in the state.

“Despite their obligations, the international community, including members of the United Nations Security Council, have failed in their duty to uphold international law,” said the statement, which claimed that Kachin people had been subjected to “numerous violations” of international law.

The statement also claimed that at least three Kachin civilians, as well as one Karen community leader, had been killed in recent weeks.

“These are war crimes, but not one country has condemned these killings and promised to take action in response,” the statement said.

​Peace process at a standstill

Since the National League for Democracy came to power two years ago, there has been little progress on the peace process, an issue that State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi said she would make a priority.

In February, two relatively small ethnic armed groups agreed to join the government’s Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), but much of that progress has been offset by renewed fighting in Kayin State, home of the Karen National Union, perhaps the most influential of the two groups to have signed the NCA in October 2015.

It has been almost a year since the government last held its flagship event for the peace process, the 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conference, the second such event held under the NLD. It has been rumored that the next event will take place in May, but that is yet to be confirmed.

“Holding a successful [Union Peace Conference] will require overcoming several obstacles, particularly lack of trust among the different parties,” Richard Horsey, an independent analyst, told VOA. “Without a sense of shared commitment to a process and negotiated outcome, it will be hard to revitalize the peace process and convene the next conference.”

Horsey said the peace process had “stagnated” and that there was frustration among signatories to the NCA, and skepticism among non-signatories towards signing the accord “until there are signs of greater political motivation and commitment to a negotiated political settlement.”

Nicola Williams, peace team leader at The Asia Foundation, agreed there had been a stalemate in political dialogue in recent years. She said that, while there had been much focus on the process of peace negotiations and cease-fire monitoring, there has been a “lack of emphasis and momentum on negotiations” to build policy solutions and the content of a peace accord.

“Nonetheless, while the peace process can seem like it’s on life support, outside of the headlines, outside of the political statements and stalemates, ethnic armed groups and conflict parties are making quite diligent efforts to discuss a lot of the core peace process issues, and to develop draft principles in preparation for the UPC,” she told VOA.",Fighting in Kachin Highlights Myanmar Civil War Worries,https://www.voanews.com/a/kachin-fighting-myanmar-civil-war/4365603.html
14,myanmar,"Foreign ministers of Muslim countries yesterday launched a campaign to mobilize international support for action against Myanmar over the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials said.

Foreign ministers and diplomats of the 53-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) set up a campaign committee during two days of talks in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. OIC secretary general Yousef bin Ahmed Al-Othaimeen called the move a key step toward ending a crisis caused by the exodus of about 700,000 Muslim Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar into camps in Bangladesh. He said the new committee would ""mobilize and coordinate international political support for accountability for human rights violations against the Rohingya community.""

""This is very important. This is one of the concrete steps that has been taken to alleviate the problem for our [Rohingya] brothers and sisters,"" he said.

A military campaign launched in Myanmar's Rakhine state in August last year set off the massive influx of the Muslim minority into Bangladesh where they joined 300,000 refugees already living in squalid camps following previous violence. The United Nations and United States have said the crackdown amounted to ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar army has said it only targeted militants.

Rohingya civilians have told of murders and rapes as they fled. They say the army burned hundreds of Rohingya villages to the ground. Al-Othaimeen said Muslim nations had to ""pressure the international community. This is not religious, this is the basic human rights of our brothers and sisters in the last 50 years,"" he said.

The International Criminal Court prosecutor has already called for the tribunal to rule on whether it can investigate the allegations of mass rape and killings.

Bangladesh has put huge diplomatic effort into pressuring Myanmar to take back the refugees in safety. The two nations signed a repatriation deal in November, but nobody has since returned.

The Rohingya have been persecuted for decades in Myanmar, where they are regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.

Last month, a U.N. Security Council delegation visiting the camps called for the safe return of the Rohingya and an end to discrimination against them. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland also called for ""accountability"" when she toured the Rohingya camps this week. Bangladesh Foreign Minister A. H.

15,myanmar,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The camps sprawl near the border with Myanmar

In the Rohingya refugee camps of southern Bangladesh, where flimsy bamboo shelters sprawl across the steep hillsides and flood prone valleys, there has been a desperate effort to make ready for the coming cyclone and monsoon season. But the almost 900,000 refugees here remain very vulnerable.

The BBC's Justin Rowlatt has spent weeks in the camps since the refugee crisis began in August last year.

Here's his summary of who the Rohingya refugees are, how well prepared the world's largest and most densely populated refugee settlement is for the coming storms and when - if ever - the refugees will be able to return to their homes.

Who are the Rohingya?

The Rohingya are a more than a million-strong population of Muslims from majority-Buddhist Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma.

They have been described as ""the world's most persecuted minority"". The government of Myanmar stripped them of citizenship in the 1980s and has imposed many restrictions on them since then. It has also subjected them to periodic waves of terrible violence.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?

Even the country's de facto leader, Aung San Su Kyi, refuses to use the term Rohingya. In official speeches she describes them as ""Bengalis"", suggesting that the Nobel peace laureate, like many Burmese, regards them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

The Rohingya, meanwhile, insist they are native to Myanmar.

Why are so many Rohingya in Bangladesh?

The UN estimates that just under 700,000 Rohingya fled their homes in the western coastal state of Rakhine to Bangladesh last year after a vicious military crackdown which began in late August after deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts.

Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground and there was widespread rape and murder. The head of the UN's watchdog on human rights has said the possibility that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya could be genocide cannot be ruled out.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground

This latest wave of refugees joined some 200,000 Rohingya who were already in Bangladesh, having fled their homes following earlier waves of persecution.

What is the worry about storms?

Bangladesh suffers terrible cyclonic storms and some of the most intense monsoon rains on earth.

Cox's Bazar, where the refugee camps are, has one of the highest rainfall totals in the entire country.

The monsoon season begins in earnest in May and it is expected to bring yet more destruction and disease to the camps.

How vulnerable are the Rohingya to the monsoon and cyclones?

The exodus of Rohingya was unexpected. The refugees built shelters wherever they could, stripping the vegetation from muddy hills and building flimsy shelters on earth platforms they dug out of the slopes of the low hills the government allocated for them.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The refugee camps are vulnerable to heavy rain

Most of these homes are little more than tents which could easily blow away in the high winds that are expected in the coming weeks. They are also susceptible to landslides and flash floods.

A UN guide to strengthening buildings in the camps is brutally clear about the risks, saying: ""It is very unlikely that any bamboo community shelter will survive a cyclone.""

Factor in the risk of disease and there could be a ""massive loss of life"", the World Health Organization has warned.

So what is being done to help them?

A huge amount of work has been done. There are classes to train the refugees how to strengthen their bamboo shelters. Hillsides and paths have been bolstered with sandbags and there are new roads and bridges to make the transport network more resilient.

New culverts and drainage channels have been dug in to try to limit flooding, while emergency depots have been set up to store food and equipment in case areas of the camps are completely cut off by flood water or as a result of storm damage.

At the same time 50 hectares of new land is being cleared and the hills levelled to create stable ground for the 15,000 refugees most vulnerable to monsoon damage.

Can't the camps be evacuated if a cyclone strikes?

No. Bangladesh does have a good early warning system for cyclones but, say UN agencies, there are no plans to evacuate the refugees. There are just too many people and nowhere safe for them to go.

What about the plan to send some Rohingya refugees to a remote island?

Bangladesh has been building roads, sea defences and shelters on Bhasan Char, a silt island that emerged from the muddy waters of the Bay of Bengal less than two decades ago.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption UN agencies are anxious about plans to relocate refugees to the island of Bhasan Char

In April the Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, confirmed that her government planned to move 100,000 Rohingya refugees to the low-lying island. ""The camps are unhealthy,"" she said. ""We have prepared a better place for them to live, with houses and shelters where they can earn a living.""

The UN and aid agencies remain very anxious about the plan. They fear that any refugees relocated to Bhasan Char would be isolated, trapped at the mercy of cyclones, floods and human traffickers.

So when are the Rohingya refugees likely to return to their homes in Myanmar?

That is what most refugees in the camps say they want to happen.

A repatriation agreement was signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar in November last year. Almost six months on and not a single refugee has yet returned home - with a claim by Myanmar that it had repatriated a family of five dismissed by Bangladesh as a ""farce"".

Bangladesh says the fault lies with Myanmar. ""Myanmar says they are ready to take back the Rohingya but they are not taking the initiative,"" Sheikh Hasina has said.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims?

Myanmar, on its part, says it has been verifying refugees for repatriation, but Bangladesh has not provided all the information required.

It says it will allow UN agencies to help with the return of some of the refugees, and that it will ensure that refugees can come back ""without fear"".

A few refugees may be repatriated in the coming months but the truth is that no-one expects the bulk of the Rohingya in Bangladesh to go back to Myanmar anytime soon.

What effect is this having on people in the camps?

An assessment of the mental health needs of the populations of the camps makes depressing reading.

Only a third of respondents felt safe in the camps and two-thirds of adults said they experienced constant grief for lost family members and their previous lives.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remained fragile with the continuation of the protracted humanitarian crises in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan; the aggravation of the humanitarian context in the northern part of Rakhine State; new internal displacement in Kachin and Shan; and natural disasters hitting already vulnerable people. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to protracted denial of rights, limited access to basic services, conflict, insecurity and climatic shocks. The people directly affected by the different humanitarian crises in Myanmar (including the refugees hosted in Thailand and Bangladesh) are estimated at 1.8 million (3 per cent of the total population).

Protracted humanitarian needs

About 240,000 people remained internally displaced in camps or camp-like settings in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine States. This includes around 91,000 in Kachin and 15,000 in Shan respectively who were displaced because of the armed conflict that resumed in 2011. It also includes about 128,000 in Rakhine who were displaced as a result of violence that erupted in 2012 and who remain unable to access basic services or enjoy the full spectrum of their human rights. In addition, there are particularly vulnerable non-displaced people who continue to require special attention and support because of different factors including, amongst others, armed conflict, restrictions on movement, discriminatory practices and severe malnutrition. The country’s vulnerability to natural disasters results in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government is building its disaster management capacities with the support of the international community.

Crisis in northern Rakhine State

Following the 25 August 2017 attacks of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police posts and subsequent security operations by the Myanmar military and security forces in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung Townships, a massive outflow of people resulted in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. As of 16 March 2017, it is estimated that more than 671,000 persons, the vast majority of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, had fled to neighbouring Bangladesh seeking refuge. In addition, over 25,000 persons were internally displaced, although most of these have since returned. Although severe restrictions on access have made an adequate assessment impossible, large numbers of people in northern Rakhine remain in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in the sectors of protection, health and food security. According to estimates made by the Maungdaw Inter-Agency Group (MIAG), around 159,000 stateless people remain in the three northern townships, all of which can be considered to have been directly affected. In addition, around 55,000 non-stateless people can be considered to have been directly affected in the three northern townships, particularly in Maungdaw and Buthidaung. This includes non-stateless displaced people who have largely returned now from Sittwe and other areas; and members of the economically disadvantaged Mro, Thet, Dynet, and Rakhine communities.

New displacements in Kachin and Shan

In Kachin and Shan states, as a result of continuing and intensified conflict between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in 2017, close to 8,000 people were newlydisplaced, bringing the total number of people in camps in these two states to over 100,000. Since November 2017, more frequent and intense clashes between ethnic armed groups and Myanmar Military have resulted in displacement and re-displacement of larger numbers of people in both states. The displacement situation across both states remain very fluid and numbers are difficult to confirm given access challenges. Humanitarian access, particularly to people staying in areas beyond government control, remains severely curtailed in both states.

Natural disasters

Myanmar’s vulnerability to natural disasters resulted in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government continues to build its disaster management capacities with the support of OCHA and other partners. In 2017, Cyclone Mora brought strong winds and heavy rains in Myanmar, destroying over 16,000 houses in Rakhine and Chin states and Ayeyarwady Region.

Rakhine was the most-affected state and, in addition to the houses that were destroyed, over 60 per cent of the temporary shelters in IDP camps were damaged or destroyed. During the 2017 monsoon season, Myanmar also experienced heavy flooding and over 320,000 people were temporarily displaced. In addition, about 30 earthquakes (all with a magnitude lower than 5) were registered.

Security and access constraints

Crisis affected people in Myanmar often have restricted access to services and livelihoods for a variety of reasons including insecurity and restrictions on their movement. Independent and impartial humanitarian organizations, both national and international, aim to meet the resulting needs to the extent possible. However humanitarian actors themselves have varying levels of access to crisis-affected people in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states, resulting in difficulties and delays in implementing and monitoring humanitarian activities. For example, humanitarian activities are sometimes cancelled or delayed as a result of lengthy approval processes and nonissuance of travel authorizations.",Myanmar Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Rakhine

UNICEF remains concerned about the conditions of crowded IDP camps in central Rakhine where 129,000 people remain reliant on humanitarian assistance. UNICEF clusters/sectors are working with the CCCM/Shelter/NFI clusters to identify actions that—with appropriate funding—can be quickly taken to improve living conditions in IDP camps. The camps, erected in 2012, were constructed based on technical guidelines provided by the Government of Myanmar. Agencies note that space allotments in camps are inadequate, leading to overcrowding of houses, people, and social service points. Current concerns include the need for rehabilitation or reconstruction of shelters, access pathways within the camps, and improvements to WASH and education facilities. Addressing some of the identified challenges willrequire additional allocations of land by the government as the current space is not sufficient for implementation of the proposed solutions. However, improved access to livelihoods opportunities for IDPs, as well as increased access for humanitarian service providers, would also lead to improvement in camp conditions.

In Maungdaw District—comprised of Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships—accurate figures of the population of Rakhine and ethnic minorities are still unavailable. UNICEF does not have access or permission from the Government of Myanmar to conduct basic needs assessments. Access constraints for UNICEF —particularly international staff—remain the biggest hurdle to assessments, implementation, and programme monitoring. Currently,travel authorization—which takes approximately two weeks to process—when granted, is valid for only a two-week period. The constant reapplication process, in addition to significant requests for information on activities, hampers effective response activities. Working through local partners, UNICEF continues to provide basic health, nutrition, WASH and child protection services in Maungdaw District where possible.

Kachin and Shan

Throughout April, armed clashes between the Myanmar military forces and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) escalated affecting Tanai, Hpakant, Sumprabum, Moegaung and Momauk townships as well as Laiza. Intense fighting continued with aerial bombings and use of heavy artillery. UNICEF field staff estimate that an additional 3,500 people have been displaced including over 1,000 people who are sheltering in a nearby forest. Local organizations including church groups, civil society groups and NGOs are advocating with the Kachin State Government and Myanmar military for evacuation of trapped and displaced people. Access to active conflict areas remains extremely difficult for UNICEF staff and international partners, as well as Myanmar NGOs. Outside the areas of active conflict, national staff and national partners have access and provide basic humanitarian services to those most in need.

UNICEF also remains extremely concerned about the situation in northern Shan State. Armed clashes in March and April were reported in Namtu, Hseinni, Kutkai and Manton with additional landmine cases reported in Kyaukme and Hsipaw townships. Furthermore, there has been a recent increase in military presence in Kokang, Special Administrative Zone. In Shan, displacement patterns show many people flee areas of fighting for several days seeking shelter in monasteries, churches or neighbouring villages and return home within a period of weeks. Throughout Shan, the Government and local partners have been providing support to those displaced. Should the fighting be sustained and lead to prolonged displacement, additional assistance will likely be required. Access to newlyaffected areas remains restricted due to insecurity.",UNICEF Myanmar Humanitarian Situation Report - 4 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-4-may-2018

Community leaders from the Christian ethnic Kachin community have called for urgent medical attention for about 2,000 civilians, including pregnant women and the elderly, trapped in the jungle where they fled to escape clashes between the Myanmar's army and the Kachin guerrillas in the country's north. (Labram Hkun Awng via AP Photo), The Associated Press

BANGKOK (AP)  Community leaders from the Christian ethnic Kachin community have called for urgent medical attention for about 2,000 civilians, including pregnant women and the elderly, trapped in the jungle where they fled to escape clashes between the Myanmar's army and the Kachin guerrillas in the country's north.

The latest fighting in Kachin state's Tanai region  an area known for amber and gold mining  began in early April with government shelling and airstrikes in response to threats by the rebel Kachin Independence Army to retake lost territory.

The Rev. Mung Dan, a Baptist community leader, said Wednesday the civilians trapped without medicine or sufficient food include five pregnant women, two women who just gave birth, 93 old people, and other villagers wounded by mortar shelling. They are ""in dire need of medical treatment as well as rations,"" he said by phone.

""Even today, it's been raining the whole day in our region and these civilians do not have any shelter yet and they are suffering from sickness as well,"" he added.

A non-governmental organization based in Kachin state has sent an open letter to the Kachin State Minister on Wednesday, asking for the permission to rescue civilians but the permission has not been granted yet.

""We have been asking permission to rescue people who are trapped in the jungle and they are in a very critical condition,"" said Awng Ja, a member of Kachin State Women Network, which helps displaced women. ""But the state minister said only if the military granted us access, we can rescue these civilians.""

Rights and aids groups said the Myanmar government and the military have dramatically increased restrictions on humanitarian assistance to some 100,000 displaced people. The government has denied virtually denied all access for the United Nations and other international humanitarian groups.

Some civilian have already been killed by the government's offensive, the Kachin say.

""At least three civilians were killed by the army's mortar shells and airstrikes in three different places since April 11,"" said Naw Bu, the head of the information department of the Kachin Independence Organization, the political organization to which the Kachin Independence Army is affiliated.

The Kachin Independence Army, like other ethnic minority armed groups, has been fighting on and off for decades against the central government for greater autonomy. Combat between the Kachin rebels and the government military resumed in 2011, ending a 17-year ceasefire agreement. The clashes have left hundreds dead and more than 100,000 civilians displaced.

Myanmar's military has long been accused of grave human rights violations against ethnic minority groups in different parts of the country.

Most recently, it has been accused of abuses against the Muslim ethnic Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine that critics say amounts to ""ethnic cleansing,"" as violent counter-insurgency sweeps by the army helped drive about 700,000 Rohingya across the border to neighboring Bangladesh, where they stay in refugee camps.","2,000 Kachin trapped by Myanmar fighting lack food, medicine",http://www.tampabay.com/-kachin-trapped-by-myanmar-fighting-lack-food-medicine-ap_world7fbe9173fe9b47a4b2449797997160b2

20,myanmar,"However, the government needs to monitor the impact of changing technologies on local jobs. Meanwhile, it is also important for the younger generation to be aware of evolving job trends in the labour market to avoid becoming irrelevant in the labour market.

ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada was optimistic about the labour market in Myanmar.

“Myanmar’s economy is growing fast and that is a good point. The labour market will absorb more workers as the economy grows,” Mr Sawada told The Myanmar Times in Manila.

“About 100 million workers are losing their jobs every year due to the automation. Workplace conditions are changing because of automation. However, these workers are also getting new jobs.” said Mr Sawada.

Manual and routine jobs in manufacturing assembly lines are most vulnerable to automation, he said.

As such, educating and training the workforce as well as ensuring favourable labour regulations, social protection and tax policies is important. “The government has an important role to play in encouraging inclusive growth as technology advances,” he said.

Mr Sawada recommended vocational training, on-job training, re-training and upgrading the skills of workers so that they become adaptable to the requirements of new and emerging jobs in the economy.

During his opening address at the AGM, Takehiko Nakao said new technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and “internet of things are emerging faster than people can imagine.”

If harnessed properly, the technologies have “huge potential to raise productivity and improve our daily lives. In Asia, young entrepreneurs and home-grown innovations are becoming an increasingly important part of the economy,” said the president.

In fact, there are several reasons to be optimistic despite fears of job losses to technology, said Mr Nakao.

“First, a job comprises many kinds of tasks. New technologies often can automate only some of those tasks, not the whole job,” he said.

He added that job automation takes place only where it is both technically and economically feasible. “Even if automatic sewing machines can produce T-shirts, if they require a huge capital investment, they cannot compete with human workers who are paid reasonably,” he said.

Meanwhile, rising incomes may substantially increase demand for products, which could more than offset job losses caused by new technologies, Mr Nakao said.

In fact, “new technologies create new occupations and industries. In the early 20th century, auto mechanics and car dealers emerged alongside the car industry. Today, we are seeing many new types of high-skilled jobs in information and communications technology (ICT), health care, education, and all kinds of business and consumer services,” said the ADB president.

Nevertheless, new technologies can alter the skills required for certain jobs and cause unemployment. “Advances in technology may make the less-skilled more likely to experience lower wages, thereby widening income inequality,” Mr Nakao warned.

“This will require proactive and comprehensive actions by the government on skills development, labour regulation, social protection, and income redistribution. Governments must promote ICT infrastructure, protect personal data and privacy, and ensure fair competition,” said Mr Nakao.",ADB not worried about impact of technology on Myanmar jobs,https://www.mmtimes.com/news/adb-not-worried-about-impact-technology-myanmar-jobs.html
21,myanmar,"Australia is chipping in an extra $13 million in aid to help people from Myanmar ethnic minority groups fleeing violence at the hands of the country's military.

The plight of Rohingya people in Rakhine state has received much international attention, following an exodus of more than 700,000 people to neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown last August.

An estimated 500,000 Rohingya people remaining behind in Myanmar are in need of humanitarian relief.

Human rights abuses and conflict in Kachin and the northern Shan states have also ramped up.

Since early April, an estimated 5000 people in the northern Kachin state have fled their homes because of intensified fighting between the military and rebels.

""The Australian government calls on all parties to end the fighting, protect civilian populations, and allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to affected communities,"" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.

Ms Bishop said the $13 million would go to aid groups such as Save the Children and the UN's refugee agency to help provide health care, shelter and schooling in Rakhine state.

Save the Children will receive $1 million to train teachers and expand an existing education program in Rakhine state which works with displaced kids.

In Kachin and Shan states Australia's support would help protect families fleeing violence.

22,myanmar,"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar’s government leader Aung San Suu Kyi met with United Nations Security Council envoys on Monday over the plight of nearly 700,000 mainly Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh amid a military crackdown, pledging to investigate any credible accusations of abuse, said diplomats who attended the meeting.

During the nearly hour-long meeting, Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also noted Myanmar’s difficulties transitioning to rule of law after decades of military dictatorship, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Myanmar civilian government spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment.

Myanmar National Security Advisor Thaung Tun said Suu Kyi has always insisted on the rule of law.

“She has always said nobody is above the law and we intend to implement that. She told the Security Council members ‘please bring to our notice any infringement of these laws and we will do whatever is necessary to take the action’,” he told Reuters on Monday after the meeting.

Earlier this month, Suu Kyi - marking two years since her party swept to power in a historic vote - said in a televised speech that Myanmar was “struggling to develop politics, society and economy.”

Suu Kyi’s civilian government has no control over the military. The council envoys also met behind closed doors for two hours with military Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing in the country’s capital Naypyitaw.

Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts in Rakhine State in August last year sparked a military operation that Myanmar said was a legitimate response. Fleeing refugees have reported killings, rapes and arson on a large scale.

The Security Council envoys are due to travel to Rakhine on Tuesday.

‘WHATEVER IS NECESSARY’

Britain, the United States and others have denounced the military crackdown as ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has asked it to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingyas to Bangladesh, a possible crime against humanity. Suu Kyi’s government expressed “serious concern” over the move.

The U.S. government is conducting an intensive examination of alleged atrocities against the Rohingya that could be used to prosecute Myanmar’s military for crimes against humanity, U.S. officials told Reuters.

Earlier on Monday the council envoys met with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the country’s capital Dhaka, who asked them to press Myanmar to take back “their citizens.”

“That’s what we want,” Hasina told reporters. “They want to go back to their own country. So the Security Council can play a very pivotal role.”

U.N. SUPERVISED RETURN?

Hasina added that the refugees should return “under U.N. supervision where security and safety should be ensured”. When asked if U.N. supervision meant the deployment of peacekeepers, Hasina said: “Not exactly, well, that the U.N. will decide”.

Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years but differences between the two sides remain and implementation of the plan has been slow.

“We are ready and willing but it will take two to tango,” Thaung Tun told Reuters. “I hope that (the Security Council) will see we are really serious on trying to find a solution for this.”

Suu Kyi’s office also said in a statement released on Monday after the meeting that cooperation was needed from Bangladesh on the repatriation of refugees.

The envoys visited camps on Sunday, where distraught refugees pleaded for help ahead of the coming monsoon season.

Kuwait’s U.N. Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi, one of the envoys, told Hasina the Security Council wanted to “send a clear strong message ... that we’re determined to end this humanitarian crisis”.

The Security Council asked Myanmar in November to ensure no “further excessive use of military force” and to allow “freedom of movement, equal access to basic services, and equal access to full citizenship for all”.

When Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar 10 years ago, 140,000 lives were lost and 800,000 were displaced. The category 4 storm slammed into Myanmar’s low-lying Irrawaddy Delta, an area that usually escapes major typhoons. High winds and a 12-foot storm surge devastated the area, affecting millions.

I was a senior humanitarian assistance officer at the United States Agency for International Development at the time. Myanmar, then under a military dictatorship, was clearly unprepared for a storm of this magnitude.

Not only did the country lack a weather radar network that could predict cyclones, it also had no early warning system, storm shelters or evacuation plans. Housing, built largely of bamboo and thatch, was hardly cyclone resistant.

Reuters / TPG Survivors of Cyclone Nargis look out from their homes in the Irrawaddy delta region of Myanmar.

In the 10 years since the storm, Myanmar has made significant progress on disaster preparedness. But the government’s relationship with international and local relief agencies remains fraught – potentially putting future lives at risk.

Unnecessary misery

I spent the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Nargis negotiating with the government to gain access for humanitarian organizations to access the country and provide emergency relief.

Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was then largely a closed country run by the military. Battling many internal insurgencies over nearly 70 years, the military tended to spend money on security, undermining the growth of social programs. Disaster preparedness was extremely weak.

The security-obsessed Myanmar government made disaster recovery after Nargis infinitely harder than it needed to be because of resistance to international help, which was seen as a potential threat to internal security. The generals I worked with refused visas for international relief staff, delayed entry of ships carrying relief supplies and even arrested citizens for undertaking local relief efforts.

These delays left millions of people injured, hungry and homeless. More than 700,000 homes were fully or partially destroyed. Nearly 75 percent of health clinics were destroyed.

Two weeks later, under pressure from regional leaders, the U.N. secretary general, and critiques from the U.S. and other Western countries, the Association of South East Asian Nations, a regional governance body, brokered an agreement that allowed international organizations into the country to provide relief.

Numerous agencies came into the country, and several, such as Save the Children and World Vision, greatly expanded their programs and staff. It is estimated that more than 1.1 million received food assistance and other relief.

Government changes

A few years later, political change began to open Myanmar up to the outside world.

In 2010 a referendum allowed citizens to vote for their first elected leaders in two decades and eased tough restrictions on foreign access to the country.

This political opening also pushed the country to collaborate with neighboring countries and international partners on disaster preparedness. Myanmar worked with ASEAN on several regional storm risk-reduction programs, signed onto international agreements to boost its disaster resiliency and joined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

It also passed laws aimed at building national, state and local disaster response mechanisms, with the support of the U.S., Japan, the Myanmar Red Cross, the U.N. and other relief agencies.

AP / TPG A man walks past newly constructed houses for survivors of Cyclone Nargis in Pyinsalu, Myanmar.

Similar efforts had been shown to help neighboring Bangladesh greatly reduce its storm deaths in recent decades. In 1991, for example, approximately 135,000 people died in Cyclone 2b. By 2007, just 3,000 were killed in Cyclone Sidr, though it was one of the largest storms ever to hit Bangladesh.

Myanmar is also making an effort to replant coastal mangrove forests. Evidence shows that deforestation of this critical coastline ecosystem worsened the storm surge of Cyclone Nargis.

During Cyclone Nargis, many in the path of the storm doubted weather reports because of the unreliability of previous storm reporting. The country has now made dramatic improvements to its national weather forecasting and disaster warning systems, installing three new radar facilities and 30 new weather observation stations.

The new weather reports, which are broadcast regularly through radio and television, have evidently earned people’s trust. When severe weather is predicted, warnings will also be issued via newly installed loudspeaker systems.

The government also hopes to build 50 concrete shelters in cyclone-vulnerable Rakhine state and offer more training to government officials in “resilience training” – teaching them best practices in disaster management and social protection.

Rise of the smartphone

The most significant disaster mitigation development, however, has nothing to do with government legislation. It is the explosion of smartphones in the country.

In 2008, when I worked in Myanmar, only 3 percent of the population had mobile phones. By June 2017, about 90 percent of the country’s 54 million people had access to a phone with internet service.

Now, even the 85 percent of Myanmar citizens who live in rural areas will soon be able to receive storm warnings directly via a smartphone app.

Difficulties remain

While Myanmar deserves praise for learning from the Cyclone Nargis disaster, I fear that the government’s continued resistance to outside influence will undermine progress.

Even with the leadership of the elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for advocating democratic reforms, Myanmar remains something of a rogue state. Most notably, the country is accused of atrocity in its treatment of the Rohingya, a minority Muslim community from Rakhine state.

Thousands have reportedly been killed since August 2017 and many of their villages razed. Some 600,000 Rohingya are now refugees in Bangladesh.

Myanmar has consistently blocked the U.N. and international aid agencies from assisting Rohingya refugees. Just as it did in 2008, when I was negotiating with generals to get foreign aid workers into the country, the government still limits visas and operations for international nonprofit relief groups.

Photo Credit：AP／達志影像 Myanmar immigration officials examine documents as a Rohingya family of five look on at a receiving center in Taung Pyo, Letwe, northern Rakhine state.

In my assessment, the government’s dual strategy – cooperating on disaster preparedness while obstructing humanitarian relief in conflict areas – still puts Burmese lives needlessly in danger.

By hindering relief organizations seeking to provide humanitarian relief to the Rohingya, Myanmar is creating confused and ineffective relationships with the same agencies that it will depend on after the inevitable next natural storm.

Myanmar has made great strides in disaster preparedness since Cyclone Nargis. But unless it builds more open and transparent relationships with international partners, it risks a repeat of another tragedy.

25,myanmar,"No problem, that was Malaysia captain Anuar Manan's confident pronouncement about winning the OCBC Cycle Speedway South-east Asia Championship yesterday.

But the favourites tumbled even before the final when one of their four men, Muhammad Elmi, crashed at a roundabout during the qualification race, resulting in their failure to advance.

It was left to the unfancied team from Myanmar to post a shock victory, pipping last year's champions the Philippines.

There was still plenty of drama left in the day. Even though Myanmar were not the quickest in the final, 20min 40.317sec, they topped the standings because of time penalties imposed on the Filipino, Thai and Singaporean sides for infringements during the dismounting and mounting of bicycles.

In the Speedway Championship, each team are split into pairs and each pair cover five laps on a flat 1km stretch along Stadium Drive.

Philippines ended up runners-up in 20:49.680, after a 10-second penalty, while Thailand were third on 20:49.907, also after a similar penalty. Singapore were fourth in 20:59.737 with a 20-second penalty.

Myanmar team manager and coach Aung Myo Naing said: ""It is an amazing feeling to have won our first title.

""We did not expect to win today as the other teams have better sprinters than us, but thankfully we had a clean changeover in the transit area.""

Philippines team captain Cris Largo Jovan lamented: ""I am disappointed as we were expecting to come in first in the race.

""One of our riders dismounted wrongly and we were penalised.""

Added Malaysia team manager Mohd Rizal Tisin: ""The competition this year was good and we had very strong competitors... We will also be more careful and come back stronger next year.""

In the OCBC Cycle Speedway Club Championship, local club Specialized Roval Mavericks regained the title they won in 2016. They had finished runners-up last year.

Yesterday, they ended ahead of Allied World Kemp Technologies and MatadorRacing, who finished second and third, respectively.

The OCBC Cycle continues today with the Community Rides, which will see cyclists participate in The Straits Times Ride (23km) and the Sportive Ride (40.8km) held at the Sports Hub.",Myanmar crash cycling party,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/myanmar-crash-cycling-party
