0,myanmar,"The Australian Government partnered with eight leading humanitarian agencies in a joint appeal to help Rohingya who need assistance following violence in Myanmar.

From 11 November – 9 December, the public donated more than $5.3 million dollars to these agencies, which include the Australian Red Cross, Australia for UNCR, CARE Australia, Caritas Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia.

The Australian Government provided $5 million in matched donations to the Australian Red Cross and Australia for UNHCR, as part of its $31.5 million contribution in response to the crisis. This brings the total amount of the joint appeal to more than $10.3 million.

Impact of joint funding

These funds are helping deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by recent violence in Myanmar, including the more than 655,000 people who have fled to Bangladesh.

Public donations are supporting life-saving aid such as the provision of shelter, clean water, sanitation, food, health care, psychological first aid and child protection.

Donations to UNHCR has helped the organisation provide 231,000 displaced people with access to clean water, and 155,000 people with medical care. UNHCR has also delivered more than 800,000 humanitarian relief items to families affected by this crisis.

Donations to the Australian Red Cross are helping to operate one field hospital, five mobile and three fixed clinics in Cox’s Bazar, which is home to the majority of the displaced Rohingya. These health facilities have treated almost 50,000 people since August 2017.

Australia’s support

Since 25 August 2017 when the violence in Rakhine State escalated, Australia has committed $31.5 million towards relief efforts. This funding is in addition to over $95 million that we have provided since 2013 to respond to humanitarian needs in Myanmar and for people displaced to Bangladesh.

1,myanmar,"The disagreement centers on a chain letter that spread on Facebook Messenger in Myanmar in September. The messages warned Buddhist communities of an imminent Muslim attack. Meanwhile, Muslim populations received a separate message cautioning them of violence from militant Buddhist groups.

Civil society groups say the messages paralyzed major cities in Myanmar and raised fears of a violent clash. Such incitement and scaremongering have become far too typical on Facebook, according to the groups, which say Facebook has repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to devote more resources to the issues.

In an interview last week, Mr. Zuckerberg appeared to hold up the September episode as a model of Facebook’s effectiveness, and said the company’s systems had detected the messages and stopped them. In fact, the activists said, they flagged the messages repeatedly to Facebook, barraging its employees with strongly worded appeals until the company finally stepped in to help.

Mr. Zuckerberg’s personal email did not quell the activists’ frustration. The groups say the biggest obstruction to their attempts to push back against a torrent of dangerous hate speech is not their lack of resources but Facebook itself. They said Facebook had a history of pledging to do more to help quell ethnic violence in Myanmar but had not fulfilled its promises.

“It’s great that he’s engaging personally with this, but the stuff he’s talking about is really not that much different from what they’ve been saying for the past few years,” said Jes Petersen, the chief executive of Phandeeyar, an innovation lab in Myanmar that has worked with Facebook to produce localized versions of its community standards.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, confirmed the authenticity of Mr. Zuckerberg’s email, and said Facebook was planning to continue engaging with the activists.

Years after civil society groups first began flagging hate speech in Myanmar, the company still has no permanent office or staff in the country and seems to be struggling to give its platform sufficient oversight. In Germany, where hate speech laws require vigilant attention from content reviewers, Facebook has hired about 1,200 moderators. In order to achieve the same ratio of users to moderators in Myanmar, Facebook would need to have around 800 reviewers in the country, Mr. Petersen calculated.

“Dozens of content reviewers is not going to cut it,” he said.

The civil society groups have already responded to Mr. Zuckerberg’s reply, asking for hard data about Facebook’s efforts in the region, including how many Burmese-speaking reviewers the company has, how many accounts the company has taken down in Myanmar and how long, on average, it takes for Facebook to respond to reports of hate speech.

“A lot of what they’ve been doing is cosmetic — it’s not the tangible improvement we’re looking for,” said Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in Myanmar who was named in Mr. Zuckerberg’s reply.

Activists in other developing countries have raised similar complaints about Facebook’s behavior. In Indonesia, politicians have called Facebook executives to account for the spread of disinformation. In the Philippines, critics of President Rodrigo Duterte have faced barrages of threatening posts. Last month, the government of Sri Lanka ordered Facebook blocked in an attempt to stem mob violence against Muslim communities.

Last month, Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s News Feed head, said in an interview that he and other Facebook executives “lose some sleep” over the possibility that Facebook had led to real-world violence.

Mr. Petersen said he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg’s appeal would spur actual change and not just expressions of worry. “I wonder how he spent those sleepless nights — because we didn’t see that much change,” he said.

Here is the full text of Mr. Zuckerberg’s email to the civil society groups, followed by the groups’ response:

Mark Zuckerberg’s email

Dear Htaike Htaike, Jes, Victoire, Phyu Phyu and Thant, I wanted to personally respond to your open letter. Thank you for writing it and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues, including the September incident you referred to. In making my remarks, my intention was to highlight how we’re building artificial intelligence to help us better identify abusive, hateful or false content even before it is flagged by our community. These improvements in technology and tools are the kinds of solutions that your organizations have called on us to implement and we are committed to doing even more. For example, we are rolling out improvements to our reporting mechanism in Messenger to make it easier to find and simpler for people to report conversations. In addition to improving our technology and tools, we have added dozens more Burmese language reviewers to handle reports from users across all our services. We have also increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues and we now we have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe. There are several other improvements we have made or are making, and I have directed my teams to ensure we are doing all we can to get your feedback and keep you informed. We are grateful for your support as we map out our ongoing work in Myanmar, and we are committed to working with you to find more ways to be responsive to these important issues. Mark

2,myanmar,"(Yangon/New York, 8 April 2018): At the conclusion today of a six-day mission to Myanmar, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Ursula Mueller called for strengthened humanitarian action based on the rights and needs of all communities, in line with international law and humanitarian principles.

“Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organizations and the Government,” said Ms. Mueller. “Wherever they are in the country and regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status, we need to work together to ensure that no vulnerable conflict-affected people are deprived of safe and sustained access to humanitarian protection and assistance. No-one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path towards a better future.”

At the outset of her mission, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. They discussed the importance of ending conflict and of strengthening peace and reconciliation efforts. Ms. Mueller reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to supporting peace, stability, and development in Myanmar. She offered the continued support of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners to ensure that all people affected by conflict and natural disasters get the humanitarian protection and assistance they need. They agreed on the importance of strengthening national capacities. Ms. Mueller noted the efforts being made by the UN to strengthen the nexus between humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts.

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator also met with the Ministers of Defence, Border Affairs, International Cooperation, and the Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. The meetings with the Union Government were an opportunity to discuss humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states as well as the collaborative efforts of the international community and the Government on disaster preparedness efforts.

In Rakhine State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator visited camps where about 130,000 people, most of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, remain confined in deplorable conditions after almost six years of displacement. In Maungdaw Township, she met with local communities affected by last year’s violence. Ms. Mueller also visited a refugee return transit site that the Government is constructing, some new housing projects, and witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Ms. Mueller. “The unfolding tragedy in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar rightly captured the world’s attention, but we cannot, and must not, forget the plight of over 400,000 Muslim people still living in Rakhine State who continue to face a life of hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions. These restrictions severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education, and other essential services.”

“The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has provided an important roadmap towards a better future for all communities in Rakhine State, but its recommendations need to be implemented holistically and impartially, in the spirit that they were written,” said Ms. Mueller. “The lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities of Rakhine State, whether they are ethnic Rakhine, Muslim, or from other minority groups, will be profoundly transformed if each recommendation is genuinely addressed and implemented. The conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees and positive outcomes for internally displaced people in camps slated for closure can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, social cohesion, livelihoods, and access to services are addressed.”

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator welcomed the access that she was granted by the Government to visit communities in different parts of Rakhine. She was concerned, however, by the continued restrictions imposed by the authorities on the movement of the Muslim population, as well as the continued restrictions faced by humanitarian workers.

In her meeting with officials in the Rakhine State Government, Ms. Mueller called for movement restrictions to be dropped and for practical measures to be taken to allow humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, in line with the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan States. When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” said Ms. Mueller. “I was able to go to northern Rakhine and to some of the camps in Kachin State, but what matters most is that the people affected by violence and restrictions in these areas are themselves given access to the assistance and services they so desperately need.”

In Kachin State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator met with representatives of international and national humanitarian organizations and visited camps where she spoke with displaced people. She also met with a group of women and girls who were taking action to respond to the needs of women in displaced communities, including preventing gender-based violence. The women emphasized the importance of prevention and education in building stronger, safer communities, and presented a joint letter to the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator raising critical concerns shared by displaced women across Kachin.

At least 10,000 people have been newly displaced or re-displaced by fighting between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in Kachin and Shan States since the beginning of the year, while about 100,000 people remain displaced as a result of the conflict between the Myanmar Army and the Kachin Independence Army that restarted in 2011. Ms. Mueller was particularly impressed by the work of local civil society organizations. She met with representatives of a number of different local organizations and commended them on their outstanding work. She was encouraged to see that the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels more than 40 per cent of its funding through national organizations.

“The conflict in Kachin is one the world’s longest running, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Ms. Mueller. “Clashes break out near displacement camps and civilian areas, landmines are still being placed in the fields and roads of Kachin and Shan States, and people continue to flee their homes. I call on all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians wherever they are, in line with international law.”

During her mission, Ms. Mueller also discussed ways of strengthening disaster preparedness and response. “Myanmar is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and the last time I was here was nearly ten years ago in the tragic aftermath of Cyclone Nargis,” said Ms. Mueller. “I see that much has changed since then and while disaster risk reduction efforts need to be further enhanced, the Government and national organizations have made excellent progress in recent years in building national capacity for disaster preparedness and response.”

More funding is urgently required for the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, which calls for $183 million to meet the needs of 832,000 people in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and Kayin States.

3,myanmar,"At least 21 fatalities have been reported in the clashes in Hpakant and Tanai townships of Kachin State, according to local residents.

Neither the Tatmadaw (military) nor the KIA would confirm the reports.

Police Colonel Myo Thura Naung of the Kachin State Police Department confirmed to The Myanmar Times on Sunday that clashes between the KIA and Tatmadaw were reported on Friday and Sunday in Hpakant and Tanai townships.

“We heard fighting in the area. The security forces were increased,” he said. “We do not know the details of the clashes as we cannot go there. We do not have new information about the fighting.”

A villager said he saw 18 Tatmadaw troops and three KIA fighters killed during an ambush launched by KIA fighters near a Tatmadaw camp along Myitkyina-Hpakant road on Friday.

He said Tatmadaw used helicopter gunships in retaliation for the KIA’s offensive.

The Tatmadaw took away dead and wounded soldiers by car with the help of militia in Nan Yar and Nan Tane villages, the residents added.

KIA spokesperson Naw Bu admitted that his troops launched offensives against a Tatmadaw camp near Tada Nyinaung area on the Myitkyina-Hpakant road on Friday, but would not confirm casualties on their side.

A 17-year-old ceasefire between the Tatmadaw and the KIA broke down in 2011, resulting in sporadic clashes between the two forces since then, not only in Kachin State but also in northern Shan State, where the armed ethnic group has a presence.

Tensions between the Tatmadaw and KIA are high in Hpakant, Mansi, Tanai, Bhamo, Sumprabum and Puta-O townships and fighting may break out at anytime, according to KIA spokesperson Naw Bu.

The Tatmadaw’s True News department could not be reached for comment about the fighting in Hpakant and Tanai, but the Commander-In-Chief of Defence Services Office announced on April 3 that there were three battles between the Tatmadaw and KIA from March 31 to April 2 in Mansi.

Due to Tatmadaw military operations in 2017, the KIA had to retreat from bases in Hpakant, which was then run by Battalion No 6.

The Tada Nyinaung area, where a fierce battle took place on Friday, was also a KIA area that is now occupied by the Tatmadaw.

On Thursday, the KIA issued a statement that it would launch offensives to recapture lost territories. It said it will launch a guerrilla operation in Hukawng valley starting on April 10. The KIA warned all workers at gold and amber mines to leave the areas.

The KIA has not signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with the government. Since 2011, over 100,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting between the two forces.

Although there were attempts to hold ceasefire talks initially, the Tatmadaw and KIA could not yet reach agreement.

Ursula Mueller, UN assistant secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs, who visited Kachin during a weeklong visit to the country that ended Sunday, called on the government and KIA to ensure the protection of civilians in line with international law.

“Kachin has one of the world’s longest-running conflicts, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Mueller in a statement. “Clashes break out near displacement camps and civilian areas, landmines are still being placed in the fields and roads of Kachin and Shan, and people continue to flee their homes.”

At least 10,000 people have been newly displaced or re-displaced by fighting between the military and armed ethnic groups in Kachin and Shan since the beginning of the year, and about 100,000 people remain displaced as a result of the conflict between the military and the KIA that restarted in 2011, according to a statement by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Sunday.

Mueller was particularly impressed by the work of local civil society organisations and was also encouraged to see that the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund channels more than 40 percent of its funding via national organisations, the statement said.

Last week, Mark Zuckerberg took the unusual step of personally writing to critics upset at the way he characterized Facebook’s response to the ongoing civil strife in Myanmar. Zuckerberg apologized for not acknowledging the importance that activist groups had played in stemming the circulation of harmful messages in Myanmar. The groups wasted no time issuing a letter demanding more transparency and accountability from the social network.



The current debate first started last week when six civil society groups in Myanmar penned an open letter criticizing Zuckerberg for statements given in an interview with Vox published on April 2nd. He’d said that Facebook had tools to detect and stop the spread false chain letters being sent through Facebook Messenger, which warned of imminent attacks supposedly planned by both Buddhist and Muslim groups. “Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on,” Zuckerberg said in the interview.

The groups politely called bullshit on the claim, stating in an open letter that the “systems” Zuckerberg referred to were actually activists reporting hate speech manually. “In your interview, you refer to your detection ‘systems.’ We believe your system, in this case, was us — and we were far from systematic,” the groups wrote.



They noted that“far from being stopped” the hate speech messages actually spread “in an unprecedented way, reaching country-wide and causing widespread fear and at least three violent incidents in the process.”

The groups said Facebook’s efforts in Myanmar exemplified “the very opposite of effective moderation” and revealed “an overreliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency.”

At issue is the persecution and alleged ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, a minority group that lives in the Buddhist-majority country. Since August 2017, more than 650,000 Rohingya people have fled the country to avoid being massacred.



United Nations human rights experts have cited Facebook as being responsible in part for facilitating the spread of hate speech and violence in the region. Data compiled by digital researcher and analyst Raymond Serrato revealed that hate speech on Facebook spiked in the lead up to killings of Rohingya.

Facebook is a dominant source for information in the country, as it is in many developing nations. In Myanmar, Facebook basically is the internet. According to data from LIRNEAsia, more people in Myanmar identify as “Facebook users” than “internet users.”

A day after posting the open letter on April 5th, the groups received a response from Mark Zuckerberg’s personal email address in which he offered a mea culpa. “I wanted to personally respond to your open letter. Thank you for writing it and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organizations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues,” Zuckerberg wrote in correspondence first obtained by The New York Times. (Facebook confirmed to The Times that the correspondence was real.)

Zuckerberg’s critics immediately responded with specific requests for improvements to the platform and additional investments into moderation services for the region, warning that “When things go wrong in Myanmar, the consequences can be really serious — potentially disastrous.”

The organizations sought details from Facebook regarding how many reports of abusive content it has received from users in Myanmar, how many of those reports were addressed by the company, and how long it took to remove the offending content, among other requests for transparency.

In his apology letter, Zuckerberg noted that the company has built artificial intelligence designed to identify hate speech and false information that has infected the platform, and added “dozens” of Burmese language content reviewers to monitor user reports of abusive posts and messages.

Victoire Rio, a social media analyst and spokesperson for the groups, told BuzzFeed News Zuckerberg’s response was “grossly insufficient” and “only reinforces our belief that Facebook is not doing anywhere near as much as they should and could do to prevent the spread of hatred in Myanmar.”

While the groups push for Facebook to provide the same level of moderation in Myanmar as it provides for western nations, they may find that Facebook simply isn’t that good at it. The company has come under fire in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and other countries for failing to adequately moderate its massive platform.

7,myanmar,"Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar, she said, must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organizations and the Government.

At the outset of her mission, the senior UN relief official met with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, discussing the importance of ending conflict and to strengthen peace and reconciliation efforts in Myanmar.

Ms. Mueller also met with a number of senior Government officials for discussions of the humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states.

‘Humanitarian crisis on both sides of Bangladesh-Myanmar border’

Ms. Mueller, also the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, visited Rakhine state – where widespread violence last year forced hundreds of thousands of minority Muslim Rohingyas to flee their homes for safety, with most finding refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Other senior UN officials including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have condemned what they describe as the systematic persecution and murders of Rohingyas by elements of the Myanmar military.

In Maungdaw township, located near the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, Ms. Mueller met with local communities affected by the violence, visited a refugee return transit site that the Government of Myanmar is constructing some new housing projects and witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Ms. Mueller, noting that while the crisis facing Rohungya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, Banladesh, has captured the world’s attention, over 400,000 Rohingyas still living in Rakhine state continue to face hardship and marginalization due to movement restrictions.

“These restrictions severely compromise their rights and obstruct their access to health, livelihoods, protection, education, and other essential services,” she stressed.

Humanitarian workers have also been barred from access restrictions to violence-torn parts of Rakhine.

Furthermore, the situation in Myanmar’s Kachin state, in the country’s far north and Shan, in the east, has also deteriorated since the beginning of this year, with some 100,000 people displaced as a result of conflict between the military and armed groups.

“The conflict in Kachin is one the world’s longest running, yet it is a forgotten humanitarian crisis,” said Ms. Mueller, calling on all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians in line with international law.

Implement recommendations of Rakhine panel ‘in the spirit’ they were written in

Ms. Mueller also underscored the need for the total and impartial implementation of recommendations made by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State “in the spirit that they were written.”

That panel, headed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, outlined long-term solutions to help end the violence and marginalization for all communities in Rakhine. It also focused on issues of citizenship and freedom of movement.

The senior UN aid official also noted that the conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees as well as internally displaced people can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, employment and access to services are addressed.

“The lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities of Rakhine state, whether they are ethnic Rakhine, Muslim, or from other minority groups, will be profoundly transformed if each recommendation is genuinely addressed and implemented,” she said.","No one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path to a better future, stresses UN official",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1006861
8,myanmar,"(CNN) As tens of millions of Americans come to grips with revelations that data from Facebook may have been used to sway the 2016 presidential election, on the other side of the world, rights groups say hatemongers have taken advantage of the social network to widely disseminate inflammatory, anti-Muslim speech in Myanmar.

The rhetoric is aimed almost exclusively at the disenfranchised Rohingya Muslim minority, a group which has been the target of a sustained campaign of violence and abuse by the Myanmar military, which claims it is targeting terrorists.

Human rights activists inside the country and out tell CNN that posts range from recirculated news articles from pro-government outlets, to misrepresented or faked photos and anti-Rohingya cartoons.

A Rohingya refugee looks out from a school window at Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh's Ukhia district.

In response to the flood of hate-filled posts, a cross-Myanmar group of tech firms and NGOs has written an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, lambasting what they term the ""inadequate response of the Facebook team"" to escalating rhetoric on the platform in Myanmar.

Citing conversations the group says it unearthed on Facebook's Messenger service, which issue calls to arms against Muslims over a fabricated ""jihad"" planned for September 2017, it stated that the examples show ""clear examples of (Facebook) tools being used to incite real harm.

Facebook Messenger conversations, screenshotted and included with an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg from Myanmar tech companies.

""Far from being stopped, they spread in an unprecedented way, reaching country-wide and causing widespread fear and at least three violent incidents in the process.""

The letter cited an interview Zuckerberg did with Vox's Ezra Klein , in which he said Facebook's ""systems detected"" the hate speech. The letter surmised that by ""systems"" Zuckerberg meant the signatories of the letter -- third party vendors in Myanmar which, the letter admits, were ""far from systematic"" in their detection of hate speech.

Calling it ""the opposite of effective moderation,"" the group also chided Facebook for what it called a lack of proper mechanisms for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders and a lack of transparency.

Zuckerberg told Vox hate speech is ""a real issue, and we want to make sure that all of the tools that we're bringing to bear on eliminating hate speech, inciting violence, and basically protecting the integrity of civil discussions that we're doing in places like Myanmar, as well as places like the US that do get a disproportionate amount of the attention.""

Sudden surge

New research suggests Facebook played a key role as extremists sought to escalate the conflict in Myanmar.

Data analyst Raymond Serrato looked at posts from Myanmar citizens over the course of 2017, determining that there was a massive spike in hate-speech posts following an August military campaign in the country's western Rakhine state, home to the majority of the country's Rohingya.

The campaign was initially sparked when an insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, called for an uprising -- one which was easily quelled by the government.

The failed attempt led to the large-scale purge, which the UN has called ""ethnic cleansing,"" and a subsequent refugee crisis, which has seen 700,000 Rohingya forced from their homes and across the border into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar denies the intentional killing of civilians, and insists that operations targeted terrorists.

Serrato said he was ""surprised by the intensity"" and frequency of the anti-Rohingya posts.

""In August, when ARSA called on the Rohingya to rise up, (we were) surprised by the speed at which (anti-Rohingya voices) weaponized social media.""

Facebook has 'turned into a beast'

In March, Facebook was accused by the UN of ""substantively"" contributing to the ""level of acrimony"" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.

Marzuki Darusman, the chair of a United Nations probe into human rights in Myanmar, said ""hate speech and incitement to violence on social media is rampant, particularly on Facebook"" and largely ""goes unchecked.""

His colleague, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, added that ""we know ultra-nationalist Buddhists... are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities.

""I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended"" to be, she said.

Instrument of 'hate and racism'

Human rights activist Zarni, who like some in the country, goes by only one name, told CNN the platform is neutral, but ""what is toxic is the state. (Lee) said Facebook has turned into a beast, (but in fact) the beasts are using Facebook.""

He says the main provocateurs are ""operating in very powerful institutions -- the military and monastic networks; the two major pillars of Burmese society."" Among the offenders, at least until his ban from the platform, was the infamous ultra-nationalist monk Wirathu.

In 2015, he told CNN that Muslims ""take many wives and they have many children. And when their population grows they threaten us."" ""And,"" he concluded, ""they are violent.""

Thaw Parka, a spokesman for Ma Ba Tha, a Buddhist nationalist group associated with the controversial monk, says critics ""cherry pick (Wirathu's) extreme words.""

A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters it suspends and sometimes removes anyone that ""consistently shares content promoting hate,"" in response to a question about Wirathu's account.

Others are not letting the social media giant off the hook. It would be ""superficial"" to ""ignore the conflict between ethnicities,"" Serrato says, ""but Facebook has definitely facilitated it.""

Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Myanmar-based startup accelerator Phandeeyar, says while there is a lot of racist content shared on the platform, ""there are also moderate voices that are doing good work not only countering this but spreading moderate narrative, but ""get drowned out.""

New users, new problems

Myanmar's relative callowness in engaging online is part of the reason the rhetoric has exploded, and been so influential.

The country experienced a ""digital leapfrog effect,"" says Petersen. ""Until 2014, there was less than 5% mobile phone penetration, but overnight, SIM cards were offered for (as little as) $1.50,"" allowing a much greater number of people to buy smartphones.

Myanmar has a ""whole new generation of internet users, just coming to terms with what you can do online,"" he says.

Facebook's ubiquity in the country -- the UN's Darusman says, in Myanmar, ""social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media"" -- only serves to multiply hate speech's virality.

Activist Sein Thein says the burden of responsibility for the online rhetoric should not fall entirely on Facebook's shoulders, and that Myanmar's citizens ""need to be mature"" when they are online.

Facebook: We're combating hate

In order to combat the platform being used for hate speech against the Muslim minority, Facebook said it has ""invested significantly in technology and local language expertise"" in Myanmar following the UN accusations.

""There is no place for hate speech or content that promotes violence on Facebook, and we work hard to keep it off our platform,"" a spokesperson told CNN.

The spokesperson said the company has worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to produce a community standards page for Myanmar ""and regular training sessions for civil society and local community groups across the country.""

It is hard for Facebook to monitor the rise of hate speech in the country, Petersen says, partly due to language difficulties.

""There's an intention to enforce them but it's not being followed."" Petersen says his company, Phandeeyar, helped Facebook translate its community standards into Burmese.

In response to the March UN accusations, Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said his government and Facebook are ""promoting cooperation and coordination for the Myanmar people to understand the community standards of Facebook.""

On Facebook he said supporters of the Rohingya were also using social media to ""spread... disinformation around the world.""

The group that sent the open letter to Zuckerberg, co-signed by Phandeeyar, urged the tech mogul ""to invest more into moderation -- particularly in countries, such as Myanmar, where Facebook has rapidly come to play a dominant role in how information is accessed and communicated.""

Long history

Zarni says the country has a ""long ideological tradition by which genocides are acceptable,"" which can partially be explained by support of the enemies of the then-British empire, including the Nazis, in resistance to British rule in the 1930s and 40s.

""I came from that society, I grew up with it. In the 1930s, we were quoting Hitler left and right in Burma,"" he said, using the colonial-era name for the country.

The country's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been criticized for her silence in the face of the country's treatment of the minority.

9,myanmar,"Dear editor,

Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been in the process of what some view as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim population from the Rakhine State. Extensive murders, rapes and arsons have taken place between the two groups, leaving the minority population with little hope to survive if they were to stay in their region. Because of this, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have left their oppressive country for others such as Malaysia, Thailand and primarily Bangladesh. Journeying through murky waters while facing innumerable conditions along the way like starvation and disease create a narrative of a displaced people solely searching for somewhere to settle and receive ethical human treatment.

The history of Rohingya Muslims dates back to the 19th and early 20th century, a time when the Arakan Kingdom was a formidable force and British-Indian rule was in effect in India’s southwest region. The advent of Burma’s independence in 1948 granted sovereignty to the Burmese government to treat the Rohingyas immorally on several spectrums including citizenship, marriage and childbirth. Tactics implemented in Burma’s 1948 citizenship policy created an atmosphere where they could not legally become citizens, in turn leaving masses of people stateless. Recent reform in the 1990s has allocated minimal rights to the Rohingyas through the usage of white cards, which are symbols of temporary residency in Myanmar and a form of identification. However, white cards do not give full or even partial citizenship to the distressed population of Muslims under persecution and play a role in enthralling the current mistreatment of the Rohingyas.

Marriage for Rohingyas is only feasible if they go against the regulations of their religion. In order for two Rohingyas to get married, a picture of the bride without her headscarf on must be shown to authorities along with proof that the groom has shaved his face, both of which are in contra with Rohingya tradition. Along the lines of childbirth, Rohingyan couples are only allowed to have two children. When these elements are implemented all at once on these individuals their lives become much more strenuous and ill-fated, leaving them no other choice but to flee in hopes of a better life elsewhere. The lack of action from the country’s leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, also appropriates their decision to journey away from their homeland. If the leader of your country won’t even flash a hand to help, what else is there to do?

Bangladesh continues to be a hotspot for Rohingya refugees but living conditions and lack of quality food create more problems for them as refugee camps continuously become overcrowded. Nearly one million refugees are scraping away at rations donated by the international community to survive, and the number continues to grow.

What will be the solution to this situation? On behalf of Myanmar, military action would need to cease and full recognition of Rohingyas would be a necessary element for reform. Even if this were to become a reality, the amount of ethical tension and discrimination that would be at the forefront of Rohingya Muslims’ lives in Myanmar and the Rhakine State might prove to be just as detrimental and destructive as its military interaction with them. Solving this series of callous events will require extensive amounts of help from the international community to help this group of people that has been ravaged for simply existing.

MYITKYINA, Myanmar – Mother-of-two Ah Chang and her family were jolted out of their sleep when gunfire ruptured the night’s calm in Ting Kok Village.

As bullets struck their home, they desperately sought cover while Myanmar troops and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) fighters battled outside the village last July.

When dawn broke and the fighting died down, her husband cautiously ventured outside, only to be detained, along with several other men, by Myanmar soldiers who had just entered the village.

Ah Chang* and her children, aged five and six, were unhurt. But when she went out, she discovered that her neighbours had been caught in the deadly crossfire.

“A young boy was fatally hit, his mother was injured in the foot and her husband was bleeding from his stomach,” she said in a recent interview at a camp for internally displaced people in Myitkyina where she and her family now live.

In all, five villagers were wounded and a two-year-old boy was killed during the gun battle near Ting Kok, which straddles the strategic main road between Tanai town and Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin, Myanmar’s northernmost state.

“A young boy was fatally hit, his mother was injured.""

After the military secured the village, the 25 local families, most of them ethnic Rawang and Lisu farmers cultivating rice paddies and orange groves, were held for some 12 hours before all - including the apprehended men - were released and taken to Myitkyina.

The plight of close to 700,000 Rohingya refugees who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh following violence in the northern part of Myanmar’s Rakhine State last August has captured global headlines.

But the residents of Ting Kok are the latest to join roughly 107,000 civilians who have been internally displaced within Myanmar by conflict. They are in camps in Kachin and the adjoining northern part of Shan State, after a 17-year-old ceasefire between the military and the KIA collapsed in 2011.

The ethnically diverse population of Myanmar’s northern and eastern borderlands have suffered from decades of conflict between the army and various ethnic armed groups, which demand regional political autonomy. Internal displacement has been common, while some 100,000 refugees fled to Thailand, where they have waited since the 1990s for peace and a chance to return home.

An army hospital in Myitkyina treated the injured Ting Kok villagers, while a small church on the town's outskirts has given the displaced families shelter. Set up by church leaders, Ka Bu Dam Camp is supported by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.

Since their arrival at the camp, the villagers have lived in emergency tents provided by UNHCR, which has also supplied cooking utensils, winter clothes, blankets, mosquito nets and other items. Additionally, they receive monthly cash transfers, food and hygiene kits from other aid organizations and Kachin State authorities.

“We left most of our belongings, and our animals, house, and orange groves. We could only bring some small things like clothes and blankets,” said Ah Chang, noting that some of her blankets “even have bullet holes.”

She said some villagers had since gone back to check on their homes and farms, only to find these had been looted and trashed.

Fighting first spread to western Kachin’s Tanai Township last year after the military announced operations there to clear out unregulated gold- and amber-mining sites in KIA-controlled areas.

Hundreds of villagers, and thousands of itinerant miners and their families were forced flee Tanai in mid-2017 and again in February this year. To the concern of UNHCR and other aid organizations, many were trapped between the warring parties for days until the military and authorities evacuated them.

Such new displacement and re-displacement occurs regularly across northern Myanmar, where clashes have spread out and risen in frequency and intensity since 2016 despite an ongoing nationwide peace process.

“We are urgently calling for human rights protection for civilians affected by the fighting.""

“We are urgently calling for human rights protection for civilians affected by the fighting as we are concerned about recurrent reports of people getting injured or killed by crossfire, indiscriminate shelling and landmines,” said Giuseppe De Vincentiis, UNHCR’s representative in Myanmar.

“Improved aid access is also needed as fleeing families are often forced to hide for days in the forest without emergency shelter, food or medicine before they can reach safety,” he added.

UN agencies and their local partners have faced a sharp reduction in access to displaced civilians in government- and KIA-controlled areas since 2016, as authorities severely curtailed travel approvals for humanitarian operations on security grounds.

In Ka Bu Dam Camp, the displacement and exposure to violence has left deep mental scars among the families. “Several people here have been traumatized,” said Mana Di, a pastor at the church hosting the camp.

Ah Chang’s neighbor, the 42-year-old mother whose child was killed, was seen in the camp caring for her two remaining young sons and recovering from a gunshot wound to her left ankle. She appeared reclusive and dejected, and has said she cannot recall what happened to her family during the fighting near Ting Kok.

Mana Di said the camp management also had ongoing concerns over the group’s food, health care and education needs, while “living conditions in the tents are difficult. They arrived in the rainy season and there was flooding and leaking, and in the dry season it gets very hot. So a lot of people get sick.”

11,myanmar,"Dhaka, Apr 8 (UNB) – UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Ursula Mueller has called for strengthening humanitarian action for Rohingyas based on the rights and needs in line with international law and humanitarian principles.

“Protecting the most vulnerable people in Myanmar must be at the heart of the humanitarian response by the international community, national aid organisations and the government,” said Mueller at the conclusion of a six-day mission to Myanmar on Sunday.

She said wherever they are in the country and regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status, all need to work together to ensure that no vulnerable conflict-affected people are deprived of safe and sustained access to humanitarian protection and assistance. “No-one in Myanmar should be left behind on the path towards a better future.”

Mueller, also Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator in the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the conditions for the dignified, voluntary, and sustainable return of refugees and positive outcomes for internally displaced people in camps slated for closure can only be reached if the critical issues of freedom of movement, social cohesion, livelihoods, and access to services are addressed.

At the outset of her mission, she met State Counsellor Aung San SuuKyi, according to the press release shared by ReliefWeb, the leading humanitarian information source on global crises and disasters.

They discussed the importance of ending conflict and of strengthening peace and reconciliation efforts.

Mueller reaffirmed the commitment of the United Nations to supporting peace, stability, and development in Myanmar.

She offered the continued support of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners to ensure that all people affected by conflict and natural disasters get the humanitarian protection and assistance they need.

They agreed on the importance of strengthening national capacities. Mueller noted the efforts being made by the UN to strengthen the nexus between humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts.

The Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator also met the Ministers of Defence, Border Affairs, International Cooperation, and the Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.

The meetings with the Union government were an opportunity to discuss humanitarian challenges in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states as well as the collaborative efforts of the international community and the government on disaster preparedness efforts.

In Rakhine State, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator visited camps where about 130,000 people, most of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, remain confined to deplorable conditions after almost six years of displacement.

“There’s a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” said Mueller.

She said the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State has provided an important roadmap towards a better future for all communities in Rakhine State, but its recommendations need to be implemented holistically and impartially, in the spirit that they were written.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan States. When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there’s a very real human impact,” said Mueller.

YANGON, Myanmar

A senior UN official on Sunday called on the government of Myanmar to grant humanitarian workers sustained and unfettered access to all people affected by conflicts in the country.

Ursula Mueller, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, concluded her six-day mission to the country on Sunday. She visited several conflict-torn ethnic areas of Myanmar including western Rakhine state, northern Kachin state and northeastern Shan state.

“Humanitarian access in Myanmar has significantly worsened in the past year, not only in Rakhine but also in Kachin and Shan states,” said Mueller in a statement.

“When you cut that humanitarian lifeline, there is a very real human impact,” she said.

In Rakhine’s Maungdaw Township where a military operation forced nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee cross-border to neighboring Bangladesh, she witnessed areas where villages had been burned down or bulldozed, said the statement.

“There is a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border that is affecting the world’s largest group of stateless people,” she said.

She also visited a refugee return transit site that the government is constructing in Maungdaw.

Posted

Myanmar is not ready for the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, says the most senior United Nations official to visit the country this year, after Myanmar was accused of instigating ethnic cleansing and driving nearly 700,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

Key points: Myanmar has verified several hundred Rohingya refugees for repatriation.

UN official: ""I've not seen or heard"" of preparations for refugees to return.

Myanmar has bulldozed at least 55 villages that were emptied during the violence.

""From what I've seen and heard from people — no access to health services, concerns about protection, continued displacements — conditions are not conducive to return,"" Ursula Mueller, UN's Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said after a six-day visit to Myanmar.

The Myanmar government has pledged to do its best to make sure repatriation under an agreement signed with Bangladesh in November would be ""fair, dignified and safe"".

Myanmar has so far verified several hundred Rohingya Muslim refugees for possible repatriation.

The group would be ""the first batch"" of refugees and could come back to Myanmar ""when it was convenient for them"", a Myanmar official said last month.

Ms Mueller was granted rare access in Myanmar, allowed to visit the most affected areas in Rakhine state, and met army-controlled ministers of defence and border affairs, as well as de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials.

The exodus of Rohingya Muslims followed an Aug 25 crackdown by the military in the north-western Rakhine state.

Rohingya refugees reported killings, burnings, looting and rape, in response to militant attacks on security forces.

""I asked [Myanmar officials] to end the violence … and that the return of the refugees from [Bangladeshi refugee camps in] Cox's Bazar is to be on a voluntary, dignified way, when solutions are durable,"" Ms Mueller said.

Myanmar says its forces have been engaged in a legitimate campaign against Muslim ""terrorists"".

Bangladesh officials have previously expressed doubts about Myanmar's willingness to take back Rohingya refugees.

Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years.

Myanmar set up two reception centres and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.

""We are right now at the border ready to receive, if the Bangladeshis bring them to our side,"" Kyaw Tin, Myanmar minister of international cooperation, said in January.

Many in the Buddhist-majority Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

The UN has described Myanmar's counteroffensive as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies.

Asked whether she believed in government assurances the Rohingya would be allowed to return to their homes after a temporary stay in camps, Ms Mueller said: ""I'm really concerned about the situation.""

Part of the problem is that, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch, Myanmar has bulldozed at least 55 villages that were emptied during the violence.

""I witnessed areas where villages were burned down and bulldozed … I've not seen or heard that there are any preparations for people to go to their places of origin,"" Ms Mueller said.

Myanmar officials have said the villages were bulldozed to make way for refugee resettlement.

Ms Mueller said she has also raised the issue with Myanmar officials of limited humanitarian aid access to the vulnerable people in the country and added, referring to the authorities, that she would ""push them on granting access"" for aid agencies.

The prosecutor of the international criminal court has asked it to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a possible crime against humanity.



A ruling affirming jurisdiction could pave the way for an investigation into the deportation of many thousands of Rohingya, though Myanmar is unlikely to cooperate.

As the monsoons approach, the Rohingya refugees are desperate for hope | Lisa Singh and Andrew Broad Read more

In a filing published on Monday, the court prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, listed the well-documented mistreatment of Rohingya and cited the UN special envoy for human rights who described it as bearing the “hallmarks of genocide”.

She argued that although Myanmar was not a member of the court, the fact that part of the alleged crime took place on the territory of Bangladesh, which is a member, meant the court could seek powers of jurisdiction.

“The prosecution seeks ... to verify that the court has territorial jurisdiction when persons are deported from the territory of a state which is not a party to the statute directly into the territory of a state which is a party to the Statute,” the filing says.

“This is not an abstract question but a concrete one, affecting whether the court may exercise jurisdiction ... to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute.”

Bensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favour of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established legal principles.

But she acknowledged uncertainty around the definition of the crime of deportation and limits of the court’s jurisdiction.

Her request is the first of its kind filed at the court. She asked the court to call a hearing so that her arguments could be considered, as well as those of other interested parties.

The magistrate assigned to consider the request, Congolese judge Antoine Kesia-Mbe Mindua, will have considerable leeway in determining how to proceed.

According to the United Nations, some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya fled their homes into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations has said constitutes ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar, which has a majority Buddhist population and government, rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against Rohingya who attacked government forces.

Hate speech exploded on Facebook at the start of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar last year, analysis has revealed, with experts blaming the social network for creating “chaos” in the country.

Young lives hang by a thread as past haunts Rohingya mothers Read more

Evidence of the spike emerged after the platform was accused of playing a key role in the spread of hate speech in Myanmar at a time when 650,000 Rohingya refugees were forced to flee to Bangladesh following persecution.

Digital researcher and analyst Raymond Serrato examined about 15,000 Facebook posts from supporters of the hardline nationalist Ma Ba Tha group. The earliest posts dated from June 2016 and spiked on 24 and 25 August 2017, when ARSA Rohingya militants attacked government forces, prompting the security forces to launch the “clearance operation” that sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya pouring over the border.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A graph of the posts on Facebook in Myanmar after attacks by Rohingya militants that prompted the ‘clearance operation’ Photograph: Facebook/ Ray Serrato

Serrato’s analysis showed that activity within the anti-Rohingya group, which has 55,000 members, exploded with posts registering a 200% increase in interactions.

“Facebook definitely helped certain elements of society to determine the narrative of the conflict in Myanmar,” Serrato told the Guardian. “Although Facebook had been used in the past to spread hate speech and misinformation, it took on greater potency after the attacks.”

The revelations come to light as Facebook is struggling to respond to criticism over the leaking of users’ private data and concern about the spread of fake news and hate speech on the platform.

Alan Davis, an analyst from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who led a two-year study of hate speech in Myanmar, said that in the months before August he noticed posts on Facebook becoming “more organised and odious, and more militarised”.

I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night. Alan Davis, analyst

His research team encountered fabricated stories stating that “mosques in Yangon are stockpiling weapons in an attempt to blow up various Buddhist pagodas and Shwedagon pagoda”, the most sacred Buddhist site in Yangon in a smear campaign against Muslims. These pages also featured posts calling Rohingya the derogatory term “kalars” and “Bengali terrorists”. Signs denoting “Muslim-free” areas were shared more than 11,000 times.

When the monitors working with Davis called officials about the signs, they were told the officials knew nothing about them. When he tried to fund a team of local journalists to investigate and report on them, the journalists all declined for reasons of safety.

Davis said this was the defining moment. “People just thought ‘oh well, we can just keep on doing what we do.’”

Facebook the only source of information

Among Myanmar’s 53 million residents, less than 1% had internet access in 2014. But by 2016, the country appeared to have more Facebook users than any other south Asian country. Today, more than 14 million of its citizens use Facebook. A 2016 report by GSMA, the global body representing mobile operators, found that in Myanmar many people considered Facebook the only internet entry point for information, and that many regarded postings as news.

One cyber security analyst in Yangon, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of online attacks, said: “Facebook is arguably the only source of information online for the majority in Myanmar.”

In early March, UN Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee warned that “Facebook has become a beast.” “It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,” she said.

Myanmar has agreed to a visit by the UN security council after months of resistance, but it remains unclear whether ambassadors will be allowed to go to Rakhine state, the body’s president said Monday.

A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was ramping up efforts to remove hate content and people who repeatedly violate the company’s hate-speech policies. “We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,” she said.



“We now have around 14,000 people working across community ops, online ops and our integrity efforts globally – almost double where we were a year ago – and will have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.”

On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Vox that the spread of hate speech on the platform in Myanmar was “a real issue”.

Serrato called on Facebook to be more open with its data. “Right now, we have no way of knowing which people like or share certain posts so we cannot track how disinformation or hate speech spreads on the platform.”

But Davis said the damage was done. “I think things are so far gone in Myanmar right now ... I really don’t know how Zuckerberg and co sleep at night. If they had any kind of conscience they would be pouring a good percentage of their fortunes into reversing the chaos they have created.”

Facebook has been accused of fomenting violence elsewhere in the region. In March the Sri Lankan district of Kandy was the site of mass riots and arson by Buddhist nationalist fanatics.

The Sri Lankan minister for telecommunication, Harin Fernando, told the Guardian the government ordered Facebook and other social media services to be shut down at the height of the violence. “This whole country could have been burning in hours,” Fernando told the Guardian.

19,myanmar,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Last week, after frustrated activists from Myanmar sent an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, they got something unexpected: a reply.

The activists, representing six civil society organisations, harshly criticised Zuckerberg in the letter, saying he had mischaracterised Facebook's response to violence-inciting messages in Myanmar and had not devoted sufficient resources to enforcing its hate speech rules in the violence-stricken country.

Zuckerberg wrote back to the group the next day from his personal email address, apologising for misspeaking and outlining steps that Facebook was taking to increase its moderation efforts.

Zuckerberg's email, which was provided to The New York Times by the activist groups, was the chief executive's first direct communication with the local groups that have criticised Facebook's role in the country's growing humanitarian crisis. Facebook has been accused by United Nations investigators and human rights groups of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims, a minority ethnic group, by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and false news to spread on its platform.

Facebook is a dominant source of information in Myanmar, and civil society groups have accused it of being a kind of absentee landlord, with few moderators and systems in place to keep extremists from using Facebook posts to incite violence.

In his email, Zuckerberg said Facebook had added ""dozens"" of Burmese language content reviewers to monitor reports of hate speech and had ""increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues,"" including a product team working on building tools to try to help stem the violence there.

The disagreement centres on a chain letter that spread on Facebook Messenger in Myanmar in September. The messages warned Buddhist communities of an imminent Muslim attack. Meanwhile, Muslim populations received a separate message cautioning them of violence from militant Buddhist groups.

Civil society groups say the messages paralysed major cities in Myanmar and raised fears of a violent clash. Such incitement and scaremongering have become far too typical on Facebook, according to the groups, which say Facebook has repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to devote more resources to the issues.

In an interview last week, Zuckerberg appeared to hold up the September episode as a model of Facebook's effectiveness, and said the company's systems had detected the messages and stopped them. In fact, the activists said, they flagged the messages repeatedly to Facebook, barraging its employees with strongly worded appeals until the company finally stepped in to help.

Zuckerberg's personal email did not quell the activists' frustration. The groups say the biggest obstruction to their attempts to push back against a torrent of dangerous hate speech is not their lack of resources but Facebook itself. They said Facebook had a history of pledging to do more to help quell ethnic violence in Myanmar but had not fulfilled its promises.

""It's great that he's engaging personally with this, but the stuff he's talking about is really not that much different from what they've been saying for the past few years,"" said Jes Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, an innovation lab in Myanmar that has worked with Facebook to produce localised versions of its community standards.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, confirmed the authenticity of Zuckerberg's email, and said Facebook was planning to continue engaging with the activists.

Years after civil society groups first began flagging hate speech in Myanmar, the company still has no permanent office or staff in the country and seems to be struggling to give its platform sufficient oversight.

In Germany, where hate speech laws require vigilant attention from content reviewers, Facebook has hired about 1,200 moderators. In order to achieve the same ratio of users to moderators in Myanmar, Facebook would need to have around 800 reviewers in the country, Petersen calculated.

""Dozens of content reviewers is not going to cut it,"" he said.

The civil society groups have already responded to Zuckerberg's reply, asking for hard data about Facebook's efforts in the region, including how many Burmese-speaking reviewers the company has, how many accounts the company has taken down in Myanmar and how long, on average, it takes for Facebook to respond to reports of hate speech.

""A lot of what they've been doing is cosmetic - it's not the tangible improvement we're looking for,"" said Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in Myanmar who was named in Zuckerberg's reply.

Activists in other developing countries have raised similar complaints about Facebook's behaviour. In Indonesia, politicians have called Facebook executives to account for the spread of disinformation. In the Philippines, critics of President Rodrigo Duterte have faced barrages of threatening posts. Last month, the government of Sri Lanka ordered Facebook blocked in an attempt to stem mob violence against Muslim communities.

Last month, Adam Mosseri, Facebook's News Feed head, said in an interview that he and other Facebook executives ""lose some sleep"" over the possibility that Facebook had led to real-world violence.

Petersen said he hoped Zuckerberg's appeal would spur actual change and not just expressions of worry. ""I wonder how he spent those sleepless nights - because we didn't see that much change,"" he said.

Here is the full text of Zuckerberg's email to the civil society groups, followed by the groups' response:

""Dear Htaike Htaike, Jes, Victoire, Phyu Phyu and Thant, I wanted to personally respond to your open letter. Thank you for writing it and I apologise for not being sufficiently clear about the important role that your organisations play in helping us understand and respond to Myanmar-related issues, including the September incident you referred to.

In making my remarks, my intention was to highlight how we're building artificial intelligence to help us better identify abusive, hateful or false content even before it is flagged by our community.

These improvements in technology and tools are the kinds of solutions that your organisations have called on us to implement and we are committed to doing even more. For example, we are rolling out improvements to our reporting mechanism in Messenger to make it easier to find and simpler for people to report conversations.

In addition to improving our technology and tools, we have added dozens more Burmese language reviewers to handle reports from users across all our services. We have also increased the number of people across the company on Myanmar-related issues and we now have a special product team working to better understand the specific local challenges and build the right tools to help keep people there safe.

There are several other improvements we have made or are making, and I have directed my teams to ensure we are doing all we can to get your feedback and keep you informed.

We are grateful for your support as we map out our ongoing work in Myanmar, and we are committed to working with you to find more ways to be responsive to these important issues.""

The civil society groups' response.

The half-dozen signatories of the response include Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country; the Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity.

""Dear Mark, Thank you for responding to our letter from your personal email account. It means a lot.

We also appreciate your reiteration of the steps Facebook has taken and intends to take to improve your performance in Myanmar.

This doesn't change our core belief that your proposed improvements are nowhere near enough to ensure that Myanmar users are provided with the same standards of care as users in the US or Europe.

When things go wrong in Myanmar, the consequences can be really serious - potentially disastrous. You have yourself publicly acknowledged the risk of the platform being abused towards real harm.

Like many discussions we have had with your policy team previously, your email focuses on inputs. We care about performance, progress and positive outcomes.

In the spirit of transparency, we would greatly appreciate if you could provide us with the following indicators, starting with the month of March 2018:

- How many reports of abuse have you received?

- What per cent of reported abuses did your team ultimately remove due to violations of the community standards?

- How many accounts were behind flagging the reports received?

- What was the average time it took for your review team to provide a final response to users of the reports they have raised? What percent of the reports received took more than 48 hours to receive a review?

- Do you have a target for review times? Data from our own monitoring suggests that you might have an internal standard for review - with most reported posts being reviewed shortly after the 48 hrs mark. Is this accurate?

- How many fake accounts did you identify and remove?

- How many accounts did you subject to a temporary ban? How many did you ban from the platform?

Improved performance comes with investments and we would also like to ask for more clarifications around these. Most importantly, we would like to know: - How many Myanmar speaking reviewers did you have, in total, as of March 2018? How many do you expect to have by the end of the year? We are specifically interested in reviewers working on the Facebook service and looking for full-time equivalents figure.

- What mechanisms do you have in place for stopping repeat offenders in Myanmar? We know for a fact that fake accounts remain a key issue and that individuals who were found to violate the community standards on a number of occasions continue to have a presence on the platform.

- What steps have you taken to date to address the duplicate posts issue we raised in the briefing we provided your team in December 2017?

We're enclosing our December briefing for your reference, as it further elaborates on the challenges we have been trying to work through with Facebook.""","Criticised for ignoring violence in Myanmar, Zuckerberg steps in",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/criticised-for-ignoring-violence-in-myanmar-zuckerberg-steps-in
20,myanmar,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar is not ready for the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, said the most senior United Nations official to visit the country this year, after Myanmar was accused of instigating ethnic cleansing and driving nearly 700,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

“From what I’ve seen and heard from people – no access to health services, concerns about protection, continued displacements – conditions are not conducive to return,” Ursula Mueller, U.N.’s Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said after a six-day visit to Myanmar.

A Myanmar government spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Mueller’s remarks.

The Myanmar government has previously pledged to do its best to make sure repatriation under an agreement signed with Bangladesh in November would be “fair, dignified and safe”.

Myanmar has so far verified several hundred Rohingya Muslim refugees for possible repatriation. The group would be “the first batch” of refugees and could come back to Myanmar “when it was convenient for them,” a Myanmar official said last month.

Mueller was granted rare access in Myanmar, allowed to visit the most affected areas in Rakhine state, and met army-controlled ministers of defense and border affairs, as well as de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials.

The exodus of Rohingya Muslims followed an Aug. 25 crackdown by the military in the northwestern Rakhine state. Rohingya refugees reported killings, burnings, looting and rape, in response to militant attacks on security forces.

“I asked (Myanmar officials) to end the violence … and that the return of the refugees from (Bangladeshi refugee camps in) Cox’s Bazar is to be on a voluntary, dignified way, when solutions are durable,” Mueller told Reuters in an interview in Myanmar’s largest city Yangon.

Myanmar says its forces have been engaged in a legitimate campaign against Muslim “terrorists”.

Bangladesh officials have previously expressed doubts about Myanmar’s willingness to take back Rohingya refugees.

Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar set up two reception centers and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.

“We are right now at the border ready to receive, if the Bangladeshis bring them to our side,” Kyaw Tin, Myanmar minister of international cooperation, told reporters in January.

Many in the Buddhist-majority Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The U.N. has described Myanmar’s counteroffensive as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies.

Asked whether she believed in government assurances the Rohingya would be allowed to return to their homes after a temporary stay in camps, Mueller said: “I’m really concerned about the situation.”

Part of the problem is that, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch, Myanmar has bulldozed at least 55 villages that were emptied during the violence.

“I witnessed areas where villages were burned down and bulldozed...I’ve not seen or heard that there are any preparations for people to go to their places of origin,” Mueller said.

Myanmar officials have said the villages were bulldozed to make way for refugee resettlement.

Mueller said she has also raised the issue with Myanmar officials of limited humanitarian aid access to the vulnerable people in the country and added, referring to the authorities, that she would “push them on granting access” for aid agencies.",Myanmar not ready for return of Rohingya refugees - UN official,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-un/myanmar-not-ready-for-return-of-rohingya-refugees-un-official-idUSKBN1HF04M
