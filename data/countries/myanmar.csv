0,myanmar,"MYITKYINA, Myanmar — As the Myanmar army’s bombs started falling near her home in Kachin state, Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbours decided they had no choice but to grab what they could and scatter into the jungle.

“We were in so much trouble, I couldn’t even swallow my food,” the 92-year-old recalled. “If we stayed in the village, we didn’t know what could happen to us.”

She climbed onto her grandson’s back and he carried her to a river where she and nearly 800 other villagers boarded boats to reach the state capital, part of a wave of 6,800 people who have fled their homes in Kachin since a fresh government offensive began in early April.

The onslaught is part of a decades-long government campaign to defeat Kachin rebels fighting for greater autonomy for the largely Christian minority group in Myanmar’s far north. The intensified offensive has renewed accusations that the army is creating a similar humanitarian crisis in Kachin to the one spawned by its violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country’s west.

“What we are seeing in Kachin state over the past few weeks is wholly unacceptable, and must stop immediately,” Yanghee Lee, the U.N.’s human rights expert for Myanmar, said last week. “Innocent civilians are being killed and injured, and hundreds of families are now fleeing for their lives.”

“All parties must take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security,” she said.

A 17-year cease-fire between the government and Kachin Independence Army was broken in 2011, when the army entered rebel territory and attacked one of their outposts. Since then, sporadic fierce combat has uprooted villagers and left hundreds of civilians dead.

The fresh exodus of villagers is adding to the 100,000 people previously displaced in Kachin and neighbouring Shan state, many of whom live in camps where people already have difficulty obtaining food and clean water due to military restrictions on aid.

Gumsha Awng of the Joint Strategy Team for Humanitarian response, a coalition of humanitarian groups in Kachin, said the army has been blocking international aid shipments to the region, a similar tactic it used with the Rohingya.

The government has denied virtually all access to the area for the United Nations and international humanitarian groups.

Those fleeing their rural villages try to seek the relative safety of the state capital, Myitkyina, which is under government control, or rebel-held cities where they can seek aid from church groups. Some who have fled, however, have found themselves stuck in a jungle no man’s land unable to find a safe route out of the war zone.

One group of 2,000 villagers has been trapped in the jungle since mid-April without proper food, water, shelter and medical care, unable to get through army roadblocks to safer refuge.

Lamai Gum Ja of the Peace Talk Creation Group, comprising Kachin notables who attempt to mediate between the community and the army, said the military is intentionally blocking civilians from being rescued because they accuse them of having connections to the rebels.

Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the government has been helping with food, shelter and medical supplies and is working to “rescue any trapped civilians.”

“We are hearing that the Kachin rebels have been pretending they’re civilians and that’s why we have to verify the civilians very carefully,” he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

There were hopes when Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government took power in 2016 that there might be a greater chance for peace. But Kachin support for Suu Kyi and her party has so far failed to pay any dividends, with the military still flexing its constitutionally ensured powers over security and border affairs.

Thousands of Kachins rallied in Myitkyina last week to demand humanitarian relief for those stuck in the jungles, and on Friday the central government-appointed state minister, Hkyet Awng, joined community leaders in a march to attempt to reach one group of trapped civilians. The military stopped them.

“Stopping the minister and Christian leaders from rescuing those civilians shows that the army is more powerful than the civilian government,” said Lagang Zegyung, a lawmaker representing Kachin state. “The army controls everything, especially in the ethnic regions, which makes it almost impossible for us to help civilians in the conflict zone.”

For those who do eventually reach safety, they often end up in church halls like the one at Trinity Baptist Church just outside Myitkyina. That’s where Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbours ended up after their escape by boat.

“Our small church is hosting nearly 800 people who had fled from their village and now the church is overcrowded with the elderly, children, pregnant women, widows and disabled people,” said La Hkawng, a church pastor.

He said they are providing food and shelter and what medical care they can. But some of the wounds are unseen.

Heavily pregnant Htu Hkam Ndu said her two young children are traumatized by the fighting.

“My children are even scared of planes flying around, any kind of planes,” she said. “My children keep telling me to flee every time they heard the sound of a plane flying. That’s why when these children grow up, they will always remember what happened.”",Crisis in Myanmar's Kachin means jungle treks to escape war,http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crisis-in-myanmars-kachin-means-jungle-treks-to-escape-war

BANGKOK (AP)  Community leaders from the Christian ethnic Kachin community have called for urgent medical attention for about 2,000 civilians, including pregnant women and the elderly, trapped in the jungle where they fled to escape clashes between the Myanmar's army and the Kachin guerrillas in the country's north.

The latest fighting in Kachin state's Tanai region  an area known for amber and gold mining  began in early April with government shelling and airstrikes in response to threats by the rebel Kachin Independence Army to retake lost territory.

The Rev. Mung Dan, a Baptist community leader, said Wednesday the civilians trapped without medicine or sufficient food include five pregnant women, two women who just gave birth, 93 old people, and other villagers wounded by mortar shelling. They are ""in dire need of medical treatment as well as rations,"" he said by phone.

""Even today, it's been raining the whole day in our region and these civilians do not have any shelter yet and they are suffering from sickness as well,"" he added.

A non-governmental organization based in Kachin state has sent an open letter to the Kachin State Minister on Wednesday, asking for the permission to rescue civilians but the permission has not been granted yet.

""We have been asking permission to rescue people who are trapped in the jungle and they are in a very critical condition,"" said Awng Ja, a member of Kachin State Women Network, which helps displaced women. ""But the state minister said only if the military granted us access, we can rescue these civilians.""

Rights and aids groups said the Myanmar government and the military have dramatically increased restrictions on humanitarian assistance to some 100,000 displaced people. The government has denied virtually denied all access for the United Nations and other international humanitarian groups.

Some civilian have already been killed by the government's offensive, the Kachin say.

""At least three civilians were killed by the army's mortar shells and airstrikes in three different places since April 11,"" said Naw Bu, the head of the information department of the Kachin Independence Organization, the political organization to which the Kachin Independence Army is affiliated.

The Kachin Independence Army, like other ethnic minority armed groups, has been fighting on and off for decades against the central government for greater autonomy. Combat between the Kachin rebels and the government military resumed in 2011, ending a 17-year ceasefire agreement. The clashes have left hundreds dead and more than 100,000 civilians displaced.

Myanmar's military has long been accused of grave human rights violations against ethnic minority groups in different parts of the country.

Most recently, it has been accused of abuses against the Muslim ethnic Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine that critics say amounts to ""ethnic cleansing,"" as violent counter-insurgency sweeps by the army helped drive about 700,000 Rohingya across the border to neighboring Bangladesh, where they stay in refugee camps.","2,000 Kachin trapped by Myanmar fighting lack food, medicine",http://www.tampabay.com/-kachin-trapped-by-myanmar-fighting-lack-food-medicine-ap_world7fbe9173fe9b47a4b2449797997160b2

• During the month of April, increased fighting in Kachin State displaced an estimated 5000 civilians.

• Access to people in need in conflict-affected areas remains extremely challenging.

• Between 24-26 April, UNICEF delivered 3,601 hygiene kits benefitting over 20,600 people in Muslim, Rakhine and Hindu communities in Maungdaw District.

• UNICEF is working with interagency colleagues to update the preparedness and response planning for the upcoming cyclone season with a focus on Rakhine State.

• UNICEF Myanmar received generous funding support from Denmark, Japan and the United States; however, significant funding gap of US$ 19 million remains. Without additional funds, UNICEF will not be able to address the essential needs of children, women and men across parts of Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Rakhine

UNICEF remains concerned about the conditions of crowded IDP camps in central Rakhine where 129,000 people remain reliant on humanitarian assistance. UNICEF clusters/sectors are working with the CCCM/Shelter/NFI clusters to identify actions that—with appropriate funding—can be quickly taken to improve living conditions in IDP camps. The camps, erected in 2012, were constructed based on technical guidelines provided by the Government of Myanmar. Agencies note that space allotments in camps are inadequate, leading to overcrowding of houses, people, and social service points. Current concerns include the need for rehabilitation or reconstruction of shelters, access pathways within the camps, and improvements to WASH and education facilities. Addressing some of the identified challenges willrequire additional allocations of land by the government as the current space is not sufficient for implementation of the proposed solutions. However, improved access to livelihoods opportunities for IDPs, as well as increased access for humanitarian service providers, would also lead to improvement in camp conditions.

In Maungdaw District—comprised of Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships—accurate figures of the population of Rakhine and ethnic minorities are still unavailable. UNICEF does not have access or permission from the Government of Myanmar to conduct basic needs assessments. Access constraints for UNICEF —particularly international staff—remain the biggest hurdle to assessments, implementation, and programme monitoring. Currently,travel authorization—which takes approximately two weeks to process—when granted, is valid for only a two-week period. The constant reapplication process, in addition to significant requests for information on activities, hampers effective response activities. Working through local partners, UNICEF continues to provide basic health, nutrition, WASH and child protection services in Maungdaw District where possible.

Kachin and Shan

Throughout April, armed clashes between the Myanmar military forces and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) escalated affecting Tanai, Hpakant, Sumprabum, Moegaung and Momauk townships as well as Laiza. Intense fighting continued with aerial bombings and use of heavy artillery. UNICEF field staff estimate that an additional 3,500 people have been displaced including over 1,000 people who are sheltering in a nearby forest. Local organizations including church groups, civil society groups and NGOs are advocating with the Kachin State Government and Myanmar military for evacuation of trapped and displaced people. Access to active conflict areas remains extremely difficult for UNICEF staff and international partners, as well as Myanmar NGOs. Outside the areas of active conflict, national staff and national partners have access and provide basic humanitarian services to those most in need.

UNICEF also remains extremely concerned about the situation in northern Shan State. Armed clashes in March and April were reported in Namtu, Hseinni, Kutkai and Manton with additional landmine cases reported in Kyaukme and Hsipaw townships. Furthermore, there has been a recent increase in military presence in Kokang, Special Administrative Zone. In Shan, displacement patterns show many people flee areas of fighting for several days seeking shelter in monasteries, churches or neighbouring villages and return home within a period of weeks. Throughout Shan, the Government and local partners have been providing support to those displaced. Should the fighting be sustained and lead to prolonged displacement, additional assistance will likely be required. Access to newlyaffected areas remains restricted due to insecurity.",UNICEF Myanmar Humanitarian Situation Report - 4 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-4-may-2018

6,myanmar,"Yangon: Myanmar's government said it has repatriated the first family of Rohingya out of some 7,00,000 refugees who fled to Bangladesh to escape a brutal military campaign, despite UN warnings that a safe return is not yet possible.

The stateless Muslim minority has been massing in squalid Bangladesh camps since the Myanmar army launched a ruthless crackdown on the community in northern Rakhine state last August.

The UN says the campaign amounts to ethnic cleansing, but Myanmar has denied the charge, saying its troops targeted Rohingya militants.

Bangladesh and Myanmar were supposed to begin repatriation in January but the plan has been repeatedly delayed as both sides blame the other for a lack of preparation.

According to a Myanmar government statement posted late on Saturday, one family of Rohingya refugees became the first to return earlier in the day.

""The five members of a family... came back to Taungpyoletwei town repatriation camp in Rakhine state this morning,"" said a statement posted on the official Facebook page of the government's Information Committee.

Authorities determined ""whether they were once living here or not"" and provided the family with National Verification Cards, a form of ID that falls short of citizenship and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders who want full rights.

Photos posted alongside the statement showed one man, two women, a young girl and a boy receiving the ID cards and getting health checks.

It said that the family had been sent to stay ""temporarily"" with relatives in Maungdaw town.

The post did not mention any plans for further returnees in the near future.

The move comes despite warnings from the UN and other rights groups that a mass repatriation of Rohingya would be premature, as Myanmar as yet to address the systematic legal discrimination and persecution the minority has faced for decades.

On Saturday, the UN's refugee agency said in a statement that conditions ""are not yet conducive for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of refugees"".

The Rohingya are reviled by many in the Buddhist-majority country, where they are branded as illegal ""Bengali"" immigrants from Bangladesh, despite their long roots in Rakhine state.","Myanmar refugee crisis: First among 7,00,000 Rohingya families who fled to Bangladesh repatriated, says govt",https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-refugee-crisis-first-among-700000-rohingya-families-who-fled-to-bangladesh-repatriated-says-govt-4432219.html
7,myanmar,"Dhaka: Islamic foreign ministers on Sunday launched a campaign to mobilise international support for action against Myanmar over the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials said.

Foreign ministers and diplomats of the 53-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) set up a campaign committee during two days of talks in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka.

OIC secretary-general Yousef bin Ahmed Al-Othaimeen called the move a key step toward ending a crisis caused by the exodus of about 7,00,000 Muslim Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar into camps in Bangladesh.

He said the new committee would ""mobilise and coordinate international political support for accountability for human rights violations against the Rohingya community.""

""This is very important. This is one of the concrete steps that has been taken to alleviate the problem for our (Rohingya) brothers and sisters,"" he said.

A military campaign launched in Myanmar's Rakhine state in August last year set off the massive influx of the Muslim minority into Bangladesh where they joined 3,00,000 refugees already living in squalid camps following previous violence.

The United Nations and the United States have said the crackdown amounted to ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar army has said it only targeted militants.

Rohingya civilians have told of murders and rapes as they fled. They say the army burned hundreds of Rohingya villages to the ground.

Al-Othaimeen said Muslim nations had to ""pressure the international community"".

""This is not religious, this is human basic rights of our brothers and sisters in the last 50 years,"" he said.

The International Criminal Court prosecutor has already called for the tribunal to rule on whether it can investigate the allegations of mass rape and killings.

Bangladesh has put huge diplomatic effort into pressuring Myanmar to take back the refugees in safety.

The two nations signed a repatriation deal in November, but nobody has since returned.

The Rohingya have been persecuted for decades in Myanmar, where they are regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.

Last month a UN Security Council delegation visiting the camps called for the safe return of the Rohingya and an end to discrimination against them.

Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland also called for ""accountability"" when she toured the Rohingya camps this week.

The plight of Rohingya people in Rakhine state has received much international attention, following an exodus of more than 700,000 people to neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown last August.

An estimated 500,000 Rohingya people remaining behind in Myanmar are in need of humanitarian relief.

Human rights abuses and conflict in Kachin and the northern Shan states have also ramped up.

Since early April, an estimated 5000 people in the northern Kachin state have fled their homes because of intensified fighting between the military and rebels.

""The Australian government calls on all parties to end the fighting, protect civilian populations, and allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to affected communities,"" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.

Ms Bishop said the $13 million would go to aid groups such as Save the Children and the UN's refugee agency to help provide health care, shelter and schooling in Rakhine state.

Save the Children will receive $1 million to train teachers and expand an existing education program in Rakhine state which works with displaced kids.

In Kachin and Shan states Australia's support would help protect families fleeing violence.

Last week, Ms Bishop announced an extra $15 million of assistance for the Rohingya refugee camps at Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

YANGON – Fighting between Myanmar forces and a rebel group in the remote northeast could escalate, a spokesman of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) told Reuters on Friday, worsening a humanitarian crisis that has displaced more than 4,000 people.

One of Myanmar's most powerful rebel groups, the KIA has regularly clashed with government troops in the mountainous region bordering China and India since 2011, when a 17-year-old ceasefire broke down.

Since early April, the conflict has escalated, driving more than 4,000 people from their homes, civil society groups based in Kachin have said.

Clashes have been reported in half of the 18 townships in the region, where the Myanmar military has sent about 2,000 infantry troops, fighter aircraft and helicopters to combat KIA forces, said the spokesman, Col Naw Bu.

""The army is sending more troops from the lower part of Myanmar and that's why the fighting will be more intense,"" he said.

""The number of refugees could increase and they could suffer more challenges,"" he added, calling the clashes ""the worst conflict"" since Kachin soldiers started fighting the government in the early 1960s.

He declined to give details of the casualties sustained by the KIA or its military deployment.

Myanmar's military and civilian government officials did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.

Aid groups have urged the government to allow access to the village of Aung Lawt, where about 2,000 people have been trapped in a remote forest with no access to humanitarian aid for two weeks.

""The longer it takes, the more challenging it is for them. And most of the people are elderly, women and children,"" said Gum Sha Aung, an official of a coalition of Kachin-based humanitarian groups.

The United States embassy in Yangon said it was ""deeply concerned"" about intensified fighting in Kachin.

In a Twitter message on Friday, it urged the government and military to ""protect civilian populations and allow humanitarian assistance"" to those affected by the recent conflicts.

A coalition of 32 groups in Kachin this week urged the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the international criminal court, citing recent deaths and displacement of civilians in Myanmar army operations.

""Women, children, elderly people forced to flee their homes because of the relentless fighting in Kachin,"" Mark Cutts, the head of a U.N. agency coordinating humanitarian affairs in Myanmar, said in a Twitter message on Thursday.

""Local humanitarian organizations doing outstanding work trying to help. But when will this decades-old conflict end?""

Reaching a comprehensive peace deal with Myanmar's ethnic minorities has been leader Aung San Suu Kyi's stated top priority, but the Buddhist-majority country has seen the worst fighting with rebels in years since she took office in 2016.

Ending the civil war, eclipsed in media coverage by the plight of nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, is key to further development of the resource-rich country.

10,myanmar,"MYITKYINA, Myanmar – As the Myanmar army’s bombs started falling near her home in Kachin state, Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbours decided they had no choice but to grab what they could and scatter into the jungle.

“We were in so much trouble, I couldn’t even swallow my food,” the 92-year-old recalled. “If we stayed in the village, we didn’t know what could happen to us.”

She climbed onto her grandson’s back and he carried her to a river where she and nearly 800 other villagers boarded boats to reach the state capital, part of a wave of 6,800 people who have fled their homes in Kachin since a fresh government offensive began in early April.

The onslaught is part of a decades-long government campaign to defeat Kachin rebels fighting for greater autonomy for the largely Christian minority group in Myanmar’s far north. The intensified offensive has renewed accusations that the army is creating a similar humanitarian crisis in Kachin to the one spawned by its violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country’s west.

“What we are seeing in Kachin state over the past few weeks is wholly unacceptable, and must stop immediately,” Yanghee Lee, the U.N.’s human rights expert for Myanmar, said last week. “Innocent civilians are being killed and injured, and hundreds of families are now fleeing for their lives.”

“All parties must take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security,” she said.

A 17-year cease-fire between the government and Kachin Independence Army was broken in 2011, when the army entered rebel territory and attacked one of their outposts. Since then, sporadic fierce combat has uprooted villagers and left hundreds of civilians dead.

The fresh exodus of villagers is adding to the 100,000 people previously displaced in Kachin and neighbouring Shan state, many of whom live in camps where people already have difficulty obtaining food and clean water due to military restrictions on aid.

Gumsha Awng of the Joint Strategy Team for Humanitarian response, a coalition of humanitarian groups in Kachin, said the army has been blocking international aid shipments to the region, a similar tactic it used with the Rohingya.

The government has denied virtually all access to the area for the United Nations and international humanitarian groups.

Those fleeing their rural villages try to seek the relative safety of the state capital, Myitkyina, which is under government control, or rebel-held cities where they can seek aid from church groups. Some who have fled, however, have found themselves stuck in a jungle no man’s land unable to find a safe route out of the war zone.

One group of 2,000 villagers has been trapped in the jungle since mid-April without proper food, water, shelter and medical care, unable to get through army roadblocks to safer refuge.

Lamai Gum Ja of the Peace Talk Creation Group, comprising Kachin notables who attempt to mediate between the community and the army, said the military is intentionally blocking civilians from being rescued because they accuse them of having connections to the rebels.

Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the government has been helping with food, shelter and medical supplies and is working to “rescue any trapped civilians.”

“We are hearing that the Kachin rebels have been pretending they’re civilians and that’s why we have to verify the civilians very carefully,” he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

There were hopes when Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government took power in 2016 that there might be a greater chance for peace. But Kachin support for Suu Kyi and her party has so far failed to pay any dividends, with the military still flexing its constitutionally ensured powers over security and border affairs.

Thousands of Kachins rallied in Myitkyina last week to demand humanitarian relief for those stuck in the jungles, and on Friday the central government-appointed state minister, Hkyet Awng, joined community leaders in a march to attempt to reach one group of trapped civilians. The military stopped them.

“Stopping the minister and Christian leaders from rescuing those civilians shows that the army is more powerful than the civilian government,” said Lagang Zegyung, a lawmaker representing Kachin state. “The army controls everything, especially in the ethnic regions, which makes it almost impossible for us to help civilians in the conflict zone.”

For those who do eventually reach safety, they often end up in church halls like the one at Trinity Baptist Church just outside Myitkyina. That’s where Nlam Numrang Doi and her neighbours ended up after their escape by boat.

“Our small church is hosting nearly 800 people who had fled from their village and now the church is overcrowded with the elderly, children, pregnant women, widows and disabled people,” said La Hkawng, a church pastor.

He said they are providing food and shelter and what medical care they can. But some of the wounds are unseen.

Heavily pregnant Htu Hkam Ndu said her two young children are traumatized by the fighting.

“My children are even scared of planes flying around, any kind of planes,” she said. “My children keep telling me to flee every time they heard the sound of a plane flying. That’s why when these children grow up, they will always remember what happened.”",Crisis in Myanmar's Kachin means jungle treks to escape war,http://www.news1130.com/2018/05/08/crisis-in-myanmars-kachin-means-jungle-treks-to-escape-war/

Despite initial resistance by China to the Security Council pressing Myanmar on accountability, the 15-member body reached consensus agreement on the British-drafted statement.

The move follows a visit by Council envoys to Bangladesh and Myanmar last week to see firsthand the aftermath of a Myanmar military crackdown that Britain, the United States and others have denounced as ethnic cleansing of the minority Rohingya. Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing.

Fleeing refugees have reported killings, rapes and arson on a large scale. Myanmar has said its operations in Rakhine were a legitimate response to attacks on security forces by Rohingya insurgents.

“The members of the Security Council in light of the importance of undertaking transparent investigations into allegations of human rights abuses and violations, urge the government of Myanmar to fulfill, based on respect for the rule of law, its stated commitment to holding accountable perpetrators of violence, including sexual violence and abuse and violence against children,” the council statement said.

Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts in Rakhine in August last year sparked a military operation that has sent nearly 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. Security Council envoys visited those vast camps last week.

The statement said they “were struck by the scale of the humanitarian crisis and remain gravely concerned by the current situation.” They also noted the “widespread destruction of villages” in Rakhine.

They also met with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and traveled to Rakhine state, where the violence erupted.

The council urged Myanmar to conclude an agreement “in the coming days” with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and U.N. Development Programme on aid access in Rakhine and help with repatriating refugees from Bangladesh.

The Security Council also said it intends to discuss how it can work with Bangladesh, Myanmar and the United Nations “to resolve the crisis and create the conditions allowing the safe, voluntary, and dignified repatriation of refugees to their homes in Rakhine State.”

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has asked the court to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingyas to Bangladesh, a possible crime against humanity.

Suu Kyi’s government has expressed “serious concern” over the move at the ICC. Bangladesh is a member of the ICC but Myanmar is not. Human rights groups have called on the U.N.

13,myanmar,"By THOMAS KEAN | FRONTIER

SINGAPORE — Former Indonesian foreign minister Mr Marty Natalegawa has called on ASEAN to take a stronger stand on Rakhine State and “go beyond the humanitarian dimension” of the crisis.

More than 750,000 Muslims have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since October 2016 following brutal Tatmadaw “clearance operations” launched in response to attacks by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

Natalegawa said the 10-member bloc could play an important bridging role between the Myanmar government and international community on Rakhine State, as it did 10 years ago in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, when Myanmar initially refused to allow international aid into the country.

But ASEAN’s role in Rakhine State must go beyond just a humanitarian response, Natalegawa said, suggesting that it should also address the human rights issues that underpin the crisis.

“I hope that ASEAN in the immediate future can develop an outlook beyond the humanitarian dimension but for that to occur Myanmar’s trust must be earned,” Natalegawa, who served as foreign minister from 2009 to 2014, told journalists at the ASEAN Media Forum in Singapore on May 4.

“What worries me now on the situation in Rakhine State, is that apart from the humanitarian dimension … ASEAN hasn’t provided a bridging situation. In fact ASEAN itself has been divided.”

In September 2017, Malaysia disassociated itself from the ASEAN Chairman’s statement on the humanitarian situation in Rakhine State, describing it as “a misrepresentation of the reality of the situation” and complaining that it had omitted the term Rohingya.

The majority of the Muslim community in Rakhine State identifies as Rohingya, but the Myanmar government refuses to accept the term, instead describing them as Bengalis or Muslims from Rakhine State.

Last month, ASEAN leaders expressed support for the government’s “efforts to bring peace, stability, the rule of law, to promote harmony and reconciliation among the various communities, as well as to ensure sustainable and equitable development in Rakhine State”.

The ASEAN Summit chairman’s statement did not mention “Rohingya” and framed the bloc’s role in the context of its humanitarian relief efforts, which are being conducted through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management.

Since then the Myanmar government has engaged with a visiting United Nations Security Council delegation, suggesting that it would prefer to work with at least some parts of the UN on Rakhine State instead of ASEAN. Following the delegation’s visit, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s office said the government was discussing a memorandum of understanding with two UN agencies to work together “for the good for all people in Rakhine”.

Natalegawa said that in the past ASEAN has been able to “speak with one voice on Myanmar” but at the same time privately push the country’s leaders to undertaken reforms and address international concerns on human rights.

When Indonesia held a seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2007 it abstained from a vote on Myanmar’s human rights record that was vetoed by Russia and China.

He said that in the wake of that vote Indonesia and other ASEAN countries took the lead on “cajoling” Myanmar to implement political reforms under its seven-step roadmap to democracy.

“Now this is where we are in need of this type of leadership within ASEAN on the Rohingya issue,” he said.

“We had the Nargis case, the democratisation process; ASEAN was always there together with Myanmar. It’s only now that we are beginning to see schism and our ability to speak with one voice is limited to only one dimension.”",ASEAN must go further than aid on Rakhine State: Marty Natalegawa,https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/asean-must-go-further-than-aid-on-rakhine-state-marty-natalegawa
14,myanmar,"Human Rights Watch yesterday said the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should immediately refer the situation in Myanmar, including the widespread and systematic abuses against ethnic Rohingya, to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

During the first week of May, senior diplomats from the 15-member Security Council visited refugee camps in Bangladesh to see the firsthand situation of more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar military abuses since August 2017, adding to an estimated 200,000 Rohingya refugees who fled previous violence.

Read More Rohingya Deportation: ICC seeks opinion of Bangladesh over jurisdiction

The diplomats pledged to take action on their return to New York. British Ambassador Karen Pierce said all council members considered the Rohingya issue to be ""one of the most significant human rights cases that we have ever faced in the last decade and that something needs to be done"" according to a report published by HRW yesterday.

""Now that the Security Council has heard directly from Rohingya refugees about the horrors inflicted by Myanmar's army... the need to hold those responsible to account should be clear,"" said Param-Preet Singh, associate international justice director.

""Myanmar's repeated and implausible denials of responsibility for atrocities and its longstanding culture of impunity mean that the International Criminal Court is the only real hope for victims to see justice"" Param-Preet also said.

During their four-day visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh, the council members met humanitarian agencies, civil society groups, parliamentarians, and military and government officials, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Myanmar's de-facto civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and Myanmar military commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing

While acknowledging a possible ICC referral, UK Ambassador Pierce told reporters that Aung San Suu Kyi assured the council members that if evidence of violations was provided to her, the Myanmar authorities would undertake a ""proper investigation.""

However, the Myanmar government has long been provided with evidence by Human Rights Watch and other international monitors and has taken no genuine action to impartially investigate the full range of abuses committed against the Rohingya.

For more than a year, the Myanmar government refused to allow access to the UN Fact-Finding Mission, created by the Human Rights Council (HRC) to ""establish the facts and circumstances"" of alleged security force violations.

It also barred Yanghee Lee, the UN-appointed human rights expert on Myanmar, from entering the country after she publicly reported on military abuses.

The government and military have dismissed voluminous reports from the UN, human rights groups, and the media on killings, rape, and burnings of Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine State. In November, an army ""investigation team"" said that at least 376 ""terrorists"" were killed during fighting but found ""no deaths of innocent people.""

While there has been no civilian-led investigation into the post-August 2017 violence, the National Investigation Commission on Rakhine State, established to investigate the violence against the Rohingya in October and November 2016, and headed by Vice President Myint Swe, concluded contrary to the evidence that there was ""no possibility of crimes against humanity, no evidence of ethnic cleansing, as per UN accusations.""

Myanmar authorities have convicted soldiers in only one case in Rakhine State for abuses committed after August 25, sentencing seven soldiers in April to 10 years in prison for their role in the massacre of 10 Rohingya in Inn Din village.

Two Reuters journalists who investigated the massacre were detained and face up to 14 years' imprisonment under the Official Secrets Act.

""By rejecting out of hand detailed accounts of atrocities, Myanmar's government has shown it has zero intention of addressing the terrible crimes against the Rohingya. Security Council members should not repeat empty promises by government officials that they will investigate abuses. This is a textbook case for referral to the ICC, which was created to act when governments refuse to do so,"" Singh said.

Under the Rome Statute of the ICC, the court can only act when a state is ""unwilling or unable"" to investigate or prosecute grave crimes in violation of international law.

Because Myanmar is neither a party to the ICC nor has accepted the court's jurisdiction, the Security Council needs to refer the situation to the court. In April, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda asked the court to rule on whether the ICC ""can exercise jurisdiction over the alleged deportation of the Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh,"" which is a party to the ICC.

The Security Council should refer the situation in Myanmar to the ICC immediately and not await a court ruling on the crime of deportation, which would not include other crimes against humanity, namely murder, rape, torture, and persecution.

The council should act on the secretary-general's September 2017 call that ""the international community has a responsibility to undertake concerted efforts to prevent further escalation of the crisis.""

Primarily because of objections from China and Russia, the council has adopted just a single Presidential Statement on the issue, in November. It last met to discuss the crisis in February.

Global concern with the Security Council's inaction on Myanmar has been rising. In February, Sweden's UN ambassador said, ""If the Myanmar authorities do not genuinely address the issue of accountability, help from the international community should be sought, including considering referral to the International Criminal Court.""

In May, after visiting a Rohingya camp, an assistant secretary general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), said that the council's ""powerful members had enough room to play, but failed to do that.""

Liechtenstein's UN ambassador publicly expressed his hope that council members would return from their Myanmar visit with a renewed sense of duty to take action, including an ICC referral.

A former Malaysian foreign minister who had been the OIC's special envoy to Myanmar until 2017 said he was disappointed with the talks between the council and Myanmar: ""They say that they will help Myanmar to investigate. Myanmar is the perpetrator of the crime. How can you want Myanmar to investigate? It must be an independent body.""

""The UK and others should stop wringing their hands and put forward a resolution referring Myanmar to the ICC,"" Singh said. ""Security Council members should stop deferring to China and Russia and make the victims of atrocities the top priority.""",UNSC should refer Myanmar to ICC: HRW,https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-crisis/human-rights-watch-said-united-nations-security-council-should-refer-myanmar-to-international-criminal-court-icc-1573762

What is the Rohingya crisis?

Rohingya Muslims are an ethnic group that make up a large minority of the population of Myanmar, also known as Burma.

They have been consistently and systematically persecuted over the years of a military dictatorship in the former British colony from 1962-2015, when democratic activist and longtime political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi became the defacto head of state.

Since taking office, further large waves of desperate Rohingya refugees have been fleeing the predominantly Buddhist country amid reports of state persecution and violence.

Whole villages have been burned down and families driven from their homes.

The heartbreaking sight of a boy desperate for aid as he cries and climbs on a truck distributing aid for a local NGO near the Balukali refugee camp

Rohingya have been classed as illegal immigrants in the country and have been denied civil rights.

Their treatment has been described by the UN as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".

The latest mass exodus was sparked by a brutal crackdown last summer after Rohingya militants attacked police posts, killing 12.

Amnesty International said that in response, Rohingya were subjected to a ""targeted campaign of widespread and systematic murder, rape and burning"".

There are now thought to be nearly a million Rohingya refugees who have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh — and more than 1,000 are thought to have been killed.

The UK said in May 2018 it would pledge £70million in aid ahead on the monsoon season, which is part of £129m in contributions the UK has made since August 2017 and will focus on providing materials to strengthen their shelters and help with food and water as well as heathcare services.

What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about the crisis?

Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and had been hailed as the saviour of Myanmar after decades of repressive military rule.

An Oxford graduate, she was feted in the West and given dozens of awards and accolades in solidarity with her campaign for democracy while she was under house arrest for much of the time between 1989 and 2010.

But she was finally given power after the 2015 elections which saw her National League For Democracy party win 86 per cent of the parliamentary seats.

Although she was prohibited from becoming President under the constitution because of her foreign-born husband and children, the new role of State Counsellor, effectively Prime Minister, was created for her.

But despite her lifelong pro-Democracy campaigning, she has failed to condemn violence against the million-strong Rohingya population.

Aung San Suu Kyi was condemned by world leaders and UN officials who accused her of turning a blind eye to the blooodshed, and there were calls for her to lose her Nobel Peace Prize.

In October 2017, Oxford City Council voted to strip her of the Freedom of the City, which she was granted in 1997.

Bob Geldof handed back his Freedom of the City of Dublin in protest against Suu Kyi, who also held the award.

He said he did not ""wish to be associated in any way with an individual currently engaged in the mass ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people of north-west Burma"".

Pope Francis landed in Yangon to begin a three-day visit to Myanmar on Monday (November 27).

Thousands of locals welcomed the head of the Catholic church as he landed in the city.

The Pontiff failed to mention Myanmar's Rohingya minority in a speech alongside the country's civilian leader.

Speaking in the capital Naypyidaw the following day, he urged people to “respect the rights of all who call this land their home”.

Francis added: ""The future of Myanmar must be peace, a peace based on respect of the dignity and rights of each member of society, respect for each ethnic group and its identity.

""Religious differences need not be a source of division and distrust, but rather a force for unity, forgiveness, tolerance and wise nation-building.”

Some papal advisers warned him against saying the word ""Rohingya"", and his omission of the word in Burma caused controversy.

But in a speech days later in Bangladesh the Pope directly addressed the persecuted minority.

""The presence of God today is also called Rohingya,"" the Pope said to a crowd in the capital Dhaka.

The country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing have overseen the exodus of more than 620,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh in the past three months.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remained fragile with the continuation of the protracted humanitarian crises in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan; the aggravation of the humanitarian context in the northern part of Rakhine State; new internal displacement in Kachin and Shan; and natural disasters hitting already vulnerable people. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to protracted denial of rights, limited access to basic services, conflict, insecurity and climatic shocks. The people directly affected by the different humanitarian crises in Myanmar (including the refugees hosted in Thailand and Bangladesh) are estimated at 1.8 million (3 per cent of the total population).

Protracted humanitarian needs

About 240,000 people remained internally displaced in camps or camp-like settings in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine States. This includes around 91,000 in Kachin and 15,000 in Shan respectively who were displaced because of the armed conflict that resumed in 2011. It also includes about 128,000 in Rakhine who were displaced as a result of violence that erupted in 2012 and who remain unable to access basic services or enjoy the full spectrum of their human rights. In addition, there are particularly vulnerable non-displaced people who continue to require special attention and support because of different factors including, amongst others, armed conflict, restrictions on movement, discriminatory practices and severe malnutrition. The country’s vulnerability to natural disasters results in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government is building its disaster management capacities with the support of the international community.

Crisis in northern Rakhine State

Following the 25 August 2017 attacks of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police posts and subsequent security operations by the Myanmar military and security forces in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung Townships, a massive outflow of people resulted in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. As of 16 March 2017, it is estimated that more than 671,000 persons, the vast majority of whom identify themselves as Rohingya, had fled to neighbouring Bangladesh seeking refuge. In addition, over 25,000 persons were internally displaced, although most of these have since returned. Although severe restrictions on access have made an adequate assessment impossible, large numbers of people in northern Rakhine remain in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in the sectors of protection, health and food security. According to estimates made by the Maungdaw Inter-Agency Group (MIAG), around 159,000 stateless people remain in the three northern townships, all of which can be considered to have been directly affected. In addition, around 55,000 non-stateless people can be considered to have been directly affected in the three northern townships, particularly in Maungdaw and Buthidaung. This includes non-stateless displaced people who have largely returned now from Sittwe and other areas; and members of the economically disadvantaged Mro, Thet, Dynet, and Rakhine communities.

New displacements in Kachin and Shan

In Kachin and Shan states, as a result of continuing and intensified conflict between the Myanmar Military and ethnic armed groups in 2017, close to 8,000 people were newlydisplaced, bringing the total number of people in camps in these two states to over 100,000. Since November 2017, more frequent and intense clashes between ethnic armed groups and Myanmar Military have resulted in displacement and re-displacement of larger numbers of people in both states. The displacement situation across both states remain very fluid and numbers are difficult to confirm given access challenges. Humanitarian access, particularly to people staying in areas beyond government control, remains severely curtailed in both states.

Natural disasters

Myanmar’s vulnerability to natural disasters resulted in significant humanitarian needs that will continue for the foreseeable future whilst the Government continues to build its disaster management capacities with the support of OCHA and other partners. In 2017, Cyclone Mora brought strong winds and heavy rains in Myanmar, destroying over 16,000 houses in Rakhine and Chin states and Ayeyarwady Region.

Rakhine was the most-affected state and, in addition to the houses that were destroyed, over 60 per cent of the temporary shelters in IDP camps were damaged or destroyed. During the 2017 monsoon season, Myanmar also experienced heavy flooding and over 320,000 people were temporarily displaced. In addition, about 30 earthquakes (all with a magnitude lower than 5) were registered.

Security and access constraints

Crisis affected people in Myanmar often have restricted access to services and livelihoods for a variety of reasons including insecurity and restrictions on their movement. Independent and impartial humanitarian organizations, both national and international, aim to meet the resulting needs to the extent possible. However humanitarian actors themselves have varying levels of access to crisis-affected people in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states, resulting in difficulties and delays in implementing and monitoring humanitarian activities. For example, humanitarian activities are sometimes cancelled or delayed as a result of lengthy approval processes and nonissuance of travel authorizations.",Myanmar Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
