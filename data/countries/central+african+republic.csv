HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The year 2017 was characterized by a series of crises that has led to an unprecedented increase in humanitarian needs since 2014. It also raises the risk of a return to a major humanitarian crisis. While the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan initially targeted to 2.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian community was forced to revise it in June 2017 to meet the needs of 2.4 million people. Of the 402,240 displaced in January, the Central African Republic registered 600,000 as of July 31, 2017, as much as in August 2014. This trend continued and reached the 688,700 at the end of December, representing 71 per cent increase in one year. At the same time, 545,497 Central Africans sought refuge in neighbouring countries, while the trend was to return in early 2017. Today, 1.1 million people or 1 out of 4 Central Africans are internally displaced or refugees.

This increase was the result of the resurgence of violence and the multiplication of hotspots across the country. Some areas previously known as islands of relative stability have shifted into violence and others that tended to return to calm have fallen back into instability. Growing insecurity due to activism of armed groups has increased tensions and heightened the vulnerability of communities already affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes and seek protection – often around MINUSCA bases and bigger agglomerations – throughout the country.

Impact of violence on humanitarian activities

2017 has also been one of the deadliest years for humanitarians. Security incidents involving aid workers have increased considerably (332 in 2017 against 131 in 2016), placing the Central African Republic among the most dangerous countries in the world. Fourteen humanitarian workers lost their lives in 2017 (6 in 2016). The multiple peaks of violence have also forced humanitarian workers to temporarily suspend their activities on several occasions, and sometimes to relocate their teams. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) relocated 297 humanitarian actors from 29 organizations on 23 occasions.

These suspensions, driven by unprecedented levels of insecurity since 2013, have exacerbated the vulnerability of thousands of people whose survival depends heavily on humanitarian assistance. In Bangassou the majority of humanitarian actors had to suspend their activities and withdraw their permanent presence from the city. The same goes for the city of Batangafo (Ouham Prefecture) where humanitarian actors have been trying to return since early December after the majority of them had to withdraw in September. At 60 kilometers from Batangafo, in the city of Kabo, in December 2017, the cessation of humanitarian activities directly or indirectly affected approximately 100,000 people, including displaced persons.

Restriction of humanitarian access

The reduction of humanitarian space was the result of several factors, including the deterioration of the security situation and the deterioration of road infrastructure throughout the country. Access to certain areas required large-scale logistical and operational resources that were partly lacking for a humanitarian community faced with the growing challenge of underfunding. The increased use of air assets for the delivery of humanitarian assistance was necessary to reach remote populations. Despite these significant constraints, humanitarian workers were able to deliver more than 6,700 tons of humanitarian assistance cargo, by road and by air, from January to September 2017. Despite its prohibitive price, several times, the actors had to give priority to the air route to help the populations inaccessible by terrestrial means and more and more isolated.

Underfunded humanitarian crisis

The Central African Republic is one of the few countries in the world where half of the population needs humanitarian assistance. Adequate funding of humanitarian action was therefore a top priority. However, by the end of 2017, only 39 per cent of the $ 497 million Humanitarian Response Plan was funded of which $22.1 million (11.5% of the 2017 HRP funding) channeled through the CAR HF. Despite this deficit, the humanitarian community was able to provide emergency assistance to more than one million vulnerable people. Over the last years, funding levels have steadily declined from 68 per cent in 2014 (right after the December 2013 outbreak), to 39 per cent in 2017. In this context of chronic humanitarian underfunding, recovery funds were also slow to be materialized on the ground. Surveys in the affected areas revealed alarming socio-economic indicators signs at the end of 2017. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance was estimated at 2.5 million (54%) out of a population of 4.6 million. The overall socio-economic situation of the country is alarming with: 70% of households having no access to potable water, 80 per cent without latrines, 50 per cent in need of food assistance, 20 per cent of schools closed depriving around 70,000 children of education, and an average acute malnutrition rate reaching the emergency threshold of 15 per cent in six health sub-prefectures of the country. The ability of humanitarian actors to respond to critical and urgent needs has been hampered. Regrettably, the needs continued to grow over the years aggravating dangerously the vulnerability of those already affected by the crisis.",Central African Republic Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

2,central+african+republic,"The numerous steps taken by President Paul Biya to restore peace and stability in the East Region have been palpable.

Intermittent crises in the Central African Republic, (C.A.R.) have had unfortunate spill over in Cameroon. The East region has paid collateral damage with the local population suffering wanton destruction of their property and in some cases getting killed.

Faced with such onslaughts, President Paul Biya had to take a series of measures to protect Cameroonians and even citizens from the Central African Republic, victims of the crisis.

Addressing the diplomatic corps in Yaounde on 5 January 2016, President Paul Biya insisted on the growing number of migrants from a war-torn country like the CAR in the following terms: ""Solutions to this difficult issue must be consistent with morality and human values. In this regard, only human solidarity can provide reasonable solutions.

In Africa as well, conflicts and terrorist atrocities are causing large-scale migration. Cameroon, for instance, has been forced to host thousands of refugees mainly from the Central African Republic and Nigeria. Faced with such an influx of helpless people, the only solution is human solidarity.

We share the little we have, and we appeal for assistance. The essential thing is to fulfil our duty to mankind."" The Head of State's assessment underlined the unfolding humanitarian tragedy caused by crises in neighbouring countries and the impact they had on Cameroon, especially with the lack of resources to cater for fleeing people.

The scale of the problem in the CAR could partly be measured from the refugee influx into the East Region of Cameroon with camps harbouring thousands of destitute people, with armed men among the lot. While the struggle to provide the needs of the genuine refugees continued, Cameroon lost some soldiers and policemen to fleeing CAR rebels.

Thus, confiscating and securing the ammunitions the rebels had was another hurdle which President Paul Biya had to tactfully manage. Consequently, the growing security threats led to the creation of additional military units with the 12th Motorised Infantry Battalion based in Bertoua, headquarters of the East Region.

Within the CAR, Cameroon has been at the forefront of peace initiatives under the auspices of the United Nations Organisation. As a landlocked country, the CAR has since the eruption of the current crisis in 2012 depended on Cameroon for the transportation of vital food and defence equipment to permit the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, MINUSCA and the French Sangaris forces to deliver vital military and humanitarian support to the desperate population.

As the Commander-in-Chief of the national Defence Forces, President Paul Biya has consistently played a key role in providing security and police officials and operatives to ensure peace and stability in the CAR. In fact, the first Commander of the MINUSCA was late Major General Tumenta Martin.

The supreme sacrifices the Cameroon Defence forces have had to pay in ensuring peace and stability in the CAR all testify to the pivotal contribution Cameroon has made to help bring back peace to the CAR and keep the country's boundaries in the East safe.

Of course, the Head of State could not show much concern for the CAR while ignoring the fate of Cameroonians in such a conflict zone. Numerous chartered flights in the heat of the war in 2013 enabled the evacuation of hundreds of Cameroonians to the delight and relief of many.

Given the protracted nature of the conflict, Mr Biya has resolved to put in place permanent measures to guarantee peace and security for Cameroonians and refugees living in the East Region.

Historically, the former French colony of CAR gained independence in 1960 and immediately became a one-party State. A succession of coups followed and culminated in 2012 in the creation of Seleka rebels, with a Muslim ideology. And once in power under Michel Djotodia who ousted François Bozizé, targeted Christians who fought back by creating the anti-Balaka movement.

Tactful support from President Paul Biya and other international partners led to the transitional government of Catherine Samba Panza and eventual elections in February 2016 that brought to power President Faustin-Archange Touadera. He has since been battling to restore the much-needed peace and stability in CAR.",Cameroon-CAR Frontier - Tactful Involvement to Ensure Peace,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805090771.html

AID ORGANISATION DRIVER REPORTED MISSING

A Burkina Faso Red Cross driver was reported missing on 3 May in the northern Soum province. The driver had been travelling between Djibo and Arbinda towns. His vehicle has also gone missing. Humanitarian access has been significantly hampered in Burkina Faso’s northern region since November 2017 due to armed attacks and military operations. More than 950,000 people, a third of them in the northern Sahel region, require urgent relief assistance across the country.

BANGUI UNREST RESTRICTS HUMANITARIAN MOVEMENT

On 4 May, UN and NGO staff restricted staff movement in the capital Bangui during a protest called to desert the city following the killing of 24 people in a violent attack three days earlier. Protesters barricaded main roads and most people stayed away from the city. Aid organisations are still facing difficulties providing emergency assistance such as ferrying injured people to hospitals due to the presence of armed elements. The unrest has also forced some people to flee for safety elsewhere.

HEAVY RAINS LEAVE OVER 9,000 HOMELESS

Torrential rains over the past two weeks in Uvira in the eastern South Kivu province have left more than 9,000 people homeless and destroyed at least 6,500 houses. Several schools and health centres have been flooded. In total, around 32,000 people have been affected. Basic household items, shelter, water, health, sanitation and hygiene assistance are the urgent needs.

IED KILLS FOUR CHILDREN IN MOPTI

On 2 May, four children playing with an explosive device they thought was a toy died when the ordnance exploded. The accident happened in Dia town in the central Mopti region. Improvised explosive devices are among the biggest threats in central and northern Mali. Since 2013, 341 tons of obsolete, unsafe and unserviceable ammunition, including 85 obsolete surfaceto-air missiles, and nearly 11,500 fire arms were found and destroyed by UN Mine Action Support (UNMAS). This represents the world’s largest ammunition stockpile disposed of by a national authority with UNMAS assistance.

4,central+african+republic,"At least 17 people are today feared to have died from a new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Health officials in the African nation have confirmed two people have the virus - but there has been 21 suspected cases in total - raising fears of an epidemic.

It comes just three years after the Ebola pandemic that killed at least 11,000 people across six countries, including a sole fatality in the US.

Ebola is already considered one of the most lethal pathogens in existence, and the new outbreak has been branded a 'public health emergency'.

Experts fear it could have an 'international impact', considering how quickly the virus decimated West Africa between 2014 and 2016.

Two confirmed cases of Ebola have been announced in the Democratic Republic of Congo

The World Health Organization declared there has been 21 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever and 17 deaths in the Equateur province, in the past five weeks.

Congo - situated escaped the brutal Ebola pandemic, finally declared over in January 2016 - but it was struck by a smaller outbreak last year.

Four DRC residents died from the virus in 2017. The outbreak lasted just 42 days and international aid teams were praised for their prompt responses.

The new outbreak is believed to be occurring in the northwestern town of Bikoro - 324 miles (522km) north of capital Kinshasa.

Confirmed cases

Jean Jack Muyembe, head of the national institute for biological research in the DRC, today confirmed the two cases and 10 more suspected.

Two out of five samples collected tested positive for a Zaire strain of Ebola at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale in Kinshasa.

But the WHO today also stated there has been 21 suspected cases since the start of April, including 17 deaths - all of which occurred before the outbreak was confirmed.

'Our country is facing another epidemic of the Ebola virus, which constitutes an international public health emergency,' the Congo Health Ministry said.

'We still dispose of the well trained human resources that were able to rapidly control previous epidemics.'

Controlling the outbreak

The WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières and Provincial Division of Health traveled today to Bikoro in an effort to stem the outbreak.

A team of epidemiologists, logisticians, clinicians, and other infection experts are expected to be deployed in the coming days.

The WHO has released £738,000 ($1mn) from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response activities for the next three months.

This is DRC’s ninth outbreak of Ebola since the discovery of the virus in the country in 1976. The virus - endemic in the country - is named after the Ebola river.

Health experts credit an awareness of the disease among the population and local medical staff's experience treating for past successes containing its spread.

Congo's vast, remote geography also gives it an advantage, as outbreaks are often localised and relatively easy to isolate.

Ikoko Impenge and Bikoro, however, lie not far from the banks of the Congo River, an essential waterway for transport and commerce.

Further downstream the river flows past Kinshasa and Brazzaville, capital of Congo Republic - two cities with a combined population of over 12 million people.

Neighbouring countries alerted

Neighbouring countries have been alerted about the new outbreak. DRC borders Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo

Ebola is often fatal if untreated. Around 50 per cent of patients die, according to the WHO. It is transmitted to people from wild animals and can be spread from human to human.

Dr Peter Salama, WHO deputy director general, said: 'Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the DRC and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak.

'Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease.'

Not ready for a pandemic

The outbreak comes after the World Bank stated last year that Earth isn't ready for an 'inevitable' pandemic, after stimulating four possible scenarios.

The research was done in an attempt to assess why the global response to the Ebola pandemic was so sloppy and to fill those gaps before another disaster strikes.

The 2014 international Ebola response drew criticism for moving too slowly and prompted an apology from the WHO.

A study released last year also suggested disease 'superspreaders' fueled the transmission of the 2014 Ebola epidemic.

Researchers found there was just a small number of so-called 'superspreaders' - highly infectious people who infect many others - in West Africa.

At least two thirds of the victims who contracted the virus can be traced back to this small group.",Ebola epidemic fears: Two cases confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5704371/Democratic-Republic-Congo-confirms-two-Ebola-cases-10-cases-suspected.html

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Several attacks and robberies against humanitarian partners were committed by armed groups, limiting humanitarian access and assistance to the most vulnerable. On 25 February, six education workers, including a UNICEF consultant, were murdered near Markounda, a remote area near the Chadian border while travelling to start a training for community teachers. Following the attack, UNICEF supported its partners to restart education activities and provided them (NGOs and members of the Ministry of Education) with psychosocial support.

In Paoua, 76,238 people having fled the surrounding rural areas are displaced in town, which has a population of about 40,000. Even though USD 2 million were allocated for the Paoua emergency response through the Humanitarian Fund, this will not be sufficient to cover even the most urgent needs. The burden of the displaced population on the host community is already a source of tensions, and may lead to conflict. The approaching rainy season could exacerbate the already poor sanitation conditions. The lack of access to the fields due to insecurity during the growing season increases the risks of food insecurity in the coming months. Thanks to joint efforts, education authorities, partners and UNICEF supported the continuation of normal school activities in the 11 schools in Paoua. The integration of displaced children into schools is ongoing with 5,123 displaced pupils (1,941 girls) attending school. 15 unaccompanied children (NA) were reunited with their families.

In Bangassou, the security situation remained volatile. For months, armed groups have prohibited neighboring residents to bring regular supply to the Petit Séminaire IDP site. Joint advocacy activities conducted towards armed groups by UNICEF’s partner Enfants Sans Frontières and Sisters from the Catholic Church allowed the population to have access to the IDP site and sell various essential items. 211 displaced children (89 girls and 122 boys) from the Petit Séminaire IDP site now have free access for the rest of the year to the Sisters' private primary school, with UNICEF support. However, no solution has been found yet to reintegrate the 108 high school students living in this site.","UNICEF Central African Republic Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/unicef-central-african-republic-humanitarian-situation-report-9
6,central+african+republic,"BANGUI, Central African Republic — A priest was among at least 16 people killed Tuesday as new sectarian violence targeted a church, mosques and health facilities in Central African Republic’s capital, an aid group, hospital and the United Nations said.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, which reported six dead, called for calm after some Bangui residents threatened the SICA hospital, where some of the more than 50 people shot and wounded were being treated.

Medical workers have a duty to treat people “regardless of their background, religious or political affiliations,” Anne-Marie Boyeldieu, MSF’s head of mission in Central African Republic, said.

Anger has been high among some in the capital since U.N. peacekeeping mission and local security forces launched a joint operation in the largely Muslim neighborhood of PK5 in early April to arrest members of armed criminal groups after their leaders refused to disarm. The dead bodies of 17 civilians were laid in front of the U.N. peacekeeping offices shortly afterward.

Tuesday’s violence erupted in the PK5 and Fatima neighborhoods, MSF said.

Armed groups are suspected of carrying out the attacks, but citizens fed up with violence are making their anger known in other ways. Residents brought the bodies of the priest and some of the other people killed to the presidential Renaissance Palace. Members of the Presidential Guard dispersed the crowd by firing shots in the air.

In the Lakwanga district, a group of young people ransacked a mosque that had just been rehabilitated as part of a social cohesion project.

At least 10 bodies were brought to the community hospital morgue Tuesday, the head of the facility said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press.

The Catholic St. Joseph Movement, an action group, confirmed that there were 10 dead in addition to the six reported by MSF.

The U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator for Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, said the people killed included Abbot Albert Tougoumale-Baba, a fervent defender of a non-aggression accord that allowed Muslims to hold burial ceremonies in accordance with their religions.

Tougoumale-Baba’s church in Fatima was attacked, Rochdi said, along with other places of worship, including mosques.

“Once again it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who pay the price of violence,” Rochdi said, calling on women to raise their voices against the recruiting of youth as fighters.

David Brownstein, chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Bangui, condemned the killings as a “cowardly and violent act.” He called for “calm and the cessation of revenge” attacks, which he said would only perpetuate the cycle of violence.

Bangui Mayor Emile Gros Raymond Nakombo appealed to communities to recognize such violence “is the work of those who do not want peace to return to the country.”

Deeply impoverished Central African Republican has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

A period of relative peace followed in late 2015 and 2016, but violence has intensified and spread in the past year.

7,central+african+republic,"On May 2, 2018, gunmen with grenades attacked the Notre-Dame de Fatima church, a Roman Catholic church, in Bangui in the Central African Republic (CAR). 15 people were killed, and dozens injured. The attack comes a few weeks after 28 people were killed in violent clashes after an operation launched by UN peacekeepers and local security forces in the neighbouring Bangui district of PK5. This sectarian violence has been escalating since February 2018. The recent attacks are nothing new as religious (and ethnic) conflicts have haunted the country for several years, reaching a peak at the end of 2012. Prior to 2012, 85% of the population of the Central African Republic was Christian with a 15% percent Muslim minority. This has changed significantly over the years.

In late 2012, an umbrella terror group Séléka, predominately Muslim, supported by Chadian and Sudanese foreign fighters, begun to occupy towns in the northern part of CAR. A short-lived peace agreement collapsed in March 2013 and the terror group took control of the capital of CAR, Bangui, ousting President François Bozizé. The sectarian violence and targeted killings, motivated by religion, escalated after the 2013 coup. Reported atrocities included summary executions, rape, sexual abuse, enforced disappearance, illegal detention and torture. The terror group was formally dissolved in September 2013 by its leader and (self-proclaimed) President Michel Djotodia in light of the international condemnation of the crimes perpetrated by the group. Nonetheless, the ex-Séléka fighters, now members of multiple smaller groups, continued to engage in atrocities. In retaliation to those atrocities, in June 2013, a self-defence militia (primarily Christian), former Central African Armed Forces (FACA) soldiers, and other non-Muslims, so-called anti-balaka, united their forces. These ex-Séléka and anti-balaka have been engaged in fighting a religious war in the Central African Republic since September 2013. The conflict escalated after anti-balaka attacked Muslim neighbourhoods in Bangui on December 5, 2013, resulting in a full-blown religious conflict that affected the whole nation.

In December 2014, the International Commission of Inquiry on the Central African Republic released a report confirming that there had been a ‘pattern of ethnic cleansing committed by the anti-balaka in the areas in which Muslims had been living.’ This finding followed the January 2014 violence unleashed by anti-balaka fighters who had begun to kill Muslims based on their religious identity. This violence led to the forcible displacement of 99% of the Muslim population of Bangui. Furthermore, 80% of the Muslim population of CAR has since fled to Cameroon and Chad. Reports suggested that out of 436 mosques in the country, 417 were destroyed. The return of Muslim minorities back to CAR has been very slowly ever since and the remaining Muslim minorities predominately live in the peacekeeper-protected enclaves. Some of those who have returned back to their homes report being forced to convert by anti-balata soldiers. UN peacekeepers have also reported seeing the returning Muslim minorities subjected to harassment and abuse.

Religious identity continues to be one of the most significant predictors of violence in the Central African Republic. Many Muslim communities remain displaced and in the western parts, Muslims cannot practice their faith freely. The CAR Government has initiated some work to ensure renewed interfaith cooperation and address the growing tensions between religious communities. However, without adequate reconciliation efforts, this has not achieved the desired results. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) found that the situation in CAR merits the designation of a country of particular concern (CRC). In its 2018 report, USCIRF reported that Muslim minorities in CAR had been subjected to marginalisation even before the recent conflict arose. Muslims continue to suffer from systemic discrimination in a wide range of areas including their access to education and identity documents. The ongoing violence has resulted in over 2.3 million people requiring humanitarian assistance. It has created more than 450,000 refugees and almost 350,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). Thousands lost their lives.

The recent attacks and the escalation of violence in the Central African Republic is nothing new. The religious conflict is deeply rooted and had not yet been adequately addressed. The conflict cannot be analysed in this vacuum. Any response to the attacks needs to take into consideration the historic internal conflict. Any future progress towards peace in CAR must incorporate comprehensive plans to combat sectarian violence. It must accommodate interfaith dialogue and reconciliation. Above all, it must ensure that human rights are afforded to all, including the right to freedom of religion and belief to the minority Muslim groups.

More needs to be done to help Muslim minorities in the Central African Republic. This includes ensuring that the refugees and IDPs are allowed to return to their homes, that they are provided adequate protection and that they are guaranteed basic rights in equality with other majority groups. The CAR Government must also ensure that the religious war between ex-Séléka and anti-balaka fighters is adequately investigated and that prosecutions are pursued against these parties for their role in the sectarian violence in CAR. Combating impunity can greatly support reconciliation and community cohesion efforts.",The Religious War In The Central African Republic Continues,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/09/the-religious-war-in-central-african-republic-continues/
8,central+african+republic,"Bangui, 1 May 2018 – The Humanitarian Coordinator in the Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, condemns in the strongest terms possible the new wave of violence that was witnessed in Bangui today.

Acts of utter cowardice led to the deaths of several civilians, including a catholic Father Albert Tougoumalé-Baba following the attack on the Fatima Church in the 6th district of Bangui, while presiding over a mass to mark the St Joseph Day.

“I am shocked by the death of Father Tougoumalé-Baba who was one of the defenders of the Boeing Pact of Non-Aggression,” said Najat Rochdi. This pact enabled the Muslim community in the surrounding neighborhoods to give their dead a befitting burial according to the precepts of Islam. The Humanitarian Coordinator also regrets that today’s violence has taken on a religious dimension ignoring the respect due to places of worship, including churches and mosques.

The Humanitarian Coordinator deplores the threats on health structures and their staff members.

Najat Rochdi reminds that it is contrary to International Humanitarian Law and calls on “the sons and daughters of the Central African Republic to put the future of the country above all other considerations”. She also requests them to respect the humanitarian character of the health structures in accordance with international law.

“Once again, it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who are paying the price for violence,” said Rochdi. The Humanitarian Coordinator calls on “Central African women to raise their voices against the manipulation of young people and to defend peace”.

Najat Rochdi wishes a speedy recovery to the wounded and offers her deepest condolences to the families and people of the Central African Republic for the losses of civilians.

Since February, intercommunity clashes have forced around 3,000 people – mainly from Koro locality in Mali’s northern Gao region – to flee to Burkina Faso. The clashes between Dogon and Peul communities have also claimed several lives. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth. Rising intercommunal tension has also been reported around the Mali - Niger border following the 11 April abduction of a German aid worker in Niger.

MENINGITIS AT ALERT LEVEL IN FOUR HEALTH DISTRICTS

On 16 April, health authorities announced that four health districts in Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions had reached the meningitis alert threshold, meaning five cases per 100,000 people per week. While no health district has reached the epidemic threshold (10 cases per 100,000), several health centres in Maradi and Tahoua regions have reached the epidemic levels. Health authorities have enough medicines for over 4,000 patients. A vaccination campaign targeting people between two and 29 years old is being organised. In 2017, Niger recorded 3,506 cases of meningitis, causing 232 deaths.

VIOLENCE FORCES 300,000 CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL

More than 300,000 children have been forced from schools due to persistent farmerherder clashes in Benue state, the state’s top education official said on 17 April. Several primary schools in the four worst-hit localities have either been burned or occupied by armed herders. In some localities schools are now hosting displaced people. With a daily influx of displaced people into camps, there are hardly any spaces to set up learning areas for children. Clashes and killings continue to escalate in the north-central region, particularly in Benue and Nasarawa states with more than 50 people killed recently.",West and Central Africa: Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot (17 - 23 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/west-and-central-africa-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-17-1
11,central+african+republic,"There are more displaced people than ever before. Half of the population needs humanitarian aid. At the same time, it’s one of the world’s most dangerous countries to do humanitarian work in. Here’s what you should know about the Central African Republic:

#1: Humanitarian crisis have led to record level of forced displacement

Since late 2012, the Central African Republic (CAR) has been wracked by a bloody conflict in which civilians have paid the price. At least 1.2 million people have been forced off their homes: One in four people are either internally displaced or have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. In 2017, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70 per cent.

#2: Large majority of the country are under control of armed groups

CAR counts a myriad of armed groups and militias. It is estimated that armed groups and militias run up to 80 per cent of the territory, challenging the authority of the central government everywhere they operate. The presence of armed groups has prevented many internally displaced people from returning to their homes.

#3: Humanitarians are often targeted

Aid workers are frequently targeted in CAR. The country is considered to be one of the world’s most dangerous countries for humanitarians. Last year, a total of 16 aid workers were killed. This often leads aid agencies to suspend their activities despite the needs of the affected and displaced populations.

#4: One of the world’s most neglected humanitarian crises

In addition to a lack of international media coverage, the crisis is receiving little support from international donors. Last year, over 60 per cent of the humanitarian needs couldn’t be covered because of a lack of funds. Today, half of the population needs humanitarian aid. This year, over USD 515 million are required to address the humanitarian needs in the country. At the beginning of May, less than 10 per cent was funded.",Five things to know about the Central African Republic,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/five-things-know-about-central-african-republic

AID CONVOY UNDER ATTACK NEAR KAGA BANDORO

Armed men on 23 April robbed a vehicle in an aid convoy near the northern Kaga Bandoro town, but were later intercepted some 100km away. Insecurity remains prevalent in several regions of CAR and aid convoys are the target of robberies and armed attacks. These incidents are a constant hindrance to relief operations and civilian movement and safety.

AID WORKERS FACE RECURRENT ATTACKS IN TIMBUKTU REGION

On 22 April, three unidentified armed men robbed aid workers in their accommodation in the town of Gossi, in the northern Timbuktu region. The assailants then looted the premises of the NGO these aid workers belong to, after firing at the guard, who managed to escape. The armed robbers stole motorcycles, phones and computers. This is the fifth incident in Gossi area since the beginning of the year. Earlier, on 19 April assailants attacked four aid workers near Gossi and robbed one of their vehicles. The incident forced an international NGO that recently launched mobile clinic consultations for new IDPs and asylum seekers to suspend the activity.

MAIDUGURI SHAKEN BY WORST ATTACK IN MONTHS

On 26 April, a Non-State Armed Group launched a multi-pronged attack on Born state capital, Maiduguri, triggering panic among the population and causing residents to flee. Reports indicate that blasts and gunfire could be heard across the city as the raid was carried out, reportedly, by around 100 attackers, including suicide bombers. The military repelled the attack and encouraged residents to return home. The incident is amongst the most significant in recent months, amid a worrying increase in security incidents in Borno state. Maiduguri is at the epicentre of the humanitarian crisis in the north-east of Nigeria and currently hosts over 260,000 internally displaced persons.

MENINGITIS CASES MORE THAN DOUBLE IN TWO WEEK

As of 22 April, 930 cases of meningitis, including 70 deaths, were reported with a fatality rate of 7.5 per cent. The number of reported cases has doubled over two weeks. However, they are lower than in the same period in 2017 (2,587 cases and 117 deaths). The health district of Keita in Tahoua region has reached the epidemic threshold, and four other health districts in the Maradi, Tahoua and Tillabéri regions are in alert phase. Epidemiological surveillance, pre-positioning of medical supplies and a vaccination campaign targeting people between 2 and 29 years of age are all ongoing.

HUMANITARIAN AID IMPEDED BY MILITARY OPERATIONS

The ongoing military offensive by the Joint Multinational Task Force (MNJTF) against armed groups presumably affiliated with Boko Haram on the islands of Lake Chad and areas along the Komadougou river is restricting humanitarian operations in the area. Planned missions to Bosso as well as a vaccination campaign and mobile clinics were cancelled.

NEARLY 12,000 CHILDREN RISK MISSING MAJOR EXAM

Some 12,000 children are at risk of not sitting their end of primary school cycle exams due to the violence in Djugu Territory, in the northeastern Ituri province, which has forced them to miss school since December 2017.

The Education Cluster is in talks with the Ministry of Education for solutions to allow these children to pass the exam. It is estimated that 50 of the 511 schools in Djugu are occupied by internally displaced people, disrupting classes for 16,000 students.",West and Central Africa: Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot (24 - 30 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/west-and-central-africa-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-24-1

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.",Eden Under Siege: Saving a Pristine Wilderness from Militarized Poachers and a Humanitarian Crisis,https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/eden-under-siege-saving-pristine-wilderness-militarized-poachers-and-humanitarian-crisis
14,central+african+republic,"Employing the caisses de résilience approach in the Central African Republic, FAO helped to strengthen the social cohesion of vulnerable communities, while improving their food production capacity.

Almost 50 000 families were assisted through the creation of community groups and establishment of village savings and loan associations in 2 000 villages. Each village savings and loan association received kits for improved rotating savings and credit funds. Microcredit enabled members to invest in income-generating activities and restore small businesses.

FAO provided agricultural inputs (crop and vegetable seeds and tools), processing equipment (cassava mills and groundnut decorticators) and livestock (goats, pigs and poultry). FAO also provided training on good livestock and agricultural practices. Participants in the cash-for-work programme earned about USD 30 per family.

Thanks to the support provided, members of the village savings and loans associations strengthened their technical capacities for agricultural production, and their financial capacities to generate income and restore their livelihoods. They identified common challenges, sought solutions and took collective action to improve their living conditions. This participatory approach contributes to behavioural change, improves access to information for rural populations and strengthens organizational capacities.

At least 22 people have been killed and over 100 injured in clashes, which erupted following the arrest of a member of a criminal group by CAR’s security forces.

In the ensuing violence, a church was attacked and a pastor killed. Two members of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the country, known by its French acronym MINUSCA, were also wounded – one seriously – when they were pelted with stones by a crowd.

In the statement, the UN chief also called on the national authorities to investigate the attacks and promptly bring those responsible to justice.

He reaffirmed his support to the country and to MINUSCA’s role to protect civilians and stabilize the country.

The CAR has been plagued by decades of instability and fighting involving clashes between the mainly Muslim Séléka rebel coalition and mostly Christian anti-Balaka militia, which plunged the country into civil conflict in 2012.

A peace agreement was reached in January 2013, but rebels seized the capital, Bangui, in March of that year, forcing President François Bozizé to flee.

Concerned with the security, humanitarian, human rights and political crisis in the CAR and its regional implications, the Security Council authorized the deployment of MINUSCA in 2014 with the protection of civilians as its utmost priority.

A transitional government has since been established and entrusted with restoring peace. The conflict, however, has taken on increasingly sectarian overtones as the anti-Balaka movement has taken up arms and inter-communal clashes have erupted sporadically in and around Bangui and elsewhere in the country.",UN chief condemns violence in Central African Republic capital Bangui,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008812
