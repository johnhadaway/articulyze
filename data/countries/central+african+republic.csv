A cardinal in the Central African Republic has urged his flock not to seek revenge after a priest and at least 24 lay Catholics were killed during a gun and grenade attack on a Mass in the country’s capital.

“For decades now, what have we done with our country: coups d’etat, mutinies, repeated rebellions?” said Cardinal Dieudonné Nzapalainga, president of the bishops’ conference.

“We see the result in deaths, scenes of pillage and acts of destruction. But behind these events, I ask myself if there’s also manipulation and instrumentalisation, a wish to divide the country and a hidden agenda.”

Cardinal Nzapalainga spoke the day after an attack on Our Lady of Fatima Church, close to Bangui’s mostly Muslim PK5 neighborhood. After the attack, a mosque was burned.

The cardinal appealed to the government and UN peacekeeping forces to “throw light” on the atrocity and ensure justice was done, but added that local Catholics should also resist the urge to retaliate.

“The whole Christian community, not just in our country, has been plunged into mourning, after brothers and sisters who came here for Mass encountered suffering, injury and death instead,” said Cardinal Nzapalainga. “It’s at most difficult moments like this that true heroes arise and find the strength to propose an alternative, saying no to the evil of violence, barbarism and destruction, and choosing the good of love, forgiveness and reconciliation.”

Dozens of Catholics were injured in the attack on the church, which was packed with 1,500 people for Mass on the feast of St Joseph.

A researcher for Human Rights Watch told the New York Times that roughly 75 per cent of the Central African Republic was controlled by armed groups. He said violence had been increasing since February, largely because earlier peace efforts failed to disarm militia groups.

Radio France International named the dead priest as Mgr Albert Toungoumale-Baba, from the neighbouring St Mathias Parish, and said the incident followed an attempt by security forces to arrest a militia leader from PK5 on a nearby street.

It added that the priest’s body had been carried toward the residence of President Faustin-Archange Touadera by a “large, angry crowd,” which was dispersed after it destroyed the mosque in Bangui’s Lakouanga district.

UN troops remained on alert against further violence, while Touadera declared two days of mourning and visited Cardinal Nzapalainga to convey condolences.

Kobine Layama, the country’s chief imam, condemned the attack as an attempt to disrupt “peace, social cohesion and coexistence”.

Serge Benda, archdiocesan youth coordinator who was at the Mass, told the France24 TV network the attack had occurred after the Gospel reading, following an exchange of fire with police outside the church.

He added that five assailants had shot at the congregation with Kalashnikov rifles and thrown two grenades, one of which killed Mgr Toungoumale-Baba close to the pulpit.

Carmelite Fr Federico Trinchero described the dead priest as “well known, esteemed and loved by the people,” adding that he had sheltered large numbers of refugees of various faiths at his church during the Central African conflict.

A previous attack on Our Lady of Fatima Church in May 2014 left 18 Catholics, including a priest, dead.

Cardinal Nzapalainga rejected suggestions that the conflict had a religious dimension and said Christians and Muslims were now “one people, working arm in arm” for peace and reconciliation in the country.

“Claims of a confessional crisis are instrumental and manipulatory, an attempt to divide people – we must be careful not to fall into this snare,” the cardinal told journalists.

“No imam has appeared at the front with arms, and no priest has held a weapon, so how can this be confessional? Instead, people have come here, thrown grenades and opened fire. We now need to find these people, so they’ll answer for their deeds.”","Don’t seek revenge for church massacre, urges cardinal",http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2018/05/06/dont-seek-revenge-for-church-massacre-urges-cardinal/

Christina Okello By Two characters from the video game 'Kissoro Tribal Game' playing Kissoro, one of the oldest strategy games in the world.. Masseka Game Studio Podcast

The conflict in the Central African Republic has pitted sectarian militias against each other at the cost of thousands of lives. But could it be resolved through a game? That's the aim of one African developer called Teddy Kossoko, whose new game Kissoro Tribal Game hopes to create a virtual peace that could inspire the whole of the African continent.

""Many people around the world don’t know that the Central African Republic even exists,"" Teddy Kossoko told RFI.

It was partly to tackle this ignorance that the young developer came up with the idea to create a game dedicated to African culture.

What better than using an ancestral tradition like Kissoro, a board game played in all African countries and able to unite thousands.

That's how Kissoro Tribal Game started.

It depicts the story of two rival kingdoms that are locked in a bloody battle for control of their local river, and access to its rich resources. It's a classic story played out all too often on the African continent.

Today Kossoko wants to change the narrative.

""The aim of my project is to promote my country first, the Central African Republic, a country that is renowned in the world,"" says the 23 year-old. ""And also to value Africa and show that Africa can bring a lot to the world in terms of culture.”

The Central African Republic (CAR) is above all renowned for violence.

The country has been in turmoil since 2013 when former president François Bozizé was overthrown, sparking conflict between the Seleka and anti-Balaka militias.

Rich in gold, diamonds, timber and uranium, CAR has proved irresistible to warlords and has seen six coups since independence in 1960.

Kossoko believes his game can change people’s perceptions of a country plagued by violence.

Message to the people

""I wanted to show people that in my country there is not only conflict,"" he says. ""There are many people, we can share ideas, we can innovate, we can also try to fight war using peaceful tools.""

That tool is Kissoro. The game's main character is a young orphan.

""One day there is a young orphan who decided to tell to his king that they have nothing in common with the opponent but they have just this board game, so why couldn't they use this board game to resolve the conflict?""

This is the Central African Republic that Kossoko chooses to see, a country of peace. A fiction that the young developer hopes will one day become reality.

""In my country, it is very difficult to talk about the situation and so, thanks to my game, it was a bit easy to say to people that they have to stop the war, and they have to find solutions themselves. Solutions are not going to come from elites, from the United Nations, or any other country, people have to take their lives in their hands and fight for solutions.""

The virtual peace offered by Kissoro Tribal Game is far removed from the current violence in the CAR, which has seen an upsurge in violence that has left at least 21 people dead, including one UN peacekeeper, killed during an exchange of fire with armed elements on Tuesday 10 April.

Most of those killed were young people, enrolled by criminal gangs, according to the head of the UN peacekeeping mission.

Kossoko wants to offer Africa's youth alternatives to violence.

Put down the guns

""Young people do not have to take guns to resolve these conflicts,"" he insists. ""There are many peaceful ways, they must be source of proposition like the character of my game.""

Since the start of the latest conflict in 2012, up to 10,000 children have been enrolled by rebel groups on both sides of the divide, according to the UN's Unicef.

Given the gravity of the situation, is it fair to make a game out of a cruel reality?

""I took care to put very quickly the light on the main character: the young orphan who will save the kingdom,"" insists Kossoko.

""Clearly this player’s objective is to quickly show that war is not the solution. Also in my game I do not say that this or that kingdom is responsible for the war, but that the war divides instead of gathering. People will win more to sit around a table and play a game. They will see that they have many things in common.""

Discovered gaming culture in France

Born in the CAR, Kossoko moved to France at the onset of the 2012 conflict to study computer science and management and he was introduced to gaming culture.

But he never forgot his past.

""I experienced the war in 1998 and the coup d’état in 2003 and so for me these are very bad experiences,"" he recalls.

In 2012, a few months after Kossoko let for France, his country sank into another crisis, ""the deadliest of its history, so I know that war is something that is very horrible,"" he says.

This explains why he is committed to projects that promote peace and fraternity.

Politicians show interest

His game has attracted wide interest, including from CAR politicians who are using it as a weapon of reconciliation.

""I’m very surprised,"" says the developer.

""At the beginning, I was very happy and it has been an honour for me to see that many people in my country and even government officials are playing this game and I think that the work I do has a positive echo even to politicians, and for me that is a good sign for the future.""

Kissoro Tribal Game and its counterparts are part of a movement that aims to amplify African myths, stories and traditions.

With its African myths and legends, the game has been compared to the blockbuster movie Black Panther, a film that also portrays the continent in a positive light.

After the success of Kissoro Tribal Game, what next for Kossoko?

""With my team, we are preparing another project more ambitious that will allow Africa and the world youth to discover one of the most powerful kingdoms of its time, the Songhai empire,"" he explains.

The new project portrays a Central African detective, who, bored with his investigations, decides to unlock the murder mystery of one of the greatest conquerors of the 14th century, Sonni Ali Ber.

""We want the African youth to know that they have a great past and they must work hard to have a great future too,"" Kossoko says.

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

***

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.

Cédric Ganière flies over a bush fire on the Chinko savannah in his tiny, two-seater plane during a mission to spot cattle herders and blazes.

Wearing desert boots, tan chinos, and a checked shirt, Simpson has a coppery glow at odds with his origins in England’s leaden, drizzly north. His accent is an unusual blend: no-nonsense Yorkshire with a southern African twang. He is direct yet understated, with a light, good-humored touch, at ease holding court during Chinko’s nightly group dinners.

“People make conservation complicated,” says Simpson. “It’s not complicated. You just stop the people killing the animals, and then you’re done. How much do I deal with animals on a daily basis? Zero. I deal with people. Sort that out, and the animals are fine.” He pauses. “I wish it was just about animals, though. It’d be much fucking easier.”

The area around the Chinko River was not always a wildlife reserve. From 2005, it was administered by an isolated hunting ranch called Central African Wildlife Adventures, which ran high-end shoots on strict quotas for wealthy tourists. Simpson became general manager in 2011. Soon after, things began to fall apart in the region. Sudanese poachers and LRA rebels had already decimated the once-abundant elephant population; well-armed poaching groups were now butchering the remaining wildlife. “A client would be getting ready to shoot a giant eland, then a whole load of AK-47s would go off nearby and slaughter the entire herd,” recounts Simpson. “We once found an eland with eight AK bullets in it and was still going.” Buffalo were being annihilated; lion prides, poisoned.

In March 2012, Simpson and his team came across 13 victims of an LRA massacre near an illegal gold mine. Their skulls were crushed, and bodies hacked with machetes. He and Erik Mararv, the concession’s founder, went to the capital to answer questions as witnesses but were instead arrested for murder and jailed in a filthy, overcrowded prison. They later learned that an official involved in the ivory trade had pinned the murders on them.

Languishing in prison, the pair realized that the area around the Chinko River needed to be transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. “We had to protect it,” says Simpson. “It was under attack.”

***

Six months later, the trumped-up charges were dropped, and Simpson reunited with his parents in the UK. After three weeks, he and Mararv headed back to eastern CAR to begin the transformation. At first, Simpson says, his team, armed only with hunting rifles, faced poachers carrying AK-47s. But Chinko’s capabilities began to expand after securing funding and, in 2014, coming under the aegis of African Parks—a conservation nonprofit that has national parks covering 10.5 million hectares. A key objective was to clear the reserve of foreign pastoralists. Each dry season, hundreds of thousands of cows are herded south from Chad and Sudan in search of fresh vegetation, a yearly practice known as transhumance, now intensified by drought, desertification, and war.

A Chinko employee monitors screens in the park’s control room, where software plots ranger movement, bush fires, and other crucial information on a Google Earth map.

This tradition has existed for centuries but has altered radically with the proliferation of weapons and involvement of cattle barons who use cows as roving bank accounts. Desertification and conflict across the Sahel have pushed foreign pastoralists deeper into CAR and the Congo as they seek out verdant terrain, especially grasslands away from armed groups who levy taxes on migrating cattle. The animals overgraze land, spread disease, and devastate dry-season soil amid uncontrollable fires that are lit by herders to clear dense brush and encourage new grass growth.

Such mega-herds—each up to 800 strong—pass through the Chinko region. Park rangers have clashed with herders in shootouts, seizing weaponry and veterinary medicines. But diplomacy is preferred. Local negotiators meet with gun-wielding nomads over tea to encourage them to bypass the reserve through a specially designated “corridor,” marked by yellow plastic bags tied to trees. The herders are given food supplies if they don’t stray off the path. “Confidence does not come quickly, but we have started the process of communication,” says Chinko’s lead negotiator, himself the grandson of a cattle trader.

Surprisingly Chinko’s personnel also includes Hervé Ngambo, a short, unassuming man in his late 30s who, from the age of 15, worked as an elephant poacher. “In the bush, I would slowly approach the elephant until I was as close as possible,” he tells me one morning. “Then I would shoot it in its head, ears, or heart.”

At the start, Ngambo says he could leave his village and find an elephant the same day. A decade later, it took him weeks. Mass poaching was taking its toll. “I always had to come home with something. If I didn’t find an elephant, I’d kill a buffalo or other animals. We’d sell some parts and go back out as soon as possible.”

Elephants were the most valuable quarry. Each time he killed one, Ngambo called his contact, a man from CAR, who bought the ivory to sell to foreign dealers. Ngambo says a pair of tusks plus the meat could bag his five-strong hunting team more than $700—a decent sum in this desperately poor region. He claims he killed well over a hundred but has lost count.

As wildlife numbers plummeted, Ngambo struggled to make ends meet. Living near the Chinko boundary, this lifelong hunter was familiar with the park and embarked on a dramatic career change, joining the reserve in 2014 to track wildlife and poaching activity. “I stopped hunting because there were no animals left. I thought Chinko was good because I want my grandchildren to see elephants. Before, I needed to make money and there was no other work. Hunting was just a job. Now I am committed to protecting these animals.”

But only so long as Chinko exists. Ngambo said, “In my community, there is nothing. There is no work. If Chinko stopped tomorrow and I didn’t get a salary, I would have to go back to hunting.”

***

In the heat of a cloudless February afternoon, the helicopter races over Chinko’s savannah, a parched expanse interspersed with snaking trails of gallery forest, seemingly empty of all human life. That is, until the tents come into view.

Several dozen shelters cluster among charred trees. The thump of rotors draws out dozens of figures who disappear amid clouds of billowing dust. Simpson and his deputy, Evelyne Malfliet, step out to face a host of women and children wearing headscarves and vibrant dresses. They are Fulani—Islamic pastoralists by tradition and, in the case of this exiled community, survivors of savage sectarian violence.

Simpson and Malfliet walk through the desolate, makeshift village toward a small thatched hut where they meet with elders. The plight of this community can be traced back to the outbreak of civil war in late 2012, when a majority-Muslim coalition of rebels known as the Séléka advanced on the capital and overthrew the government, committing atrocities on their path to power. Militias composed largely of Christians—the anti-balaka—fought back. Clashes across the country killed thousands.

At the end of a meeting, the park manager, David Simpson, speaks with elders of a community that was displaced by vicious fighting and is now sheltering in Chinko.

The Séléka were eventually ousted, splintering into rival factions that now control some 80 percent of this mineral-rich country. Violence surged again in late 2016, compounding the humanitarian crisis and uprooting hundreds of thousands of people. One of them was Amadou Boukar, who, in March 2017, awoke before dawn to militants attacking his town, Nzako. “They killed lots of people—women and children,” says Boukar, a 41-year-old former shopkeeper and a father of five. “The attack lasted all day.”

Around 380 civilians fled into Chinko, where park staff gave them food and shelter, later relocating them deep in the savannah where the sheer remoteness offers protection, though hyenas and lions stalk their camp at night. “We would have nothing without Chinko,” Boukar continues. “We could not survive alone. But look at these children. There is no school. This is no future for them. We want to go home more than anything. All we need is peace.”

Chinko is a beacon in one of the world’s darkest corners, bringing order and employment in a time of chaos. It fills the void left by a wholly absent state, sending the park’s medical staff into the community and paying for 50 teachers who reach more than a thousand children. At stake is not just the ecology of the region—it’s the people, too.

Two suspected poachers who were arrested deep in the Chinko bush board a helicopter to be taken to a holding cell at the park’s main base.

“The conditions needed for people to thrive are the same conditions for wildlife and ecosystems to thrive,” says Peter Fearnhead, the CEO of African Parks. “If you have an ungoverned area where natural resources are being exploited in an illegal manner, this contributes to the cycle of poverty.” Well-managed reserves, he says, “can radiate a system of good governance over a very, very large area.”

Despite the existential threats and tortuous logistics of keeping Chinko afloat, Fearnhead believes it presents “one of Africa’s greatest conservation opportunities.” Already, against the odds, wildlife is bouncing back. “In CAR, you have this big black hole filled only with tragedy. Chinko portrays hope in a situation where everything is stacked up to be doom and gloom. We are not allowing Eden to be lost. We are in the process of bringing Eden back.”

***

Swaddled in khaki fatigues and a desert scarf, Stefan Maritz, Chinko’s acting assistant law enforcement manager, waits on the airstrip for takeoff in the 95-degree heat. This burly South African, a former lance-corporal, goes on leave tomorrow. Before his departure, there is one last task.

The day before, rangers found a poaching camp, uncovering a haul of carcasses—buffalo, crocodile, giant forest hog, monkey, water buck, and hippo (its teeth, a valuable substitute for elephant ivory). The rangers lay in wait for the poachers’ return, later catching five of them, confiscating shotguns, rifles, machetes, and a large cache of ammunition. These men are suspected to be part of a larger operation, backed by a wealthy businessman.

The chopper takes off and pushes to the south. “Our mission is to fight the wrong,” says Maritz. “In Chinko, there is authority. There are consequences for what you do. Once accountability falls away, nothing works anymore.”

Fifty miles on, the helicopter descends in a forest clearing. Carrying his Kalashnikov, Maritz greets two rangers who emerge from the scratchy, sun-scorched grass escorting two poachers, one of whom wears flip-flops; the other, barefoot and hobbling. For a fortnight these men have slept rough in the forest amid clouds of mosquitos and tsetse flies.

In a patch of shade, I ask them why they’re here. “This is the only way I can make money for my family,” responds Constant, a father of one in his late 30s whose wife is pregnant with their second child. He says he has been working here independently without support for two weeks and insists he wasn’t aware of Chinko’s boundaries. The rangers shake their heads. “There is no work in my village. There are no opportunities. I do this to survive.”

The two men stare into the trees. Constant seems resigned, strangely calm. The other, Kinimapé, looks forlorn—his eyes, bloodshot. After days of pursuing faceless villains in the bush, this is a strange meeting that only blurs the line between good and bad, between greed and desperation.

The rangers lead the men to the helicopter. It thuds back to base where the men are frogmarched to a holding cell for questioning. Three days later, they will be transferred to Bangui to enter the country’s decrepit justice system. Poachers can be jailed for up to ten years, but this is no real indication of the fate of these men. Whoever funded this poaching trip may let them languish behind bars, or pay off the cops and deploy them once more.

The sun slides behind a canopy of dark forest. The sky is a deep, bruised purple, slashed with red. The air is cooler now. After the day’s drama, Simpson is wrapping up before lights-out. He’ll be up by 5:30 AM tomorrow to do it all again.

“Give it five to ten years, Chinko will be the jewel of African Parks,” he says. “This could be a thousand-lion park. We could have 100,000 buffalo. We’ve now created some stability. If we keep on, we’ll see more development. Then, in time, hopefully, peace.”

A newly released report and summary paper offer the international community direction in terms of areas of future priority for better responding to migrants caught in crisis situations. The report “Resilience in the Face of Adversity: A Comparative Study of Migrants in Crisis Situations ” is based on six case studies conducted across the globe on crisis situations in migrant host countries: Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Libya, South Africa and Thailand. The research, conducted by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development, the International Migration Institute of the University of Oxford, and local research partners, has collected and analysed the experiences and knowledge of over 650 migrants, family members of migrants, civil society organisations, intergovernmental organisations and government authority representatives who were interviewed across twelve different countries. The six case studies cover a spectrum of crises – from public disturbance to natural disaster to armed conflict – thereby highlighting the diverse experiences and needs of migrants during a crisis situation, as well as the varied ways institutional and other stakeholders respond to their needs.

The study points to the need for better and contextualised understanding of crises and migrants’ experiences, as well as the need to improve (and coordinate) international responses to migrants caught in crisis situations. Crises can produce a wide range of impacts, based not only on how they are handled by state and international actors, but also on the nature of the crisis, the environment leading up to the crisis and – significantly – how (and at what level) migrants’ engage their own agency in response to the crisis. Despite the wide range of crisis outcomes, the research also found that across the board, long-term responses to displaced persons – particularly returnees – was lacking and has seriously hindered migrants’ recovery in the years following the crisis.

Building on the results of the comparative study, the new summary paper connects six main thematic findings from the report to recent developments on the global stage and concrete recommendations and guidance that can already greatly improve responses. Engaging the main themes under study in the first phase of development of the UN Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the summary paper highlights the main issues that have emerged in the research related to: human rights, social inclusion and cohesion, discrimination and xenophobia, international cooperation, remittances and irregular migration.

Institutional stakeholders already have a breadth of resources available to them that provide tangible and specific guidance on how to improve their responses. In particular, on migrants caught in crisis situations, there are already at least three specific guidance documents that provide best practices and concrete examples for states, civil society, international organisations and private institutions:

Indeed, the research conducted on migrants’ experiences in the context of crises validates many of the issues already identified in these guidelines. The challenges migrants and institutional stakeholders encounter in the face of crises can be enormous – but they are not insurmountable: the international community already has the means to address many of these challenges at our fingertips.

Each village savings and loan association received kits for improved rotating savings and credit funds. Microcredit enabled members to invest in income-generating activities and restore small businesses.

FAO provided agricultural inputs (crop and vegetable seeds and tools), processing equipment (cassava mills and groundnut decorticators) and livestock (goats, pigs and poultry). FAO also provided training on good livestock and agricultural practices. Participants in the cash-for-work programme earned about USD 30 per family.

Thanks to the support provided, members of the village savings and loans associations strengthened their technical capacities for agricultural production, and their financial capacities to generate income and restore their livelihoods. They identified common challenges, sought solutions and took collective action to improve their living conditions. This participatory approach contributes to behavioural change, improves access to information for rural populations and strengthens organizational capacities.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The year 2017 was characterized by a series of crises that has led to an unprecedented increase in humanitarian needs since 2014. It also raises the risk of a return to a major humanitarian crisis. While the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan initially targeted to 2.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian community was forced to revise it in June 2017 to meet the needs of 2.4 million people. Of the 402,240 displaced in January, the Central African Republic registered 600,000 as of July 31, 2017, as much as in August 2014. This trend continued and reached the 688,700 at the end of December, representing 71 per cent increase in one year. At the same time, 545,497 Central Africans sought refuge in neighbouring countries, while the trend was to return in early 2017. Today, 1.1 million people or 1 out of 4 Central Africans are internally displaced or refugees.

This increase was the result of the resurgence of violence and the multiplication of hotspots across the country. Some areas previously known as islands of relative stability have shifted into violence and others that tended to return to calm have fallen back into instability. Growing insecurity due to activism of armed groups has increased tensions and heightened the vulnerability of communities already affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes and seek protection – often around MINUSCA bases and bigger agglomerations – throughout the country.

Impact of violence on humanitarian activities

2017 has also been one of the deadliest years for humanitarians. Security incidents involving aid workers have increased considerably (332 in 2017 against 131 in 2016), placing the Central African Republic among the most dangerous countries in the world. Fourteen humanitarian workers lost their lives in 2017 (6 in 2016). The multiple peaks of violence have also forced humanitarian workers to temporarily suspend their activities on several occasions, and sometimes to relocate their teams. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) relocated 297 humanitarian actors from 29 organizations on 23 occasions.

These suspensions, driven by unprecedented levels of insecurity since 2013, have exacerbated the vulnerability of thousands of people whose survival depends heavily on humanitarian assistance. In Bangassou the majority of humanitarian actors had to suspend their activities and withdraw their permanent presence from the city. The same goes for the city of Batangafo (Ouham Prefecture) where humanitarian actors have been trying to return since early December after the majority of them had to withdraw in September. At 60 kilometers from Batangafo, in the city of Kabo, in December 2017, the cessation of humanitarian activities directly or indirectly affected approximately 100,000 people, including displaced persons.

Restriction of humanitarian access

The reduction of humanitarian space was the result of several factors, including the deterioration of the security situation and the deterioration of road infrastructure throughout the country. Access to certain areas required large-scale logistical and operational resources that were partly lacking for a humanitarian community faced with the growing challenge of underfunding. The increased use of air assets for the delivery of humanitarian assistance was necessary to reach remote populations. Despite these significant constraints, humanitarian workers were able to deliver more than 6,700 tons of humanitarian assistance cargo, by road and by air, from January to September 2017. Despite its prohibitive price, several times, the actors had to give priority to the air route to help the populations inaccessible by terrestrial means and more and more isolated.

Underfunded humanitarian crisis

The Central African Republic is one of the few countries in the world where half of the population needs humanitarian assistance. Adequate funding of humanitarian action was therefore a top priority. However, by the end of 2017, only 39 per cent of the $ 497 million Humanitarian Response Plan was funded of which $22.1 million (11.5% of the 2017 HRP funding) channeled through the CAR HF. Despite this deficit, the humanitarian community was able to provide emergency assistance to more than one million vulnerable people. Over the last years, funding levels have steadily declined from 68 per cent in 2014 (right after the December 2013 outbreak), to 39 per cent in 2017. In this context of chronic humanitarian underfunding, recovery funds were also slow to be materialized on the ground. Surveys in the affected areas revealed alarming socio-economic indicators signs at the end of 2017. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance was estimated at 2.5 million (54%) out of a population of 4.6 million. The overall socio-economic situation of the country is alarming with: 70% of households having no access to potable water, 80 per cent without latrines, 50 per cent in need of food assistance, 20 per cent of schools closed depriving around 70,000 children of education, and an average acute malnutrition rate reaching the emergency threshold of 15 per cent in six health sub-prefectures of the country. The ability of humanitarian actors to respond to critical and urgent needs has been hampered. Regrettably, the needs continued to grow over the years aggravating dangerously the vulnerability of those already affected by the crisis.",Central African Republic Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Since February, intercommunity clashes have forced around 3,000 people – mainly from Koro locality in Mali’s northern Gao region – to flee to Burkina Faso. The clashes between Dogon and Peul communities have also claimed several lives. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth. Rising intercommunal tension has also been reported around the Mali - Niger border following the 11 April abduction of a German aid worker in Niger.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Several attacks and robberies against humanitarian partners were committed by armed groups, limiting humanitarian access and assistance to the most vulnerable. On 25 February, six education workers, including a UNICEF consultant, were murdered near Markounda, a remote area near the Chadian border while travelling to start a training for community teachers. Following the attack, UNICEF supported its partners to restart education activities and provided them (NGOs and members of the Ministry of Education) with psychosocial support.

In Paoua, 76,238 people having fled the surrounding rural areas are displaced in town, which has a population of about 40,000. Even though USD 2 million were allocated for the Paoua emergency response through the Humanitarian Fund, this will not be sufficient to cover even the most urgent needs. The burden of the displaced population on the host community is already a source of tensions, and may lead to conflict. The approaching rainy season could exacerbate the already poor sanitation conditions. The lack of access to the fields due to insecurity during the growing season increases the risks of food insecurity in the coming months. Thanks to joint efforts, education authorities, partners and UNICEF supported the continuation of normal school activities in the 11 schools in Paoua. The integration of displaced children into schools is ongoing with 5,123 displaced pupils (1,941 girls) attending school. 15 unaccompanied children (NA) were reunited with their families.

In Bangassou, the security situation remained volatile. For months, armed groups have prohibited neighboring residents to bring regular supply to the Petit Séminaire IDP site. Joint advocacy activities conducted towards armed groups by UNICEF’s partner Enfants Sans Frontières and Sisters from the Catholic Church allowed the population to have access to the IDP site and sell various essential items. 211 displaced children (89 girls and 122 boys) from the Petit Séminaire IDP site now have free access for the rest of the year to the Sisters' private primary school, with UNICEF support. However, no solution has been found yet to reintegrate the 108 high school students living in this site.","UNICEF Central African Republic Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/unicef-central-african-republic-humanitarian-situation-report-9
8,central+african+republic,"BANGUI, Central African Republic — A priest was among at least 16 people killed Tuesday as new sectarian violence targeted a church, mosques and health facilities in Central African Republic’s capital, an aid group, hospital and the United Nations said.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, which reported six dead, called for calm after some Bangui residents threatened the SICA hospital, where some of the more than 50 people shot and wounded were being treated.

Medical workers have a duty to treat people “regardless of their background, religious or political affiliations,” Anne-Marie Boyeldieu, MSF’s head of mission in Central African Republic, said.

Anger has been high among some in the capital since U.N. peacekeeping mission and local security forces launched a joint operation in the largely Muslim neighborhood of PK5 in early April to arrest members of armed criminal groups after their leaders refused to disarm. The dead bodies of 17 civilians were laid in front of the U.N. peacekeeping offices shortly afterward.

Tuesday’s violence erupted in the PK5 and Fatima neighborhoods, MSF said.

Armed groups are suspected of carrying out the attacks, but citizens fed up with violence are making their anger known in other ways. Residents brought the bodies of the priest and some of the other people killed to the presidential Renaissance Palace. Members of the Presidential Guard dispersed the crowd by firing shots in the air.

In the Lakwanga district, a group of young people ransacked a mosque that had just been rehabilitated as part of a social cohesion project.

At least 10 bodies were brought to the community hospital morgue Tuesday, the head of the facility said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press.

The Catholic St. Joseph Movement, an action group, confirmed that there were 10 dead in addition to the six reported by MSF.

The U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator for Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, said the people killed included Abbot Albert Tougoumale-Baba, a fervent defender of a non-aggression accord that allowed Muslims to hold burial ceremonies in accordance with their religions.

Tougoumale-Baba’s church in Fatima was attacked, Rochdi said, along with other places of worship, including mosques.

“Once again it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who pay the price of violence,” Rochdi said, calling on women to raise their voices against the recruiting of youth as fighters.

David Brownstein, chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Bangui, condemned the killings as a “cowardly and violent act.” He called for “calm and the cessation of revenge” attacks, which he said would only perpetuate the cycle of violence.

Bangui Mayor Emile Gros Raymond Nakombo appealed to communities to recognize such violence “is the work of those who do not want peace to return to the country.”

Deeply impoverished Central African Republican has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

A period of relative peace followed in late 2015 and 2016, but violence has intensified and spread in the past year.

Humanitarian movements to and within several towns were disrupted following the 10 April crackdown by UN peacekeepers on armed vigilantes in the capital Bangui. The crackdown prompted sympathetic armed groups to urge retaliation against the UN mission. Armed groups also warned aid workers in some towns against venturing out. At least 145 people and eight peacekeepers were wounded and 31 others, including a peacekeeper, were killed in the skirmishes in Bangui’s PK5 neighbourhood.

10,central+african+republic,"Bangui, 1 May 2018 – The Humanitarian Coordinator in the Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, condemns in the strongest terms possible the new wave of violence that was witnessed in Bangui today.

Acts of utter cowardice led to the deaths of several civilians, including a catholic Father Albert Tougoumalé-Baba following the attack on the Fatima Church in the 6th district of Bangui, while presiding over a mass to mark the St Joseph Day.

“I am shocked by the death of Father Tougoumalé-Baba who was one of the defenders of the Boeing Pact of Non-Aggression,” said Najat Rochdi. This pact enabled the Muslim community in the surrounding neighborhoods to give their dead a befitting burial according to the precepts of Islam. The Humanitarian Coordinator also regrets that today’s violence has taken on a religious dimension ignoring the respect due to places of worship, including churches and mosques.

The Humanitarian Coordinator deplores the threats on health structures and their staff members.

Najat Rochdi reminds that it is contrary to International Humanitarian Law and calls on “the sons and daughters of the Central African Republic to put the future of the country above all other considerations”. She also requests them to respect the humanitarian character of the health structures in accordance with international law.

“Once again, it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who are paying the price for violence,” said Rochdi. The Humanitarian Coordinator calls on “Central African women to raise their voices against the manipulation of young people and to defend peace”.

Funding received: $6.26 B

Funding percentage: 24.8%

People in need: 130.6 M

People to receive aid: 95.3 M

Countries affected: 40

As of April 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require US$25.27 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 95.3 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.

Three significant humanitarian resource mobilization events took place in April: the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, 3 April, Geneva, co-hosted by the UN, Sweden and Switzerland, where US$2.01 billion in contributions for 2018 were announced by 40 entities and a further $20.2 million were announced in multi-year funding; the Humanitarian Conference on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 13 April, co-hosted in Geneva by the UN, the Netherlands and the EU, where $528.1 million were pledged by 22 donors for 2018 and a further $38.7 million for 2019-2020; and the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region Brussels II Conference, 24-25 April, co-hosted by the UN and the EU. This drew 36 announcements of humanitarian funding totalling $4.4 billion for 2018 and an additional $3.4 billion for 2019-2020.

The humanitarian funding outlook for the protracted, entrenched humanitarian crisis in DPRK is particularly concerning, with a persistent risk that geo-political tension – even with the recent positive developments – could dampen funding. 10.3 million people in DPRK are estimated to be undernourished. More than one-quarter of children are stunted and 4% wasted, while about 30% of women of reproductive age are anaemic. The lack of safe water and the poor sanitation contribute to high levels of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, which are the most common causes of death among young children. The 2018 Needs and Priorities Plan released in April calls for $111 million to provide food assistance, health and nutrition services and improved access to safe water and sanitation for 6 million highly vulnerable people.

On 20 April, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine briefed Member States in New York on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people after four years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Disrupted access to critical facilities and diminished livelihoods mean that 3.4 million people are without basic supplies and services and need protection and life-saving assistance. Ukraine has the highest proportion of elderly people affected by humanitarian crisis in the world. Some 1.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced across the country, and some 200,000 live in daily fear of shelling. Funding for the HRP is urgently needed.

In 2018, as many as 7 million people in South Sudan need humanitarian assistance to cope with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and grave protection violations including conflict-related sexual violence. This is the world’s third largest refugee crisis: more than 4.2 million people have been displaced, including 1.8 million IDPs and more than 2.4 million refugees.

Severe food insecurity continues to rise as people are unable to plant or harvest and have limited access to humanitarian assistance. With the lean season beginning in May, urgent funding is required to save lives and resources. On 27 April, the DSRSG/RC/HC for South Sudan formally invited the USG to support him in delivering three key messages when he visits the country in mid-May. Namely, calling for a sustainable political solution to the conflict to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis, with IGAD-led peace talks expected to resume in May; urging parties to the conflict, including the numerous splinter groups, to address the insecurity that affects civilians and aid workers; and advocating for resources towards the HRP which is currently funded at 21%.

Humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic have increased from 2.2 million people in need in early 2017 to 2.5 million this year, with a multiplication of hotspots. The spike in tensions and armed violence that erupted in April is also affecting the capital, Bangui. Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70% over the first quarter of 2017, and the number of refugees increased by 30%; effectively, 25% of Central Africans are currently displaced either as IDPs or refugees. Underfunding remains one of the biggest impediments to stepping up the humanitarian response. By end April 2018 the HRP had received less than 10 per cent of its $515.6 million requirements.

By 30 April, 21 donors had contributed a combined $278 million (including pledges) to 17 country-based pooled funds (CBPFs), which translated into financial support for 308 humanitarian projects implemented by 229 partners. These included international NGOs which received $55.3 million (42% of total budget allocations) while UN agencies received $42.6 million (32% of allocations). Support to national NGOs included $33.6 million (25% of allocations) and to the Red Cross / Crescent movement $0.6 million (0.5% of total allocations). The largest amounts were channelled to Yemen ($77.9 million), the whole of Syria response ($41.7 million), Sudan ($28.2 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($26.5 million). New reserve allocations were launched by the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (HF) for $16.2 million and by the occupied Palestinian territories HF for $2.2 million, on top of its first standard allocation of the year for $3.9 million, to respond to immediate health and protection needs in the Gaza Strip.

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.",Eden Under Siege: Saving a Pristine Wilderness from Militarized Poachers and a Humanitarian Crisis,https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/eden-under-siege-saving-pristine-wilderness-militarized-poachers-and-humanitarian-crisis
