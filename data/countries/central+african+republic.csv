Almost 50 000 families were assisted through the creation of community groups and establishment of village savings and loan associations in 2 000 villages. Each village savings and loan association received kits for improved rotating savings and credit funds. Microcredit enabled members to invest in income-generating activities and restore small businesses.

FAO provided agricultural inputs (crop and vegetable seeds and tools), processing equipment (cassava mills and groundnut decorticators) and livestock (goats, pigs and poultry). FAO also provided training on good livestock and agricultural practices. Participants in the cash-for-work programme earned about USD 30 per family.

Thanks to the support provided, members of the village savings and loans associations strengthened their technical capacities for agricultural production, and their financial capacities to generate income and restore their livelihoods. They identified common challenges, sought solutions and took collective action to improve their living conditions. This participatory approach contributes to behavioural change, improves access to information for rural populations and strengthens organizational capacities.

At least 22 people have been killed and over 100 injured in clashes, which erupted following the arrest of a member of a criminal group by CAR’s security forces.

In the ensuing violence, a church was attacked and a pastor killed. Two members of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the country, known by its French acronym MINUSCA, were also wounded – one seriously – when they were pelted with stones by a crowd.

In the statement, the UN chief also called on the national authorities to investigate the attacks and promptly bring those responsible to justice.

He reaffirmed his support to the country and to MINUSCA’s role to protect civilians and stabilize the country.

The CAR has been plagued by decades of instability and fighting Clashes between the mainly Muslim Séléka rebel coalition and anti-Balaka militia, which are mostly Christian, plunged the country into civil conflict in 2012.

A peace agreement was reached in January 2013, but rebels seized the capital, Bangui, in March of that year, forcing President François Bozizé to flee.

Concerned with the security, humanitarian, human rights and political crisis in the CAR and its regional implications, the Security Council authorized the deployment of MINUSCA in 2014 with the protection of civilians as its utmost priority.

A transitional government has since been established and entrusted with restoring peace. The conflict, however, has taken on increasingly sectarian overtones as the anti-Balaka movement has taken up arms and inter-communal clashes have erupted sporadically in and around Bangui and elsewhere in the country.",UN chief condemns violence in Central African Republic capital Bangui,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008812
2,central+african+republic,"Located in northern Central African Republic, the city of N'délé was mostly spared by the 2013 crisis. As a result of the relative stability, it has become a place of refuge for many displaced people fleeing violence.

Many men and women, often from the Muslim community, have arrived both alone and with their families, in N’délé, with virtually nothing, after having lost all they once owned.

Kadidja is one of them. She used to live in the Miskine district of Bangui and owned a business. In 2014, when clashes between the anti-Balaka and the ex-Seleka broke out in the capital, Kadidja had no other choice but to flee. With that action, the life she had built was gone.

“I work in a small business and I earn enough to cover my needs and those of my children”, Kadidja

Starting a new life in N’dele was not easy, due to the financial hardships usually experienced by displaced people. During their first days in N’dele, Kadidja and her children lived with a host family until they moved into one of the 68 homes our teams have built there. With her new-found home, Kadidja wanted to resume her professional life.Today, Kadidja is part of an association of 12 women who sell their products at the market. At the end of each month, the women share the money they have earned, so that each member can support their household.

""With this associative activity, I can take care of my children,"" said Kadidja.

With the help of guidance from our organisation, internally displaced communities in N’délé organise themselves in association and collectively use the tools and equipment that we provide them. The profits generated by the various professional activities are then redistributed among the members of the association.

""It's better to be organised in associations, we produce more and better,"" explained Kadidja.

With her new salary, Kadidja is able to provide food, access health care and pay school fees for her children. Kadidja has also been able to invest part of her salary to buy goats and set up a small donut business. This will allow her to generate new and regular income streams in the future.

""I work in a small business, and I earn enough to cover my needs and those of my children"" said Kadidja who decided to stay in Ndélé. ""I do not have the courage to return to Bangui. Here I have a new house built by the NRC and I am part of an association that has helped me a lot.”

Building a new life with agriculture

Other internally displaced people, who focus on agricultural activities, have also organised themselves into an association.

""I chose agriculture because I understand its importance,"" said Abdel Akim, who fled his hometown of Bossangoa. ""The agricultural products I received from NRC allowed me to grow cassava, sorghum and peanuts.""

“I was able to sell part of it and keep the rest to feed my family,” Akim

Thanks to the trainings provided by the NRC food security team, Akim learned methods to increase his yields. ""Before we planted our seeds, we were taught to sow in rows and carefully record planting dates to improve our estimation of the harvest period. This was an important technique taught by NRC, and my production has drastically increased since then,"" he explained.

Akim was able to harvest groundnuts and cassava, but unfortunately his sorghum was destroyed by the livestock of transhumant herders in January. He plans to cultivate a new field this year. ""With what I harvested last year, I was able to sell part of it and keep the rest to feed my family,"" he said.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The year 2017 was characterized by a series of crises that has led to an unprecedented increase in humanitarian needs since 2014. It also raises the risk of a return to a major humanitarian crisis. While the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan initially targeted to 2.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian community was forced to revise it in June 2017 to meet the needs of 2.4 million people. Of the 402,240 displaced in January, the Central African Republic registered 600,000 as of July 31, 2017, as much as in August 2014. This trend continued and reached the 688,700 at the end of December, representing 71 per cent increase in one year. At the same time, 545,497 Central Africans sought refuge in neighbouring countries, while the trend was to return in early 2017. Today, 1.1 million people or 1 out of 4 Central Africans are internally displaced or refugees.

This increase was the result of the resurgence of violence and the multiplication of hotspots across the country. Some areas previously known as islands of relative stability have shifted into violence and others that tended to return to calm have fallen back into instability. Growing insecurity due to activism of armed groups has increased tensions and heightened the vulnerability of communities already affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes and seek protection – often around MINUSCA bases and bigger agglomerations – throughout the country.

Impact of violence on humanitarian activities

2017 has also been one of the deadliest years for humanitarians. Security incidents involving aid workers have increased considerably (332 in 2017 against 131 in 2016), placing the Central African Republic among the most dangerous countries in the world. Fourteen humanitarian workers lost their lives in 2017 (6 in 2016). The multiple peaks of violence have also forced humanitarian workers to temporarily suspend their activities on several occasions, and sometimes to relocate their teams. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) relocated 297 humanitarian actors from 29 organizations on 23 occasions.

These suspensions, driven by unprecedented levels of insecurity since 2013, have exacerbated the vulnerability of thousands of people whose survival depends heavily on humanitarian assistance. In Bangassou the majority of humanitarian actors had to suspend their activities and withdraw their permanent presence from the city. The same goes for the city of Batangafo (Ouham Prefecture) where humanitarian actors have been trying to return since early December after the majority of them had to withdraw in September. At 60 kilometers from Batangafo, in the city of Kabo, in December 2017, the cessation of humanitarian activities directly or indirectly affected approximately 100,000 people, including displaced persons.

Restriction of humanitarian access

The reduction of humanitarian space was the result of several factors, including the deterioration of the security situation and the deterioration of road infrastructure throughout the country. Access to certain areas required large-scale logistical and operational resources that were partly lacking for a humanitarian community faced with the growing challenge of underfunding. The increased use of air assets for the delivery of humanitarian assistance was necessary to reach remote populations. Despite these significant constraints, humanitarian workers were able to deliver more than 6,700 tons of humanitarian assistance cargo, by road and by air, from January to September 2017. Despite its prohibitive price, several times, the actors had to give priority to the air route to help the populations inaccessible by terrestrial means and more and more isolated.

Underfunded humanitarian crisis

The Central African Republic is one of the few countries in the world where half of the population needs humanitarian assistance. Adequate funding of humanitarian action was therefore a top priority. However, by the end of 2017, only 39 per cent of the $ 497 million Humanitarian Response Plan was funded of which $22.1 million (11.5% of the 2017 HRP funding) channeled through the CAR HF. Despite this deficit, the humanitarian community was able to provide emergency assistance to more than one million vulnerable people. Over the last years, funding levels have steadily declined from 68 per cent in 2014 (right after the December 2013 outbreak), to 39 per cent in 2017. In this context of chronic humanitarian underfunding, recovery funds were also slow to be materialized on the ground. Surveys in the affected areas revealed alarming socio-economic indicators signs at the end of 2017. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance was estimated at 2.5 million (54%) out of a population of 4.6 million. The overall socio-economic situation of the country is alarming with: 70% of households having no access to potable water, 80 per cent without latrines, 50 per cent in need of food assistance, 20 per cent of schools closed depriving around 70,000 children of education, and an average acute malnutrition rate reaching the emergency threshold of 15 per cent in six health sub-prefectures of the country. The ability of humanitarian actors to respond to critical and urgent needs has been hampered. Regrettably, the needs continued to grow over the years aggravating dangerously the vulnerability of those already affected by the crisis.",Central African Republic Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Promoting access to birth registration and education.

Violent crises in Central African Republic have effected access to birth registration and education. Birth registration needs to be facilitated and barriers removed to enrolling in school and sitting public exams.

Introduction

The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced a succession of violent crises, the most serious taking place between 2013 and 2015. Further outbreaks of violence in May and June 2017 have pushed the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) to 600,000 and CAR refugees in neighbouring countries to 481,000. CAR remains extremely fragile with an estimated 2.4 million people in need of assistance.

Insecurity, violence and forced displacement have severely weakened civil registration and education systems in CAR. In 2010, before the crisis, only 61 percent of children under the age of five were registered at birth. Similarly, challenges in access to education are demonstrated by the 2015 primary net enrolment rate of 72 percent and achievement rate of only 48 percent.

NRC has carried out an assessment on access to birth registration for displacement-affected communities in CAR and its link to enrolling in school and sitting public exams. The results of this research indicate numerous challenges in registering births and that lack of a birth certificate limits access to education, in particular to secondary school and higher education, as well as access to diplomas and certificates.",Legal identity and education in Central African Republic - Briefing Note April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/legal-identity-and-education-central-african-republic-briefing-note

6,central+african+republic,"Press release | 1st Standard Humanitarian Fund Allocation | April 2018

Bangui, 27 April 2018 – The Humanitarian Coordinator for Central African Republic (CAR), Najat Rochdi has allocated US$11 million from the Humanitarian Fund (CAR HF) for projects countywide to address urgent humanitarian needs prioritized in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). This funding will also help in bridging the funding gap observed during the first quarter of the year.

The humanitarian situation in CAR continues to deteriorate due to attacks by armed groups resulting in massive displacements of population. This situation is further exacerbated by extreme poverty, lack of basic social services, and successive conflicts disrupting early recovery initiatives. Against this backdrop, humanitarian needs are increasing and yet funding has diminished significantly.

This funding allocation aims at responding to the immediate and critical needs of people affected by crisis, protracted emergency and support to durable solutions for the return of the displaced persons. Targeted geographic areas include the Prefectures of Ouham Pendé, Ouaka, Mbomou, Haut Mbomou, Mambéré-Kadeï, Basse-Kotto and Haute Kotto. These regions were prioritized due to the severity of needs through a participative and consultative process that involved all the stakeholders of the CAR HF.

Eligible projects will be implemented mainly through a multi-sectoral approach, ensuring that beneficiaries receive a comprehensive package of assistance. Cash programming approach through activities such as inkind assistance, cash-for-work or vouchers will be encouraged as per the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit recommendations aiming at increasing the efficiency of humanitarian assistance.

Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) has continued to increase reaching 680,962 persons as of 31 March 2018. In addition, the number of refugees has reached 568,572 making 1 in 4 Central Africans either displaced internally or in neighboring countries. 2.5 million people, which is more than half of the population of CAR, are in need of humanitarian assistance.

The 2018 HRP requesting $ 515.6 million which aims at covering humanitarian needs of 1.9 million Central Africans is only 8 per cent funded ($38.6 million). “I commend the international community for their generosity towards the people of CAR. Humanitarian needs have grown significantly reaching an unprecedented level while funding remains very low. I urge the international community not to neglect the crisis. The people of CAR need your continuous support and we must not fail them” said Ms. Rochdi. Adequate funding for the 2018 HRP is critical to provide immediate response to the conflict-affected people.

Since January 2018, the CAR HF has received over $10 million through contributions from Belgium,

Denmark, Luxemburg, Sweden, and United Kingdom. In July 2018, the CAR Humanitarian Fund will be celebrating its 10 years’ anniversary since its inception in 2008. $165.2 million has been so far allocated by the fund to respond to emergency projects. CAR HF is a predictable funding mechanism that allows the Humanitarian Coordinator to respond to onset emergencies to save life and alleviate suffering.",The CAR Humanitarian Fund releases $ 11 Million to Support Humanitarian Response,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/car-humanitarian-fund-releases-11-million-support-humanitarian

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Several attacks and robberies against humanitarian partners were committed by armed groups, limiting humanitarian access and assistance to the most vulnerable. On 25 February, six education workers, including a UNICEF consultant, were murdered near Markounda, a remote area near the Chadian border while travelling to start a training for community teachers. Following the attack, UNICEF supported its partners to restart education activities and provided them (NGOs and members of the Ministry of Education) with psychosocial support.

In Paoua, 76,238 people having fled the surrounding rural areas are displaced in town, which has a population of about 40,000. Even though USD 2 million were allocated for the Paoua emergency response through the Humanitarian Fund, this will not be sufficient to cover even the most urgent needs. The burden of the displaced population on the host community is already a source of tensions, and may lead to conflict. The approaching rainy season could exacerbate the already poor sanitation conditions. The lack of access to the fields due to insecurity during the growing season increases the risks of food insecurity in the coming months. Thanks to joint efforts, education authorities, partners and UNICEF supported the continuation of normal school activities in the 11 schools in Paoua. The integration of displaced children into schools is ongoing with 5,123 displaced pupils (1,941 girls) attending school. 15 unaccompanied children (NA) were reunited with their families.

In Bangassou, the security situation remained volatile. For months, armed groups have prohibited neighboring residents to bring regular supply to the Petit Séminaire IDP site. Joint advocacy activities conducted towards armed groups by UNICEF’s partner Enfants Sans Frontières and Sisters from the Catholic Church allowed the population to have access to the IDP site and sell various essential items. 211 displaced children (89 girls and 122 boys) from the Petit Séminaire IDP site now have free access for the rest of the year to the Sisters' private primary school, with UNICEF support. However, no solution has been found yet to reintegrate the 108 high school students living in this site.","UNICEF Central African Republic Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/unicef-central-african-republic-humanitarian-situation-report-9

9,central+african+republic,"Ongoing war has resulted in a protracted humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic (CAR), creating severe health needs among the population.

After the deadly civil war that took place in 2013-2014, CAR enjoyed a period of relative calm. However, tensions between the more numerous armed groups exploded again at the end of 2016, throwing the country into a renewed spiral of violence. The conflict developed throughout 2017 and into 2018 in the form of violent attacks in several locations, creating dire health needs among the population.

Armed groups control 70 per cent of the country, and large numbers of wounded have little options for treatment.

Some of the wounded are referred to the Central African capital of Bangui for treatment for want of specialist facilities elsewhere in the country. Jean-Noel was shot in the left leg and came to Bangui for treatment. “We were in the fields collecting cassava. A militia arrived in our village, Ouogo. They surrounded us. They shot at us.” His life was saved but he lost his leg. For Jean-Noel and many others, the violence in the country has led to life-altering injuries. Not everyone will be able to access the healthcare they need, with populations in many areas unreachable owing to the ongoing conflict.

Women and children, already a vulnerable group in times of conflict, face ever-greater challenges.

Even for those not directly injured in conflict, the violence has had a direct impact on access to medical care, food, water, shelter and education. “A mother can have 7 to 10 children,” says Adele Priska Yazando, midwife at MSF’s project in Castor Hospital, in Bangui. “She doesn’t have enough money to pay for prenatal care, nor the means to take care of her and her baby’s health. Because of this we receive patients with complications.”

In many regions, MSF health structures are the only place for people to seek treatment free of charge.

In Kabo and Bambari, in the north and south of CAR, respectively, MSF-supported hospitals are the only places offering treatment for those with bullet wounds. In March, Bambari experienced a particularly violent episode, with teams receiving 14 patients with gunshot wounds in one evening. But other regions are inaccessible to those providing healthcare, and people affected by the conflict lack the resources to pay for treatment and medication.

MSF provides free healthcare to mothers across the country, as well as providing medical care and assistance to survivors of sexual violence in various locations across CAR. MSF offers outpatient and inpatient care to local communities and internally displaced people in 10 provinces. In Batangafo and Kabo, Boguila and Bossangoa (Ouham), Paoua (Ouham-Pendé), Carnot (Mambéré-Kadéï), Bangassou (Mbomou), Bambari (Ouaka), Bria (Haute-Kotto), and the capital Bangui, the team provides basic, specialised and emergency care, as well as maternity and paediatric services.",CAR: Four things to know about the conflict in the Central African Republic,http://www.msf.org/en/article/car-four-things-know-about-conflict-central-african-republic

Acts of utter cowardice led to the deaths of several civilians, including a catholic Father Albert Tougoumalé-Baba following the attack on the Fatima Church in the 6th district of Bangui, while presiding over a mass to mark the St Joseph Day.

“I am shocked by the death of Father Tougoumalé-Baba who was one of the defenders of the Boeing Pact of Non-Aggression,” said Najat Rochdi. This pact enabled the Muslim community in the surrounding neighborhoods to give their dead a befitting burial according to the precepts of Islam. The Humanitarian Coordinator also regrets that today’s violence has taken on a religious dimension ignoring the respect due to places of worship, including churches and mosques.

The Humanitarian Coordinator deplores the threats on health structures and their staff members.

Najat Rochdi reminds that it is contrary to International Humanitarian Law and calls on “the sons and daughters of the Central African Republic to put the future of the country above all other considerations”. She also requests them to respect the humanitarian character of the health structures in accordance with international law.

“Once again, it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who are paying the price for violence,” said Rochdi. The Humanitarian Coordinator calls on “Central African women to raise their voices against the manipulation of young people and to defend peace”.

11,central+african+republic,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – After five years of crisis, the people of the Central African Republic are tired of conflict.

Christophe Droeven, the Catholic Relief Services country representative for CAR, told Crux that although the situation is improving in the capital Bangui, the violence is getting worse in the rest of the country.

“What’s especially concerning is that violence against civilians is increasing, driving even more people from their homes,” he said.

The country has experienced instability since 2013, when Seleka, a Muslim-majority militia movement, overthrew the government. The Christian-dominated Anti-Balaka militia then formed to fight the Seleka. French and African peacekeepers were deployed in January 2014 and drove the Seleka forces from the capital, Bangui.

With a newly elected government unable to move beyond Bangui, armed groups and militias have taken control of more than 70 percent of the country.

The United Nations says the conflict has left at least 1.1 million people destitute and homeless, with about 2.5 million people – more than half of CAR’s four million inhabitants – now in need of humanitarian assistance.

Droeven said access for humanitarian workers is almost completely cut off in certain areas, and it is becoming more dangerous to operate in the country.

In 2017, 16 humanitarian workers were confirmed to have been killed in the country.

“That’s 16 too many,” Droeven told Crux.

The CRS staffer said the people in the country are scared that anything could happen to them at any time.

“This is a place where armed groups roam freely and there are rarely consequences to their actions. What people here want more than anything is to go back home to a normal life and to a restored peace. They want to send their children to school and to cultivate their land,” Droeven said.

Catholic Relief Services has been trying as best it can to bring respite to the affected people. The U.S.-based aid agency has partnered with other relief agencies in an interfaith effort to build the peace in the Central African Republic.

“Through CIPP, CRS and our partners have reached more than 8,000 people with services ranging from trauma healing and inter-communal dialogues to livelihoods recovery. Perhaps more importantly, our interventions are supporting grassroots civil society and religious organizations of all faiths to implement community peace- building initiatives – ensuring that those closest to the problem are empowered to solve it,” Droeven told Crux.

Pope Francis visited Bangui in 2015 and met with Muslim leaders, emphasizing the need for inter-religious peace and dialogue.

Christians make up about 80 percent of the population of the Central African Republic, and Muslims about 15 percent.

The Muslim population is concentrated in the north of the country, touches on the Sahel region of Africa, although there are many Muslim traders in the south.

The southern city of Bangassou has become a flashpoint in the conflict. Rebels attacked a Muslim quarter on May 13, 2017, leaving 115 dead, including six UN peacekeepers.

The Catholic cathedral in the city has become home to some 2,000 Muslims who live under the protection of the Catholic bishop, Spaniard Juan José Aguirre Muñoz.

In trying to forge a peace, CRS and its partners have to deal with people suffering from trauma, some of whom have already lost faith in life itself.

“CRS’s trauma healing approach focuses on helping people understand the causes and symptoms of their trauma as well as how to manage those symptoms,” Droeven said to Crux.

He told the story of a woman whose home was recently destroyed, but who was able to overcome the traumatic experience, thanks to one of CRS’s workshops on how to deal with such experiences.

“If I hadn’t participated in the (trauma healing) workshop, I don’t know if I would have been able to handle this loss. But I’m keeping my courage, and I keep reminding myself ‘after everything, life continues,’” Droeven quoted the woman as saying.

He said preliminary results from an impact study conducted by Palo Alto University on CIPP’s trauma healing and peace education approaches showed that the interventions reduced anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among participants.

While the needs for humanitarian assistance continue to rise, the capacity of both the UN and the government of the CAR to intervene are limited, said Droeven.

“The UN Peace mission is trying to secure the countryside and bring back peace, but it’s stretched beyond capacity by the growing violence in this vast country,” he said. “It needs more support from the international community because its mandate and mission are not comparable to the amount of support it receives.”

Droeven emphasized the need for the government, UN peace mission, relief agencies, civil society and religious leaders to work together to bring back peace and hope to the population of “this forgotten country.”","Central African Republic “tired” of conflict, fearful for future",https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/04/14/central-african-republic-tired-of-conflict-fearful-for-future/

AID WORKER ATTACKS THREATEN ACCESS

Armed men on 11 April attacked and seized an aid worker near Kouango town in the southern Ouaka prefecture. The aid worker was released, but his belongings were taken. A week earlier, gunmen abducted a driver with an international aid group also near Kouango. The attacks risk affecting humanitarian access in the area. Efforts are underway to sensitise on the neutrality of humanitarian workers.

FIRST GROUP OF SUDANESE REFUGEES RETURN HOME

The first group of Sudanese refugees willing to return home left on 14 April. Fifty-three people were repatriated under the terms of a May 2017 agreement between Chad, Sudan and UNHCR on voluntary refugee return. More than 329,000 Sudanese have been living in eastern Chad for over a decade.

Many are unwilling to return due to persistent insecurity back home. Meanwhile, around 4,000 Chadians in Darfur have returned home since December 2017.

CLASHES FORCE 3,000 TO FLEE TO BURKINA FASO

Since February, intercommunity clashes have forced around 3,000 people – mainly from Koro locality in Mali’s northern Gao region – to flee to Burkina Faso. The clashes between Dogon and Peul communities have also claimed several lives. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth. Rising intercommunal tension has also been reported around the Mali - Niger border following the 11 April abduction of a German aid worker in Niger.

MENINGITIS AT ALERT LEVEL IN FOUR HEALTH DISTRICTS

On 16 April, health authorities announced that four health districts in Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions had reached the meningitis alert threshold, meaning five cases per 100,000 people per week. While no health district has reached the epidemic threshold (10 cases per 100,000), several health centres in Maradi and Tahoua regions have reached the epidemic levels. Health authorities have enough medicines for over 4,000 patients. A vaccination campaign targeting people between two and 29 years old is being organised. In 2017, Niger recorded 3,506 cases of meningitis, causing 232 deaths.

VIOLENCE FORCES 300,000 CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL

More than 300,000 children have been forced from schools due to persistent farmerherder clashes in Benue state, the state’s top education official said on 17 April. Several primary schools in the four worst-hit localities have either been burned or occupied by armed herders. In some localities schools are now hosting displaced people. With a daily influx of displaced people into camps, there are hardly any spaces to set up learning areas for children. Clashes and killings continue to escalate in the north-central region, particularly in Benue and Nasarawa states with more than 50 people killed recently.",West and Central Africa: Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot (17 - 23 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/west-and-central-africa-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-17-1

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.",Eden Under Siege: Saving a Pristine Wilderness from Militarized Poachers and a Humanitarian Crisis,https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/eden-under-siege-saving-pristine-wilderness-militarized-poachers-and-humanitarian-crisis

AID CONVOY UNDER ATTACK NEAR KAGA BANDORO

Armed men on 23 April robbed a vehicle in an aid convoy near the northern Kaga Bandoro town, but were later intercepted some 100km away. Insecurity remains prevalent in several regions of CAR and aid convoys are the target of robberies and armed attacks. These incidents are a constant hindrance to relief operations and civilian movement and safety.

AID WORKERS FACE RECURRENT ATTACKS IN TIMBUKTU REGION

On 22 April, three unidentified armed men robbed aid workers in their accommodation in the town of Gossi, in the northern Timbuktu region. The assailants then looted the premises of the NGO these aid workers belong to, after firing at the guard, who managed to escape. The armed robbers stole motorcycles, phones and computers. This is the fifth incident in Gossi area since the beginning of the year. Earlier, on 19 April assailants attacked four aid workers near Gossi and robbed one of their vehicles. The incident forced an international NGO that recently launched mobile clinic consultations for new IDPs and asylum seekers to suspend the activity.

MAIDUGURI SHAKEN BY WORST ATTACK IN MONTHS

On 26 April, a Non-State Armed Group launched a multi-pronged attack on Born state capital, Maiduguri, triggering panic among the population and causing residents to flee. Reports indicate that blasts and gunfire could be heard across the city as the raid was carried out, reportedly, by around 100 attackers, including suicide bombers. The military repelled the attack and encouraged residents to return home. The incident is amongst the most significant in recent months, amid a worrying increase in security incidents in Borno state. Maiduguri is at the epicentre of the humanitarian crisis in the north-east of Nigeria and currently hosts over 260,000 internally displaced persons.

MENINGITIS CASES MORE THAN DOUBLE IN TWO WEEK

As of 22 April, 930 cases of meningitis, including 70 deaths, were reported with a fatality rate of 7.5 per cent. The number of reported cases has doubled over two weeks. However, they are lower than in the same period in 2017 (2,587 cases and 117 deaths). The health district of Keita in Tahoua region has reached the epidemic threshold, and four other health districts in the Maradi, Tahoua and Tillabéri regions are in alert phase. Epidemiological surveillance, pre-positioning of medical supplies and a vaccination campaign targeting people between 2 and 29 years of age are all ongoing.

HUMANITARIAN AID IMPEDED BY MILITARY OPERATIONS

The ongoing military offensive by the Joint Multinational Task Force (MNJTF) against armed groups presumably affiliated with Boko Haram on the islands of Lake Chad and areas along the Komadougou river is restricting humanitarian operations in the area.

15,central+african+republic,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said that Nigeria had initiated measures to mitigate the negative effects of the shrinking Lake Chad on the people of the area.

The president, who was represented by the Borno Governor, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, stated this in Maiduguri while declaring open the First Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum.

The president, who also sought the support of the international community in addressing effects of climate change, said Nigeria was working diligently to address the plight of the people living on the Nigeria’s side of the lake.

Buhari, who noted that the Lake Chad issues must be treated with the required urgency, called on all stakeholders to share the mission of rescuing the Lake Chad Basin from extinction.

He said there was the need to find workable solutions in resuscitating the lake to the benefit of all member-countries in the region.

He added that the people living in the basin depended on the lake for agriculture, fisheries and livestock for their economic well-being.

“The Lake Chad is very dear to our heart as it is a source of livelihood to over 45 million people living in the Basin.

‘‘This Lake, which is one of the oldest Lakes in Africa, is shared by Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria,” he said.

He noted that the Lake Chad region was formerly an “oasis in the desert”, a hub of economic activities and food security, providing a source of happiness and contentment that contributed to the stability of the sub-region.

“Unfortunately, the ‘oasis in the desert’ is almost a desert now, due to the drying up of Lake Chad occasioned by the effects of global warming and population explosion.

Mr Edward Kallon, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Nigeria, said despite the progress made on the security and humanitarian front in recent years, more needed to be done to assure the people of the Lake Chad Basin of their safety.

“The people of this region have suffered for far too long and we need to redouble our collective efforts to address the underlying causes of the crisis.’’

Kallon noted that the forum would enhance the effective participation of local communities defining pathways to the crisis facing the region.

“We must further more enhance cooperation around stabilisation, peace building and conflict prevention.’’

Kallon, who also advocated a multi-pronged approach to Lake Chad Basin crisis, urged the governor to support UN to address the crisis.",Buhari pledges to mitigate effects of drying Lake Chad,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/buhari-pledges-mitigate-effects-drying-lake-chad/
