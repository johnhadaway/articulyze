0,central+african+republic,"On a late Saturday morning in the Miskine neighborhood of Bangui, the war engulfing the Central African Republic seems far away. There are no militiamen clashing in the streets or eerie, abandoned fields that smell of rot. In Miskine, people are busy living, not dying. Scratchy radios blare music and women call out greetings from doorways. Kids chase each other, sending tiny chicks scuttling after their mother hen.

Sixteen-year-old Fortuné Kibinda seems oblivious to the noise. He’s crouched over an open fire in front of his house, making a full meal of fish, rice and fried yams. He’s sweating — he’s got to finish by 1 p.m., in time for his friend Abigail’s birthday party.

""I’m making something to surprise her,” Fortuné says, grinning.

Abigail is a member of the youth singing group that Fortuné started.

Kids in this neighborhood are lucky to be back in school: For years, the fighting that bled across the capital put their education on hold. Still, school here is basic, with no extracurriculars, so these kids organize singing practices themselves, meeting after school and after church on Sundays.

A few hours later, the eight young members of Fortuné’s singing group stand in a circle in Abigail’s living room.

The rice and fish that Fortuné made are sitting on a big wooden table. Before the friends dig in, he leads them in prayer.

Fortuné’s voice soars above the harmonies of the other children: “There is no one behind me, no one ahead of me, you are everything, oh, Jesus.”

A breath after the song finishes, Fortuné calls out with the cadence and stature of the preachers he must study in church each Sunday.

“All together, we’ll raise our voices, say thank you to the Lord!” he cries, before dropping his voice to a furious whisper to deliver his own private prayer.

Abigail says the final grace, her voice soft but earnest.

The group’s name is Efficace Divine — which means “Divine Efficiency” in French. Faith is important to these kids, as it is to many just trying to exist in Central African Republic.

“We go to church together,” Fortuné says. “I heard how they sing and that’s why I invited them to be my singers.”

The youngest member is just 10, while Fortuné and Abigail are the oldest — at 16.

A worn notebook contains their entire repertoire of hymns, which Fortuné wrote out by hand.

The name Efficace Divine once belonged to another one of Fortuné’s projects. Just over a year ago, he opened a kiosk where he sold coffee and spaghetti. As his business grew, he dreamed of someday owning a chain of restaurants, of being a successful businessman.

Then, one day, he went to open his kiosk — and found the entire wooden structure gone.

“I asked around and people told me it had been stolen during night,” he says. “My mind was empty. I just started crying. And then I went home.”

For Fortuné, the loss of his stand also represented the loss of the future.

“It was all I had to help me to get ahead,” he says. “That’s why I cried.”

Fortuné lives with his great aunt, a housecleaner, and she didn’t have the money to help him rebuild the kiosk.

So, Fortuné threw himself into something that didn’t require an upfront investment — singing.

“What changed in my life is that I’m getting ahead in music,” he says.

A photo in the family’s living room shows Fortuné in a recording studio, wearing big headphones. The picture was taken when he recorded a song, which now plays on a local Christian radio station. The experience made him even more excited about his group.

""We want to make a CD, release an album and send it to countries across Africa,” he says.

But all that would require money.

“If I had some money again,” he says, “I could restart my kiosk and then invest in my singing group.”

But money is hard to come by in this country, where most people are just scraping by.

So, Fortuné thinks the most likely way he’d get some money would be through divine intervention. He prays a lot. It keeps the uncertainty of the present and the sadness of the past from swallowing him up — things like the loss of his mother, who died while the family was living in a refugee camp.

“I don’t think about her. I only think about God,” he says, voice wavering.

He also says he doesn’t even have time to think about girls.

Not even Abigail?

“No, no, no,” he says, shaking his head. “No. I have a lot to do in my life. There’ll be time for that in the future.”

He smiles, though.

But the truth is the crisis in the Central African Republic is getting worse. Bangui, where Fortuné lives, has some law and order, but much of the rest of the country is controlled by militia groups that regularly target civilians. There’s widespread hunger and hundreds of thousands of people displaced.

His country may be crumbling around him, but Fortuné is so sure that he’ll come out okay, that his faith will carry him through. In fact, there’s this line in the song that he has playing on the radio. In it, he’s speaking directly to God.

“I know that with you, I’ll triumph,” he sings. “I’ll reach the destiny that’s burning in me.”

It’s an amazing destiny, if only he can reach it.

As delivered

Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you for joining us for this briefing on the Central African Republic and I am delighted to be joined on the podium by H.E. Ms. Ambroisine Kpongo, the Permanent Representative of the Central African Republic to the United Nations.

I am very pleased to be here to discuss the situation in the Central African Republic following my mission to the country last month, and I wish to express my appreciation to the Government and to the people of the Central African Republic for their warm welcome and support throughout my visit.

The situation in the Central African Republic has further deteriorated since the Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, briefed you in November last year. Two years after the democratic elections, conflict is escalating. Violence is fast spreading across the country, creating new emergencies while urgent and critical needs that existed before are deepening further.

The number of people displaced within and outside the Central African Republic has reached record high levels. Currently more than 690,000 people have been internally displaced – which is an increase since last year of 72 per cent. Over 546,000 people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries – that is more than 20 per cent more than last year. Insecurity and recurrent displacement led to a 58 per cent decline in crop production, as well as increased food prices and rising malnutrition levels. 1.1 million people are moderately or severely food insecure, and in 2018, an estimated 37,000 children under 5 years will suffer from severe acute malnutrition. Less than half of all children are fully immunized and 1.7 million people are without access to safe water, 800,000 of which are children.

With the upsurge in violence, the recruitment and use of children by armed groups increased by 50 per cent between 2016 and 2017 and, due to insecurity, approximately one in four children is out of school. These figures are even more striking when considering that the total population in the country is less than 5 million, and we estimate that 2.5 million people – more than half of the country’s population – need humanitarian assistance.

During my mission, I met with Government officials, United Nations agencies, the leadership of the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), NGO partners, religious leaders and the diplomatic community. I met with internally displaced persons in Paoua, in northwestern Central African Republic, and in the PK5 neighbourhood in the capital, Bangui. I also met with returnees in Bangui’s Bimbo neighbourhood.

Civilians continue to bear the brunt of violence. Women, men, boys and girls are severely affected by the crisis. Too often they are uprooted and forced to flee from their homes because of the presence of armed groups and criminal gangs. Mothers I talked to who have been displaced and are in return sites in Bangui and Paoua were shaken, and I was really shaken listening to the stories that they recounted to me of the violence they experienced while fleeing their homes. They also reminded me how their communities urgently require security, food, water, education and jobs to prevent the youth from joining armed groups.

Armed clashes are affecting towns and villages which were relatively calm and where communities have previously lived peacefully side by side. Countless women, girls, boys and men have been raped. The number of children taken by armed groups has increased in the past year. Cases of torture and inhumane treatment, including enslavement and sexual exploitation of minorities, have not stopped since the conflict erupted.

The latest escalation of violence has come at a time when the Government and the people of the Central African Republic were recovering from years of instability. However, several officials I met in Bangui expressed their optimism about the outlook for the country, and the satisfaction for the work done so far in starting to re-deploy – or in some cases such as Birao, in the North of CAR, deploying for the first time – civil servants such as the prefects. I am firmly convinced that the donor community should increase its investments in those areas of the country that have been successfully stabilized.

At the same time, it is also critical to provide a realistic account on the different realities and challenges faced by the population living outside Bangui. For instance, in Paoua, a relatively small town in the northwestern part of the country, close to the country’s borders with Chad and Cameroon, I witnessed first-hand how once relatively stable areas can rapidly relapse into conflict. This bordering area had been identified as a priority area for initiating recovery and development programmes when, last December, violence erupted, brutally displacing over 65,000 people and generating new dire humanitarian needs.

While the State bears the primary responsibility for the protection of civilians, both humanitarian actors and peacekeepers in the Central African Republic continue to prioritize protection in their respective work. And as mentioned before, with MINUSCA’s support, significant progress has been made in bolstering the State presence in the interior of the country. Measures such as building the capacity of local government administrative officials have helped in improving the situation. Despite these developments, people continue to depend heavily on humanitarian organizations’ support because essential social services remain scarce in many parts of the country. Throughout my conversations with various interlocutors, there was a broad consensus that more needs to be done to protect civilians.

I am also concerned that armed groups increasingly instrumentalize religious or ethnic affiliations to manipulate communities to fight each other and incite them to violence. Civilians are targeted because they are artificially described as belonging to an opposing group. Various spoilers of the peace process have fueled this violence by supporting militias or making inflammatory statements. This must stop immediately.

One such example is Bangassou, where some 1,500 internally displaced people from minority groups continue to be trapped and threatened by armed groups. They have been living in the Catholic Church premises since May 2017 when anti-Balaka elements attacked and destroyed Tokoyo, their neighbourhood of origin. Prevailing insecurity and occupation by their assailants of their area of origin prevents them from returning home, while no solution has been found to relocate them to a safer area. These 1,500 IDPs continue to live in fear in what has become another enclave under MINUSCA’s protection. We should commend MINUSCA’s significant efforts to protect civilians when violence erupts, improve security and promote the conditions for the return of IDPs.

As I could see and hear in Paoua, the presence and violent activities of armed groups continue to be a deterrent forcing civilians to remain displaced for long periods of time. It is concerning that entire areas of the Central African Republic have been emptied of communities who had lived there for generations and now strive to maintain family ties, although the social fabric of their towns and villages has been torn apart.

Insecurity also restricts humanitarian access and undermines the response to the most vulnerable. The Central African Republic is one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarian actors to operate in. In 2017, 14 humanitarian workers lost their lives – a 43 per cent increase from the previous year. In the first two months of 2018 alone, six education workers and four health practitioners were killed. In the past year, violence against aid workers has often led to temporary suspensions of humanitarian activities, leaving vulnerable men, women and children without required life-saving assistance.

I therefore reiterate the call I made in the Central African Republic to all parties, and those who have influence in the region and beyond, to respect and ensure the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers and to facilitate humanitarian access. All parties to the conflict must comply with International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law obligations.

Despite the challenges I have mentioned, there is room for hope. The international community, the authorities and the population of the Central African Republic have a strong commitment for the restoration of stability in the country. The people of the Central African Republic want peace, justice and reconciliation. They want to return safely to their homes and rebuild their lives. They want to contribute to the development of their country.

Humanitarian workers continue to stay and to deliver despite persistent insecurity. I met with international NGOs and local NGOs, and I was really impressed and inspired by their dedication and their courage to put their lives on the line to provide humanitarian assistance and protection day by day.

In 2017, 637,000 people received emergency food assistance, 1.4 million people received clean water assistance, while 447,000 IDPs and affected comminutes received aid in sanitation. 27,000 severely acutely malnourished children under the age of five received nutrition support. Over 5,000 households received shelter, non-food items or cash transfers and 22,000 households in IDP sites received access to basic services. As humanitarians continue to save lives and alleviate suffering, it is critical that development actors step up their efforts to address the root causes of the crisis. This will help put an end to the vicious cycle of violence and support the authorities in providing basic social services.

Yet, serious underfunding continues to hamper the work of aid organizations. This year, the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for the Central African Republic, requires almost US$516 million, but so far only 2 percent has been received. Last year, the HRP – in the whole year – received only 39 per cent of its $497 million requirement.

I want to take this opportunity to thank our esteemed donors for their continued support, which allowed the humanitarian community to meet the needs of 1.3 million people in 2017, despite the security and financial constraints I mentioned. And I call on your continuous support to prevent a further deterioration. We cannot afford to neglect the crisis in the Central African Republic any longer, or the price to pay will be much higher than the investments already made.

Thank you very much, and I would now like to give the floor to Her Excellency the Permanent Representative of the Central African Republic to the United Nations.","Assistant-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, Remarks at Member States Briefing on the Central African Republic",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/assistant-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-deputy-2

Description of the disaster

Following clashes between armed groups in the North of Paoua in the Central African Republic (CAR) and a steady upsurge of violence in recent months, since 26 December 2017, an influx of CAR refugees entering the Eastern Logone region in the South of Chad has been observed since 26 December 2017. According to UNHCR Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, released on 12 March 2018, about 19,910 Central African refugees have arrived in Chad since the beginning of 2018. The situation is constantly evolving and according to UNHCR-Chad weekly report of 2 March, during the last week of February approximately 2,500 new arrivals were recorded in the Moissala area. Pre-registrations are on-going as new arrivals continue to be identified.

This latest influx is the largest population movement ever observed since the beginning of the crisis in 2013: It exceeds the total number of arrivals to Chad for the whole year 2017, which amounts to 2,000 people. Given the volatile and unpredictable security situation in the North of CAR (Ouham Pende), the presence of refugees will most likely continue for a long time.

In the context of this crisis, the Government and UNHCR, after noting the limited effects of ""camps"" on the socioeconomic integration of refugees, now favours the settlement of refugees from the emergency phase, into host villages such as the Diba experience. Only a part of the new arrivals is being registered in camps, which often constitute ""islets"" that limit the integration of refugees. In recent weeks, authorities and humanitarian partners have been working on redefining the relocation and identification strategy of these refugee resettlement sites / villages.

Chad Red Cross (CRC), in close collaboration with the ICRC and the French RC, has from the onset of this refugee influx, activated its departmental committee and the local volunteer network to monitor the situation. It equally deployed a joint Red Cross Movement assessment mission in January 2018, to assess the needs of the affected populations.

The initial RCRC Movement joint needs assessment in January, as well as the UNHCR Emergency Response Plan, highlight that over 40 host villages are overwhelmed by a precarious food situation, with urgent needs for shelter, food, drinking water, health, education and care for children. There is also a need to strengthen basic services (water, sanitation and health) in these villages. It is for these reasons that Chad RC is requesting a total amount of CHF 271,180, to support in responding to the direst needs of these refugee and host households.

Bearing in mind that during the first weeks of this refugees’ influx, UNHCR was still working on finetuning its strategy, Chad Red Cross, for proper response and action, took the necessary time to observe the evolution of the situation on the ground while coordinating with all actors to plan accordingly for an adequate intervention to fill existing gaps.

As the situation does not seem to be improving, Chad Red Cross within the framework of this DREF, aims to target the priority gaps highlighted by the Government, as well as UNHCR's weekly report of March 2 and Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, particularly about needs in the WASH sector. Indeed, it is essential to respond before the start of the rainy season, in May-June, to the urgent needs in water, hygiene and sanitation and prevent any epidemic outbreaks, while ensuring better access to basic services.",Chad: Population Movement from the Central African Republic (CAR) - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF n°MDRTD017 / PTD027,https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-population-movement-central-african-republic-car-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-n

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

Insecurity and violence continue to restrict humanitarian access across Central African Republic (CAR). Attacks targeting civilians and humanitarian staff have continued in recent months, with one incident in Ouham Prefecture resulting in four aid worker deaths.

Clashes between armed groups near Ouaka Prefecture’s capital town of Bambari have caused approximately 11,200 people to flee to internally displaced person (IDP) sites in and around Bambari in recent weeks. In addition, an attack against a UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA) base in Ouaka resulted in the death of one peacekeeper on April 3.","Central African Republic - Complex Emergency Fact Sheet #3, Fiscal Year (FY) 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-complex-emergency-fact-sheet-3-fiscal-2
4,central+african+republic,"We met Frederick in the western CAR town of Boda, at a hospital run by an aid group called Alima. He’s 5 years old, emaciated, with ribs pressing through his flesh, and weighs just 19.6 pounds. That’s less than half the weight of an average 5-year-old in America.

His mom, Tefole Raissa, explained that they had fled fighting and no longer have land. “I can’t farm now,” she explained. She doesn’t remember the last time she ate meat or eggs; the family gets by on one evening meal a day of cassava, a starchy tuber with negligible nutrition.

This country is lush, with vast areas of untilled land, and nobody should go hungry. But violence changes everything. Collette Lundi, the mother of one desperately malnourished boy fighting for his life in a hospital, said her husband had been killed by a militia and their house destroyed, leaving the family with nothing to eat but small amounts of cassava.

I asked if she ever eats meat.

She nodded and explained, “We try to catch rats.”",Opinion | ‘Conflict Is More Profitable Than Peace’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/central-african-republic-conflict.html
5,central+african+republic,"A new traveling exhibit that opened Monday April 9 at University Medical Center provides a glimpse of what life is like in refugee camps around the world from the perspective of the people who live there and volunteers with Doctors Without Borders.

Using virtual reality documentaries, photographs, and testimonies from aid workers and patients, the exhibit called Forced from Home, explores the lives of some of the millions of people who have been displaced from their homes either due to armed conflict, political violence, natural or man-made disasters. In 2016 the U. N's refugee agency reported that the number of displaced people reached 65.3 million or one out of 113 people on the planet--the highest number since post-World War II.

The exhibit is self-contained in a mobile trailer and staffed with Doctors Without Borders volunteers from New Orleans, including Dr. Peter Reynaud a local physician and faculty member at the Tulane School of Medicine. Reynaud has completed seven assignments with the humanitarian aid organization over the past 15 years.

He was most recently in the Central African Republic and has also worked with Syrian refugees in northern Iraq as well as earthquake victims in Bangladesh.

""Every place has its own unique challenges but in all we are addressing the basic needs, access to clean water, nutrition, shelter and mental health care,"" Reynaud said pointing to a wall of photographs taken at camps from around the world.

The exhibit includes a virtual reality tour where visitors are able to see aspects of life in four different settlements across the world. In one a young mother from Honduras explains how she had to leave her home country and escape to Mexico after her husband was murdered by local gangs. The organization estimates that 190,000 people are estimated to be displaced in Honduras from violence in 2016, another 504 people were treated by the organization for sexual violence that year.

Another video shows Syrian children singing in their living space in the Domiz Refugee camp in northern Iraq. They are among an estimated 26,500 refugees living in the camp, having fled Syria after civil war broke out in 2011.

Forced from Home is a free exhibit and open to the public from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 9, 10 at the University Medical Center. It will move to Tulane University, McAlister Auditorium on April 11, 12 and be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It will then move to the Peace Quad at Loyola University on April 13 and open from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.",See the global refugee crisis through the eyes of medical aid workers and refugees,http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2018/04/see_the_global_refugee_crisis.html

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

***

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.

Cédric Ganière flies over a bush fire on the Chinko savannah in his tiny, two-seater plane during a mission to spot cattle herders and blazes.

Wearing desert boots, tan chinos, and a checked shirt, Simpson has a coppery glow at odds with his origins in England’s leaden, drizzly north. His accent is an unusual blend: no-nonsense Yorkshire with a southern African twang. He is direct yet understated, with a light, good-humored touch, at ease holding court during Chinko’s nightly group dinners.

“People make conservation complicated,” says Simpson. “It’s not complicated. You just stop the people killing the animals, and then you’re done. How much do I deal with animals on a daily basis? Zero. I deal with people. Sort that out, and the animals are fine.” He pauses. “I wish it was just about animals, though. It’d be much fucking easier.”

The area around the Chinko River was not always a wildlife reserve. From 2005, it was administered by an isolated hunting ranch called Central African Wildlife Adventures, which ran high-end shoots on strict quotas for wealthy tourists. Simpson became general manager in 2011. Soon after, things began to fall apart in the region. Sudanese poachers and LRA rebels had already decimated the once-abundant elephant population; well-armed poaching groups were now butchering the remaining wildlife. “A client would be getting ready to shoot a giant eland, then a whole load of AK-47s would go off nearby and slaughter the entire herd,” recounts Simpson. “We once found an eland with eight AK bullets in it and was still going.” Buffalo were being annihilated; lion prides, poisoned.

In March 2012, Simpson and his team came across 13 victims of an LRA massacre near an illegal gold mine. Their skulls were crushed, and bodies hacked with machetes. He and Erik Mararv, the concession’s founder, went to the capital to answer questions as witnesses but were instead arrested for murder and jailed in a filthy, overcrowded prison. They later learned that an official involved in the ivory trade had pinned the murders on them.

Languishing in prison, the pair realized that the area around the Chinko River needed to be transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. “We had to protect it,” says Simpson. “It was under attack.”

***

Six months later, the trumped-up charges were dropped, and Simpson reunited with his parents in the UK. After three weeks, he and Mararv headed back to eastern CAR to begin the transformation. At first, Simpson says, his team, armed only with hunting rifles, faced poachers carrying AK-47s. But Chinko’s capabilities began to expand after securing funding and, in 2014, coming under the aegis of African Parks—a conservation nonprofit that has national parks covering 10.5 million hectares. A key objective was to clear the reserve of foreign pastoralists. Each dry season, hundreds of thousands of cows are herded south from Chad and Sudan in search of fresh vegetation, a yearly practice known as transhumance, now intensified by drought, desertification, and war.

A Chinko employee monitors screens in the park’s control room, where software plots ranger movement, bush fires, and other crucial information on a Google Earth map.

This tradition has existed for centuries but has altered radically with the proliferation of weapons and involvement of cattle barons who use cows as roving bank accounts. Desertification and conflict across the Sahel have pushed foreign pastoralists deeper into CAR and the Congo as they seek out verdant terrain, especially grasslands away from armed groups who levy taxes on migrating cattle. The animals overgraze land, spread disease, and devastate dry-season soil amid uncontrollable fires that are lit by herders to clear dense brush and encourage new grass growth.

Such mega-herds—each up to 800 strong—pass through the Chinko region. Park rangers have clashed with herders in shootouts, seizing weaponry and veterinary medicines. But diplomacy is preferred. Local negotiators meet with gun-wielding nomads over tea to encourage them to bypass the reserve through a specially designated “corridor,” marked by yellow plastic bags tied to trees. The herders are given food supplies if they don’t stray off the path. “Confidence does not come quickly, but we have started the process of communication,” says Chinko’s lead negotiator, himself the grandson of a cattle trader.

Surprisingly Chinko’s personnel also includes Hervé Ngambo, a short, unassuming man in his late 30s who, from the age of 15, worked as an elephant poacher. “In the bush, I would slowly approach the elephant until I was as close as possible,” he tells me one morning. “Then I would shoot it in its head, ears, or heart.”

At the start, Ngambo says he could leave his village and find an elephant the same day. A decade later, it took him weeks. Mass poaching was taking its toll. “I always had to come home with something. If I didn’t find an elephant, I’d kill a buffalo or other animals. We’d sell some parts and go back out as soon as possible.”

Elephants were the most valuable quarry. Each time he killed one, Ngambo called his contact, a man from CAR, who bought the ivory to sell to foreign dealers. Ngambo says a pair of tusks plus the meat could bag his five-strong hunting team more than $700—a decent sum in this desperately poor region. He claims he killed well over a hundred but has lost count.

As wildlife numbers plummeted, Ngambo struggled to make ends meet. Living near the Chinko boundary, this lifelong hunter was familiar with the park and embarked on a dramatic career change, joining the reserve in 2014 to track wildlife and poaching activity. “I stopped hunting because there were no animals left. I thought Chinko was good because I want my grandchildren to see elephants. Before, I needed to make money and there was no other work. Hunting was just a job. Now I am committed to protecting these animals.”

But only so long as Chinko exists. Ngambo said, “In my community, there is nothing. There is no work. If Chinko stopped tomorrow and I didn’t get a salary, I would have to go back to hunting.”

***

In the heat of a cloudless February afternoon, the helicopter races over Chinko’s savannah, a parched expanse interspersed with snaking trails of gallery forest, seemingly empty of all human life. That is, until the tents come into view.

Several dozen shelters cluster among charred trees. The thump of rotors draws out dozens of figures who disappear amid clouds of billowing dust. Simpson and his deputy, Evelyne Malfliet, step out to face a host of women and children wearing headscarves and vibrant dresses. They are Fulani—Islamic pastoralists by tradition and, in the case of this exiled community, survivors of savage sectarian violence.

Simpson and Malfliet walk through the desolate, makeshift village toward a small thatched hut where they meet with elders. The plight of this community can be traced back to the outbreak of civil war in late 2012, when a majority-Muslim coalition of rebels known as the Séléka advanced on the capital and overthrew the government, committing atrocities on their path to power. Militias composed largely of Christians—the anti-balaka—fought back. Clashes across the country killed thousands.

At the end of a meeting, the park manager, David Simpson, speaks with elders of a community that was displaced by vicious fighting and is now sheltering in Chinko.

The Séléka were eventually ousted, splintering into rival factions that now control some 80 percent of this mineral-rich country. Violence surged again in late 2016, compounding the humanitarian crisis and uprooting hundreds of thousands of people. One of them was Amadou Boukar, who, in March 2017, awoke before dawn to militants attacking his town, Nzako. “They killed lots of people—women and children,” says Boukar, a 41-year-old former shopkeeper and a father of five. “The attack lasted all day.”

Around 380 civilians fled into Chinko, where park staff gave them food and shelter, later relocating them deep in the savannah where the sheer remoteness offers protection, though hyenas and lions stalk their camp at night. “We would have nothing without Chinko,” Boukar continues. “We could not survive alone. But look at these children. There is no school. This is no future for them. We want to go home more than anything. All we need is peace.”

Chinko is a beacon in one of the world’s darkest corners, bringing order and employment in a time of chaos. It fills the void left by a wholly absent state, sending the park’s medical staff into the community and paying for 50 teachers who reach more than a thousand children. At stake is not just the ecology of the region—it’s the people, too.

Two suspected poachers who were arrested deep in the Chinko bush board a helicopter to be taken to a holding cell at the park’s main base.

“The conditions needed for people to thrive are the same conditions for wildlife and ecosystems to thrive,” says Peter Fearnhead, the CEO of African Parks. “If you have an ungoverned area where natural resources are being exploited in an illegal manner, this contributes to the cycle of poverty.” Well-managed reserves, he says, “can radiate a system of good governance over a very, very large area.”

Despite the existential threats and tortuous logistics of keeping Chinko afloat, Fearnhead believes it presents “one of Africa’s greatest conservation opportunities.” Already, against the odds, wildlife is bouncing back. “In CAR, you have this big black hole filled only with tragedy. Chinko portrays hope in a situation where everything is stacked up to be doom and gloom. We are not allowing Eden to be lost. We are in the process of bringing Eden back.”

***

Swaddled in khaki fatigues and a desert scarf, Stefan Maritz, Chinko’s acting assistant law enforcement manager, waits on the airstrip for takeoff in the 95-degree heat. This burly South African, a former lance-corporal, goes on leave tomorrow. Before his departure, there is one last task.

The day before, rangers found a poaching camp, uncovering a haul of carcasses—buffalo, crocodile, giant forest hog, monkey, water buck, and hippo (its teeth, a valuable substitute for elephant ivory). The rangers lay in wait for the poachers’ return, later catching five of them, confiscating shotguns, rifles, machetes, and a large cache of ammunition. These men are suspected to be part of a larger operation, backed by a wealthy businessman.

The chopper takes off and pushes to the south. “Our mission is to fight the wrong,” says Maritz. “In Chinko, there is authority. There are consequences for what you do. Once accountability falls away, nothing works anymore.”

Fifty miles on, the helicopter descends in a forest clearing. Carrying his Kalashnikov, Maritz greets two rangers who emerge from the scratchy, sun-scorched grass escorting two poachers, one of whom wears flip-flops; the other, barefoot and hobbling. For a fortnight these men have slept rough in the forest amid clouds of mosquitos and tsetse flies.

In a patch of shade, I ask them why they’re here. “This is the only way I can make money for my family,” responds Constant, a father of one in his late 30s whose wife is pregnant with their second child. He says he has been working here independently without support for two weeks and insists he wasn’t aware of Chinko’s boundaries. The rangers shake their heads. “There is no work in my village. There are no opportunities. I do this to survive.”

The two men stare into the trees. Constant seems resigned, strangely calm. The other, Kinimapé, looks forlorn—his eyes, bloodshot. After days of pursuing faceless villains in the bush, this is a strange meeting that only blurs the line between good and bad, between greed and desperation.

The rangers lead the men to the helicopter. It thuds back to base where the men are frogmarched to a holding cell for questioning. Three days later, they will be transferred to Bangui to enter the country’s decrepit justice system. Poachers can be jailed for up to ten years, but this is no real indication of the fate of these men. Whoever funded this poaching trip may let them languish behind bars, or pay off the cops and deploy them once more.

The sun slides behind a canopy of dark forest. The sky is a deep, bruised purple, slashed with red. The air is cooler now. After the day’s drama, Simpson is wrapping up before lights-out. He’ll be up by 5:30 AM tomorrow to do it all again.

“Give it five to ten years, Chinko will be the jewel of African Parks,” he says. “This could be a thousand-lion park. We could have 100,000 buffalo. We’ve now created some stability. If we keep on, we’ll see more development. Then, in time, hopefully, peace.”

7,central+african+republic,"'Times' Column Is Slammed For Its Portrayal Of Central African Republic

Enlarge this image toggle caption Florent Vergnes /AFP/Getty Images Florent Vergnes /AFP/Getty Images

The column was supposed to draw attention to a crisis in a country that Americans don't often hear about in the media: the Central African Republic.

Instead, it drew fury on social media this week for its portrayal of CAR and the sources interviewed. Sarah Knuckey, a professor at Columbia University's law school and the co-director of the university's Human Rights Institute, called it ""shallow"" and ""reckless"" in its reporting.

The piece, ""Conflict Is More Profitable Than Peace,"" written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, was published in the Times on March 25. A two-time Pulitzer winner, Kristof explains why years of violence and conflict in the CAR have created major barriers to alleviating poverty, hunger and preventable disease.

Kristof argues that international donors, including the U.S. government, should amp up investments in peace-building efforts like the U.N. peacekeeper budget — not just humanitarian aid.

The story was part of Kristof's annual ""Win A Trip"" contest, where he takes a promising student journalist on a reporting trip to highlight under-covered global development issues. Kristof chose the CAR because it is indeed a country in crisis. It ranks 188 out of 188 in the Human Development Index, which measures such data as life expectancy, education and per capita income.

As for the story's intent, in an interview with NPR on Thursday, Kristof said, ""I was writing a piece about global conflict as an impediment to development and health care. I was using CAR as an example of that. South Sudan would have been as good an example.""

Within hours of publication, Kristof's column was slammed in a tweetstorm on Twitter by Knuckey, who has visited the CAR in her research on human rights crimes. Her tweets ignited a conversation across the global humanitarian community.

There is little recognition of the agency and work of the countless Central Africans who run NGOs, provide healthcare, work for peace, prosecute crimes, risk their lives to protect others 11/n — Sarah Knuckey (@SarahKnuckey) March 25, 2018

He tells his readers that death results from “chaos and dysfunction,” and fails to grapple with the complexities of the conflict, the harms of colonization, the systems & structures leading to poverty 17/n — Sarah Knuckey (@SarahKnuckey) March 25, 2018

""Kristof represented CAR as if it were miserable across the board, and that the people who live there are victims,"" Knuckey told NPR. ""It represents a brand of journalism that has been heavily criticized for decades, and that is harmful.""

Kristof himself says he was a ""little bit"" surprised by the reaction on social media but ""understands the frustration that people have with the lack of coverage about things they care deeply about,"" referring to researchers, academics and aid workers who work to improve conditions in the CAR.

For Moussa Abdoulaye, a Central African activist, founder of a community school and consultant for media companies like Al Jazeera, VICE and HBO, perhaps the worst offense was Kristof's depiction of his country as a hopeless place.

Kristof described the CAR as ""the world's most wretched country,"" ""the capital of human misery"" and home to ""the world's most neglected crisis.""

Abdoulaye, who lives in CAR's capital of Bangui, acknowledges the challenges that a journalist like Kristof might face when reporting about his country. CAR is huge, the size of Spain and Portugal combined, he says. Telecommunications are difficult. There are few roads. ""It's not possible for any journalist to spend five days here and judge the whole country.""

Igor Acko, a Central African program specialist for the U.S. Institute of Peace based in Bangui, agrees somewhat with Kristof's characterizations. War and violence has indeed made life in the CAR ""miserable,"" he says. ""But it's not the most miserable.""

""I have seen more miserable countries,"" he says. ""Despite the conflict and the lack of freedom of movement, [hungry] people in the CAR can still collect food, plants and caterpillars, from the forest or bush to keep on living. Compare that to Somalia or South Sudan [where populations are suffering from lack of food from drought.]""

Many on Twitter were upset that the Central Africans mentioned in Kristof's story were mainly the poor, helpless victims, not voices of authority. The experts quoted were Westerners from large international aid groups like Mercy Corps and Catholic Relief Services.

I do a bit of journalism in Egypt, so I'm interested in one point covered in the critique. Why don't you mention local NGOs and African activists? What is the journalistic merit of omitting those from the story? Since I think I get journalism, I would like your take. — Wael Eskandar (@weskandar) March 27, 2018

Faced with this criticism, Kristof told NPR, ""The U.S. announced a big cut in U.N. peacekeeping funds this year. Finding people who can comment on that larger problem, on U.S. policy, that's more challenging.""

""It's not satisfying,"" says Knuckey of Kristof's response. ""There are Central Africans who work in the human rights space, who are very aware of what would happen if money to U.N. peacekeepers were cut.""

Others were baffled by some of the facts in Kristof's reporting. Acko, for example, couldn't understand why Kristof chose to highlight the Pygmy population.

The article mentioned that a quarter of the country's population has been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict. But the Pygmy people featured in the story were not displaced by violence, says Acko.

They live in a forest community in the southwest region that is relatively protected from conflict, which has mostly taken place in the north. ""Rebels and armed groups cannot move in the forest to reach the Pygmies,"" says Acko.

""That's true,"" says Kristof. ""But they are representative of people who are suffering from the conflict, which affects lives throughout the country when there's lack of government.""

Others have been supportive of Kristof's coverage.

Sarah as you know we have worked with many local CAR NGOS. I still found @NickKristof piece really useful highlighting the macro needs; namely that we need political, rather than humanitarian, solutions to stop war. For my mind it's the greatest challenge our movement faces. — Andrew Hudson (@andrewhudsonau) March 25, 2018

Kristof is trying to get Americans to care about issues beyond our borders (a worthy goal, IMO). You don't do that by telling happy stories of self-determination. Also NYT won't run these. Where will we read them? The stories of people in his CAR story are real & should be told. — Heather Luca (@heatherannluca) March 27, 2018

In an op-ed on the blog Outside the Beltway, James Joyner, a security studies professor at Marine Corps University, wrote, ""He's not writing for the people of CAR but rather for an American elite he's seeking to influence. He wants his readership to feel for the plight of the world's poor and to implore their government to do something about it.""

Still, Joyner wrote that Kristof owes it to his readers to ""continue to learn"" from experts like Knuckey.

Shortly after Knuckey posted the tweets on Sunday, Kristof fired off a tweet in response. ""Thanks for your critique,"" he tweeted. ""I think it's well-meant, but I don't think you get journalism any more than I get law.""

Knuckey and Kristof met at the Times office in New York City to discuss those critiques.

As for the reaction in the CAR, it depends on whom you talk to.

Abdoulaye says his colleagues — a mix of expats and Central Africans who are activists, lawyers and journalists — were ""shocked"" by Kristof's piece. ""They said he was not professional in the way he gathered his information.""

But Acko doesn't think people in general are up in arms.

""The language spoken here is French,"" he says. ""The New York Times publishes in English. Myself, I was not aware of this article until you sent it to me.

""So yeah — there are really few people who have read this article.""

8,central+african+republic,"UNITED NATIONS — Mostly Christian militia fighters attacked a U.N. peacekeeping base in the Central African Republic early Tuesday, and one peacekeeper from Mauritania was killed and 11 others were injured in a gunbattle that lasted several hours, the United Nations said.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the attack by the anti-Balaka militias took place at a temporary U.N. peacekeeping base in Tagbara, about 60 miles northeast of the central mining town of Bambari. The peacekeeping mission said more than 22 anti-Balaka fighters died in the clash.

Dujarric said the U.N. peacekeeping mission sent reinforcements to the base, and he strongly condemned the attack.

The U.N. Security Council condemned the attack “in the strongest terms” and reiterated that attacks against peacekeepers may constitute war crimes. Its members called on the Central African Republic government to swiftly investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Separately, Dujarric said, the U.N. mission reported that later Tuesday morning peacekeepers discovered the bodies of 21 civilians, including four women and four children, in Tagbara. The mission said the bodies were found near a church, and the victims had been killed with “traditional weapons.”

The Security Council said it supports an investigation by the U.N. peacekeeping mission to see if the civilian casualties are linked to the attack against the Tagbara base.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack on peacekeepers and is “outraged” at the killing of the 21 civilians and injuries to 14 other civilians, Dujarric said.

“The secretary-general calls on the Central African Republic authorities to investigate these attacks and quickly bring those responsible to justice,” he said.

In another incident, Dujarric said U.N. peacekeepers were informed Monday evening that a rebel group known as the UPC had detained 23 people in Tagbara, including 13 women, seven men and three children. He said they were released peacefully to U.N. peacekeepers and spent the night at the temporary base to ensure their safety.

The U.N. mission condemned the attacks on civilians and said that “nothing can justify these acts that can be considered war crimes.”

It said an investigation will be carried out that “leaves no possibility for impunity.”

Elsewhere, Dujarric said, U.N. peacekeepers and Central African Republic forces launched a joint operation on Saturday and rescued 15 people who had been taken hostage by the Lord’s Resistance Army rebel group led by Joseph Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.

The LRA has wreaked havoc in central Africa over the years in violent rampages that include the abduction of children. It has taken boys who are then forced to become fighters and girls who become sex slaves, one of the reasons the group has gained international attention in recent times.

The Central African Republic has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

The impoverished country saw a period of relative peace in late 2015 and 2016 but violence has intensified and spread in the past year.

9,central+african+republic,"BODA, Central African Republic — Nina Beina, a widowed mother of 11, couldn’t wait to give me a tour of the land she had just bought. She beamed as she showed me the site where her children will build their homes.

Ms. Beina isn’t a real estate mogul, and like most people here she has no access to banks or formal loans. But she was able to buy the property through a program arising from one of the hot ideas in the global fight against poverty — microsavings. With the help of Catholic Relief Services, an international humanitarian organization, Ms. Beina and her neighbors recently started their own savings group.

The idea is that villagers gather regularly and deposit tiny sums — often less than a dollar — into a pool, which is then lent to a member of the group. The loan is paid back over time, and it is often used to help people start small businesses. For Ms. Beina, the new land for her children will give her more space in her already overcrowded home.

For vulnerable populations, especially women, “it empowers them to save,” said Laura Dills, who oversees a range of Catholic Relief Services’ programming, including the organization’s microfinance efforts. “We’re actually building that capacity to go after loans in a very safe setting that’s not going to risk any of their assets.”",Opinion | Finance Isn’t Just for Fat Cats,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/opinion/finance-isnt-just-for-fat-cats.html

At the broadest level, it’s a mistake to pit sympathy for animals against sympathy for humans. Compassion for other species can also nurture compassion for fellow humans. Empathy isn’t a zero-sum game.

Overseas conservation organizations have also gotten much better at giving local people a stake in the survival of animals. The World Wildlife Fund, which helps manage the Dzanga Sangha Protected Area, supports a health clinic and is starting an education initiative. The refuge hires 240 local people, from rangers to trackers who locate the gorillas and get them habituated to people.

To respond to the crisis, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance organized the donor conference in Geneva on April 13 to make its biggest appeal yet for aid to Congo to provide emergency assistance — including food, sanitation, shelter and education — to more than 13 million people affected by the violence.

Mr. Kita said the calls for assistance are “a demonization campaign.” Congolese officials convened a separate meeting in Geneva with other African officials, asking them denounce the aid effort, according to a diplomat with knowledge of the matter. The other nations did not agree to the request.

Still, diplomats and aid workers say they expect the Congolese government’s opposition to have an effect by making it harder for countries at the conference to agree to donate.

The United Arab Emirates, a co-host of the conference, has already said it would suspend participation if the Congolese government did not support the appeal. Congo also threatened Swedish and Dutch diplomats who helped convene the donor conference, saying they did not consult with their Congolese counterparts and warning of unspecified consequences if the European nations continued with the conference.

Christos Stylianides, the European Commission’s top crisis envoy, said during a visit to Kinshasa late last month that foreign assistance would be ineffective without local government cooperation. Donor nations have already pledged $171 million.

An appeal for aid last year fell far short of needs, as donors provided less than 60 percent of what aid agencies requested.

Jose Barahona, Congo country director for Oxfam International, said he has witnessed firsthand what the funding shortfall means for the ordinary Congolese. His organization had to halve its assistance last year, when promised donor funds did not materialize.

The people left out felt hopeless, he said. He recalled one of them pointing to the ground and saying: “I have two of my younger sons buried here.

The operation, which had targeted, the ""bases of certain criminal groups"" would continue ""until the goal is achieved"", Verhoosel said.

Eight people belonging to the armed groups Force and 50/50 had been detained by Minusca and ammunition had been seized, he added.

The operation comes after a resurgence in violence in the flashpoint PK5 neighbourhood of Bangui.

The Central African Republic has been struggling to return to stability since the country exploded into bloodshed after the 2013 overthrow of longtime leader Francois Bozize by the mainly Muslim Seleka rebel alliance.

France intervened militarily to push out the Seleka alliance but the country remains plagued with violence pitting groups competing for control of resources and areas of influence.

World Watch Monitor

A UN official has called for a new approach to end the still-deepening crisis in the Central African Republic.

The situation in CAR has been deteriorating for five years now, and in the next six months may grow even worse, according to the head of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in CAR, Joseph Inganji.

Speaking to World Watch Monitor last week, Mr Inganji called on “all actors to sit around the table to have a shared analysis and joint planning, in order to cut the vicious cycle of violence, and respond according to each other and everyone’s mandate”.

CAR fell into chaos on 24th March, 2013, when a predominantly Muslim coalition of rebels, known as Séléka, ousted President François Bozizé and took power.

Six months later, in September, 2013, Séléka’s leader, Michel Djotodia, who had proclaimed himself president, disbanded the group and in January, 2014, resigned as President, to be replaced by Catherine Samba-Panza.

Yet during her two-year reign, and that of her successor, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, the conflict continued. More than 14 armed groups are currently active in CAR, together controlling around three quarters of territory.

Recent violence in the eastern village of Séko and its surroundings claimed 46 lives, including that of a priest. Father Joseph Désiré Angbabata, 49, was killed when UPC militants (a Séléka offshoot) stormed his Saint Charles LWANGA parish on 21st March.

Details provided by OCHA revealed that 10 children were among the victims, and as many as 19 villages were burnt down on the 100 kilometres stretch of road between Bambari and Ippy. As a result, thousands fled their homes and are now living three newly built camps, including one within the compound of the Catholic Church in Séko, which alone is housing more than 5,000 people.

Mr Inganji told World Watch Monitor the protection of civilian remains a major concern and that, in the absence of a functioning national army (disbanded in 2013 when Séléka took power), the UN’s Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) has a key role. However, he said the UN peacekeepers need to change their modus operandi because the conflict has evolved.

“We have seen the fragmentation of armed groups,” he said. “These groups are adopting a guerrilla sort of warfare, while perpetrating gross violations of human rights.”

Mr Injanji said development agencies must address the root causes of the conflict by turning their focus to conflict-resolution, reconciliation, security-sector reform and DDR (disarmament, demobilisation and reinsertion).

He called on aid and development groups and peacekeepers to set “a peace-humanitarian-development nexus”.

The government must also play a key role, he said: “The government has the sovereign responsibility for protection of civilians. That’s why, with the deployment of prefects [administrators] in the remote areas, the FACA [CAR’s armed forces] should be deployed to ensure and reinforce the rule of law.

“Unless we all sit together to have a joint analysis, agreed way forward together with the government, and all actors in the theatre, the situation will continue to deteriorate in the coming days.”

Some 2.5 million people – more than half of CAR’s four million inhabitants – are now in need of humanitarian assistance, the highest per capita caseload globally, according to the UN.

Despite the deepening crisis, humanitarian funding is currently at its “worst” and “lowest” level, says Mr Inganji. So far, only two per cent of the $US515.6 million dollars needed has been funded.

“If we’ve got nothing to provide assistance to the needy people, it means that these people will die because we cannot give them our empty hands,” he said. “People require water and sanitation; they require food; they require medicine, etc.”

The head of OCHA called on donors to step up funding for humanitarian and development needs, before warning: “If nothing is done, the international community will be forced in future to use more resources to address the situation. But if there’s funding for humanitarian – alongside development – actions, CAR will remain a model in the world where other countries can replicate the manner in which a crisis needs to be handled.”

The violence in CAR is often portrayed as a sectarian conflict, but the country’s top three religious leaders – who head up the CAR’s Interfaith Group – say the conflict relates more to land and resource grabbing.

On 20th March, during a briefing at the UN Office in Geneva, Cardinal Dieudonné Nzapalainga, the Archbishop of the capital Bangui, denounced the “business of war” developed by armed groups in order to continue to exploit the resources of the country.

“Since 2013, children are no longer going to school in some regions,” he said. “Which kind of future are we preparing for this country with a whole generation sacrificed?”

Meanwhile, Imam Omar Kobine Layama, the president of the Islamic Conference in CAR, said “all our efforts remain vain because of the lack of security”.

The imam called on the reinforcement of the state, notably the national army, to accompany the UN peacekeepers already deployed in the country.

Finally, the representative of CAR’s Evangelical Alliance, François Ndeckere Nzogbia, welcomed the contribution of the international community towards the resolution of the crisis in CAR, but said more needs to be done: “We need to be supported strongly in order to stop the acts of these warlords and criminals, who continue to kill central Africans on a daily basis. But unfortunately the echo is not raised loud enough to enable the world to know that somewhere in that world, men and women continue to be killed cowardly.”

The Geneva briefing was organised jointly by the World Evangelical Alliance and the Catholic charity Caritas International.

It was also attended by various key stakeholders, including the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic, Marie-Thérèse Keita Bocoum, who stressed the key role of the religious leaders: “I want to insist on the importance of interreligious dialogue, which will enable each locality of CAR to move forward to listening, forgiveness and reconciliation.”","AFRICA: FIVE YEARS ON, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC CRISIS DEEPENS",https://www.sightmagazine.com.au/features/9097-africa-five-years-on-central-african-republic-crisis-deepens
14,central+african+republic,"Sébastien Jagla, MSF project coordinator in the north of Democratic Republic of Congo, describes the challenges to provide humanitarian assistance to Central African refugees, constantly on the move between two places and with no real home.

“Refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) in the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) can be invisible at times. Since mid-2017, tens of thousands have fled a brutal conflict and settled over the last months on the other side of the Ubangi river, in the Congolese districts of Gbadolite and Mobayi-Mbongo. The current number of refugees stands at approximately 42,000, fewer than the approximately 67,000 at the peak of the displacement some months ago.

It is difficult to trace them. Many are still looking after their fields and remaining properties just a few kilometres away and they go back sporadically to look for food and subsistence. They are constantly on the move, living in uncertainty as part time-refugees and part-time returnees, without really benefitting from either status and being subjected to violence and harassment by different parties on both sides of the river.

Mixing with the local communities

Some have managed to blend into the local communities or to live next to them in small settlements in villages and towns across the riverine Congolese border. They have built their own shelters: usually wooden huts. This allows them to fish and farm while remaining close to their country of origin. However, sometimes difficulties arise when accessing the existing resources and basic services.

Central African refugees in these areas are somewhat removed from the camps where humanitarian assistance from the DRC authorities and UNHCR is concentrated. They are also more difficult to access for the few aid organisations present in a remote region where logistics pose big challenges to intervening in a crisis which, on top of this, has not raised much attention.

Risky crossings

Many of the refugees continue to periodically cross over into CAR despite often facing violence by armed groups on the way or upon their temporary return to the country. As one refugee explained to us, some militiamen cut him with a machete because he went back to collect some remaining coffee harvest. The armed men argued that the refugee man was no longer entitled to harvest since he had chosen to live on the other side of the river.

Other refugees have spoken of similar accounts about their return journeys, but also stories of disputes with local Congolese people when accessing water points or dividing the manioc harvests they were allowed to collect for the benefit of both communities.

Carl Theunis/MSF Since May 2017, dozens of thousands of refugees from the Central African Republic have arrived to the towns of Gbadolite and Mobayi-Mbongo and to the rural area along the Ubangi River of the Democratic Republic of Congo after fleeing conflict in their country.

These daily tensions and, more importantly, the risky returns to an obviously unsafe place, would probably be less prevalent if there were proper humanitarian assistance in place, but what we have seen over the past six months of intervention is that these crossings have become common practice, while the crisis has not managed to raise any kind of awareness.

While this may not be an emergency in terms of mortality and child malnutrition levels, our fixed and mobile teams have observed prevalent severe diseases, with malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections being the most common, a usual pattern in displacement crises. Our teams see very vulnerable people who deserve attention in a context in which the already limited health system and basic services have become clearly overstretched, consequently affecting the host community as well. The lack of visibility and knowledge of this vulnerable population undermines the capacity to address their needs.”

MSF worked between mid-September 2017 and the end of March 2018 supporting two hospitals and nine health centres in the northern Congolese districts of Gbadolite and Mobayi-Mbongo and running mobile clinics for both refugees and the host community.

Teams provided more than 38,600 medical consultations, admitted 3,970 inpatients, treated nearly 2,000 children under five for malnutrition and vaccinated 20,000 children for measles as part of a vaccination campaign against a range of other diseases. Its logistical teams have also helped to improve water and sanitation conditions by constructing 13 boreholes and rehabilitating other water sources.

The intervention has now been handed over to the Ministry of Health after some staff received training, while MSF keeps a surveillance system in Nord-Ubangi province in order to be ready to intervene should an emergency develop.

Since May 2017, MSF has also been providing medical care in the village of Ndu, east of Gbadolite, to more than 12,000 refugees from the Central African city of Bangassou. After an attack on its staff last November, MSF suspended its activities in Bangassou but continues to provide remote support to CAR refugees in Ndu.",CAR/DRC: Lives split over the Congolese border,http://www.msf.org/en/article/cardrc-lives-split-over-congolese-border

A UN spokesperson has called for a new approach to end the still-deepening crisis in the Central African Republic.

The situation in CAR has been deteriorating for five years now, and in the next six months may grow even worse, according to the head of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in CAR, Joseph Inganji.

Speaking to World Watch Monitor last week, Inganji called on “all actors to sit around the table to have a shared analysis and joint planning, in order to cut the vicious cycle of violence, and respond according to each other and everyone’s mandate”.

CAR fell into chaos on 24 March 2013 when a predominantly Muslim coalition of rebels, known as Séléka, ousted President François Bozizé and took power.

Six months later, in September 2013, Séléka’s leader, Michel Djotodia, who had proclaimed himself president, disbanded the group and in January 2014 resigned as president, to be replaced by Catherine Samba-Panza.

Yet during her two-year reign, and that of her successor, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, the conflict continued. More than 14 armed groups are currently active in CAR, together controlling around three quarters of territory.

Recent violence in the eastern village of Séko and its surroundings claimed 46 lives, including that of a priest. Father Joseph Désiré Angbabata, 49, was killed when UPC militants (a Séléka offshoot) stormed his Saint Charles LWANGA parish on Wednesday, 21 March.

Details provided by OCHA revealed that 10 children were among the victims, and as many as 19 villages were burnt down on the 100km stretch of road between Bambari and Ippy. As a result, thousands fled their homes and are now living three newly built camps, including one within the compound of the Catholic Church in Séko, which alone is housing more than 5,000 people.

‘Guerrilla warfare’

Inganji told World Watch Monitor the protection of civilian remains a major concern and that, in the absence of a functioning national army (disbanded in 2013 when Séléka took power), the UN’s Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) has a key role. However, he said the UN peacekeepers need to change their modus operandi because the conflict has evolved.

“We have seen the fragmentation of armed groups,” he said. “These groups are adopting a guerrilla sort of warfare, while perpetrating gross violations of human rights.”

Injanji said development agencies must address the root causes of the conflict by turning their focus to conflict-resolution, reconciliation, security-sector reform and DDR (disarmament, demobilisation and reinsertion).

He called on aid and development groups and peacekeepers to set “a peace-humanitarian-development nexus”.

The government must also play a key role, he said: “The government has the sovereign responsibility for protection of civilians. That’s why, with the deployment of prefects [administrators] in the remote areas, the FACA [CAR’s armed forces] should be deployed to ensure and reinforce the rule of law.

“Unless we all sit together to have a joint analysis, agreed way forward together with the government, and all actors in the theatre, the situation will continue to deteriorate in the coming days.”

Some 2.5 million people – more than half of CAR’s 4 million inhabitants – are now in need of humanitarian assistance, the highest per capita caseload globally, according to the UN.

Despite the deepening crisis, humanitarian funding is currently at its “worst” and “lowest” level, deplores Inganji. So far, only 2% of the $515.6 million dollars needed has been funded.

“If we’ve got nothing to provide assistance to the needy people, it means that these people will die because we cannot give them our empty hands,” he said. “People require water and sanitation; they require food; they require medicine, etc.”

The head of OCHA called on donors to step up funding for humanitarian and development needs, before warning: “If nothing is done, the international community will be forced in future to use more resources to address the situation. But if there’s funding for humanitarian – alongside development – actions, CAR will remain a model in the world where other countries can replicate the manner in which a crisis needs to be handled.”

‘A whole generation sacrificed’

The violence in CAR is often portrayed as a sectarian conflict, but the country’s top three religious leaders – who head up the CAR’s Interfaith Group – say the conflict relates more to land- and resource-grabbing.

On 20 March, during a briefing at the UN Office in Geneva, Cardinal Dieudonné Nzapalainga, the Archbishop of the capital Bangui, denounced the “business of war” developed by armed groups in order to continue to exploit the resources of the country.

“Since 2013, children are no longer going to school in some regions,” he said. “Which kind of future are we preparing for this country with a whole generation sacrificed?”

Meanwhile, Imam Omar Kobine Layama, the president of the Islamic Conference in CAR, said “all our efforts remain vain because of the lack of security”.

The imam called on the reinforcement of the state, notably the national army, to accompany the UN peacekeepers already deployed in the country.

Finally the representative of CAR’s Evangelical Alliance, François Ndeckere Nzogbia, welcomed the contribution of the international community towards the resolution of the crisis in CAR, but said more needs to be done:

“We need to be supported strongly in order to stop the acts of these warlords and criminals, who continue to kill central Africans on a daily basis. But unfortunately the echo is not raised loud enough to enable the world to know that somewhere in that world, men and women continue to be killed cowardly.”

The Geneva briefing was organised jointly by the World Evangelical Alliance and the Catholic charity Caritas International.

It was also attended by various key stakeholders, including the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic, Marie-Thérèse Keita Bocoum, who stressed the key role of the religious leaders:

“I want to insist on the importance of interreligious dialogue, which will enable each locality of CAR to move forward to listening, forgiveness and reconciliation.”

Recently, The Washington Post’s Jack Losh reported on the precarious governance of Central African Republic, where, “[i]n the absence of an effective government, more than a dozen armed groups and a multitude of local militias have usurped control of about 80 percent of the impoverished former French colony.”

Given this crisis, replete with rising social tensions and political violence, in November 2017 the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Central African Republic (MINUSCA), widely known as peacekeepers or “blue helmets.” Over the next year, the Security Council expects MINUSCA to protect civilians, facilitate peace and provide “support for the rule of law.”

But such a mission is likely to fail if we don’t understand what these concepts mean to CAR’s citizens. How do they understand justice? And what do they think about their country’s state and traditional justice systems?

Here’s how we did our research

As part of a program to improve access to justice and combat impunity in CAR, the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI) worked with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative to conduct and jointly analyze a population-based survey in the capital, Bangui, and the surrounding areas of Bimbo and Bégoua. We surveyed 2,650 respondents in October 2016 in the local Sango language, using multi-staged cluster sampling methods. Responses were weighted based on the United Nations’ 2016 estimates of the adult population in each of the 12 covered neighborhoods.

[ Afghanistan’s road to peace won’t be an easy one ]

Here’s the background

In 2013, an alliance of rebel groups called the Séléka took power from President François Bozizé in a coup d’état. In 2014, following cease-fire negotiations, a newly created National Transitional Council shepherded CAR through a reconciliation process that included a national dialogue, known as the Bangui Forum for National Reconciliation.

In 2015, the Forum convened transitional government officials, representatives of certain armed groups, civil society, religious and traditional leaders, and political parties to discuss the way forward. A “fragile peace” held through the national elections in late 2015 and early 2016. But sporadic violence resumed as leaders of various armed groups became disappointed with their exclusion from coveted state positions and faced weak incentives to relinquish their control over territory and resources.

We wanted to know how to strengthen CAR’s justice system by understanding what people thought about justice and dispute resolution. We focused the survey in the capital of Bangui and the surrounding areas of Bimbo and Bégoua — which are less riven by fighting than other parts of CAR where rival rebel groups contend for control.

[ Yes, Central African Republic is a real country. But it’s a very different kind of country. ]

Retributive justice is more popular than restorative justice

Bangui, Bimbo and Bégoua residents have a rather formalistic and retributive view of justice. When asked to define justice, 82 percent of our respondents talked about “applying the law.” The next most common elements included “establishing the truth,” mentioned by 49 percent of respondents, and “punishing those responsible” for wrongs, mentioned by 47 percent. Only 30 percent of our respondents mentioned holding a trial for those accused of crimes. Even fewer mentioned compensating victims or having perpetrators acknowledge or apologize for their crimes.

CAR residents are optimistic about peace and justice but disagree about amnesty

Fully 90 percent of our sample told us that peace is possible; 77 percent said justice is possible.

But public opinion is divided about amnesty as a way to achieve transitional justice. A third of respondents oppose any form of amnesty; 23 percent favor general amnesty; and 39 percent support amnesty for those who were not leaders or did not commit serious crimes during the recent conflict.

Residents of Bangui, Bimbo and Bégoua distrust others

The recent conflict destroyed many social networks. Not surprisingly, most people we surveyed trust few entities other than their families. While 83 percent of respondents said they trust their families, only 52 percent trust the army, which was the runner-up. Only 47 percent say that they trust religious leaders; 42 percent trust others from their own ethnic group; and only one-third trust their neighbors.

Trust drops even lower for local and national authorities, coming in at 29 and 30 percent, and for domestic and international NGOs, at 26 and 24 percent. Residents expressed the least trust in the United Nations, at 14 percent.

[ Should U.N. peacekeepers launch preemptive strikes? ]

Such distrust helps explain why, of those who said they’d actually suffered crimes and disputes during the conflict between late 2015 and late 2016, only a minority, 32 percent, said they’d approached anyone for assistance.

Residents are most inclined to use courts for sexual and gender-based violent crimes

CAR has a history of porous borders and poor governance, which, among other factors, has undermined the nation’s efforts to establish an effective and legitimate justice system. So which types of crimes and disputes would citizens be willing to take to their nation’s courts?

Sexual assault and murder top the list: 69 percent said people should go to the justice system when there’s a murder, while 61 percent said the same for sexual violence. For these crimes, residents said they would be more inclined to go to the courts than to local police, traditional leaders or their families.

But the opposite was true for land disputes, financial disputes, family disputes, domestic violence and theft. For each of these types of disputes, fewer than 35 percent of respondents said they’d use CAR’s justice system for redress.

Why not use the courts? Those who said that they would not go to the justice system explained that they would be deterred because, first, it would take too much time to reach a resolution and, second, it would make their problems public. Those willing to take crimes and disputes to the justice system, by contrast, most often said they’d do so because the resolution would be enforced.

Residents are worried about basic services and humanitarian issues

Bangui residents are most concerned about meeting their basic needs. Little more than a quarter of residents say they are satisfied with their access to housing, food or water. Fewer than 10 percent are satisfied with access to jobs and employment. Successful rule of law reform will depend upon improving citizen access to these fundamental services.

NAIROBI, Kenya — The recent death of a Catholic priest in the Central African Republic demonstrates the delicate nature of peace in the country, where a cardinal and an imam have worked to bring the population toward peace and unity. Fr. Joseph Desire Angbabata, parish priest at St. Charles Lwanga Church in Seko in the southern Diocese of Bambari, died March 21 after he was shot during an attack at the parish. Rebels shot the 48-year-old priest as he intervened to protect refugees camped at the church compound. Such attacks pose risks to Catholic clergy who step up to protect people forced to flee violence in the troubled country. Two forces — the Christian-dominated Anti-Balaka and the rebel Seleka, led by Arab-speaking Islamists — have clashed in the mineral-rich area for years.

The attack on the parish occurred March 20 and lasted about 24 hours, leaving an unknown number of civilians dead. The victims were buried in a mass grave, according to reports. Cardinal Dieudone Nzapalainga of Bangui joined Imam Omar Kobine Layama March 26 in denouncing the priest's killing. ""We strongly condemn these acts. The men of God have task of announcing the path of peace and reconciliation,"" Fides News Agency quoted the two leaders as saying. The two religious leaders have united to steer a fragile peace effort in the country, where Christians make up about 80 percent of the population and Muslims about 15 percent. The country has experienced instability since 2013, when Seleka forces overthrew the government. French and African peacekeepers were deployed in January 2014 and drove the rebels from the capital, Bangui.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The humanitarian situation remains worrying. The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) increased by 72% since January 2017 (from 402,240 IDPs in January 2017 to 693,932 in January 2018) according to OCHA. In Kaga-Bandoro and Bria, dry-season fires destroyed shelters of the most vulnerable persons in IDP sites. In addition, persistent conflicts between armed groups, coupled with the increased criminality notably targeting humanitarian workers in the country (e.g. Paoua, Kambakota, Ngaoundaye, Ndim, Bria, Alindao, Bambari), led to an increase in humanitarian need and the worsening of conditions for humanitarian access.

Due to clashes between armed groups in and outside Paoua in December 2017, around 12,506 households (60,000 people) have been forced to flee and find protection in Paoua throughout January. Some of these IDPs are currently hosted by local families, while others have moved and gathered in several locations in Paoua. The humanitarian community is mobilized to provide multi-sectoral assistance to the most vulnerable people in Paoua, including the IDPs and the host population. Due to insecurity on the main axes around Paoua, humanitarian access remains limited.

In Bria, the protection of civilians remains a challenge in the town and along the axes. Ongoing tensions inside the city and fighting on the Bria-Yalinga axis remain high. The lack of access in this area is a serious problem for the protection monitoring.","UNICEF Central African Republic Humanitarian Situation Report, January 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/unicef-central-african-republic-humanitarian-situation-report-5

On a dirt track beneath a fierce sun, three U.N. peacekeepers guard the dividing line.





On one side of a small bridge lies the rebel stronghold, where gunmen freely roam. On the other is a designated “arms-free zone” on Kaga-Bandoro’s outskirts — a sliver of territory where the “blue helmets” keep the peace and thousands of displaced people shelter around a desolate airstrip.

Years of rebellion, mismanagement and sectarian violence have divided this dusty cattle-trading town and roiled the rest of the Central African Republic, leaving the country’s Western-backed government toothless and unable to exert much authority beyond the capital, Bangui. In the absence of an effective government, more than a dozen armed groups and a multitude of local militias have usurped control of about 80 percent of the impoverished former French colony. Hundreds of thousands have been uprooted from their homes, and more than half of the population is in need of humanitarian aid.

[The Central African Republic could be on the brink of a bloodbath]

Kaga-Bandoro has, for years, shunned central authority. But even in this anarchic space, rebels here and elsewhere throughout the country are providing some show of statehood. The ruling militants run customs, charge taxes, give out fines and operate their own gendarmes.

“The region has government ministries, but all the staff are in Bangui,” said an aid worker in Kaga-Bandoro who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety. “They get their salary still but can’t do anything here.”

These are central Africa’s ministates — overlapping and unrecognized fiefdoms in a Texas-size country riven by disorder, situated in one of the world’s worst neighborhoods. These lawless territories are extremely volatile and controlled by violent groups prone to infighting. With the country surrounded by Islamist insurgencies and other conflicts in Chad, South Sudan and Congo, the spillover from these badlands can fuel — and be fueled by — the region’s chronic instability.

Representatives from the Central African Republic’s Defense, Justice and Humanitarian Action ministries did not respond to requests for comment.

Today’s vicious turf wars stem from the nationwide outbreak of armed conflict in 2013, when the predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power and primarily Christian militias known as anti-Balaka fought back. The violence ebbed with the deployment of international troops, but the crisis has intensified since the Seleka alliance, which lacks a unified hierarchy, disintegrated into competing factions.

[The hospital at the center of a Muslim-Christian war in Africa]

“The situation is worsening, and armed groups are fighting among themselves,” said Joseph Inganji, who leads the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, in the country. “The conflict is moving into areas that were previously deemed safe.”

Kaga-Bandoro, in the country’s north, is held by a group called the Central African Patriotic Movement, or MPC, a former Seleka faction that Human Rights Watch says has razed villages and killed scores of civilians.

Militias are drawn to the country’s mineral wealth and the opportunity to levy taxes on huge cattle migrations each dry season. “It is a scramble for riches,” Inganji said.

These herds are a literal cash cow for Kaga-Bandoro’s local warlord, Mahamat Alkatim. His forces charge a customs tariff on each head of cattle that enters his domain from Chad. Other fees are taken at unofficial checkpoints. The lucrative trade in bush meat — a vital source of subsistence protein in central Africa — is another profitable target for taxation to prop up a rebel statelet.

Exploitation and chaotic rule are nothing new here.

France’s imperial authorities resorted to slavery and other brutal measures during the early 20th century to turn a profit in this remote backwater. Long after the Central African Republic gained independence in 1960, French advisers remained in its ministries, overseeing decadent presidents whose repressive rule promised short-term stability but alienated Muslim areas.

Porous frontiers allow a free flow of arms and mercenaries. Corruption permeates government institutions. Sex-abuse scandals have marred peacekeeping operations. And ham-handed efforts to demobilize militants have exacerbated the very grievances they sought to resolve.

[The growing scandal over the U.N. and “peacekeeper babies”]

This climate of mistrust and instability continues to segregate the country’s diverse population along ethnic and religious lines. The collapse of institutions has led International Crisis Group analysts to brand the country not just a failed state but a “phantom state.”

Within this unwieldy land, rebel groups may well possess tools for military enforcement and economic extraction, but their ministates remain combustible and profoundly limited, lacking reliable public utilities and transparent justice systems.

The task of looking after the population’s most basic needs — food, water, sanitation, health care, schooling — is passed to nonprofit groups. For rebels, this is purely an expedient form of outsourcing.

“We help the population, but we are only providing security,” said Mahouloud Moussa, an official with another rebel group called the Popular Front for the Renaissance of the Central African Republic, or FPRC, which controls large swaths of the country’s northeast and has an outpost in Kaga-Bandoro. “Everything else is done by humanitarian organizations, so there’s no need for us to do it.”

His comments disregard the deadly attacks and financial shortfalls that impede crucial aid operations. Last month, six education workers were killed near the northwestern border with Chad — an impoverished area where about 90,000 civilians have fled a surge in fighting in recent months. Overshadowed by wars in the Middle East, this is a humanitarian crisis in which 1 in 4 people is displaced, with tens of thousands of children severely malnourished.

Despite his rebel affiliations, Moussa wears conventional civilian clothes — white polo shirt, black suit trousers, socks with sandals. FPRC fighters are accused of war crimes, but he says they are a force for good. “We are teaching the population about social cohesion and encourage people not to discriminate against others,” he said.

People such as Olive Kpadomona would disagree. A mother of five in her early 30s, she lives in a cramped tent with her family, alongside thousands of other internally displaced people on ­Kaga-Bandoro’s edge.

Inside her spartan shelter, grubby mattresses are laid on the bare earth. Above, the sky is hazy and gray with dust. Peacekeepers patrol the squalid camp, but fighting still flares between the Muslim rebels outside and the Christian militias within.

“I was eight months pregnant when soldiers attacked my village,” Kpadomona said. “They destroyed all the houses. I ran into the forest and came here. This was two years ago. We get some food, but it’s not enough for my children. We live in fear.”

[The Central African Republic’s complex war, explained in the journey of a Muslim baby girl]

Besides the armed authority of rebel groups, there are other, more promising forms of governance in the Central African Republic.

The Chinko wildlife reserve — funded by a public-private partnership that includes the Central African Republic’s Environment Ministry, USAID, the African Parks network and the Walton Family Foundation — has managed to bring some stability and development to the unruly southeast. Spanning more than 6,800 square miles, Chinko not only protects an extraordinary mix of wildlife but also offers the trappings of a working state, providing education, health care, law enforcement and an economy.

The park funds the salaries of dozens of local teachers and trains its own employees in hygiene, money management and sexual health. Its nurses make visits to nearby communities. Weekly markets supply Chinko’s 450-strong workforce — a boon to this destitute region. A dedicated ranger corps patrols the reserve to combat poaching.

“A strong kernel of law enforcement can have a big impact on a larger region of anarchy,” said David Simpson, Chinko’s park manager. “It’s not as if we set out to do all these activities — we’re here for conservation — but when no one else is around, everyone looks to you for help.”
