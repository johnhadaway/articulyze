0,central+african+republic,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – After five years of crisis, the people of the Central African Republic are tired of conflict.

Christophe Droeven, the Catholic Relief Services country representative for CAR, told Crux that although the situation is improving in the capital Bangui, the violence is getting worse in the rest of the country.

“What’s especially concerning is that violence against civilians is increasing, driving even more people from their homes,” he said.

The country has experienced instability since 2013, when Seleka, a Muslim-majority militia movement, overthrew the government. The Christian-dominated Anti-Balaka militia then formed to fight the Seleka. French and African peacekeepers were deployed in January 2014 and drove the Seleka forces from the capital, Bangui.

With a newly elected government unable to move beyond Bangui, armed groups and militias have taken control of more than 70 percent of the country.

The United Nations says the conflict has left at least 1.1 million people destitute and homeless, with about 2.5 million people – more than half of CAR’s four million inhabitants – now in need of humanitarian assistance.

Droeven said access for humanitarian workers is almost completely cut off in certain areas, and it is becoming more dangerous to operate in the country.

In 2017, 16 humanitarian workers were confirmed to have been killed in the country.

“That’s 16 too many,” Droeven told Crux.

The CRS staffer said the people in the country are scared that anything could happen to them at any time.

“This is a place where armed groups roam freely and there are rarely consequences to their actions. What people here want more than anything is to go back home to a normal life and to a restored peace. They want to send their children to school and to cultivate their land,” Droeven said.

Catholic Relief Services has been trying as best it can to bring respite to the affected people. The U.S.-based aid agency has partnered with other relief agencies in an interfaith effort to build the peace in the Central African Republic.

These partners include the CAR Interreligious Platform, Aegis Trust, Islamic Relief Worldwide, and World Vision International to support sustainable social cohesion through the CAR Interfaith Peace building Partnership (CIPP).

“Through CIPP, CRS and our partners have reached more than 8,000 people with services ranging from trauma healing and inter-communal dialogues to livelihoods recovery. Perhaps more importantly, our interventions are supporting grassroots civil society and religious organizations of all faiths to implement community peace- building initiatives – ensuring that those closest to the problem are empowered to solve it,” Droeven told Crux.

Pope Francis visited Bangui in 2015 and met with Muslim leaders, emphasizing the need for inter-religious peace and dialogue.

Christians make up about 80 percent of the population of the Central African Republic, and Muslims about 15 percent.

The Muslim population is concentrated in the north of the country, touches on the Sahel region of Africa, although there are many Muslim traders in the south.

The southern city of Bangassou has become a flashpoint in the conflict. Rebels attacked a Muslim quarter on May 13, 2017, leaving 115 dead, including six UN peacekeepers.

The Catholic cathedral in the city has become home to some 2,000 Muslims who live under the protection of the Catholic bishop, Spaniard Juan José Aguirre Muñoz.

In trying to forge a peace, CRS and its partners have to deal with people suffering from trauma, some of whom have already lost faith in life itself.

“CRS’s trauma healing approach focuses on helping people understand the causes and symptoms of their trauma as well as how to manage those symptoms,” Droeven said to Crux.

He told the story of a woman whose home was recently destroyed, but who was able to overcome the traumatic experience, thanks to one of CRS’s workshops on how to deal with such experiences.

“If I hadn’t participated in the (trauma healing) workshop, I don’t know if I would have been able to handle this loss. But I’m keeping my courage, and I keep reminding myself ‘after everything, life continues,’” Droeven quoted the woman as saying.

He said preliminary results from an impact study conducted by Palo Alto University on CIPP’s trauma healing and peace education approaches showed that the interventions reduced anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among participants.

While the needs for humanitarian assistance continue to rise, the capacity of both the UN and the government of the CAR to intervene are limited, said Droeven.

“The UN Peace mission is trying to secure the countryside and bring back peace, but it’s stretched beyond capacity by the growing violence in this vast country,” he said. “It needs more support from the international community because its mandate and mission are not comparable to the amount of support it receives.”

Droeven emphasized the need for the government, UN peace mission, relief agencies, civil society and religious leaders to work together to bring back peace and hope to the population of “this forgotten country.”","Central African Republic “tired” of conflict, fearful for future",https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/04/14/central-african-republic-tired-of-conflict-fearful-for-future/

AID CONVOY UNDER ATTACK NEAR KAGA BANDORO

Armed men on 23 April robbed a vehicle in an aid convoy near the northern Kaga Bandoro town, but were later intercepted some 100km away. Insecurity remains prevalent in several regions of CAR and aid convoys are the target of robberies and armed attacks. These incidents are a constant hindrance to relief operations and civilian movement and safety.

On 22 April, three unidentified armed men robbed aid workers in their accommodation in the town of Gossi, in the northern Timbuktu region. The assailants then looted the premises of the NGO these aid workers belong to, after firing at the guard, who managed to escape. The armed robbers stole motorcycles, phones and computers. This is the fifth incident in Gossi area since the beginning of the year. Earlier, on 19 April assailants attacked four aid workers near Gossi and robbed one of their vehicles. The incident forced an international NGO that recently launched mobile clinic consultations for new IDPs and asylum seekers to suspend the activity.

MAIDUGURI SHAKEN BY WORST ATTACK IN MONTHS

On 26 April, a Non-State Armed Group launched a multi-pronged attack on Born state capital, Maiduguri, triggering panic among the population and causing residents to flee. Reports indicate that blasts and gunfire could be heard across the city as the raid was carried out, reportedly, by around 100 attackers, including suicide bombers. The military repelled the attack and encouraged residents to return home. The incident is amongst the most significant in recent months, amid a worrying increase in security incidents in Borno state. Maiduguri is at the epicentre of the humanitarian crisis in the north-east of Nigeria and currently hosts over 260,000 internally displaced persons.

• Two burnt to death in reprisal attacks

• Witness: ‘There were dead bodies everywhere’

Those responsible for the killing and injuring of civilians in Central African Republic (CAR) must not be allowed to hide from justice, Amnesty International said today.

According to reports, at least 20 civilians including a priest were killed and more than 90 injured following fresh sectarian violence which targeted places of worship on 1 May in the capital, Bangui.

In a country where the images from months of horrific violence are still fresh in the memories of people, these renewed tensions could stoke more attacks and bloodshed if those responsible are not stopped once for all Balkissa Ide Siddo, Amnesty International’s Central Africa researcher Share this Twitter

“In a country where the images from months of horrific violence are still fresh in the memories of people, these renewed tensions could stoke more attacks and bloodshed if those responsible are not stopped once for all,” said Balkissa Ide Siddo, Amnesty International’s Central Africa researcher.

“Central African authorities and MINUSCA must send an immediate and clear message to all armed groups and their allies in CAR: No attack against civilians will be tolerated and all those suspected of committing war crimes and other serious human rights violations and abuses will be brought to justice.”

According to information collected by Amnesty International, the violence erupted after security forces attempted to arrest a member of an armed “self-defense” group in the neighborhood of PK5.

Members of the armed “self-defense” group opened fire on security forces in an attempt to rescue their member and in reprisal for the arrest. The situation escalated quickly and members of the armed “self-defense” group, targeted civilians during a mass at the Notre-Dame de Fatima church in Bangui.

A 46-year-old woman who was in the church yesterday told Amnesty international:

‘…We were in the middle of the mass around 11 am when we heard gunshots. At first, it was weak and little by little, it got worse. There were even sounds of grenades. We were attacked. Just in front of me, a boy and a girl fell dead. A girl behind me had her right eye injured. We fled to the presbytery of the abbes. There were dead bodies everywhere… There were many people injured and bleeding on the ground. Boys from the neighborhood pierced the wall behind the church and we escaped from there. We saw many young boys coming from PK5 with weapons... We ran into the neighborhood and we took the bike to go home.’

Another witness said: “… We heard gunshots. We were helpless. There were some FACA who prevented the attackers from entering the parish. If they had entered, we would all be dead.”

She added: “Abbot Toungoumalé Baba was killed. Abbot Lazare was shot and wounded. The priests did their best calling for help but none came. There was no escape route. UN peacekeepers came two hours later, surrounded the parish and we were able to escape. The good people in the neighborhood made a hole in the wall. This is where we escaped from. There was blood everywhere. It was serious. People say 16 people died but I believe there are more than 16 dead. I saw so many people on the ground when we were fleeing.’

According to reports, the same day, at least two Muslims civilians were burnt to death in reprisal attacks.

Since yesterday, the mainly Muslim neighborhood PK5 is shutdown.

A PK5 inhabitant told Amnesty International today: ‘Everyone stays at home. If you go out, to the other side, you will be killed.’

Another women leader from PK5 added: ‘all this is so sad. It’s been like three weeks now that peace returned. We leaders have been raising awareness. Now we are discouraged.’

There’s been an uptick in violence in CAR in the last month with attacks on the village of Tagbara which hosts a MINUSCA temporary base. 11 UN peacekeepers were wounded and more than 22 anti-Balaka armed group members were killed.

“The international community should remain committed, as new names are added to the already long list of victims of violence in the country,” said Balkissa Ide Siddo.

Background

Since December 2013, the conflict in CAR killed thousands of people, displaced hundreds of thousands more, and destroyed countless villages.

The deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), on 15 September 2014, raised hopes for positive change.

Despite the presence of UN force, armed groups are carrying out a range of abuses. Reports of sexual exploitation and abuses by UN peacekeeping troops are also reported.

Amnesty International had launched last year the campaign Justice Now! Towards lasting peace in CAR calling on authorities to commit to a tougher stance against impunity by holding those responsible for serious crimes to account.",Central African Republic: Those responsible for renewed bloodshed must be brought to justice,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/central-african-republic-those-responsible-for-renewed-bloodshed-must-be-brought-to-justice/
3,central+african+republic,"BANGUI, Central African Republic — A priest was among at least 16 people killed Tuesday as new sectarian violence targeted a church, mosques and health facilities in Central African Republic’s capital, an aid group, hospital and the United Nations said.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, which reported six dead, called for calm after some Bangui residents threatened the SICA hospital, where some of the more than 50 people shot and wounded were being treated.

Medical workers have a duty to treat people “regardless of their background, religious or political affiliations,” Anne-Marie Boyeldieu, MSF’s head of mission in Central African Republic, said.

Anger has been high among some in the capital since U.N. peacekeeping mission and local security forces launched a joint operation in the largely Muslim neighborhood of PK5 in early April to arrest members of armed criminal groups after their leaders refused to disarm. The dead bodies of 17 civilians were laid in front of the U.N. peacekeeping offices shortly afterward.

Tuesday’s violence erupted in the PK5 and Fatima neighborhoods, MSF said.

Armed groups are suspected of carrying out the attacks, but citizens fed up with violence are making their anger known in other ways. Residents brought the bodies of the priest and some of the other people killed to the presidential Renaissance Palace. Members of the Presidential Guard dispersed the crowd by firing shots in the air.

In the Lakwanga district, a group of young people ransacked a mosque that had just been rehabilitated as part of a social cohesion project.

At least 10 bodies were brought to the community hospital morgue Tuesday, the head of the facility said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press.

The Catholic St. Joseph Movement, an action group, confirmed that there were 10 dead in addition to the six reported by MSF.

The U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator for Central African Republic, Najat Rochdi, said the people killed included Abbot Albert Tougoumale-Baba, a fervent defender of a non-aggression accord that allowed Muslims to hold burial ceremonies in accordance with their religions.

Tougoumale-Baba’s church in Fatima was attacked, Rochdi said, along with other places of worship, including mosques.

“Once again it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who pay the price of violence,” Rochdi said, calling on women to raise their voices against the recruiting of youth as fighters.

David Brownstein, chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Bangui, condemned the killings as a “cowardly and violent act.” He called for “calm and the cessation of revenge” attacks, which he said would only perpetuate the cycle of violence.

Bangui Mayor Emile Gros Raymond Nakombo appealed to communities to recognize such violence “is the work of those who do not want peace to return to the country.”

Deeply impoverished Central African Republican has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.

A period of relative peace followed in late 2015 and 2016, but violence has intensified and spread in the past year.

4,central+african+republic,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The year 2017 was characterized by a series of crises that has led to an unprecedented increase in humanitarian needs since 2014. It also raises the risk of a return to a major humanitarian crisis. While the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan initially targeted to 2.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian community was forced to revise it in June 2017 to meet the needs of 2.4 million people. Of the 402,240 displaced in January, the Central African Republic registered 600,000 as of July 31, 2017, as much as in August 2014. This trend continued and reached the 688,700 at the end of December, representing 71 per cent increase in one year. At the same time, 545,497 Central Africans sought refuge in neighbouring countries, while the trend was to return in early 2017. Today, 1.1 million people or 1 out of 4 Central Africans are internally displaced or refugees.

This increase was the result of the resurgence of violence and the multiplication of hotspots across the country. Some areas previously known as islands of relative stability have shifted into violence and others that tended to return to calm have fallen back into instability. Growing insecurity due to activism of armed groups has increased tensions and heightened the vulnerability of communities already affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes and seek protection – often around MINUSCA bases and bigger agglomerations – throughout the country.

Impact of violence on humanitarian activities

2017 has also been one of the deadliest years for humanitarians. Security incidents involving aid workers have increased considerably (332 in 2017 against 131 in 2016), placing the Central African Republic among the most dangerous countries in the world. Fourteen humanitarian workers lost their lives in 2017 (6 in 2016). The multiple peaks of violence have also forced humanitarian workers to temporarily suspend their activities on several occasions, and sometimes to relocate their teams. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) relocated 297 humanitarian actors from 29 organizations on 23 occasions.

These suspensions, driven by unprecedented levels of insecurity since 2013, have exacerbated the vulnerability of thousands of people whose survival depends heavily on humanitarian assistance. In Bangassou the majority of humanitarian actors had to suspend their activities and withdraw their permanent presence from the city. The same goes for the city of Batangafo (Ouham Prefecture) where humanitarian actors have been trying to return since early December after the majority of them had to withdraw in September. At 60 kilometers from Batangafo, in the city of Kabo, in December 2017, the cessation of humanitarian activities directly or indirectly affected approximately 100,000 people, including displaced persons.

Restriction of humanitarian access

The reduction of humanitarian space was the result of several factors, including the deterioration of the security situation and the deterioration of road infrastructure throughout the country. Access to certain areas required large-scale logistical and operational resources that were partly lacking for a humanitarian community faced with the growing challenge of underfunding. The increased use of air assets for the delivery of humanitarian assistance was necessary to reach remote populations. Despite these significant constraints, humanitarian workers were able to deliver more than 6,700 tons of humanitarian assistance cargo, by road and by air, from January to September 2017. Despite its prohibitive price, several times, the actors had to give priority to the air route to help the populations inaccessible by terrestrial means and more and more isolated.

Underfunded humanitarian crisis

The Central African Republic is one of the few countries in the world where half of the population needs humanitarian assistance. Adequate funding of humanitarian action was therefore a top priority. However, by the end of 2017, only 39 per cent of the $ 497 million Humanitarian Response Plan was funded of which $22.1 million (11.5% of the 2017 HRP funding) channeled through the CAR HF. Despite this deficit, the humanitarian community was able to provide emergency assistance to more than one million vulnerable people. Over the last years, funding levels have steadily declined from 68 per cent in 2014 (right after the December 2013 outbreak), to 39 per cent in 2017. In this context of chronic humanitarian underfunding, recovery funds were also slow to be materialized on the ground. Surveys in the affected areas revealed alarming socio-economic indicators signs at the end of 2017. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance was estimated at 2.5 million (54%) out of a population of 4.6 million. The overall socio-economic situation of the country is alarming with: 70% of households having no access to potable water, 80 per cent without latrines, 50 per cent in need of food assistance, 20 per cent of schools closed depriving around 70,000 children of education, and an average acute malnutrition rate reaching the emergency threshold of 15 per cent in six health sub-prefectures of the country. The ability of humanitarian actors to respond to critical and urgent needs has been hampered. Regrettably, the needs continued to grow over the years aggravating dangerously the vulnerability of those already affected by the crisis.",Central African Republic Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

6,central+african+republic,"Observers said the assault on the church was most likely in retaliation for the security operation.

“There were several dead on the Muslim side” in the early days of the operation, said Teddy Junior Magbe, country director for Search for Common Ground, an international peace-building organization. “On the day of burial, they warned they were going to take revenge.”

Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch who specializes in the Central African Republic, said roughly 75 percent of the country was controlled by armed groups. Violence has been escalating nationwide since February, largely because earlier peace efforts failed to disarm militia groups, he said.

Former Seleka members have also been threatening to march on the capital. Local activists said they worried that the attack on Tuesday might signal the start of a new wave of instability.

The church attack also set off retaliatory violence in Bangui on Tuesday. Vladimir Monteiro, a spokesman for the United Nations mission in the country, said an “angry mob” had attacked several mosques, injured people on the streets, and damaged United Nations vehicles that were patrolling the city. A United Nations soldier was also injured, he said.

It was the second time in four years that Notre Dame of Fatima has become a symbol of the violence that has cleaved the country, often along religious lines. In 2014, Seleka rebels followed the same pattern, first throwing grenades and then opening fire indiscriminately, targeting people who had sought protection at the church from ongoing clashes.

The ensuing violence has often followed a cycle of revenge attacks between religious communities, but local activists and international observers say that armed actors are manipulating religious identities for their own purposes.

“This is not a religious conflict as such,” said Mr. Mudge, the Human Rights Watch researcher. “Muslims and Christians have lived together there for generations.”

“This is about political leaders who never saw fit to create a functioning state, and who instead benefited from disorder,” he added.

At the same time, Ms. Ekomo-Soignet said, social media — particularly Facebook — has become a hotbed of hate speech, often expressed in religious terms, that is having dangerous consequences offline.

“You’ll see people writing, ‘We have to get revenge, we have to kill them all,’ and people will like and like and like those,” she said. “Then they meet at a bar somewhere in the city and they talk it all through again. It really feeds the perception of one group about the other.”

“After an attack, then you see people say, ‘I told you so.

Promoting access to birth registration and education.

Violent crises in Central African Republic have effected access to birth registration and education. Birth registration needs to be facilitated and barriers removed to enrolling in school and sitting public exams.

Introduction

The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced a succession of violent crises, the most serious taking place between 2013 and 2015. Further outbreaks of violence in May and June 2017 have pushed the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) to 600,000 and CAR refugees in neighbouring countries to 481,000. CAR remains extremely fragile with an estimated 2.4 million people in need of assistance.

Insecurity, violence and forced displacement have severely weakened civil registration and education systems in CAR. In 2010, before the crisis, only 61 percent of children under the age of five were registered at birth. Similarly, challenges in access to education are demonstrated by the 2015 primary net enrolment rate of 72 percent and achievement rate of only 48 percent.

NRC has carried out an assessment on access to birth registration for displacement-affected communities in CAR and its link to enrolling in school and sitting public exams. The results of this research indicate numerous challenges in registering births and that lack of a birth certificate limits access to education, in particular to secondary school and higher education, as well as access to diplomas and certificates.",Legal identity and education in Central African Republic - Briefing Note April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/legal-identity-and-education-central-african-republic-briefing-note

TENSIONS HAMPER HUMANITARIAN MOVEMENTS

Humanitarian movements to and within several towns were disrupted following the 10 April crackdown by UN peacekeepers on armed vigilantes in the capital Bangui. The crackdown prompted sympathetic armed groups to urge retaliation against the UN mission. Armed groups also warned aid workers in some towns against venturing out. At least 145 people and eight peacekeepers were wounded and 31 others, including a peacekeeper, were killed in the skirmishes in Bangui’s PK5 neighbourhood.

9,central+african+republic,"Employing the caisses de résilience approach in the Central African Republic, FAO helped to strengthen the social cohesion of vulnerable communities, while improving their food production capacity.

Almost 50 000 families were assisted through the creation of community groups and establishment of village savings and loan associations in 2 000 villages. Each village savings and loan association received kits for improved rotating savings and credit funds. Microcredit enabled members to invest in income-generating activities and restore small businesses.

FAO provided agricultural inputs (crop and vegetable seeds and tools), processing equipment (cassava mills and groundnut decorticators) and livestock (goats, pigs and poultry). FAO also provided training on good livestock and agricultural practices. Participants in the cash-for-work programme earned about USD 30 per family.

Thanks to the support provided, members of the village savings and loans associations strengthened their technical capacities for agricultural production, and their financial capacities to generate income and restore their livelihoods. They identified common challenges, sought solutions and took collective action to improve their living conditions. This participatory approach contributes to behavioural change, improves access to information for rural populations and strengthens organizational capacities.

Armed groups control 70 per cent of the country, and large numbers of wounded have little options for treatment.

Some of the wounded are referred to the Central African capital of Bangui for treatment for want of specialist facilities elsewhere in the country. Jean-Noel was shot in the left leg and came to Bangui for treatment. “We were in the fields collecting cassava. A militia arrived in our village, Ouogo. They surrounded us. They shot at us.” His life was saved but he lost his leg. For Jean-Noel and many others, the violence in the country has led to life-altering injuries. Not everyone will be able to access the healthcare they need, with populations in many areas unreachable owing to the ongoing conflict.

Women and children, already a vulnerable group in times of conflict, face ever-greater challenges.

Even for those not directly injured in conflict, the violence has had a direct impact on access to medical care, food, water, shelter and education. “A mother can have 7 to 10 children,” says Adele Priska Yazando, midwife at MSF’s project in Castor Hospital, in Bangui. “She doesn’t have enough money to pay for prenatal care, nor the means to take care of her and her baby’s health. Because of this we receive patients with complications.”

In many regions, MSF health structures are the only place for people to seek treatment free of charge.

In Kabo and Bambari, in the north and south of CAR, respectively, MSF-supported hospitals are the only places offering treatment for those with bullet wounds. In March, Bambari experienced a particularly violent episode, with teams receiving 14 patients with gunshot wounds in one evening. But other regions are inaccessible to those providing healthcare, and people affected by the conflict lack the resources to pay for treatment and medication.

MSF provides free healthcare to mothers across the country, as well as providing medical care and assistance to survivors of sexual violence in various locations across CAR. MSF offers outpatient and inpatient care to local communities and internally displaced people in 10 provinces. In Batangafo and Kabo, Boguila and Bossangoa (Ouham), Paoua (Ouham-Pendé), Carnot (Mambéré-Kadéï), Bangassou (Mbomou), Bambari (Ouaka), Bria (Haute-Kotto), and the capital Bangui, the team provides basic, specialised and emergency care, as well as maternity and paediatric services.",CAR: Four things to know about the conflict in the Central African Republic,http://www.msf.org/en/article/car-four-things-know-about-conflict-central-african-republic

12,central+african+republic,"GENEVA (3 May 2018) – A UN human rights expert has called for calm and for all sides to exercise restraint in the Central African Republic (CAR) following deadly attacks in the capital Bangui.

Marie-Thérèse Keita Bocoum urged authorities to strengthen the protection of civilians amid an upsurge in violence across the country.

""I express my condolences to the families of the victims, and I deplore once again all attacks against civilians, humanitarian workers and peacekeepers throughout the country,"" said Ms Keita Bocoum.

She said the upsurge in violence underscored the need to look at implementing a sub-regional strategy on the circulation of arms and the neutralisation of armed groups.

On 26 April, the Independent Expert concluded a visit to Gabon for regional talks on the situation in CAR.

During her mission Ms Keita Bocoum held talks with an adviser to Gabon’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Special Representative for Central Africa and Head of the UN Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), the Deputy Secretary General of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) in charge of the Department of Human Integration, Peace, Security and Stability, and representatives of the diplomatic corps.

Ms Keita-Bocoum praised increased cooperation between the United Nations and ECCAS on regional peace and security issues and their impact on human rights in CAR. ""ECCAS is a key partner in supporting dialogue and the African Initiative for Peace in CAR, as well as backing progress on justice and reconciliation and the humanitarian situation in the country,” she said.

On cross-border issues, the Independent Expert noted ongoing multilateral efforts to reach agreements on issues related to transhumance and recalled the importance of addressing the plight of refugees in Central Africa.

“I appreciate the collaboration between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the ECCAS with regard to sharing experiences, particularly in the context of the ECCAS reform and the mutual reinforcement of regional entities.

“I have also noted developments in the formulation of a regional action plan for implementing the UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security,” Ms Keita Bocoum said.

The Independent Expert’s next mission to the Central African Republic will come ahead of her report in June to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.",Eden Under Siege: Saving a Pristine Wilderness from Militarized Poachers and a Humanitarian Crisis,https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/eden-under-siege-saving-pristine-wilderness-militarized-poachers-and-humanitarian-crisis

17,central+african+republic,"Press release | 1st Standard Humanitarian Fund Allocation | April 2018

Bangui, 27 April 2018 – The Humanitarian Coordinator for Central African Republic (CAR), Najat Rochdi has allocated US$11 million from the Humanitarian Fund (CAR HF) for projects countywide to address urgent humanitarian needs prioritized in the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). This funding will also help in bridging the funding gap observed during the first quarter of the year.

The humanitarian situation in CAR continues to deteriorate due to attacks by armed groups resulting in massive displacements of population. This situation is further exacerbated by extreme poverty, lack of basic social services, and successive conflicts disrupting early recovery initiatives. Against this backdrop, humanitarian needs are increasing and yet funding has diminished significantly.

This funding allocation aims at responding to the immediate and critical needs of people affected by crisis, protracted emergency and support to durable solutions for the return of the displaced persons. Targeted geographic areas include the Prefectures of Ouham Pendé, Ouaka, Mbomou, Haut Mbomou, Mambéré-Kadeï, Basse-Kotto and Haute Kotto. These regions were prioritized due to the severity of needs through a participative and consultative process that involved all the stakeholders of the CAR HF.

Eligible projects will be implemented mainly through a multi-sectoral approach, ensuring that beneficiaries receive a comprehensive package of assistance. Cash programming approach through activities such as inkind assistance, cash-for-work or vouchers will be encouraged as per the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit recommendations aiming at increasing the efficiency of humanitarian assistance.

Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) has continued to increase reaching 680,962 persons as of 31 March 2018. In addition, the number of refugees has reached 568,572 making 1 in 4 Central Africans either displaced internally or in neighboring countries. 2.5 million people, which is more than half of the population of CAR, are in need of humanitarian assistance.

The 2018 HRP requesting $ 515.6 million which aims at covering humanitarian needs of 1.9 million Central Africans is only 8 per cent funded ($38.6 million). “I commend the international community for their generosity towards the people of CAR. Humanitarian needs have grown significantly reaching an unprecedented level while funding remains very low. I urge the international community not to neglect the crisis. The people of CAR need your continuous support and we must not fail them” said Ms. Rochdi. Adequate funding for the 2018 HRP is critical to provide immediate response to the conflict-affected people.

Since January 2018, the CAR HF has received over $10 million through contributions from Belgium,

Denmark, Luxemburg, Sweden, and United Kingdom. In July 2018, the CAR Humanitarian Fund will be celebrating its 10 years’ anniversary since its inception in 2008. $165.2 million has been so far allocated by the fund to respond to emergency projects.

18,central+african+republic,"Militants killed a Roman Catholic priest this week in Bangui, the violence-wracked capital of the Central African Republic where Catholic and other faith leaders had made headway recently mediating between factions.

Former members of the mainly Muslim militant group Seleka are accused of killing Father Albert Toungoumale–Baba on Tuesday (May 1) at the Notre Dame of Fatima Church. Of the hundreds of worshippers gathered at the church, at least 24 were killed and 170 injured by militants who sprayed bullets into the crowd and detonated grenades.

Toungoumale–Baba is the second Catholic priest to be killed in about a month in the CAR.

The murdered priest’s church lies just outside the predominantly Muslim PK5 district of Bangui, where a U.N. peacekeeping force began working last month. The attack on the church is seen as a response to security operations that resulted in the wounding of a leader of a self-defense group that had been accused of terrorizing both Christians and Muslims, said Roman Catholic Bishop Nestor-Desire Nongo-Aziagbia.

The attack on the church Tuesday was followed by attacks on mosques and other Muslim institutions.

Seleka overtook the CAR’s central government in March 2013, and was dissolved months later. But ex-Seleka members still hold sway in the CAR, despite U.N. and other efforts to keep the peace. The Catholic Church maintains a high profile in such efforts but has grown uneasy with the killing of a second priest within weeks.

Last month Father Joseph Desire Angbabata, who served in a parish east of Bangui, died of bullet wounds after rebels targeted his church. He had intervened to protect refugees camped at the church compound from the rebels.

Acts of utter cowardice led to the deaths of several civilians, including a catholic Father Albert Tougoumalé-Baba following the attack on the Fatima Church in the 6th district of Bangui, while presiding over a mass to mark the St Joseph Day.

“I am shocked by the death of Father Tougoumalé-Baba who was one of the defenders of the Boeing Pact of Non-Aggression,” said Najat Rochdi. This pact enabled the Muslim community in the surrounding neighborhoods to give their dead a befitting burial according to the precepts of Islam. The Humanitarian Coordinator also regrets that today’s violence has taken on a religious dimension ignoring the respect due to places of worship, including churches and mosques.

The Humanitarian Coordinator deplores the threats on health structures and their staff members.

Najat Rochdi reminds that it is contrary to International Humanitarian Law and calls on “the sons and daughters of the Central African Republic to put the future of the country above all other considerations”. She also requests them to respect the humanitarian character of the health structures in accordance with international law.

“Once again, it is the civilian population, especially women and children, who are paying the price for violence,” said Rochdi. The Humanitarian Coordinator calls on “Central African women to raise their voices against the manipulation of young people and to defend peace”.

Angry protesters bring corpses to MINUSCA headquarters in Bangui

Central African Republic crisis civil war continues

Muslim vs Catholic violence surges again in CAR capital city Bangui



Aftermath of violence clashes in Bangui, CAR, on May 1 (Defense Post)

Sectarian Muslim versus Christian violence in the Central African Republic (CAR) has continued with armed groups and marauding gangs, both Muslim and Christian, almost nonstop across the country, since the violence began in 2013. The capital city Bangui has been relatively spared from violence in the last year, but this has changed in the last month, with sectarian attacks killing dozens of people, including attacks on a Catholic Church and a mosque.

The violence mostly took place in the PK5 district of Bangui. Bangui is a mostly Catholic city, but PK5 is a mostly Muslim enclave within Bangui. I wrote about PK5 in November 2015, when Pope Francis visited Bangui, and particularly paid a visit to the PK5 mosque.

The exact sequence of events isn’t completely clear, but it appears that the violence began early in April when MINUSCA, the UN peacekeeper mission for CAR, joined local CAR security forces to launch a joint security operation in PK5 to dismantle militia bases that were hiding out in PK5.

MINUSCA is the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (CAR), launched in April 2014 as a peacekeeping mission. Unfortunately, there has been little peace for MINUSCA to keep. CAR is a huge country, and pretty much the entire country is in flames, so MINUSCA has mostly restricted itself to Bangui.

On April 10, the joint security operation turned into a bloody massacre, as the security forces battled several armed groups in PK5, known as the “self-defense forces,” a name that reflects lack of respect in the Muslim community for either MINUSCA or CAR’s current government. A total of 21 people were killed in a four-hour gun battle between the security forces and the self-defense forces, including a peacekeeper from Rwanda. 11 peacekeepers were wounded. AFP (9-Apr)

Angry protesters bring corpses to MINUSCA headquarters in Bangui

On April 11, hundreds of angry demonstrators from PK5 held a peaceful march in Bangui, and in a dramatic gesture, carried the corpses of 17 of the 21 who had been killed, and laid the corpses in front of the MINUSCA mission headquarters. According to one demonstrator:

“We, ourselves, no longer understand anything. Does their mission consist of shooting at civilians?”

MINUSCA denied that civilians had been targeted, and said that only criminal gangs had been targeted. A spokesman criticized the demonstrators:

“This is not an operation against communities and specifically the Muslim community. The Muslim community asked our troops to launch the operation and put an end to the criminal activities. We regret the fact that the bodies were being manipulated, while they should be buried like every person who dies.”

So-called Muslim “self-defense groups” have been springing up in PK5, claiming to protect the Muslim civilians.

The relationship between MINUSCA and the self-defense groups has become increasingly acrimonious. The self-defense groups claim that MINUSCA is trying to drive the Muslims out of Bangui entirely, while MINUSCA accuses them of extortion and violence against civilians. Reuters (11-Apr) and The Defense Post

The self-defense group ‘The Force’ gets revenge

One of the PK5 self-defense groups, “The Force,” got revenge on May 1 when gunmen attacked a service at a Catholic Church in Bangui. Some 2000 people had gathered for the service, when armed men threw grenades and fired on the church. The attack lasted for hours, killing a priest and at least 15 people from the church, and injuring hundreds more.

After attacking the church, the perpetrators moved into neighboring districts, looting shops and homes and attacking civilians. An Evangelical church member was killed outside his home.

Various officials offered the usual rhetoric. The head of the Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Mervyn Thomas said:

“We extend our condolences to the parishioners of Our Lady Fatima Church, to the family of Albert Toungoumale Baba and to all those who have been bereaved. The attack on a place of worship not only violates the right to freedom of religion or belief, but also threatens the social fabric of the community that religious leaders of all faiths have worked to maintain throughout the recent conflict.”

Amnesty International issued the usual near-boilerplate statement:

“Central African authorities and MINUSCA must send an immediate and clear message to all armed groups and their allies in CAR: No attack against civilians will be tolerated and all those suspected of committing war crimes and other serious human rights violations and abuses will be brought to justice.”

La Libre (Belgium) (Translation) and Premier (UK) and Amnesty International

Central African Republic crisis civil war continues

Despite Amnesty International’s laughable rhetoric, “No attack against civilians will be tolerated,” CAR is in a generational crisis civil war, and there’s no end in sight.

The CAR sectarian war began in March 2013, when François Bozizé, the Christian former president of CAR, was ousted in a coup in March 2013 by Michel Djotodia, a Muslim, who became president and served until January 2014.

After Djotodia’s coup took place in March 2013, Muslim Seleka militias began committing atrocities, particularly targeting the Christian constituencies of the deposed François Bozizé. In December 2013, French Foreign Legion peacekeeping troops arrived to disarm the Seleka militias.

The peacekeepers succeeded, but then the Christian anti-balaka militias “rushed into the vacuum,” and began committing atrocities in 2014, for revenge against the Selekas. Since then, both Christians and Muslims have been committing atrocities, and it’s become a full-scale generational crisis war. Thousands have been killed, and millions have been displaced.

Although the CAR war appears to be entirely sectarian, that isn’t entirely true. The Muslims are mostly herders, while the Christians are mostly farmers, and this is the same kind of conflict between herders and farmers that I’ve described in Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, and even America in the 1800s. As population grows, the farmers accuse the herders of letting the cattle eat their crops, while the herders accuse the farmers of planting on land that’s meant for grazing. If the farmers put up fences, then the herders knock them down. In CAR, there have been situations where Muslim and Christian farmers were united in fighting Muslim herders.

As I’ve explained in the past, CAR’s last generational crisis war was the 1928-1931 Kongo-Wara Rebellion (“War of the Hoe Handle”), which was a very long time ago, putting CAR today deep into a generational Crisis era, where a new crisis war is increasingly likely.

On 25 February, six education workers, including a UNICEF consultant, were murdered near Markounda, a remote area near the Chadian border while travelling to start a training for community teachers. Following the attack, UNICEF supported its partners to restart education activities and provided them (NGOs and members of the Ministry of Education) with psychosocial support.

In Paoua, 76,238 people having fled the surrounding rural areas are displaced in town, which has a population of about 40,000. Even though USD 2 million were allocated for the Paoua emergency response through the Humanitarian Fund, this will not be sufficient to cover even the most urgent needs. The burden of the displaced population on the host community is already a source of tensions, and may lead to conflict. The approaching rainy season could exacerbate the already poor sanitation conditions. The lack of access to the fields due to insecurity during the growing season increases the risks of food insecurity in the coming months. Thanks to joint efforts, education authorities, partners and UNICEF supported the continuation of normal school activities in the 11 schools in Paoua. The integration of displaced children into schools is ongoing with 5,123 displaced pupils (1,941 girls) attending school. 15 unaccompanied children (NA) were reunited with their families.

In Bangassou, the security situation remained volatile. For months, armed groups have prohibited neighboring residents to bring regular supply to the Petit Séminaire IDP site. Joint advocacy activities conducted towards armed groups by UNICEF’s partner Enfants Sans Frontières and Sisters from the Catholic Church allowed the population to have access to the IDP site and sell various essential items. 211 displaced children (89 girls and 122 boys) from the Petit Séminaire IDP site now have free access for the rest of the year to the Sisters' private primary school, with UNICEF support. However, no solution has been found yet to reintegrate the 108 high school students living in this site.","UNICEF Central African Republic Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/unicef-central-african-republic-humanitarian-situation-report-9

A newly released report and summary paper offer the international community direction in terms of areas of future priority for better responding to migrants caught in crisis situations. The report “Resilience in the Face of Adversity: A Comparative Study of Migrants in Crisis Situations ” is based on six case studies conducted across the globe on crisis situations in migrant host countries: Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Libya, South Africa and Thailand. The research, conducted by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development, the International Migration Institute of the University of Oxford, and local research partners, has collected and analysed the experiences and knowledge of over 650 migrants, family members of migrants, civil society organisations, intergovernmental organisations and government authority representatives who were interviewed across twelve different countries. The six case studies cover a spectrum of crises – from public disturbance to natural disaster to armed conflict – thereby highlighting the diverse experiences and needs of migrants during a crisis situation, as well as the varied ways institutional and other stakeholders respond to their needs.

The study points to the need for better and contextualised understanding of crises and migrants’ experiences, as well as the need to improve (and coordinate) international responses to migrants caught in crisis situations. Crises can produce a wide range of impacts, based not only on how they are handled by state and international actors, but also on the nature of the crisis, the environment leading up to the crisis and – significantly – how (and at what level) migrants’ engage their own agency in response to the crisis. Despite the wide range of crisis outcomes, the research also found that across the board, long-term responses to displaced persons – particularly returnees – was lacking and has seriously hindered migrants’ recovery in the years following the crisis.

Building on the results of the comparative study, the new summary paper connects six main thematic findings from the report to recent developments on the global stage and concrete recommendations and guidance that can already greatly improve responses. Engaging the main themes under study in the first phase of development of the UN Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the summary paper highlights the main issues that have emerged in the research related to: human rights, social inclusion and cohesion, discrimination and xenophobia, international cooperation, remittances and irregular migration.

Institutional stakeholders already have a breadth of resources available to them that provide tangible and specific guidance on how to improve their responses. In particular, on migrants caught in crisis situations, there are already at least three specific guidance documents that provide best practices and concrete examples for states, civil society, international organisations and private institutions:

Indeed, the research conducted on migrants’ experiences in the context of crises validates many of the issues already identified in these guidelines. The challenges migrants and institutional stakeholders encounter in the face of crises can be enormous – but they are not insurmountable: the international community already has the means to address many of these challenges at our fingertips.
