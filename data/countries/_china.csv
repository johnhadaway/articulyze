The trade dispute between the US and China will deteriorate before it improves. The jarring re-pricing of technology stocks has further to run. And normalisation of central bank policy will continue to spook the bond market.

Why then, am I still positive towards risk? And why do I see currently weak investor sentiment and poor market price action as a buying opportunity?

Let me explain. Much of the current market uncertainty – including the tech wreck - relates entirely or partially to escalating trade tensions between the US and China, and the prevailing fear that an all-out trade war could tip the global economy into recession, causing subsequent carnage in the market.

It’s why – over the last week or so – the MCSI China Index is down 4.2 per cent, the Hang Seng is down 3.5 per cent, and the S&P is down 3.9 per cent.

And of course, were an all-out trade war between the world’s two largest economies erupt, then almost certainly the global economy would encounter severe headwinds. And almost certainly a bear market would ensue.

The thing is, I do not buy the “all-out trade war” narrative. I think the market has overreacted. Granted there are undeniable risks, but on balance, I envisage a negotiated trade settlement as being by far the more likely outcome, as I discussed in my previous column two weeks ago.

A silver lining is in the clouds if the economies of China, Asia can pull through the immediate squall

Like all investment decisions, there are both risks and rewards to balance and assess; but overall, my sense is risk appetite will recover, and in months, if not weeks from now, equity markets will be trading higher.

For all of the bluff and bluster by US President Donald Trump, I believe he has a clear political objective in mind: being the reciprocity of access.

This is why trade tariffs are being levied; it is why the Section 301 investigation was launched, and it’s why reciprocal, mirror taxes are being mooted.

In fact, I see the US’s trade war as one very large and very powerful crowbar designed to prise open China’s tightly guarded domestic market to greater foreign – read American – exports.

And the reason I think the US will succeed in achieving this aim is because Beijing realises how serious Washington and Corporate America are in seeking to fundamentally reset their bilateral terms of trade.

Trump won’t back down until US deficit narrows, Reince Priebus says

First, it’s important to understand the depth of animus held in the US towards China’s trade practices which are seen variously as distorted, predatory, and unfair. Under Trump, such frustrations have come to a head and found a voice. From rust belt workers to business leaders, from Silicon Valley IT firms to the halls of government, the impulse to “get tough on China” is broad-based and increasingly vocal.

Not surprisingly, China is treading cautiously. In response to the US plan to levy tariffs on up to US$60 billion of imports from China, Beijing responded with countermeasures equivalent to a rather timid US$3 billion, albeit with a promise to do more if further provoked.

The problem is, when you racked up a monster trade surplus with the US approximating US$280 billion in 2017, it’s a challenge to sound convincingly on the side of angels.

Yet ironically - for now at least - the US tariffs are a side show, a commercial irrelevance equivalent to less than 0.1 per cent of China’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much more important is the seven-month-old Section 301 investigation into China’s alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, the full results of which could be published as soon as next month.

Section 301 puts China’s critical hi-tech industries firmly in the cross hairs, and if the investigation identifies instances of state-led market-distorting efforts either to force, pressure or coerce US companies to disclose commercially sensitive technology, punishment - including restrictions on Chinese investments in the US - could follow.

Trump’s trade tensions could be the catalyst for the next financial crash

Limiting Corporate China’s ability to expand in the US would directly challenge President Xi Jinping’s Made In China 2025 vision, which – among other things - relies on China’s tech giants to drive and innovate the new economy in the coming years.

To the extent that exposure to US innovation and earnings is considered essential to execute on the 2025 ambitions, an inability to expand in the US market is a clear roadblock and could possibly see tensions rise between China’s IT bosses and the president’s office.

All of this points to China having every reason to negotiate with the US and provide for greater access to its domestic markets. As such, expect China to grant greater access to selected markets for US companies, set in place agencies and monitoring systems to increase protection of US intellectual property rights, and step up commitments to buy more US-made goods to reduce the trade deficit.

But progress in resetting the US-Sino trade regime needs to be seen to be done, not least by the US electorate. A conciliatory China and headway on market access will provide a clear boost to the Republicans’ prospects in November’s midterm elections and indeed, Trump’s own re-election chances.

Inevitably, a fine balancing act is required. Trump cannot afford to provoke Beijing too obviously or by too much, especially with North Korea apparently seeking to come in from the cold.

Trump has his flaws, but US trade with China is more unbalanced

Similarly, China is aware it needs to provide Trump with sufficient political face at home, or provoke a trade backlash with potentially worrisome economic consequences.

My overriding assumption is that sensible people tend to do sensible things; and that as such, sense will prevail.

Simultaneously I’m also aware the level of predictability falls sharply with less predictable people. The Trump administration has shown a good amount of sensibility on both the issues of exemptions to the steel tariffs, as well as the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement. But Trump has also brandished a radical streak, and Beijing seems to have taken note of it.

From our perspective, the more sensible bet would be on China and the US getting past these disagreements and coming to an arrangement that is more equitable, and therefore also more sustainable.

As such, the recent weakness in both Chinese and Korean equity markets simply increases the attraction that both already hold for us. Here, the radical might just be the more sensible: go against the grain and go overweight on both.

2,china,"The numerous overlapping sovereign claims on islands, reefs, and rocks — many of which disappear under high tide — have turned the South China Sea into a virtual armed camp. And China has been quietly perfecting one of its key military outposts in the disputed waters.

The South China Sea, which is home to more than 200 specks of land, serves as a gateway to global sea routes through which approximately $3.4 trillion of trade passes annually.

China, the second-largest economy in the world, links its economic security closely to these waterways since more than 64 percent of its maritime trade transited through the region in 2016. The South China Sea is also a vital trade artery for Vietnam, Japan and South Korea.

The Spratly Islands, to which six countries lay claim, receive significantly more attention than other areas in the waters. Since there are more stakeholders involved with them, they are considered to be a more likely flashpoint for potential conflict.

3,china,"China is taking its first steps towards paying for imported crude oil in yuan instead of the U.S. dollar, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a key development in Beijing's efforts to establish its currency internationally.

Shifting just part of global oil trade into the yuan is potentially huge. Oil is the world's most traded commodity, with an annual trade value of around $14 trillion, roughly equivalent to China's gross domestic product last year.

A pilot program for yuan payment could be launched as early as the second half of this year, two of the people said.

Regulators have informally asked a handful of financial institutions to prepare for pricing China's crude imports in the yuan, said the three sources at some of the financial firms.

""Being the biggest buyer of oil, it's only natural for China to push for the usage of yuan for payment settlement. This will also improve the yuan liquidity in the global market,"" said one of the people briefed on the matter by Chinese authorities.

China is the world's second-largest oil consumer and in 2017 overtook the United States as the biggest importer of crude oil. Its demand is a key determinant of global oil prices.

Under the plan being discussed, Beijing could possibly start with purchases from Russia and Angola, one of the people said, although the source had no details of anything in the works.

Both Russia and Angola, like China, are keen to break the dollar's global dominance. They are also two of the top suppliers of crude oil to China, along with Saudi Arabia.

The move would mark a major step in reviving usage of the currency of the world's second-largest economy for offshore payments after several years of on-again, off-again measures.

If successful, it could also trigger shifting other product payments to the yuan, including metals and mining raw materials.

All three sources, who spoke to Reuters on the condition that they not be named, said the plans were at early stages. Officials at some of China's state oil companies said they had not heard of such plans.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/30/china-is-reportedly-taking-the-first-steps-to-pay-for-oil-in-yuan-sources.html

In a statement, the regulator also said it would help clean up local governments’ hidden debts, crack down on shadow banking and push forward in orderly way lowering of corporate leverage ratios.

It will also support debt-to-equity swaps in a market-oriented and lawful way, it said, summarizing a meeting chaired by its head, Guo Shuqing, who is also the Communist Party chief and deputy governor of the central People’s Bank of China.

The regulator says they discussed “important documents” on strengthening the disposal and identification of non-performing banking assets, but did not give details.

China is among global economies viewed as most vulnerable to a banking crisis, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Beijing has maintained that debt risks are under control and its commitment to deleveraging will not waver.

The banking and insurance regulators were merged earlier this month as part of a broader re-organization of government departments.

The move to tighten oversight of China’s $42 trillion banking and insurance sectors comes as Beijing reins in riskier lending practices and cuts high corporate debt.

6,china,"Alan D. Romberg, an Asia affairs specialist at the State Department who spent more than two decades in the Foreign Service and counseled a generation of China hands, died March 27 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 79.

The cause was renal cancer, said a son, Jon Romberg.

Mr. Romberg worked behind the diplomatic scenes to maintain good U.S. relations with China. As a member of the State Department policy planning office in the mid-1990s, he helped repair ties that had been strained by the 1989 Chinese crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators.

“He was centrally involved in negotiations with the Chinese in 1997-1998 to plan the exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin that restored normalcy to U.S.-China relations eight years after the Tiananmen massacre,” Jeffrey A. Bader, who was the National Security Council’s senior director for Asian affairs under President Obama, wrote in an email.

Mr. Romberg also was one of the leading U.S. authorities on the special status of Taiwan, which the United States treated as a self-governing island even as Beijing insisted that it should be recognized as an integral part of China. It was, Mr. Romberg later wrote, a “sensitive triangular relationship” and parsing words was crucial to keeping the Taiwan issue from upsetting ties between Beijing and Washington.

“There are few more complicated or more important aspects of U.S. diplomacy than Washington’s widely misunderstood ‘one-China policy,’ the guiding set of principles behind America’s relationship with both Taiwan and mainland China,” said Thomas J. Christensen, an international relations scholar at Princeton University who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Asia from 2006 to 2008. “Alan helped us keep the peace in that volatile period in cross-Strait relations.”

His advice was not always heeded — most notably when tensions led to the firing of Chinese missiles at Taiwan and a show of force by a flotilla of U.S. warships under President Clinton.

“Romberg was one of two or three officials who warned the secretary of state in 1995 that a visit to the U.S. by Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was a bad idea and would trigger a crisis in U.S.-China relations,” Bader recalled. “Developments proved him right.”

Alan Demuth Romberg was born in White Plains, N.Y., on Dec. 1, 1938. He attributed his early interest in Asia to his father, a doctor who ran an Army field hospital in western China during World War II. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1960 from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and a master’s degree in Soviet affairs from Harvard University in 1964.

After completing his undergraduate studies, he served two years in the Navy and was assigned to Taiwan.

His first marriage, to Elaine Ehrenfeld, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 24 years, Nancy Henningsen of Bethesda; two children from his first marriage, Jon Romberg of Jersey City, and Laura Romberg of Cleveland; a stepson, Alex Southwell of Manhattan; a brother; and four grandchildren.

In addition to his Foreign Service career, from 1964 to 1985, Mr. Romberg served as director of the State Department’s Japan office and principal deputy director of the department’s policy planning office. He also was a State Department deputy spokesman, did stints on the National Security Council staff, was senior adviser to the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations and was special assistant to the secretary of the Navy. He received Superior Honor and Distinguished Honor awards from the State Department.

Santino Bol Muoter, Deputy Chairperson of South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC), told Xinhua that Beijing's food and non-food contribution last year enabled them to assist tens of thousands of needy people.

Last year, China provided tonnes of assistance including rice, tents, mosquito nets and blankets as emergency relief package to the war-torn East African nation.

Muoter said the RRC was still holding over 69,000 bags of Chinese rice in its stores and they would be distributed to vulnerable people.

""China is one of the friendly countries to South Sudan and we benefit from China in various aid including food aid and other material aid. We are grateful and we thank China for being a good friend especially in this hard time for South Sudan,"" Muoter said.

8,china,"The Government of the Republic of Liberia and the People’s Republic of China, Friday, March 9, signed an Emergency Humanitarian Food Assistance grant to Liberia. The food assistance is aimed at consolidating and strengthening the existing bilateral cooperation between the two countries.

According to a Foreign Ministry release, the signing of the Certificate of Handover and Acceptance note for the China-aid grant under which China donated 50 containers of 1,243 metric tons of rice, took place in the Foreign Minister’s conference room.

Acting Foreign Minister B. Elias Shoniyin signed on behalf of the Liberian Government while Chinese Ambassador, H.E. Fu Jijun, signed for his Government.

The donation was made possible following a request from the Liberia government.

In brief remarks, Chinese Ambassador Fu stated, “On behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, I have the honor to hand over 50 containers in the tone of 1,243 metric tons of rice to the Liberian Government and people.”

Ambassador Fu indicated that the donation is another gift from the Chinese Government; adding, “The rice has arrived in the country at the right time.”

He recalled that since the inauguration of President George Manneh Weah on January 22nd, the President and his administration have been working hard to stabilize the price of the country’s staple food, with the intend to ensure that Liberians especially unprivileged Liberians can afford to buy their staple at a reasonable price.

“I believe this batch of rice will help alleviate some of the difficulties the current administration is faced with,” Ambassador Fu hoped.

The Chinese Envoy further hoped that the rice donated would be allocated to the needy; adding, “As a friend of Liberia, China is willing to share its experiences and help Liberia in the recovery of its agriculture and increase its grain production.”

For his part, the Acting Foreign Minister, Honorable B. Elias Shoniyin, lauded the Government and People of the People’s Republic of China for the bilateral gesture.

Mr. Shoniyin recounted China’s numerous bilateral aids to the People of Liberia.

He also, on behalf of President Weah and Liberia, extended Liberia’s deepest appreciation to the Government and People of the People’s Republic of China for what he called the ‘usual and genuine gift’ from China to Liberia.

The Honorable Acting Foreign Minister hopes that the food assistance would go a long way in alleviating hardship on the ordinary Liberians.

He thanked the Chinese for supporting Liberia under the previous administration of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and now under the CDC-led administration.

I am extremely appreciative that China has continued to consistently maintain its relationship with Liberia.

“In the last seven days, china has signed four major agreements to support Liberia. This is a demonstration of its commitment to deepening the relationship with Liberia.”

Acting Foreign Minister Shoniyin recommitted Liberia to the “One China Policy” with the aim to strengthen the bilateral cooperation and ties with Beijing. He pledged Liberia’s willingness to work closely with China at both bilateral and multilateral levels for the mutual benefits of the two peoples.

Also speaking at the occasion, Commerce Minister Professor Wilson Tarpeh thanked the Chinese Ambassador and through him, to the Government and People of the People’s Republic of China for the humanitarian gesture and added that the donation is consistent with the pivotal role China has played in the recovery effort of Liberia.

He stressed that the donation to Liberia is extremely laudable.

Minister Tarpeh hoped that the PRC will continue to do more for Liberia; adding, “We appreciate it very much. You can be assured that the Liberian Government would utilize this particular intervention in a responsible manner.”

Isaac Stone Fish is a journalist and senior fellow at the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China Relations, on sabbatical from Foreign Policy magazine.

China has become a hugely lucrative market for American films — causing pushback from some in the ruling Chinese Communist Party, who fear the spread of ideas they find distasteful. And so Hollywood producers work with Beijing to ensure that their scripts won’t, in Chinese parlance, “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.”

“World War Z” deleted a line in which characters debate whether the zombie pandemic sweeping the world originated in China. The arcade game film “Pixels” lost a scene where aliens blast a hole in the Great Wall. And in the most absurd recent example, Marvel’s “Doctor Strange” featured the white British actress Tilda Swinton playing a Tibetan character, because the film’s screenwriter C. Robert Cargill felt that would be less controversial than casting someone who looked ethnically Chinese or Tibetan.

That grip is likely to grow tighter, and the censorship more absurd. In a little noticed shift at the recently concluded National People’s Congress — where the 64-year-old Chinese leader Xi Jinping successfully abolished term limits for the presidency of China, paving the way for him to potentially stay in office for life — the Party’s Propaganda Department got an important new responsibility. Before March, it was a government body, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT), that managed China’s relationship with Hollywood. But as the party moves to reassert its control over China and the government, Xi assigned that control to the Propaganda Department, a much more powerful and conservative body.

So far it remains unclear how exactly the new relationship will unfold between Hollywood and the Propaganda Department. But the most likely outcome is that U.S. studios will have to jump through higher ideological hoops to get their films approved — and thus will more carefully scrub their films of elements that Beijing deems sensitive, and add in more scenes, lines and characters that glorify China and the party.

To understand what the U.S. film industry will soon be facing, it’s important to comprehend the stark difference between the government and the party in Chinese political life. In the United States, the Democratic and Republican parties share control of the government, while existing independently from it. In China, however, the government is subservient to the Communist Party, which wields far greater power. In Chinese provinces, the governor is the second most powerful official — behind the local party secretary, who oversees him. (And yes, both roles are almost exclusively filled by men.)

While government officials are often party members — and SAPPRFT serves the party’s interests — there are differences between government and party institutions. Party institutions tend to be more obsessed with how China is portrayed, and more sensitive to slights against the country. And because they are more powerful, their decisions tend to matter more, and they have more sway.

Moreover, the reorganization, according to a description of the plan released on China’s official news wire Xinhua, reflects the “especially important role of cinema in propagating ideas and in cultural entertainment.” Because the party will likely give more resources to domestic film producers, foreign and co-produced films might now face stiffer competition in China — meaning that Hollywood producers will have to tread more lightly around sensitive areas, so as not to put themselves at a disadvantage.

The quota system dictates how foreign films are screened in China. A 2012 bilateral deal caps the number of foreign films China imports at several dozen. Because China’s ticket sales hit $8.59 billion in 2017 — rapidly closing the gap with the United States, which saw a $11.12 billion box-office take in the same period — competition for those slots is growing fiercer. And officials from the Propaganda Department will likely have higher censorship standards than their government counterparts.

With so much shifting in the U.S.-China trade relationship, it’s difficult to predict what will happen. Currently, the United States and China are negotiating over the quota system. Could the potential for a trade war cause Beijing to retaliate against Hollywood, forcing the studios to grow more supplicant? It’s possible. Yet as film expert Stan Rosen points out, “They know that if they go after Hollywood, no one will give a damn, because no one there likes” President Trump.

Could the shifting political climate toward China cause Hollywood to produce films more critical of the country? Possible, but unlikely. Although many in Washington and the Pentagon seem to have concluded that China is a threat, Americans as a whole have not: A February 2018 Gallup poll shows that 53 percent of Americans now view China favorably, the highest number in almost three decades. Hollywood films will reflect public perception far more than that of policy wonks. And there are far more moviegoers in China than in Washington. In 2016, screenwriter Cargill explained why “Doctor Strange” censored itself: “If you acknowledge that Tibet is a place,” he said, “you risk alienating one billion people.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/03/30/the-coming-chinese-crackdown-on-hollywood/
11,china,"Five years ago, China was the most trigger-happy cloud seeder in the world. It was creating 55 billion tons of artificial rain a year, with plans to quintuple that amount. In 2013, launching cloud-seeding chemicals by rocket into the sky or spraying them from planes were the preferred methods.

Now, reportedly equipped with new military weather-altering technology, China is embarking on its biggest rain-making project yet, the South China Morning Post says. Using a system developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Hong Kong news outlet reports, the country plans to build tens of thousands of combustion chambers on steep Tibetan mountainsides. The chambers would burn a solid fuel, which would result in a spray of silver iodide billowing towards the sky.

The particles, much like those already sprayed from planes, would provide something for passing water vapor to condense around, forming clouds. And the clouds would bring the rain.

A single cloud-seeding chamber could create a strip of clouds covering a five-kilometer area, the Morning Post states.

Water in Tibet is good for Asia

The Tibetan plateau was chosen for its massive impact on water supply. Climate models predict it will see severe drought as temperatures rise and regional rainfall decreases. This poses a major problem that extends far beyond Tibet itself; the Tibetan plateau is vital to the water supply for much of China and a large swath of Asia. Its glaciers and reservoirs feed the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, and other major rivers that flow through China, India, Nepal, and other countries.

The chambers were said to have first been developed as part of a Chinese military program to use weather modification for defense purposes. They “burn fuel as cleanly and efficiently as rocket engines, according to the Morning Post, “releasing only vapours and carbon dioxide, which makes them suitable for use even in environmentally protected areas.”

The plan, announced this month, would be the world’s largest cloud-seeding project. It is intended to force rainfall and snow over 1.6 million square kilometres (620,000 square miles)—an area roughly three times the size of Spain (if you’re in Australia, then it’s the size of Queensland).

“More than 500 burners have been deployed on alpine slopes in Tibet, Xinjiang and other areas for experimental use. The data we have collected show very promising results,” an unnamed researcher told the Morning Post. “Sometimes snow would start falling almost immediately after we ignited the chamber. It was like standing on the stage of a magic show.”

Is this a good idea?

Plenty of questions remain about the safety and efficacy of such a system. First of all, releasing silver iodide at the ground level could affect humans like small particles in dust or smoke do. “Based on their small size they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs, potentially causing health issues for the workers operating the equipment and others in the area,” explains Faye McNeill, a chemical engineer at Columbia University who studies atmospheric aerosols. “In other words, these particles will add to the amount of fine particulate matter.”

The silver iodide would eventually fall back down to Earth with the rain, but McNeill tells Quartz that isn’t as much of a concern, at least not for people. “Once the silver iodide enters the groundwater, it is not expected to be in a very toxic form, but it may disrupt the aquatic ecosystem.”

There are also ethical implications of sucking moisture out of the air. You’re invariably taking rain away from another region, says Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University’s engineering school: “If you’re making it rain where it wouldn’t otherwise, you’re taking water out of the air that would have rained elsewhere.”

In this case, China plans to take advantage of the moist air that passes over the Tibetan plateau on its way to fuel the monsoon season in India. If China manages to make a large enough volume of rain fall on Tibet, it could hypothetically reduce the rain that falls on India.

“Trump does not separate security from trade; they are all part of his pack of cards, while Moon tended to see them as separate issues,” said Shim Sang-ryul, a professor of international trade at Kwangwoon University in Seoul.

But Mr. Trump’s decision to link the trade deal with South Korea to a breakthrough in denuclearizing North Korea shows a growing unease in Washington, analysts said. Washington fears that Seoul might drift from their alliance and move closer to Beijing, while Mr. Trump feels his approach to North Korea is being undermined in the wake of a flurry of diplomatic initiatives by Mr. Kim in recent weeks, especially his meeting this week with China’s president, Xi Jinping, analysts said. (On Thursday, North Korea released an English-language version of a documentary of the trip.)

When Mr. Kim began seeking talks this year after ratcheting up regional tensions with a string of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, United States officials argued that he had done so because of pressure from Mr. Trump, including the threat of sanctions.

But analysts say that Mr. Kim had already been planning to seek talks at the end of a hurried effort to complete what he called “a state nuclear force” last year. Analysts say his goal was to enter negotiations with Washington with a much stronger hand than his father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, had in the 1990s and 2000s.

Adding to that, Mr. Kim’s decision to travel to Beijing to meet with Mr. Xi before his planned summit meetings with the South Korean and American presidents was a brilliant maneuver, analysts said.

By choosing Beijing for his first trip abroad as leader, Mr. Kim recommitted North Korea to the traditional — yet much frayed — Communist alliance with China. At the same time, Mr. Kim’s visit helped China reassert its role in diplomacy around denuclearizing North Korea, a process that has been dominated by South Korea and the United States in recent months. If China’s role on the Korean Peninsula grows bigger, it strengthens North Korea’s leverage in talks and helps China as well if a trade war with the United States comes to pass, said Professor Shim.

Mr. Kim’s meeting with Mr. Xi has already complicated Mr. Trump’s calculations.

China’s state news media reported that Mr. Kim had called for “phased, synchronized” moves toward denuclearizing his country — the same approach the North insisted on in past negotiations with Washington. In those talks, the North said it would take only incremental steps toward giving up its nuclear program, beginning with a freeze, and demanded that the United States offer simultaneous incentives. Those past discussions all eventually collapsed as Washington and Pyongyang accused each other of reneging on agreements.

Mr. Kim’s call for a phased approach raised the possibility of drawn out and uncertain negotiations, dimming the hopes for the so-called Libyan model of rapid dismantlement, which Mr. Trump and his new pick for national security adviser, John R. Bolton, prefer.

A key problem for Mr. Trump is that South Korea sides with China in arguing that the Libyan model is unrealistic, championing an “action-for-action” phased approach for denuclearization. When Mr. Xi’s envoy, Yang Jiechi, visited Seoul this week, South Korea and China agreed to cooperate for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean crisis. On Friday, a senior aide for Mr. Moon told reporters that the North’s nuclear weapons program, which has been developing over the past 25 years, could not be dismantled “like you turn off your TV by pulling out the electricity cord.”

Lee Jong-seok, a former South Korean unification minister, said, “The key will be how to persuade North Korea to take a couple or few early concrete steps early — for instance, measures concerning its nuclear test site or its ICBM production facilities — that would help convince the Americans that it is sincere about denuclearization.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/asia/donald-trump-north-korea-south.html
14,china,"Ministry says country has 9m sources of pollution, with factories breaking emissions rules the big problem

China’s environment ministry has said the number of sources of pollution in the country has increased by more than half in less than a decade.

Releasing preliminary results of an ongoing “environmental census”, China’s ministry of ecology and environment said the number of sources of pollution in the country stands at about 9m, compared to 5.9m in its first census, in 2010.

“The objectives and scope of the second census is different from those of the first one,” said Hong Yaxiong, head of the pollution survey at the ministry, Thursday. “But overall, there are more pollution sources.”

The census did not say whether pollution had increased but declines in airborne pollution in major cities have been recorded in other studies.

Chinese premier declares war on pollution in economic overhaul Read more

Hong said factories flouting emissions standards were the main problem. The ministry found 7.4m sources of industrial pollution, compared to a million in rural areas and 500,000 in urban locations.

Five years ago, China declared a “war against pollution.” Since then, new coal plants have been barred from opening and existing ones have been ordered to cut emissions. Major cities restrict the number of cars allowed on the roads. This past winter, residents in Beijing were left without heat after their coal boilers were removed.



As part of the campaign, officials this month expanded the powers of the country’s 10-year-old ministry of environmental protection to include water management, emissions reductions, agricultural pollution, and other duties previously managed by half a dozen other ministries.



As part of its new remit, the ministry is holding a second environmental census, to be completed in 2019. It will look into industrial parks, as well as municipal and rural sources of pollution. “We will look into all kinds of pollution sources,” Hong said.

China has made some important gains. Michael Greenstone, director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, analysed data from government air monitors collected between 2013 and 2017, and found that many of China’s densest cities have recorded major declines in air pollution.

In Beijing, where several days of smog known as “the airpocalypse” of 2013 in part prompted China’s declaration of war, the concentration of fine particulates in the air fell 35%.

“By winning this war, China is due to see dramatic improvements in the overall health of its people, including longer lifespans, if these improvements are sustained,” Greenstone said in a statement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/31/china-environment-census-reveals-50-rise-in-pollution-sources
15,china,"Growth in China's manufacturing sector picked up more than expected in March as authorities lifted winter pollution restrictions and steel mills cranked up production as construction activity swings back into high gear.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Saturday rose to 51.5 in March, from 50.3 in February, and was well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.

Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would pick up only slightly to 50.5.

The findings add to a growing amount of data which suggest that China's economy has carried more momentum into the first quarter from last year than analysts had expected, which should keep synchronized global growth on track for a while longer even as trade tensions build.

February's print had been the lowest in 1-1/2 years, but many analysts suspected it was due to disruptions related to the long Lunar New Year holidays, not a sharp drop in consumption.

Indeed, the March survey showed manufacturers shifted into higher gear as usual as seasonal demand picked up at home and abroad. The sub-index for output jumped to 53.1 from 50.3 in February, while total new orders rose to 53.3 from 51.0 and export orders climbed to 51.3 from 49.0.

The China Logistics Information Centre, in a commentary on the PMI figures, said it expected first-quarter economic growth to be about 6.8 percent. Early this year, economists polled by Reuters were pencilling in a fade to around 6.6 percent.

Large companies saw a modest pickup in growth, while small firms' activity expanded marginally after shrinking in February.

Helping drive positive sentiment, exports have been better than expected in the first two months of the year, particularly for tech products, the fastest-growing segment of China's industrial sector. Though a sub PMI for hi-tech manufacturing eased in March, growth remained solid.

However, a sharp escalation in trade tensions with the United States is clouding the outlook for both China's ""old economy"" heavy industries and ""new economy"" tech firms.

The Trump administration slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports last week and then targeted China specifically with plans for additional tariffs of up to $60 billion of its goods, likely focusing on tech and telecommunications products.

""Stress tests have shown the new U.S. tariffs will have a relatively small impact on Chinese steel. Chinese steel firms should not be overly worried and should focus on guaranteeing demand from the domestic market and our major exporters,"" the China Steel Logistics Professional Committee said.

""But it's worth noting that the amount of steel products we supply to U.S. consumers through the global supply chain may well exceed China's direct exports to the United States,"" it added. ""China should proactively oppose U.S. unilateral trade protectionism to maintain the global supply chain.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/31/china-march-factory-growth-stronger-than-expected-official-pmi-shows.html
16,china,"I had the opportunity to meet Liu He, the newly appointed vice-premier of China and a 1995 graduate of Harvard Kennedy School, when he returned to campus for a series of meetings to discuss the 2008 global financial meltdown, after having been tasked with writing a report for the premier on the crisis’ impact on the US.

He was sharp and focused, seeing the threats of a financial system that was not under effective control and regulation, while concluding that the US economy was resilient. This was important because, at the time, some voices in China were seeing the crisis as marking the inevitable decline of the US. By all accounts, the report was influential in policy circles within China and within the office of the premier.

We know that Liu is a critic of the debt-fuelled programme that China adopted following the financial crisis, or at least feels that it has continued for too long and that government stimulus cannot be the main driver of growth.

Liu’s view is that debt-driven growth carries financial and broader risks, possibly even of a systemic financial crisis. In 2016, Liu is credited with having written an important editorial for the People’s Daily, in which he warned against maintaining economic growth with loose monetary policy. The Chinese have referred to the policy package as their own version of “supply-side economics”.

The two main drivers of China’s economic growth have been state investment and exports. These two elements will remain important but can’t be relied upon to maintain stable growth in the future. As a result, Liu supports the moves in recent years to maintain slower growth, rather than the heady days of double-digit growth, and supports the preference for a more sustainable consumption-based growth.

One of the major challenges that remains is how to deal with the state-owned sector of the economy, which needs to be reformed to use resources more efficiently, but which is home to strong vested interests that have roots deep in the Communist Party. On that front, Liu certainly has his work cut out for him.

Debt servicing ratio, meanwhile, refers to the amount of money as a proportion of income that's used to repay loans. A higher ratio means borrowers may have taken on too much debt than what their income can support.

In addition to China, the BIS report also found Canada and Hong Kong to be at risk of a banking crisis. The vulnerabilities of those two economies were partly caused by climbing property prices.

The People's Bank of China and the Bank of Canada did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that a number of macro-prudential measures had already been put in place to strengthen the banking's system resilience. It listed new capital buffers and new stress tests for mortgage applicants, among other measures.

""Hong Kong's banking sector remains healthy and well capitalized, and has the ability to weather through stresses,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

19,china,"For a couple of weeks in March, after the announcement that Donald Trump had accepted an offer to meet with Kim Jong Un, the outcome of the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear weapons seemed to depend on whether two leaders who had steered their nations toward war could pump the brakes and broker peace. Then, this week, Kim boarded a train to Beijing and scrambled the whole map. The North Korean leader’s friendly meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping—his first encounter with another head of state—doesn’t necessarily place Trump in a weaker position heading into nuclear talks with Kim later this spring, said Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center. But it does make Trump’s position far more complicated. China, which is North Korea’s neighbor, treaty ally, and nearly exclusive trading partner, has reasserted itself as a “central player” in the negotiations. Just as important, Kim played the United States and China off each other, much like Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung exploited doctrinal disputes between China and the Soviet Union to extract economic assistance and security pacts from both of his communist patrons in the early 1960s. Kim’s invitation to Trump stoked Chinese anxiety about being excluded from the summitry (Fear of Missing Out applies as much to international affairs as to human affairs), which will now enable North Korea to take advantage of the “differences, the strategic competition and mistrust between the United States and China,” Yun told me. Related Story Why Did Kim Jong Un Just Visit China? “Last week the assumption was that North Korea’s relationship with China was very bad, so going into the [Trump-Kim] summit we could assume that North Korea would be more desperate to have a deal,” Yun said, in reference to the ways in which Kim Jong Un’s weapons tests in defiance of Chinese objections and China’s retaliation with economic sanctions had poisoned ties between the two countries in recent years. Now North Korea has more leverage: “The more options North Korea has, the less isolated North Korea is, the less able the U.S. will be to coerce North Korea in any direction.” Imagine, for example, that Trump and Kim meet in May and their first conversation—on the shared goal of “denuclearizing” North Korea—goes swimmingly. Then they get to specifics and Kim says he’s happy to dismantle his nuclear program if the United States abandons its “hostile policy” toward his nation. When Trump asks what he means by that, Kim explains that an end to hostilities could entail a peace treaty concluding the Korean War and the termination of America’s military alliance with South Korea, but would at least have to start with the lifting of some sanctions. Trump says the United States won’t ease an iota of pressure on North Korea until Kim takes significant steps toward completely, verifiably, and irreversibly removing his nuclear weapons. Kim protests: “We haven’t tested a nuclear bomb or ballistic missile in six months! We’re sitting right in front of you at the negotiating table! We deserve a reward.” Trump stays tough: “No way, Little Rocket Man,” he says.

A week ago, Kim might have felt cornered under such circumstances. Now, the Chinese could step into the stalemate and argue that the Kim government has indeed behaved well, that the North Korean people are suffering from sanctions, and that achieving denuclearization requires not just sticks but carrots. The Trump administration, whose new national-security adviser detests diplomatic carrots, might balk at the proposal. But the Chinese could press ahead with economic relief regardless, threatening to blow a China-sized hole in the international sanctions campaign against North Korea. (The North Korea scholar Go Myong Hyun has speculated that one of Kim’s motives for visiting Beijing was to “prepare the ground for the immediate relaxation of sanctions after the U.S.-North Korea talks,” even if that only involves China “turning a blind eye to the smuggling activities along the border.”) Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, compared the Chinese and North Korean moves ahead of the Trump-Kim summit to a complex game of cards with the United States. China “wants to use the [North Korea] card to strengthen its position vis-a-vis the U.S., especially in the current ‘trade war,’” and prevent North Korea from falling into the “U.S. orbit,” he told me by email. North Korea “wants to use the China card to strengthen its position vis-a-vis the U.S., especially in the coming negotiation with the U.S. on denuclearization, and play its newly ‘secured’ U.S. card to force China to soften [its] position toward Pyongyang.” (The United States looks poised to play some hands of its own; on Thursday, Trump threatened to delay renegotiation of a trade agreement with South Korea, which has tended to be more accommodating of North Korea than the U.S. has been, until he has finalized a nuclear deal with North Korea. Trade is “a very strong card,” he reasoned.)

Trump could try to avoid getting played by coordinating positions with Xi ahead of his meeting with Kim. The U.S. president might have agreed to talk directly with North Korea’s leader, cutting out China as a middleman, for the same reason Trump prefers bilateral trade deals: The mighty United States is more likely to get what it wants when it goes up against one country rather than multiple countries. But in this case, America could benefit from having the middleman closer to its side. “The only way to constrain the small power’s ability to manipulate big powers is for the big powers to have communications among themselves,” Yun said. “As long as the U.S. and China see each other as a bigger problem, North Korea will be able to manipulate the situation.” But while China and the United States both oppose nuclear weapons in North Korea, their interests in Korea diverge after that. America fears the capabilities of the Kim regime while China fears the collapse of the Kim regime. What the Chinese government ideally wants from the nuclear talks, Yun said, is for the U.S. and North Korea to sign a peace treaty and for North Korea to give up its nuclear program “step by step” in exchange for the United States withdrawing its troops from the Korean peninsula. According to this vision, “North Korea will remain as a pro-China, friendly, nuclear-free force” while “South Korea will also become pro-China or, at a minimum, neutral between the U.S. and China,” Yun said. The Trump administration, by contrast, has indicated that it ideally wants to maintain its alliance with South Korea even as North Korea fully relinquishes its nuclear weapons.

John Bolton, Trump’s incoming national-security adviser, has gone further, repeatedly suggesting that the United States pursue a diplomatic track of persuading China that it’s in Chinese interests to engineer a “controlled collapse” of the Kim regime by severing its economic lifeline to North Korea, supporting a rival political faction, or more forceful means. As Bolton tells it, China would then permit the absorption of North Korea into South Korea with the understanding that the United States would keep its troops in southern Korea rather than moving them up toward China’s border as part of reunification. Shen dismissed Bolton’s scheme as “nearly impossible,” but Yun wasn’t as quick to do so. Last year, as Trump peppered North Korea with military threats and Kim Jong Un persisted with nuclear and missile tests, the “Chinese were genuinely convinced that war was imminent,” she noted, and similar ideas about China removing the Kim regime began popping up in Chinese policy circles. Proponents of such ideas, which have not been publicly advocated by Chinese officials, considered the prospect of China getting drawn into a second Korean war and direct conflict with the United States, and “differentiated between the North Korean regime and the North Korean country—determining that North Korea the country remains China’s strategic asset, but the North Korean regime is ... hurting China’s national interests,” Yun said. “So I think John Bolton’s proposal is not inconceivable.” At the moment, however, China’s anxiety about war has subsided and its anxiety about being excluded from nuclear negotiations has swelled. Hence Xi Jinping’s reluctant embrace of Kim Jong Un in Beijing.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/kim-jong-un-china-trump/556802/
20,china,"At the U.N., China and Russia Score Win in War on Human Rights

António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, has quietly begun to dismantle a key cell within his office charged with ensuring that the international body’s sprawling political and humanitarian agencies promote human rights.

The move comes mere months after China, with the support of Russia and other critics of the U.N. human rights mission, led a successful effort in an obscure but powerful U.N. budget committee to block a request by Guterres to fund the cell, which was established in 2014.

The development is just one of the latest signs that Beijing and Moscow are gradually gaining ground in their geopolitical struggle against the West to roll back decades of advances on human rights at the U.N. But human rights proponents claim that the U.N. chief, as well as the United States and European countries, has done too little to resist the trend.

On a range of fronts, China and Russia have grown increasingly assertive in their efforts to curtail human rights advocacy, targeting financing for U.N. rights programs, barring human rights defenders from participating in U.N. meetings, and ratcheting up pressure on smaller countries to vote alongside them in the U.N. Security Council. They have tapped into a growing aversion to advocacy from scores of governments that resent what they see as the West’s manipulation of human rights causes to punish political rivals.

“China is the real playmaker here. It has cleverly combined positive messaging over climate change and development with an increasingly uncompromising approach to limiting human rights,” says Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It can get away with this because a lot of diplomats view Chinese engagement at the U.N. as insurance against Trump walking away [from multilateralism].”

Only last week, Beijing and Moscow prevailed in an effort to block a U.S.-backed proposal to have the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, brief the Security Council in a formal session on flagrant rights abuses in Syria.

The United States required a vote by at least nine members of the 15-nation council to schedule the meeting. But the effort collapsed when representatives of the council’s three African countries — Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, and Ivory Coast — broke with the Western camp and abstained.

The final stroke that killed the initiative was delivered by Ivory Coast, a former French colony that had privately vowed to vote alongside France and the United States but defected at the last moment, according to a Security Council diplomat. The reversal, officials say, followed a strenuous diplomatic pressure campaign by China.

The United States downplayed the significance of the defeat, arguing that it, the United Kingdom, and France ultimately outmaneuvered China and Russia by arranging an informal briefing by Zeid to council members.

A U.S. official speaking to Foreign Policy challenges the notion that human rights has been in retreat at the U.N. since President Donald Trump took office.

“On the contrary, the United States has been gaining ground on human rights at the U.N.,” the official says, citing a number of human rights meetings sponsored by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.

“We held the first Security Council meeting on human rights during our presidency last year and have held country-specific U.N. meetings on human rights abuses in North Korea and Venezuela in New York and Geneva,” the official says. “We held a briefing to the Security Council on the crackdown on protesters in Iran. All of these show a larger human rights profile across the U.N. system, which unsurprisingly puts countries like Russia and China — who are no friends to human rights — on the defense.”

But other observers see a subtle shift in the council’s balance of power at the U.N., where states opposed to human rights advocacy — including China, Egypt, Pakistan, and Russia — have grown increasingly assertive in pressing their case. At the same time, the United States and its European allies have shown less vigor in fighting for the cause.

As China’s share of the U.N. budget has ballooned in recent years, its diplomats have sought steeper cuts in U.N. spending. Their efforts have disproportionately targeted posts with a mandate to protect human rights from U.N. headquarters to the field, where they have sought to eliminate human rights posts in U.N. peacekeeping missions.

At the same time, China has become more assertive in curtailing the ability of independent human rights advocates to have their voices heard at the U.N. Chinese diplomats have begun to insist, for instance, that groups seeking to be accredited to speak at U.N. functions publicly recognize Chinese sovereignty over Tibet.

“China is pushing this stuff really hard,” says Louis Charbonneau, the U.N. director at Human Rights Watch. But many countries that traditionally support human rights “mainly pay lip service to the need to keep human rights high on the agenda while barely lifting a finger to do anything about it. We aren’t going to be able to fight this sitting down.”

The latest battle over human rights dates back to the spring of 2014, when Guterres’s predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, created the cell to implement his signature Human Rights Up Front initiative, which was established after criticism of the U.N.’s tepid response to the mass killing of tens of thousands of civilians by the Sri Lankan armed forces in 2009. The initiative was designed to encourage U.N. staff at headquarters and in the field to “take a principled stance and to act with moral courage to prevent serious and large-scale violations.”

The cell was largely funded outside the U.N.’s regular budget, relying on funding from Norway, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. The new U.N. chief, who supports the initiative in principle, last year sought funding from the U.N. General Assembly budget committee to underwrite the cost of the senior official in the secretary-general’s executive office. But the committee — which is run by U.N. member states — rejected the request in December.

The human rights cell, which once employed as many as five people, has continued to shrink. Today, Guterres plans to eliminate the post for the last remaining senior official and transfer his responsibilities to a senior aide, Fabrizio Hochschild, who is respected by human rights advocates, but they say he oversees too broad a portfolio to devote sufficient attention to human rights.

In an interview, Hochschild says Guterres wanted to preserve the cell but that he was blocked by the membership. “There is no question that the general climate for promoting respect for human rights has grown more difficult,” he says. “I don’t want to comment on individual member states, but there has been a much broader pushback on human rights than two member states.”

Still, Hochschild says that has not diminished Guterres’s commitment to promoting human rights.

“I would argue that Human Rights Up Front is victim of its own success — it is no longer a side issue in the secretary-general’s executive office,” he says. “It is at the heart of the secretary-general’s thinking. He has reorganized the whole internal governance [of his office] to do that better.”

Human rights advocates have expressed concern about the decision to shutter the office.

“Our conversations with member states indicate that the post — and the broader Human Rights Up Front Initiative — has widespread support, and the decision to eliminate it aligns with the desire of only a small minority of states,” a coalition of human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the International Service for Human Rights, wrote in a letter to Guterres.

The group suggested that the U.N. chief might be able to find other funds to keep the initiative going, and the foreign ministers of five Nordic states have already signaled a willingness to help.",http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/26/at-the-u-n-china-and-russia-score-win-in-war-on-human-rights/
21,china,"New Delhi (CNN) Is India distancing itself from the Tibetan exile community six decades after the Dalai Lama fled to the country?

That's the question many are asking after celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the spiritual leader's arrival in India have been moved or canceled, as Beijing and New Delhi seek to reboot ties in the wake of a tense year in bilateral relations.

From March 31, Tibetans in India are holding a year-long ""Thank You India"" event as a prelude to celebrating the Dalai Lama's time in the country and to show gratitude to the Indian government and its people for their support of Tibetan refugees.

But what should have been a moment of joy has been overshadowed by a flurry of speculation about the future of the exiled Tibetan community -- and especially the freedom they have enjoyed in India since the late 1950s.

""It looks like the Government of India is changing its policy,"" said Claude Apri, an India-based expert on Tibet and author of several books on Tibetan issues.

After an unsuccessful revolt against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled the capital Lhasa in secret.

He crossed into India on March 31, 1959 and has made India his home ever since.

A living god-like figure for millions of Buddhists, India officially calls him ""the most esteemed and honored guest of India."" China accuses of him of being a ""a wolf in monk's robes,"" engaged in ""anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion with the aim of breaking Tibet away from China.""

'Very sensitive'

attending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India. In early March, news emerged that the Indian Foreign Secretary penned a classified advisory asking senior leaders and government officials to refrain fromattending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India.

The note reportedly said the events, in March and April, came at a ""very sensitive time in the context of India's relations with China.""

A week later, the Tibetan Central Administration -- the government in exile -- decided to move a major cultural event that was originally planned to be held in the Indian capital New Delhi with a speech by the Dalai Lama, to Dharamsala, where the exiled community is based.

A Dalai Lama-led inter-faith prayer ceremony was also scrapped, the Tibetan Central Administration said, as was the Seventh World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet that was meant to be held on April 26-28 in Delhi.

The Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, the organizers of the convention, declined to give a reason for the cancellation of the high-profile event.

Sonam Dagpo, a spokesman for the Tibetan Central Administration said that there has been no direct communication from the Indian authorities and that the plans were changed out of respect to the Indian government's position.

""Once we (heard about the note), we decided to shift the venue,"" he said. ""There are no ill feelings. If you weigh what the Indian government has done for us, that is far more than this.""

The Indian foreign ministry issued a statement this month saying there is no change in India's position, and that ""His Holiness is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.""

According to the latest data from the government in exile, more than 128,000 Tibetans live outside of their homeland. Of those, 94,000 live in India, around three quarters of the total. Another 10.6% live in Nepal and the remaining have resettled in more than 30 countries around the world.

Since 1974, the Dalai Lama has said he does not seek independence from China for Tibet, but a ""meaningful autonomy"" which would allow Tibet to preserve its culture and heritage.

India maintains that Tibetans in India ""do not conduct political activities from Indian soil.""

Dance, not fight

Recent statements from Beijing and Delhi show the two governments are seeking to mend ties after a turbulent year in bilateral relations.

Last year, troops from both countries were involved in a months-long border standoff in Doklam , up in the Himalayas near Bhutan.

At a press conference last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two countries leaders ""have developed a strategic vision for the future of our relations: the Chinese 'dragon' and the Indian 'elephant' must not fight each other, but dance with each other.""

India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale visited Beijing in February, where he said both sides noted the need to ""address differences on the basis of mutual respect and sensitivity to each other's concerns, interests and aspirations.""

Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, said India is keen to keep ties balanced, especially with China growing closer to rival Pakistan.

""Relations stand at an uneasy place, with India trying to backtrack somewhat and mend fences that were broken in the last two years,"" he told CNN.

He added China was also seeking progress as it didn't want ""India to drift back into the American camp.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in June.

Tibetans may be the big losers if India and China do mend things up, said Tshering Chonzom Bhutia, associate fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi.

""If policymakers in India continue to be guided by the perception that serving up the Tibet issue on the diplomatic plate to China is the most efficient way to improve India-China relations, then we can anticipate more restrictions on Tibetan activities in India,"" she said.

Against the backdrop of China's rising dominance in India's neighboring countries, Tibet is a minor issue for Delhi, said Tsering Shakya, a Tibet scholar and research chair at the University of British Columbia in Canada.

""India is sensing Tibet's appeal in the West is declining,"" Shakya said, freeing Delhi to play to Beijing's feelings on the issue.

Uncertainty

Adding to all this uncertainty is the confusion of what happens after the Dalai Lama dies.

In 2011, in a move to democratize the system of government, the Dalai Lama gave up his political and administrative powers and chose to remain as just a spiritual leader, but he is still far and away the community's most influential figure.

When the current Dalai Lama dies, Tibetans will be in a state of disarray, said Phunchok Stobdan, a former Indian diplomat and a senior fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, although he stressed that India will continue to support the Tibetan refugees on humanitarian grounds.

""India will do (this) because India is a democratic country. That is separate from the political side of it,"" he said.

But many Tibetans in India are concerned about their future in the country when the most influential figure in their community is no longer there to speak out on their behalf.

Ultimately, what might matter most is geopolitics.

""How the political issue of Tibet will pan out in the post-Dalai Lama era depends to a huge extent on the bilateral India-China dynamics as well as the regional and global situation,"" Bhutia said.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/asia/india-tibet-china-dalai-lama-intl/

BEIJING — Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.

The sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.

“The motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong’s crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,” the court’s verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.

The court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.
