0,india,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has approved humanitarian proposals made by India regarding exchange of civilian prisoners incarcerated in both the countries.

The proposals include exchange of three categories of prisoners, women, mentally challenged or with special needs and those above 70 years of age.

In addition, New Delhi had proposed the revival of judicial committee mechanism and facilitating the visit of medical experts (from both sides) to meet and examine the mentally challenged prisoners for their repatriation.

According to a statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry on March 7, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has extended two more humanitarian proposals regarding exchange of prisoners above 60 years of age and child prisoners below 18 years of age.

He expressed the hope that India would positively reciprocate Pakistan’s proposals.

The foreign minister stated that it was his desire that through such initiatives, Pakistan and India would embark on the road to a comprehensive dialogue, and make a conscious effort to de-escalate the extremely vitiated current environment and the situation on the Line of Control and the Working Boundary.

Earlier this year, Pakistan had handed over a list of 457 Indian prisoners being held in the country to India. – SAMAA

1,india,"NEW DELHI: While the Abdulla Yameen government has lifted Emergency in the Maldives, India remains upset with Male for the opaque manner in which it is carrying out not just its China policy but also its overtures to Pakistan. The latest issue niggling India is Male's decision to discuss with Islamabad a visit by Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa without first bringing it to the notice of South Block.Despite its stated India First policy, the Yameen government has not bothered, unlike all other previous governments in Male, to take India into confidence on major issues in the spirit of mutual trust whether it's the Chinese investments in the Maldives or the ocean observatory Beijing wants to build right under India's nose.""As usual, the current Maldivian regime remains secretive about the dealings with the Chinese and Pakistanis unlike previous governments which took us into confidence in advance on such issues,’’ said a top Indian official on condition of anonymity when asked about Bajwa’s visit to Pakistan. He added that India was closely following reports that Bajwa was going to visit Male on March 31.As TOI had first reported on February 26, China is looking to build what the Maldives officially describes as a Joint Ocean Observation Station on the westernmost atoll of Makunudhoo in northern Maldives, not far from Lakshadweep. Even as it seeks to convince India that the observatory will have no military application, it has refused to share a copy of the agreement for the observatory with the Indian government.Official sources here said that former foreign secretary S Jaishankar had sought a clarification from the Maldivian ambassador, Ahmed Mohamed, over the issue. Mohamed is learnt to have told Jaishankar that China was only looking to build a meteorological ocean observation centre in the Maldives.A senior official of the Maldivian government told TOI too that the agreement signed was for meteorological purposes but refused to share a copy saying it was not a public document.While the President’s official website calls the agreement The Protocol on Establishment of Joint Ocean Observation Station between the Maldives and China, the Maldivian official claimed that the website probably ""forgot"" to add the word meteorological to it.A marine observatory, as strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney says, is an important tool to gather information on ocean state, phenomena and processes in order to have a better understanding of ocean dynamics and grasp regional characteristics and vulnerabilities.""A Chinese-built marine observatory in the Maldives will yield a variety of physical, chemical and biological data to better understand the specific characteristics of that part of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea so as to optimally deploy nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in India’s maritime backyard. This will complete India’s strategic encirclement,’’ he says.As Vice Admiral (Rtd) Jagjit Singh Bedi had tweeted, in response to the TOI story on the proposed observatory, China needed accurate and reliable hydrological data for sub surface operations. ""Precursor to prolonged deployment of SSBN/ SSN operations in the Arabian Sea. To be read in conjunction with surveys conducted off Gwadar (the Pakistan port which China has built and controls) to analyse tectonic activity,’’ tweeted Bedi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldivess-engagement-with-china-pakistan-too-secretive-for-india/articleshow/63523883.cms
2,india,"New Delhi (CNN) Is India distancing itself from the Tibetan exile community six decades after the Dalai Lama fled to the country?

That's the question many are asking after celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the spiritual leader's arrival in India have been moved or canceled, as Beijing and New Delhi seek to reboot ties in the wake of a tense year in bilateral relations.

From March 31, Tibetans in India are holding a year-long ""Thank You India"" event as a prelude to celebrating the Dalai Lama's time in the country and to show gratitude to the Indian government and its people for their support of Tibetan refugees.

But what should have been a moment of joy has been overshadowed by a flurry of speculation about the future of the exiled Tibetan community -- and especially the freedom they have enjoyed in India since the late 1950s.

""It looks like the Government of India is changing its policy,"" said Claude Apri, an India-based expert on Tibet and author of several books on Tibetan issues.

After an unsuccessful revolt against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled the capital Lhasa in secret.

He crossed into India on March 31, 1959 and has made India his home ever since.

A living god-like figure for millions of Buddhists, India officially calls him ""the most esteemed and honored guest of India."" China accuses of him of being a ""a wolf in monk's robes,"" engaged in ""anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion with the aim of breaking Tibet away from China.""

'Very sensitive'

attending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India. In early March, news emerged that the Indian Foreign Secretary penned a classified advisory asking senior leaders and government officials to refrain fromattending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India.

The note reportedly said the events, in March and April, came at a ""very sensitive time in the context of India's relations with China.""

A week later, the Tibetan Central Administration -- the government in exile -- decided to move a major cultural event that was originally planned to be held in the Indian capital New Delhi with a speech by the Dalai Lama, to Dharamsala, where the exiled community is based.

A Dalai Lama-led inter-faith prayer ceremony was also scrapped, the Tibetan Central Administration said, as was the Seventh World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet that was meant to be held on April 26-28 in Delhi.

The Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, the organizers of the convention, declined to give a reason for the cancellation of the high-profile event.

Sonam Dagpo, a spokesman for the Tibetan Central Administration said that there has been no direct communication from the Indian authorities and that the plans were changed out of respect to the Indian government's position.

""Once we (heard about the note), we decided to shift the venue,"" he said. ""There are no ill feelings. If you weigh what the Indian government has done for us, that is far more than this.""

The Indian foreign ministry issued a statement this month saying there is no change in India's position, and that ""His Holiness is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.""

According to the latest data from the government in exile, more than 128,000 Tibetans live outside of their homeland. Of those, 94,000 live in India, around three quarters of the total. Another 10.6% live in Nepal and the remaining have resettled in more than 30 countries around the world.

Since 1974, the Dalai Lama has said he does not seek independence from China for Tibet, but a ""meaningful autonomy"" which would allow Tibet to preserve its culture and heritage.

India maintains that Tibetans in India ""do not conduct political activities from Indian soil.""

Dance, not fight

Recent statements from Beijing and Delhi show the two governments are seeking to mend ties after a turbulent year in bilateral relations.

Last year, troops from both countries were involved in a months-long border standoff in Doklam , up in the Himalayas near Bhutan.

At a press conference last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two countries leaders ""have developed a strategic vision for the future of our relations: the Chinese 'dragon' and the Indian 'elephant' must not fight each other, but dance with each other.""

India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale visited Beijing in February, where he said both sides noted the need to ""address differences on the basis of mutual respect and sensitivity to each other's concerns, interests and aspirations.""

Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, said India is keen to keep ties balanced, especially with China growing closer to rival Pakistan.

""Relations stand at an uneasy place, with India trying to backtrack somewhat and mend fences that were broken in the last two years,"" he told CNN.

He added China was also seeking progress as it didn't want ""India to drift back into the American camp.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in June.

Tibetans may be the big losers if India and China do mend things up, said Tshering Chonzom Bhutia, associate fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi.

""If policymakers in India continue to be guided by the perception that serving up the Tibet issue on the diplomatic plate to China is the most efficient way to improve India-China relations, then we can anticipate more restrictions on Tibetan activities in India,"" she said.

Against the backdrop of China's rising dominance in India's neighboring countries, Tibet is a minor issue for Delhi, said Tsering Shakya, a Tibet scholar and research chair at the University of British Columbia in Canada.

""India is sensing Tibet's appeal in the West is declining,"" Shakya said, freeing Delhi to play to Beijing's feelings on the issue.

Uncertainty

Adding to all this uncertainty is the confusion of what happens after the Dalai Lama dies.

In 2011, in a move to democratize the system of government, the Dalai Lama gave up his political and administrative powers and chose to remain as just a spiritual leader, but he is still far and away the community's most influential figure.

When the current Dalai Lama dies, Tibetans will be in a state of disarray, said Phunchok Stobdan, a former Indian diplomat and a senior fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, although he stressed that India will continue to support the Tibetan refugees on humanitarian grounds.

""India will do (this) because India is a democratic country. That is separate from the political side of it,"" he said.

But many Tibetans in India are concerned about their future in the country when the most influential figure in their community is no longer there to speak out on their behalf.

Ultimately, what might matter most is geopolitics.

""How the political issue of Tibet will pan out in the post-Dalai Lama era depends to a huge extent on the bilateral India-China dynamics as well as the regional and global situation,"" Bhutia said.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/asia/india-tibet-china-dalai-lama-intl/index.html
3,india,"Masood strongly condemns killing of 6 innocent Kashmiris by Indian troops

President says India’s draconian black laws empower occupation forces to commit war crimes

Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan has strongly condemned killing by Indian occupation forces of 6 innocent civilians in Shopian and subsequent lockdowns and crackdowns in Indian-Held Kashmir.

Speaking on the recent killings taking place in IHK, the president said, “Six young civilian men were gunned down in cold blood and now they are being called militants. India has flouted international humanitarian laws applicable in the conflict situations which prohibits the killing of non-combatants. India has once again committed a heinous war crime.”

The president made these remarks during his two-day official visit to Italy while addressing various events in the cities of Brescia, Bergamo, and Cremona organised by the Pakistani-Kashmiri community-based in the administrative region of Lombardy.

President Masood Khan said that India’s draconian black laws – the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and Public Safety Act – empower occupation forces to commit such war crimes with impunity. India, the president said, must be held accountable by the UN Security Council, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the Human Rights Council.

He said that India by using unbridled brute force has denied the unarmed innocent Kashmiris their right to self-defence and instead demonised their indigenous freedom struggle as acts of terrorism and labeling the defenseless protestors as terrorists.

Emphasising the fact that there was no terrorism in IHK, he said, “The Kashmiris are the most unarmed populace on the face of the earth and are leading a peaceful unarmed struggle for their right to self-determination which had been guaranteed under the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. The only terrorism in IHK is the state terrorism under the patronage of Delhi.”

During his interaction at the community events, he complimented the Pakistani-Kashmiri community-based in Italy for their commitment and resolute struggle for the cause of Kashmir; especially commending their efforts in closing their ranks and forging unity.

Lauding the successes of the Pakistan-Kashmir diaspora community, he urged them to continue working for a stronger and prosperous Pakistan because only a strong Pakistan can guarantee the realisation of the right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. He thanked the people and Government of Pakistan for its continued moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiris.

Paying tribute to the valiant civilians living along the LoC, he assured his audience that the issues concerning compensation to the people living near the LoC and relocation of some of the population exposed to extremely dangerous zones are being addressed.

In his exchange of views with the Italian lawmakers and other interlocutors, the president said that Pakistan and Italy enjoyed excellent relations and work closely on various issues at the United Nations. The members of the Pakistan-Kashmir community in Italy, he said, were acting as ambassadors between Pakistan and Italy building and strengthening diplomatic and social bridges between the two countries.",https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/06/india-flouting-international-humanitarian-laws-ajk-president/
4,india,"NEW DELHI: In a significant move to ease tensions, India and Pakistan are looking to put a lid on recent incidents of harassment of diplomats by reiterating a code of conduct arrived at in 1992 to ensure diplomatic staff are not subject to rough treatment that has accelerated a downturn in relations.The understanding under the code of conduct (CoC) for treatment of diplomatic/consular personnel signed in 1992 after a spate of incidents of harassment indicates that India and Pakistan seem to have decided they should not sink any further in diplomatic quicksand over instances of intimidation.The two sides have taken steps to minimise such cases in the past 5-6 days and called on each other to abide by the August 1992 CoC in dealing with diplomats in talks held here and in Islamabad . Interestingly, the announcement comes even as Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria assured businessmen at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry that he would try to maximise visas issued for trade.“Traders on both sides of the Indo-Pak border face visa issues which is among the reasons why the two sides have failed to actualise the potential $30 billion trade mark estimated by the World Bank,” Bisaria said. “I will try that maximum number of Indian visas are issued to traders,” he said.In Delhi, the MEA said, “India and Pakistan have mutually agreed to resolve matters related to the treatment of diplomats and diplomatic premises, in line with the 1992 code of conduct.”There have been instances of aggressive tailing of Indian diplomats in Islamabad and Pakistani diplomats have reported similar incidents in Delhi.Talking about the significance of the CoC, former Indian HC to Pakistan TCA Raghavan said it was signed at a tense period in India-Pakistan relations and was a pragmatic attempt to ring fence diplomats from frequent turbulence in ties. “Though frequently infringed through tit-for-tat responses, it remains a standard to be invoked to reset things at more stable levels,” he said.Both sides agreed there was at least a hint of de-escalation in the past week or so. The last incident of harassment reported by Pakistan was on March 22. India though did issue a note verbale to Pakistan earlier this week and sources here said there were still “minor’’ cases of tailing of Indian staff taking place in Islamabad. According to Indian authorities, Pakistan has often claimed harassment of its personnel in India in a bid to establish equivalence.The two countries have again sought to bring humanitarian issues to the fore with India, as reported by TOI on March 26, seeking visas for a team of doctors that will visit Pakistan soon to examine mentally unsound Indian prisoners.The CoC clearly lays down that the dignity and personal inviolability of diplomatic/ consular personnel of the Sending State and their families shall be guaranteed and fully respected by the Receiving State.It also states that intrusive and aggressive surveillance and actions such as verbal and physical harassment, disconnecting of telephone lines, threatening telephone calls, pursuit in cars and unauthorised entry into residences shall not be resorted to.The two countries are also looking to arrive at an understanding to facilitate unhindered construction work by either side. While Indian diplomats can still live without the membership of elite Islamabad Club – Pakistan interior ministry is yet to approve Indian envoy Ajay Bisaria’s membership – India is not willing to brook any obstruction in the ongoing work for a residential complex for Indian staff in Islamabad. A raid on the complex on February 15 was one of the triggers for the chain of events which eventually led to allegations of intimidation of diplomats and other staff.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-turn-to-code-of-1992-to-put-a-lid-on-envoys-harassment/articleshow/63551262.cms

Kumar (left) with Modi

New Delhi: Ashwani Kumar, former Union minister for law and justice, has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to enact a legislation to prevent custodial torture.

""Instances of custodial torture, reported almost on a daily basis, clearly demonstrate that pervasive acts of torture of helpless individuals in custody continue unabated. Some of these instances are heartrending and must shock the conscience of every citizen,"" Kumar said in a letter to the Prime Minister.

The former minister appealed to Modi to explore the possibility of mandating a legislation against custodial torture during the ongoing budget session of Parliament.

Against the backdrop of the ongoing debate on date security, Kumar also requested the Prime Minister to pursue the necessary legal framework for a standalone law to protect privacy.

Kumar said in a statement that Modi agreed in principle with the humanitarian issues raised by the former minister and that such issues needed to be addressed in the framework of the human rights philosophy enshrined in the Constitution.

The Prime Minister assured him of his ""personal, urgent and positive attention"" on the need for enacting purposive legislation to protect the individual's right to dignity, privacy and reputation, Kumar said in a statement.

Kumar, who is also a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, met the Prime Minister in his Parliament House office on Tuesday to follow up on a public interest litigation petition filed by the former minister in the Supreme Court.

The apex court had left the matter to the government and disposed of the petition on the basis of the attorney-general's assurance that the Centre was considering such legislation.

In 2010, a select committee of the Rajya Sabha, chaired by Kumar, had proposed a comprehensive bill on the prevention of torture which was con sidered compliant with the provisions of the UN Convention Against Torture.

India has not ratified the UN Convention, which enables the ""international community to question our commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law. Inaction on this score diminishes our soft power and denies us the moral authority when voicing humanitarian concerns in the international fora"", Kumar said in the letter to Modi.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/ex-minister-plea-for-anti-torture-law-219716

At the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) here, a group of scientists is preparing a one-of-its-kind database of brain images that, when compiled together, could result in a so-called Indian Brain Template (IBT).

This archetype, to be constructed from a composite of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from 150 adult Indians, will likely include at least one person from every State and Union Territory, and serve as a guide to neuroscientists and surgeons, who have so far based their knowledge of intricate brain anatomy on Caucasian models.

Significant variations

Over the years, scientists from across the world have been pointing out that there are significant variations in the location of key brain regions and the density of neurons in various brain areas between racial types.

Drawing from this, several countries, including China, South Korea and Canada, have brain templates of their population and it is time, say researchers, that India had one of its own, too.

“There are variations in the size, volume and location of certain brain regions in Indian populations compared to, say, the Canadians,” said Pravat Mandal, a neuroscientist and project leader at the National Brain Research Centre here.

A tough job

Of the 150 healthy participants that they hope to recruit over the year, “about 40%,” according to Dr. Mandal’s estimates, are expected to be scanned at the NBRC in the next two months.

“It’s a tough job recruiting and cajoling participants to spend 10 minutes inside an MRI scanner, which is about the time required for a detailed scan,” he added.

By way of comparison, China’s template rests on a bank of about 1,000 volunteers and the Canadian template (called the Montreal Neurological Institute template and a key reference point in the field) is built on about 300 healthy volunteers.

The IBT is funded by the Department of Science and Technology. While other research groups in India have attempted similar databases, none have aspired to the geographical and chronological spread of participants envisaged by Professor Mandal’s initiative.

Naren Rao, a neuropsychiatrist at the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), and his colleagues had embarked on building an IBT. They, however, had only 27 recruits, all from Aurangabad and this was, said Dr. Rao, “due to logistical challenges.”

In that study of 17 men and 10 women — all certified as mentally fit by a neuropsychiatrist — it emerged that Indian brains “significantly differed” in length and width, but not in their height, from Caucasian brains, according to a 2016 report in Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, a peer-reviewed journal. “They were smaller but that doesn’t mean Indians have lesser intelligence,” Dr. Rao clarified to The Hindu in a phone conversation.

While the comparison of brain sizes among people of various ethnicities was an obsession of the 19th century physiology, contemporary researchers are keener on variations in the innards of the brain and whether it could hold clues to neuropsychiatric diseases.

Dr. Mandal, who has completed a few scans in the course of the IBT project, said that while it’s early to say if there’s anything typical about Indian brains, a key factor that he will be looking out for is the quantity of a molecule called glutathione, an antioxidant known to help repair cell damage. Dr. Mandal avers that reduced glutathione concentrations in the parietal cortical region — near the back of the brain near where the skull bulges — may help predict Alzheimer’s disease.

“We will be looking at glutathione concentrations and how they vary with age in the people we study,” he added. The other outstanding question, said Dr. Rao, would be to establish if the brain variation within Indians, given the country’s complex history of migrations, was greater than among other countries.",http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/manesar-scientists-to-create-indian-brain-template/article23395277.ece
7,india,"China said today it will resume sharing with India the hydrological data of the Brahmaputra river as top water resource officials of the two countries wrapped up two-day talks, the first after Beijing last year stopped providing the data crucial to predict floods.

""On the basis of humanitarian spirit and our shared will to develop bilateral ties we will continue with the cooperation on hydrological information cooperation,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a media briefing here.

He was responding to a question whether China will resume sharing of the hydrological data on Brahmaputra river, which Beijing suspended last year stating that it could not share it with India due to upgradation of data collection station in Tibet.

China's announcement to not to share the data came soon after the 73-day long stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Dokalam over Chinese military's plans to build a road close to India's Chicken Neck corridor connecting North-Eastern states.

A team of officials of India's Ministry of Water Resources held talks with their Chinese counterparts on the cooperation of trans-border rivers in the last two days at the Chinese city of Hangzhou, the first after Beijing last year stopped providing the data.

Lu said during the talks the two sides reviewed the achievements of the previous meetings as well as bilateral cooperation on emergency and response and hydrological information.

""The two sides have agreed to continue with such cooperation. On the grounds of humanitarian principles and the basis of bilateral relations China will continue with this cooperation with the Indian side on the provision of hydrological information and emergency response cooperation,"" Lu said.

Asked whether China would resume the data, Lu said ""since you made it quite clear"", China will continue with the cooperation on hydrological information cooperation.

The two-day talks of the 11th meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) on Trans-Border Rivers concluded yesterday at Hangzhou, a statement from the Indian Embassy here said today.

The Indian side was led by Teerath Singh Mehra, Commissioner (B&B), Ministry of Water Resources and the Chinese side by Yu Xingjun, Consul, Department of International Cooperation Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources.

The meeting which was held in a ""cordial and friendly"" atmosphere reviewed the progress made since the earlier meetings of the ELM and their continued cooperation on provision of hydrological information and emergency management in respect of trans-border rivers, the press release said.

The officials also reviewed the data utilisation report upon provision of hydrological information provided by China to India in flood season on Brahmaputra and Sutlej Rivers.

The institutional mechanism of the ELM was established in 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers.

Under existing bilateral Memorandums of Understanding, China provides to India hydrological information of Brahmaputra River (Yarlong Zangbo) and Sutlej River (Langqen Zangbo) during the flood seasons.

Under the arrangement, China provides flood season data of the Brahmaputra river between May 15 and October 15 every year.

China has been building major dams on Brahmaputra river to generate hydel power. It operationalised Zangmu hydroelectric project in October, 2015 and three more are under construction.

While dams raised concerns of water shortages in India and Bangladesh, which are lower riparian states of Brahmaputra river, China said its dams were aimed at generating power and not storing water.

The data shared by upper riparian state, China, to lower riparian states, India and Bangladesh is essential every monsoon to allow anticipation of the flow of the water and take necessary measures to deal with flooding in India's Northeastern states.",http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-china-cites-humanitarian-spirit-to-resume-sharing-hydrological-data-with-india-on-brahmaputra-2598817

9,india,"NEW DELHI: Foxconn’s India arm stepped up its local manufacturing efforts by starting the assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which will likely benefit clients such as Chinese phone company Xiaomi and HMD Global , the makers of Nokia devices, as it will give them a price advantage over rivals that have to pay duty on imported PCBs, widely expected to be levied from April.PCBs make up about 50% of the cost of making a phone. South Korea’s Samsung is among the only major brand that assembles PCBs in India.“They ( Foxconn ) have begun assembling PCBs in India,” said a person with knowledge of the development. Foxconn’s move is a boost for Make in India . India had raised basic customs duty (BCD) on smartphones to 20% in the Union Budget from 15% earlier, which became effective February 1. Import duties have acted as a catalyst for the establishment of nearly 120 mobile phone manufacturing companies since 2014. However, many of these were assembling handsets at less than 10% value addition.With PCB assembly and manufacturing of some other components, local value addition is set to rise to 15%, analysts said.Foxconn Technology Group said it “follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products.”The world’s largest contract manufacturer, also the biggest contract manufacturer for phones in India, has acquired machinery that enables surface mounting on PCBs from the now-defunct Nokia plant in Sriperumbudur, near Chennai The company currently has a phone manufacturing facility at Sri City, Andhra Pradesh , located on the border with Tamil Nadu, employing about 6,000 people to produce more than 15 million phones a year for companies such as Xiaomi, HMD Global, which makes Nokia-branded phones, and Gionee.“Companies like Xiaomi and HMD Global will benefit, as they won't have to increase prices, while others who will continue to import PCBs will have to raise prices of mobile phones,” said Navkendar Singh, research director at International Data Corporation (IDC) India.Xiaomi may be able to sell a model for less than Rs 5,000 since it has volumes and the saving on local assembly will give it greater margins for marketing and distribution, making it a stronger player, Singh said. This is critical in a price-sensitive market like India, where most smartphones are sold in the under Rs 10,000 band.Xiaomi, which recently replaced Samsung as the country’s No 1 smartphone maker by shipments, declined to comment. HMD Global didn’t respond to ET’s queries.Ajey Mehta, head of India operations at HMD Global, had told ET earlier that the company was working with its partners to manufacture more components in India. “SMT is definitely on the card for us,” he said.

10,india,"While a section and sector of India is busy enjoying its glooming lifestyle and increasing earning potential, job crisis in India is deepening. This is once again highlighted after Indian Railways received over two crore job applications for just one lakh vacancies – two hundred candidates competing with each other for each post. Apathy is, these figures are just initial indicators of the job crisis in India as there are still five more days to apply for these post.

Despite all the claims and statements, job crisis in India is apparently far from over. Most of the industries are going through a transitional phase and actively embracing technology-driven processes, which is resulting in the high demand for government jobs in India. However, the demand for skilled workforce and performance bases payout have forced many state government to look to outsourced model or hire people on contract for a short period.

The loss of existing jobs is only making the situation worse for government and people of India. Last year, between October 2016 and October 2017, 90 lakh jobs were lost. The increasing worrisome employment situation has tagged India with the “job-loss economy”. between 2011 and 2016, the population percentage of working professionally in India declined to 51% from 54%.

Government claim to provide a great push to entrepreneurship in the country has only helped the cause a bit. The real cause behind the deteriorating employment situation is the imbalance between the increasing working population and new jobs. Between 2012 and 2016, the working age population at the rate of 2.9% per year. In contrast, during the same period, the number of people with jobs increased at just 1.2% – half the required rate.

The increasing unemployable skill set is another concern, especially in private sectors, which requires an immediate attention. 95% of software engineers in India developers are tagged as unemployable, claims a recent study done by Aspiring Minds.

The bar of the quality talent we needed a decade ago, has gone up significantly. But the academia has not kept pace with it. What we were developing as talent probably five years ago was still matching the demand then in terms of quality level. Fast forward 2018, due to the advent of Article Intelligence, Machine Learning and IoT enabled devices the required talent pool is completely different, says Sachin Gupta, CEO – HackerEarth.

But, will improved quality talent pool in IT sector solve the employment problem? probably not. Analysts believe that government must focus on tech and non-tech sector equally to create an adequate number of job openings for people belonging to different sectors.

In the non-tech sector, the need of the hour is to improve manufacturing capabilities and capacity in India, feels Paul Krugman, a 2008 Nobel prize winner American economist. he strongly believes that India could overcome the job crisis only by having balanced offerings between services and local manufacturing.

By having the demographic population advantage – the majority of the young population – India could easily eat into the markets share of other manufacturing hubs, likes of China and Japan where a majority of the population is ageing. But if India fails to act now and makes no confident moves, the job crisis in India may only get worse in the years to come.",https://dazeinfo.com/2018/03/29/india-job-crisis-employement/
11,india,"A new citizenship registry threatens to exclude millions – mostly Muslims of Bengali extraction – and force out entire populations who have always called the state home

Altaf Hossain has been distraught the past couple of months. He’s always thought he was Indian, but is now being told the country doesn’t think of him as one of its own. His name, he has learned, is missing from a new citizenship registry being drawn up by the government of his home state of Assam, where millions of people are in danger of being disenfranchised.

“I am not in the first list, the authorities have supposedly found a mismatch in my family tree. My family has lived in Assam since 1942 and now I can suddenly become stateless,” said Hossain, a shopkeeper in Assam’s western district of Dhubri bordering Bangladesh.

Imtiaz Ahmed, a farmer, is in a similar situation. He says his land records date back to his grandfather but the authorities insist something is amiss. “This registry update is a cruel joke,” he said.

Hossain and Ahmed are among five million residents – mostly Muslims of Bengali extraction – in the troubled north-eastern state facing expulsion as the provincial government puts the final touches on its National Register of Citizens (NRC), due in about four months.

The government’s disenfranchising of those whom Assam now says are foreigners could trigger a crisis like that facing the Rohingya in Myanmar. That crisis erupted after Rakhine state disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Muslims through a new citizenship law that took effect in 1982.

“If most citizens don’t get to retain their citizenship in Assam, we are looking at a huge mass of stateless persons like in Myanmar’s Rakhine province. It would end up in a similar humanitarian crisis,” said Anita Sengupta, head of the Calcutta Research Group.

WATCH: What’s driving Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis?

A top Assam government official said mismatches in family trees had been found in 4.8 million applications during the updating of the NRC. “It is unlikely these applicants, at least most of them, can make it into the NRC,” said the official.

India’s Supreme Court has set a June 30 deadline for the publication of the registry. The first part of the draft NRC, containing 19.1 million names, was published on December 31. Nearly 33 million residents of Assam applied for inclusion in the registry, of which about 12.8 million applicants are not yet on the list. Those who can’t make it to the final list will lose their citizenship.

The original Assam NRC, prepared in 1951, is being updated under the supervision of the Supreme Court to detect “illegal immigrants”, raising fears that tens of thousands of Bengali-speaking Hindus, but mostly Muslims, may find their names deleted from the new registry. The first list published in December did not contain the names of two lawmakers, Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and Radheshyam Biswas, both from the Assam’s leading minority party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). Even some Assamese Hindu politicians of this party were not on the first list. The registry made headlines for excluding a retired army officer. Ajmal, a Muslim of Bengali descent, is a perfume baron with headquarters in Dubai and Mumbai who set up the AIUDF in 2006. Biswas is a Bengali Hindu and represents Ajmal’s party in parliament.

The registry update process puts the onus of proof on anyone alleged to be an illegal migrant. Muslims and Hindus of Bengali origin make up nearly 45 per cent of Assam’s population, more than ethnic Assamese, since most tribespeople register themselves by tribal identity and not as Assamese speakers. The number of Bengali speakers, particularly Muslims, has climbed steadily in the past several decades, making nativism a divisive but lasting strand of Assam’s politics.

For many years, the province has been in the throes of a violent political movement against “outsiders” domiciled in the state. Initially targeted at all people of non-Assamese origin, “outsiders” has come to mean Muslim migrants from Bangladesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, rode this popular anger to power in Assam in 2016, by promising to update the NRC and protect Assam’s identity from dilution through illegal immigration.

An earlier law – the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal), or IMDT Act – enacted to protect illegal immigrants from expulsion unless proved illegal, was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2005, setting in motion the registry update that now threatens to uproot millions. The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the old law and force a registry update has been welcomed by Assam’s nativist parties, especially the All Assam Students Union (AASU), which led the violent anti-migrant agitation in the state in 1978-1985.

“The Supreme Court’s decision has fulfilled the aspirations of ethnic Assamese who have faced a demographic invasion from Bangladesh,” said Sammujal Bhattacharjee, chief adviser to the AASU.

“We welcome the court’s unambiguous verdict that leaves the government with no options but to comply,” said Abhijeet Sarma, president of the Assam Public Works, a local non-government organisation that moved the court to update the NRC.

But changes in the law and the court order to correct the NRC have struck terror into the hearts of millions within the at-risk groups. “The IMDT Act was our protection against arbitrary denial of citizenship by Assamese politicians and a very biased bureaucracy,” Bengali Muslim politician Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Chowdhury said. “The scrapping of that law has put us in a similar situation as the Rohingya in Myanmar, who are also considered illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.”

With 4.8 million applicants still unable to prove their roots, Assam is at the risk of throwing up a mass of stateless population unprecedented in its scale. “Will Assam be the next Rakhine?” wrote the state’s leading political commentator Utpal Bordoloi.

On August 15 last year – Indian independence Day – a video showed Muslims of Bengali descent steadfastly hoisting Indian flags and braving floodwaters as they stood in boats. According to Bordoloi, they were trying to drive home the point they are Indians. ■",http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/2138246/indias-assam-rohingya-refugee-crisis-making

The rare, mutual understanding comes amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed rival nations, stemming from military skirmishes in the disputed Kashmir region.

16,india,"Image copyright Press Trust of India Image caption Students have protested against the exam leak

India has launched an inquiry into its national school exams after questions were leaked, forcing 1.6 million students to resit their tests.

Police have questioned 32 people over the leaks in mathematics and economics papers which were accessed and spread via WhatsApp before the exam.

Authorities say the new exam dates will be announced soon.

Cheating in exams is common including paying large bribes to buy exam papers, although there have been other methods.

In 2015, around 300 people were arrested and 750 students expelled in the northern state of Bihar after parents and friends of students were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers during school exams.

The latest leak of high-school question papers pertains to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams that are crucial for students hoping to secure admission in some of India's most prestigious public universities.

Federal education minister Prakash Javadekar has promised to strengthen online security following the outrage over the leak.

""The criminals who did this won't be spared. I am sure police will catch these people soon. Let me assure that we will further improve the system and make it foolproof,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

He said he ""understood the pain and anguish and frustration"" of parents and students following the breach.

Police in the capital Delhi say they have questioned more than 30 people, including college students and tutorial centre owners, in connection with the leak.

The leaks have also put pressure on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defend itself over digital security.

Rahul Gandhi, president of the main opposition Congress party, condemned the leaks while taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Twitter.

The government was also criticised earlier this week after Mr Modi's official mobile application was accused of sending personal user data to a third party without their consent.

Skip Twitter post by @RahulGandhi The exam leaks destroy the hopes and futures of millions of students.



The Congress always protected our institutions. This is what happens when institutions are destroyed by the RSS/BJP.



Believe me when I say, this is only the beginning. — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) March 29, 2018 Report

Authorities said that copies of the economics paper were being circulated on social media hours before the test, which began on 26 March.

The Delhi government also received complaints on 15 March after another exam paper was reported to have leaked.

The CBSE initially denied reports of leaks in the public, but acknowledged them a week later.

""We are working for the children. Nobody needs to worry. We have taken a decision in favour of the children,"" Anita Karwal, a CBSE official, said on Thursday.

In recent years, authorities in Bihar have asked students not to wear shoes or socks and imposed fines and jail terms to stop cheating in school exams.

They have also expelled students and detained parents for helping their children cheat in the exams.

17,india,"After relations between China and India reached a new low during last year’s Doklam stand-off, New Delhi’s China policy has taken a sharp turn this year, in what could be interpreted as a reversal of its previous stance. In recent months, India has not only supported China’s vice-presidency in the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental agency combating money laundering, but Delhi also withdrew its support from a commemorative event marking the 59th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising. And, in a bid to stabilise ties, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to visit China next month.

The change in India’s approach has triggered a backlash in academic and strategic circles at home, with China sceptics expressing concern that Delhi was “surrendering” to Beijing. Such an observation isn’t entirely accurate.

First, it’s important to understand the factors driving this change. Last year, besides the tensions over Doklam, New Delhi’s invitation to the Dalai Lama to visit Arunachal Pradesh and its criticism of Beijing’s “Belt and Road Initiative” also significantly damaged bilateral ties. On its part, Beijing has been deepening its strategic ties with Pakistan, and it continues to oppose India’s entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, as well as its attempt to get Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar added to an international blacklist of terrorists. This has prompted New Delhi to look for a counterstrategy.

Will India turn its back on the Dalai Lama to appease China?

The agent of change has been India’s new foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, a former ambassador to China. Under his leadership, New Delhi realised that its aggressive tit-for-tat moves were self-damaging and could not be sustained for long.

Meanwhile, an intensification of geostrategic competition in the region is playing out in the background. In Nepal, the Beijing-friendly communist alliance easily defeated the traditional Indian ally, Nepali Congress, in elections last November. In Sri Lanka, the running of the Hambantota port was handed over to a Chinese company. And the Maldives became a new site for strategic competition, with the current regime aligning itself with China.

No wonder New Delhi is correcting course in its approach to dealing with China.

At the same time, it appears to be compensating for this tactical retreat by aligning itself with a larger regional alliance. India has thrown its weight behind the Quad grouping, also comprising Australia, Japan and the United States, in its quest to reshape the Indo-Pacific balance of power.

The China factor remains a focal point in India’s foreign relations. During French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India this month, both sides welcomed a joint strategic vision for cooperation in the Indian Ocean. A bilateral agreement allowing reciprocal access to each other’s bases in the region was interpreted as a China-centric move.

Ties with Vietnam gained traction with the Vietnamese president’s visit early this month, and the nature of the agreements once again pointed towards India’s growing resolve to increase its footprint in the Indo-Pacific region.

India crafts its own ‘string of pearls’ to rival China’s naval jewels

To be sure, India’s scepticism of belt and road plan has not dissipated, and it is open to entering alliances which offer a credible alternative to the China-driven development plan. The Quad powers were reportedly mulling over the idea.

For now, India’s policy shift has raised some expectations as well. There are hopes, for example, that a friendlier attitude may earn New Delhi China’s support in its efforts to join the nuclear grouping and get Masood Azhar blacklisted by the United Nations.

Now that New Delhi is doing away with its reprisal-driven China policy and cutting down on irritants in their bilateral relationship, Beijing’s ability to deliver on New Delhi’s expectations would go a long way to defining the agenda for future relations.

18,india,"New Delhi (CNN) Is India distancing itself from the Tibetan exile community six decades after the Dalai Lama fled to the country?

That's the question many are asking after celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the spiritual leader's arrival in India have been moved or canceled, as Beijing and New Delhi seek to reboot ties in the wake of a tense year in bilateral relations.

From March 31, Tibetans in India are holding a year-long ""Thank You India"" event as a prelude to celebrating the Dalai Lama's time in the country and to show gratitude to the Indian government and its people for their support of Tibetan refugees.

But what should have been a moment of joy has been overshadowed by a flurry of speculation about the future of the exiled Tibetan community -- and especially the freedom they have enjoyed in India since the late 1950s.

""It looks like the Government of India is changing its policy,"" said Claude Apri, an India-based expert on Tibet and author of several books on Tibetan issues.

After an unsuccessful revolt against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled the capital Lhasa in secret.

He crossed into India on March 31, 1959 and has made India his home ever since.

A living god-like figure for millions of Buddhists, India officially calls him ""the most esteemed and honored guest of India."" China accuses of him of being a ""a wolf in monk's robes,"" engaged in ""anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion with the aim of breaking Tibet away from China.""

'Very sensitive'

attending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India. In early March, news emerged that the Indian Foreign Secretary penned a classified advisory asking senior leaders and government officials to refrain fromattending events planned by exiled Tibetans in India.

The note reportedly said the events, in March and April, came at a ""very sensitive time in the context of India's relations with China.""

A week later, the Tibetan Central Administration -- the government in exile -- decided to move a major cultural event that was originally planned to be held in the Indian capital New Delhi with a speech by the Dalai Lama, to Dharamsala, where the exiled community is based.

A Dalai Lama-led inter-faith prayer ceremony was also scrapped, the Tibetan Central Administration said, as was the Seventh World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet that was meant to be held on April 26-28 in Delhi.

The Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, the organizers of the convention, declined to give a reason for the cancellation of the high-profile event.

Sonam Dagpo, a spokesman for the Tibetan Central Administration said that there has been no direct communication from the Indian authorities and that the plans were changed out of respect to the Indian government's position.

""Once we (heard about the note), we decided to shift the venue,"" he said. ""There are no ill feelings. If you weigh what the Indian government has done for us, that is far more than this.""

The Indian foreign ministry issued a statement this month saying there is no change in India's position, and that ""His Holiness is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.""

According to the latest data from the government in exile, more than 128,000 Tibetans live outside of their homeland. Of those, 94,000 live in India, around three quarters of the total. Another 10.6% live in Nepal and the remaining have resettled in more than 30 countries around the world.

Since 1974, the Dalai Lama has said he does not seek independence from China for Tibet, but a ""meaningful autonomy"" which would allow Tibet to preserve its culture and heritage.

India maintains that Tibetans in India ""do not conduct political activities from Indian soil.""

Dance, not fight

Recent statements from Beijing and Delhi show the two governments are seeking to mend ties after a turbulent year in bilateral relations.

Last year, troops from both countries were involved in a months-long border standoff in Doklam , up in the Himalayas near Bhutan.

At a press conference last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two countries leaders ""have developed a strategic vision for the future of our relations: the Chinese 'dragon' and the Indian 'elephant' must not fight each other, but dance with each other.""

India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale visited Beijing in February, where he said both sides noted the need to ""address differences on the basis of mutual respect and sensitivity to each other's concerns, interests and aspirations.""

Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, said India is keen to keep ties balanced, especially with China growing closer to rival Pakistan.

""Relations stand at an uneasy place, with India trying to backtrack somewhat and mend fences that were broken in the last two years,"" he told CNN.

He added China was also seeking progress as it didn't want ""India to drift back into the American camp.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in June.

Tibetans may be the big losers if India and China do mend things up, said Tshering Chonzom Bhutia, associate fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi.

""If policymakers in India continue to be guided by the perception that serving up the Tibet issue on the diplomatic plate to China is the most efficient way to improve India-China relations, then we can anticipate more restrictions on Tibetan activities in India,"" she said.

Against the backdrop of China's rising dominance in India's neighboring countries, Tibet is a minor issue for Delhi, said Tsering Shakya, a Tibet scholar and research chair at the University of British Columbia in Canada.

""India is sensing Tibet's appeal in the West is declining,"" Shakya said, freeing Delhi to play to Beijing's feelings on the issue.

Uncertainty

Adding to all this uncertainty is the confusion of what happens after the Dalai Lama dies.

In 2011, in a move to democratize the system of government, the Dalai Lama gave up his political and administrative powers and chose to remain as just a spiritual leader, but he is still far and away the community's most influential figure.

When the current Dalai Lama dies, Tibetans will be in a state of disarray, said Phunchok Stobdan, a former Indian diplomat and a senior fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, although he stressed that India will continue to support the Tibetan refugees on humanitarian grounds.

""India will do (this) because India is a democratic country. That is separate from the political side of it,"" he said.

But many Tibetans in India are concerned about their future in the country when the most influential figure in their community is no longer there to speak out on their behalf.

Ultimately, what might matter most is geopolitics.

""How the political issue of Tibet will pan out in the post-Dalai Lama era depends to a huge extent on the bilateral India-China dynamics as well as the regional and global situation,"" Bhutia said.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/asia/india-tibet-china-dalai-lama-intl/

Modi was voted into power in 2014 on promises to reignite growth in Asia's third-largest economy and provide jobs.

But his flagship ""Make in India"" initiative to lift the share of manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy to 25 percent from about 17 percent and create 100 million jobs by 2022 has so far failed to deliver on its promise.

The railway, which currently employs 1.3 million people, said it was filling tens of thousands of vacant positions for engine drivers, technicians, carpenters, track inspection crews and other roles related to improving safety in the world's fourth-largest network.

""We've not been recruiting for the last couple of years and attrition is already there. And so we require people,"" Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the railways board, told Reuters news agency.

The Railway Recruitment Board advertised for the positions last month and, since then, 25 million people have filed online applications from around the country, Lohani said. The closing date is Saturday.

The recruitment drive would be the largest conducted by a state-run organisation since Modi took office four years ago, struggling to find jobs for an estimated 1 million young people that enter the labour force each month.

""The huge number of applications shows the level of stress,"" said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at economic think-tank CMIE.

""It shows that there is really a paucity of jobs, and the other thing is about the great preference that Indians have got for government jobs. We need to move away from this.""

The railways are India's biggest employer and are in the midst of a $130bn modernisation plan.

Applicants will take a written test available in 15 languages, according to the ad. There is also a physical fitness test, and different criteria for men and women have been specified.

Lohani said it would be a logistical challenge to sift through 25 million candidates, but the railway was equipped to handle it. ""We had to come out with an open advertisement, that is the only way to do it,"" he said.

India's unemployment rate surged to a 15-month high of 6.1 percent in February, think-tank CMIE said.

Even after the railway completes the recruitment, the challenge will be training the new workers, which is critical for safety, another expert said.

The early 1990s saw tectonic shifts in India’s civil aviation industry , with the objective of curbing the ‘monopoly’ of Air India and Indian Airlines and encourage competition through the participation of private operators.The government of the day rightly realised the importance of multiple Indian operators in international as well as domestic sectors to exploit the full commercial potential for the growth of this service sector through competition.Indeed, GoI’s policy shift saw not only rapid growth of operators but also of traffic. The monopoly of the state carriers was broken. But it had an unexpected side effect. At least 10 private operators failed to sustain their market existence owing to rank mismanagement and dubious source of funding and financing. Questions arose about whether private operators are good enough for a competitive market of volatile aviation economics? These doubts were not misplaced.Before the late 1990s, Indian Airlines’ profitability-frequency usually surpassed Air India’s, owing to the latter’s cut-throat competition with foreign carriers in the international circuit. But the 2007 merger of Air India and Indian Airlines virtually sank their collective finance. Eleven years later, there is no doubt that Air India needs to perform.Although the plan for Air India’s privatisation/divestment/disinvestment — call it what you feel like — is reported to be in an advanced stage, one must remember that in one stroke, GoI is selling four carriers: Air India, IndianAirlines, Air India Express and Alliance Air as ‘Air India’. So, for the final successful bidder, it will be a windfall, contrary to the projected ‘valuelessness’ of Air India.With a vast network across 60-plus domestic airports and 40-plus foreign destinations, a fleet of latest Airbus and Boeing aircraft, real estate, prime official and residential property, enormous landing rights, huge frequency and capacity across the globe, one has to keep a very watchful eye on the activities of the bidders (domestic or foreign) to ensure that India does not bring back the very monopoly GoI had sought to break from the 1990s through the back door.Competition in Indian aerospace received a sudden and unexpected jolt by way of what has been reported to be defective aero-engines of private carriers. This, in turn, has created an unforeseen situation resulting in increased profits for a few airlines. Competition, not cartelisation, is the essence of consumer convenience. One hopes this goes on uninterrupted post-divestment/disinvestment/ privatisation of Air India.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/view-why-the-government-needs-to-be-watchful-about-its-air-india-disinvestment-plan/articleshow/63550213.cms
23,india,"NEW DELHI: Google on Saturday dedicated its doodle to mark the 153rd birth anniversary of India's first lady doctor Anandi Gopal Joshi The doodle is created by Bangalore-based artist Kashmira Sarode , who portrayed Joshi celebrating her medical degree.As Google writes in its blog, ""In 1886, a young doctor stepped off a ship from America, eager to take up the role of physician in charge of the female ward at Kolhapur's Albert Edward Hospital. Not only was she India's first female doctor, but she was only 19 years old at the time. Her name was Anandi Gopal Joshi, and her story is one of courage and perseverance.""As per the custom in the 19th century India, Joshi, born on March 31 1865, was married at the age of nine; her husband encouraged her to continue her education.She earned her medical degree from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania , now known as Drexel University College of Medicine , and returned to India with dreams of opening a medical college for women.""Joshi's young life was tragically cut short when she died of tuberculosis before her 22nd birthday. However, her legacy and the path she paved for generations of women continues today. Interestingly, even a crater on Venus is named after her!"" the blog adds.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/google-doodle-marks-indias-first-lady-doctors-153rd-birthday/articleshow/63553791.cms
24,india,"India's jobs crisis—when emerging technologies are reducing jobs while new ones are hard to come by due to low private investment—has once again been highlighted. The railways has received more than two crore applications for about one lakh vacancies, with five days still remaining for the online registration to end.So many people chasing so few low-level government jobs points out that there is a dearth of jobs in the private sector and people fall back on government jobs due to uncertainty in the jobs market.Despite the government's thrust on generating jobs through entrepreneurs by giving easy small loans, 200 people chasing one job shows that the jobs crisis in India is deep.Not only is the private sector not adding enough new jobs, the government is cutting its jobs. Steep salary hikes due to the Pay Commission awards and the need for performance-based specialist jobs are forcing state governments to hire workers on contract or just outsource jobs. Several state governments have opted for such steps. Recently, the Tamil Nadu government constituted a committee to identify non-essential posts that can be done away with, outsourced or filled through contract appointments for a fixed period.In a deepening jobs crisis, a permanent government job is seen as a luxury.Job creation has become a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he has only one year left to face the people in Lok Sabha polls in 2019. He had promised to create 10 million jobs a year during his campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.Far from more jobs being created, employment has actually contracted, according to a Mint report. Employment in the total Indian economy shrank by 0.1% in financial year 2015-16 and by 0.2% in 2014-15. Employment fell in several sectors. ‘Agriculture, forestry, fishing’, mining, manufacture of food products, textiles, leather products, paper, transport equipment and trade are some sectors in which employment contracted in both 2014-15 and 2015-16, shows, the KLEMS India database, a research project supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to analyse the productivity of the Indian economy.A large number of people enter the workforce in India every year and most of them are not adequately skilled and a significant number not even employable. On top of this, emerging technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence have started reducing jobs in several sectors. Unskilled or under-skilled labour has been a major problem for India. Employability of even software engineers has been found too low.Recently, Paul Krugman, the American economist who won a Nobel Prize in 2008, warned that India could end up with huge mass unemployment if it does not grow its manufacturing sector.""There is this concept called artificial intelligence that you should be wary of. In future, while diagnosis may be outsourced to a doctor in India, it could also go to a firm based on artificial intelligence. Things like this could be a cause for worry for Indian services sector,"" Krugman said.In Asia, India could take the lead but only if it also develops its manufacturing sector, not only the services one,” he said.India's demographic dividend—the majority of its population being young—while population in many other Asian countries such as Japan and China is aging, would mean nothing if there aren't enough jobs and most of the youths lack employability.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/200-applicants-for-1-post-indias-jobs-crisis-gets-a-grim-reminder-from-railways/articleshow/63527790.cms
25,india,"Image copyright Postcard News Image caption The editor of Postcard News has been arrested for publishing fake news

The editor of an Indian website has been held, accused of publishing a false story about Muslims attacking a monk from the Jain faith, police say.

The report in Mahesh Hegde's Postcard News, a controversial right-wing site, showed the monk with head and shoulder injuries.

But police in southern Bangalore city said he was injured in a road accident.

India has no law against ""fake news"" but publishing content that could incite religious hatred is an offence.

Mr Hegde published the story on 18 March but deleted it a few days later after people started pointing out the inaccuracy.

He hasn't made a statement about his decision to publish and then delete the story.

He was arrested on Thursday after the ruling Congress party in the southern state of Karnataka filed a complaint.

""When the monk was getting treatment after the accident, one of his disciples took a picture. He [Mr Hegde] used the picture to say that the monk was attacked by Muslims. He published the news on his website as well and that is why he has been arrested,"" senior police office Satish Kumar told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi.

The Congress has also accused Mr Hegde of publishing content that favours the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

The two parties are campaigning to win the upcoming assembly elections in the state.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43593418
