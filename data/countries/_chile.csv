0,chile,"At a table stretching the length of an entire hotel dining room, a crew of interesting characters gather: Italian vintners with wineries in nearby Colchagua Valley, local surfers dedicated to the break at Punta de Lobos, and Chilean artists who transplanted to Pichilemu long ago, when the town resembled an undiscovered Tulum. None of them could resist the call of Chile's best-kept secret.

A three-hour drive from Santiago, the Chilean capital, the bohemian beach town of Pichilemu was first enjoyed by big-wave surfer Ramón Navarro and is now gaining the attention of international competitions like Quiksilver’s annual big-wave contest and the Association of Surfing Professionals’ Big Wave World Tour. This once quaint fishing village is steady gaining notoriety for its iconic left-hand point break at Punta de Lobos. Visit during the warm months of January and February to discover why this mellow town is quickly becoming a mainstay for the world’s in-the-know surf set.

Where to Stay

With 12 private bungalows and floor-to-ceiling views of the Chilean coastline, a stay at Hotel Alaia ensures you’re in the heart of the town’s adventurous action. Named after a round-nosed, square-tailed board first used in ancient Hawaii, the property’s organic and sustainable surf roots run deep. Each bungalow features outdoor terraces with access to the Pacific Ocean, an area the property works to preserve, creating harmony between the local community and the natural environment. With its own skate school, rock-climbing boulder wall, and fleet of stand-up paddle boards, Hotel Alaia offers plenty of ways to experience Pichilemu’s natural delights, but you can also find reasons not to leave the hotel, with in-room massages and cozy lobby fireplaces perfect for nightcaps. At the property’s own sea-to-table restaurant, dine on cuisine by chef Juan Morales, who sources organic vegetables, rock fish, and virtually every ingredient from a 60-mile radius. Well positioned near the Colchagua Valley wine region, guests can join winemaker Isidora Aldunate each Friday and Saturday evening (upon request) to taste the area’s plentiful wine varietals.

Where to Eat

Go to La Loba Restaurante, a slow-food outpost helmed by chef Leonor Correa. Freshly-caught grouper ceviche, octopus risotto, and merlot wine ice cream are all stars of the menu. Just a ten-minute drive into Pichilemu proper is Gustavo Moreno’s Raíces Lab, an experimental food research and development kitchen dedicated to cataloguing native plants and seafood along the Chilean coast. On Saturday mornings, Moreno guides gourmands along the rocky shoreline of Pichilemu, where larger-than-life strips of cochayuyu, or seaweed, bake in the sun. While foraging, Moreno scopes the area for edibles like wild sea asparagus and salty and citric wood sorrel, all ingredients the chef utilizes to reimagine food preparation. Along with his partner and sommelier Javiera Valenzuela, who makes the lab’s ceramics and pairs each dish with Chilean wine, Moreno hosts exclusive, six-seat lunches each Saturday near his seaside home. Expect dishes like black ink brioche buns stuffed with fried chicken, seaweed pickles, yellow peppers and cured fish roe, and cream of clams topped with flowers of sea garlic, accompanied by bright additions like the velvety mallow flower and wild radish as wasabi.

What to Do

Zip up your wetsuit and meet the instructors of Hotel Alaia’s surf school for a day conquering the long wave at Punta de Lobos. As a left-handed point break, the area is recognized for its shape, consistency, and protection from wind conditions. If surfing isn’t your sport of choice, there’s no need to fear. The coast is perfect for windsurfing, kitesurfing, sailing, and sunrise and sunset yoga, too, and you can even partake in a horseback ride or simply stroll through the town’s colorful arts and crafts fairs.

A tried-and-true haven for Chilean artists, Pichilemu is home to as many hidden art galleries as surf boards dotting its waters. Ask about the in-home galleries of some of Chile’s most prolific artists like Beatriz Hagel, Isabel Klotz, and sculpture artist Macarena Irarrazaval, which are occasionally open for visits. And don’t miss the chance to visit Barcaza Creative Center, where artists like Antonia Lara Gómez display their work. You’ll also see Lara’s work in Hotel Alaia, as this talented illustrator and naturalist created the ethereal sea-meets-land scene on the property’s own restaurant menus.",https://www.vogue.com/article/where-to-stay-eat-surf-in-pichilemu-chile
1,chile,"Pretty much every country in the world now has an obesity crisis. But no one’s really figured out what to do about it.

One of the most avant-garde obesity policy experiments is happening in Chile, where health officials are trying to revolutionize nutrition labeling. Instead of cramming percentages and numbers onto the back of food packages, the Chilean government now requires symbol-based warning labels on the front of food products that contain high levels of salt, sugar, calories, and saturated fat.

Canada, where 26 percent of adults have obesity, has taken notice. It’s now on the cusp of becoming the second high-income country to adopt a similar warning system. Meanwhile, Mexico, which has called overweight, obesity, and diabetes public health emergencies, is also considering following Chile’s lead.

But these new approaches in Mexico and Canada may never see the light of day if the American trade representatives get their way.

Welcome to the opaque — and somewhat surprising — intersection of obesity and the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiation.

According to a leaked document shared with Vox, US trade representatives are seeking to override national food labeling policies in Mexico, Canada — as well as in the US — through the NAFTA renegotiation.

Specifically, the US is proposing a provision about packaged food and non-alcoholic beverages that suggests that countries involved in the trade deal should not adopt front-of-package symbol warnings that “inappropriately denotes that a hazard exists from consumption of the food or non-alcoholic beverages.” The New York Times first reported on the provision Tuesday

On Wednesday, in a House Ways and Means Committee meeting about America’s trade agenda, the United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, confirmed that he is indeed pursuing this provision, arguing that national food labeling policies are “protectionist.”

But public health researchers and concerned lawmakers like Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex) see the provision another way: as a threat to the battle against obesity.

Today, I questioned U.S. Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer in a Ways & Means hearing on the public health impacts of current NAFTA negotiations. We must not let private interests, like Big Tobacco, Big Pharma & the Obesity Lobby subvert public health through such agreements. — Lloyd Doggett (@RepLloydDoggett) March 21, 2018

Processed foods are heavily linked to obesity and diabetes. Public health officials want consumers to know that.

The American diet — which has been exported around the world — relies heavily on processed foods. According to a recent study, published in the BMJ, almost 60 percent of the calories consumed in America between 2007 and 2012 came from ultra-processed foods, including soda and fruit juice, mass-produced breads, frozen meals, candies, cakes, and cookies.

Make no mistake: When we eat packaged foods, instead of home-cooked meals, we consume more sugar, salt, calories, and fat. That’s why prepared and packaged foods have been heavily linked with epidemic of diet-related diseases, including obesity and metabolic disorders, around the world.

As the packaged food industry has flourished, along with our penchant for these foods, there hasn’t been a lot of transparency about exactly what’s in them. There’s ample evidence that many people can’t make sense of the traditional food labels on the back of food packages: they too often require math, and some knowledge of nutrition. What’s more, they don’t always contain information about “nutrients of concern,” like added sugar.

That’s why groups, including the World Health Organization and Institute of Medicine, have suggested consumers would better served with symbol-based nutrition labels — like Chile’s.

Chile created easy to understand symbols for less healthy food

In 2016, Chile introduced its new food labeling system in response to the country’s dire obesity crisis. (Twenty-five percent of adults have obesity there.) There, food packages that are high in sugar, calories, saturated fat, and salt feature black, stop-sign warnings warnings with the words “Alto en” or “high in.”

Canada, where obesity rates have also continued to climb, is in the final stages of a regulatory process that will implement a Chile-like graphic warning system on the front of food packages. The Canadian government is currently taking comments about which of four front-of-package designs best “provide quick and easy guidance to help you make informed choices about packaged foods,” according to Health Canada.

In Mexico, the National Institute of Public Health has also acknowledged that many people can’t read their current food labels — and they’re looking at going the way of Chile.

The US food industry says warning labels would be costly. Health researchers say their arguments don’t hold water.

But these efforts may be hampered by the NAFTA renegotiation.

In the Ways and Means Committee meeting, Lighthizer explained why the Trump administration is concerned about the Chilean-style graphics on food packages. “There are lots of examples of countries that are using this loophole to basically create a protectionist environment,” he said.

The argument against the graphics seems to be that they would be costly and burdensome for US manufacturers who depend on Canada and Mexico for significant portion of their business. (An office of the US Trade Representative’s spokesperson would not comment on the specifics of the provision but said, “In general, the United States supports science based labeling that is truthful and not misleading.”)

The Grocery Manufacturers Association, the industry trade group that represents more than 250 leading food, beverage and consumer product companies and sits on the advisory board to the NAFTA negotiations, also told Vox “unnecessary differences in regulations increase costs without benefitting consumers.”

Instead, the GMA favors voluntary food labeling — like the Facts Up Front labeling system that already appears on the front of food packages, such as soda bottles, in the US.

But Shu Wen Ng, a University of North Carolina researcher who has been evaluating the effectiveness of anti-obesity policies around the world, pointed out, “A lot of research across the globe has looked at [these labels] and consumers don’t understand them. There’s too much information to digest across nutrients. It’s more confusing.”

What’s more, Ng added, exporting foods to Mexico or Canada already requires country-specific packaging. In Mexico, for example, packaged foods need to be labeled in Spanish, and in Canada, both French and English. So the argument that warning systems are extra burdensome, or would be hinder trade, “doesn’t hold water,” she added.

University of North Carolina nutrition policy researcher Barry Popkin says he thinks there’s a another reason food companies are pushing back: the graphic warning labels are bad marketing.

“The industry doesn’t like its foods being called not healthy,” said Popkin. “So what you have is an obesity lobby, trying to work across the three countries to force the NAFTA negotiators to accept this language versus all the public health and medical interest groups which are saying we’re in a big crisis now in our countries. And we really need to do something to change the diet.”

Canada’s final regulations are expected to be released later this year, and it’s not clear whether America’s position on food labeling could derail them. On the one hand, knowing a major trading partner isn’t happy about a policy should act as a deterrent for Canada, Ng said.

On the other, America’s effort to block the food labeling policies are reminiscent of Big Tobacco’s push to circumvent health warnings and labeling policies on cigarette packages through trade challenges, said the University of Waterloo’s David Hammond, who is advising Canada on their new food labeling policy. And these failed in many places when groups like the World Trade Organization asserted that countries have the right to put public health first.

“Consumers are not dietitians. We have study after study showing how people don’t know how to use the numbers [in traditional food labels],” Hammond said.

“It doesn’t surprise me that the food companies who manufacture products high in sugar and sodium don’t want a label telling consumers these are high in sugar and sodium. They are within their right to lobby. But let’s not confuse the industry’s interest with the consumers’ and public health interest.”

2,chile,"Red Cross: Rising humanitarian needs among Venezuelans entering Colombia

22nd Thursday, March 2018 - 11:33 UTC Full article

In 2017 alone, an estimated 796,000 people entered Colombia from Venezuela through official migration points

“No one organization, agency or government can address this issue alone,” said Mr Cotte.

The Colombian Red Cross Society have been working for more than a year to support people arriving in Colombia and travelling through the country. Aid workers are warning of rising vulnerabilities among people crossing the Colombian-Venezuelan border and “are calling on the international community to increase support for humanitarian efforts”, said a statement published by International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) at Geneva.

In 2017 alone, an estimated 796,000 people entered Colombia from Venezuela through official migration points and Between 2,000 and 10,000 people are on the move within Colombia every day. Some are looking for a place of temporary or long-term shelter, others use Colombia as a transit area to approach further south countries as Chile, Argentina, Peru or Ecuador. These numbers do not include people using informal border crossing. This is a major concern as these crossings are typically in areas where non-state armed groups from both Colombia and Venezuela operates.

“We are increasingly concerned about this situation, and we believe that additional, urgent action needs to be taken to ensure that people can access basic services and support,” said Walter Cotte, the IFRC Regional Director for the Americas.

At the border, you can easily see all kinds of migrants or people and officials taking advantage of the situation smuggling fuel or food.

“We crossed the border at Puerto Santander to reach the airport of Cúcuta with my husband and my 1-year old son”, says Andrea Astorga, a Venezuelan dentist who found a job a in Uruguay with a pay 1200 times higher than the one she had in Venezuela. “Venezuelan officials ruined our luggage looking for drugs, money or food to give them and when they found nothing, they asked for a ‘coima’ which is a pay to let us pass to Colombia”, added Astorga.

This situation is generating significant humanitarian needs in transit zones, places of temporary settlement or host cities in Colombia, especially along the Colombia-Venezuela and Colombia-Ecuador borders.

The statement follows that IFRC and the Colombia Red Cross have launched an international emergency appeal for 2.2 million Swiss francs, with the aim of providing expanded support to about 120,000 of the most vulnerable people who have crossed from Venezuela. The Red Cross aims to provide a range of basic services, including health care, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash transfer programming and livelihoods support.

In 2017, the Colombian Red Cross assisted more than 300,000 people. Their actions received financial backing from IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF).

“No one organization, agency or government can address this issue alone,” said Mr Cotte. “Authorities must work closely with national humanitarian actors and other partners to coordinate and strengthen the humanitarian assistance available to people in need, and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.”",http://en.mercopress.com/2018/03/22/red-cross-rising-humanitarian-needs-among-venezuelans-entering-colombia

Last week (March 22), researchers reported the sequenced genome of a mummified fetus found in 2003 near Chile’s Atacama desert in Genome Research. Now, some Chilean scientists are condemning the study as unethical, and the Chilean National Monuments Council has begun an inquiry into whether the remains were illegally disinterred and smuggled out of the country (via The New York Times).

The Chilean Society of Biological Anthropology released a statement yesterday (March 28), in which it says the study ignored the basic ethical standards surrounding archaeology. “[A] study of similar characteristics where the remains of a fetus [were] unearthed from a current cemetery in a developed country would surely provoke other reactions,” the statement concludes.

“We had no involvement or knowledge of how the skeleton was originally obtained nor how it was sold or exported to Spain,” Atil Butte, a geneticist at Stanford and coauthor of the Genome Research study, tells The New York Times. “We had no reason to suspect in this case that this sample was illegally obtained.”

Óscar Muñoz, a local treasure-hunter, found the remains in 2003 in the abandoned village of La Noria. The mummy is unusual in that it is 6 inches long but has a fully formed skeleton. It also has 10 ribs instead of 12 and large eye sockets set in an oblong skull that tapers to a point. Its unique appearance fueled rumors that it was a nonhuman primate or even an extraterrestrial being. A private collector in Barcelona named Ramon Navia-Osorio eventually obtained the mummy, which was featured in a 2013 documentary that claimed it was an alien life form (via Science). Gary Nolan, a geneticist at Stanford, heard about the film and contacted its producers to offer to analyze the mummy's DNA; they agreed, and last week Nolan’s team published its results.

Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the remains were in fact those of a human female who had mutations in several genes linked with a constellation of diseases affecting stature, skull formation, and skeletal dysplasia. “I was amazed by how much you can tell from the genetic blueprint,” study coauthor Sanchita Bhattacharya, a bioinformaticist at the University of California, San Francisco, told The New York Times last week.

Cristina Dorador, a biologist at the University of Antofagasta, published an article earlier this week (March 25) in Etilmercurio, an online science publication, in which she notes that the researchers failed to meet the legal requirements for working on samples from Chile, such as obtaining permits and providing an ethical statement about the work. “Etilmercurio demands that the Chilean authorities, the academic community and civil society openly condemn the outrage continually committed over the years,” she writes.

Dorador writes that the Genome Research study is “peppered with mistakes” about the origin and wider context of the mummy that could have been avoided by contacting local experts, and that they ascribe Andean origin to a genetic signature of people from an island 2,500 kilometers south of the region.

Correction (March 30): The original version of this article erroneously referred to Cristina Dorador as Cristina Dorado; it has been corrected. The Scientist regrets this error.

4,chile,"Chilean researchers contend that the grave site was plundered and the mummified skeleton was stolen, violating the country’s laws.

Days after researchers announced that a tiny mummy once rumored to be an alien was actually a human infant, Chilean scientists condemned the new study as unethical and their government began an investigation into grave robbing.

The Chilean National Monuments Council, a government agency, said in an email Tuesday that it had initiated an inquiry into whether the little girl’s remains were illegally exhumed in 2003 and smuggled out of the country. The council has turned over its records to the Public Ministry of Chile in response to the outcry from Chilean researchers. They contend the grave site was plundered and the mummified skeleton was stolen, violating the country’s laws.

“It’s offensive for the girl, for her family, and for the heritage of Chile,” said Francisca Santana-Sagredo, a biological anthropologist at the University of Antofagasta in Chile and the University of Oxford in England.

In a telephone interview, two authors of the new study, Dr. Garry P. Nolan, an immunologist at Stanford University, and Atul Butte of the University of California, San Francisco, defended the ethics of their research.

“We had no involvement or knowledge of how the skeleton was originally obtained nor how it was sold or exported to Spain,” Butte said. “We had no reason to suspect in this case that this sample was illegally obtained.” He noted that there were reports about the remains on Chilean television for 15 years without the government investigating the case.

Those reports, from the early 2000s, indicate that a man named Oscar Muñoz discovered the 6-inch-long mummy next to an abandoned church in a ghost town called La Noria. The body was remarkable not just for its size, but also for its abnormalities, including an elongated skull that ended in a point, giant eye sockets and bones that were as mature as those of a 6-year-old.

Rumors spread that Muñoz had found an alien. It gained the nickname “Ata,” for the Atacama Desert in Chile where the remains supposedly came from. (In fact, La Noria is more than 450 miles north of the desert.)

Eventually Ata ended up in the private collection in Barcelona of Ramón Navia-Osorio, who did not immediately respond to an email query about whether he had legally obtained Ata’s remains.

In 2012, the producers of a documentary claiming to have evidence of UFOs got access to Ata’s skeleton.

When Nolan learned of their efforts, he offered to examine samples sent to him for DNA.

Working with a team of researchers from both Stanford University in California and the University of California, San Francisco, Nolan reconstructed Ata’s entire genome. Far from being an alien, they concluded, Ata was a Chilean girl who was probably stillborn and suffered from previously unknown bone disorders.

Publication of the study in the journal Genome Research enraged some researchers in Chile, where the looting and sale of artifacts and mummies have long been a concern.

Like many other countries, Chile now has laws that make such exhumations and smuggling illegal, punishable by fines and prison sentences. But it can be hard to stop treasure hunters from plundering remote sites.

On Sunday, Cristina Dorado, a biologist at the University of Antofagasta, called the study an “outrage” in a commentary on Etilmercurio, an online science publication in Chile. “If samples are obtained unethically, any resulting science is not ethical,” she wrote.

Chilean scientific societies also condemned the study. “Could you imagine the same study carried out using the corpse of someone’s miscarried baby in Europe or America?” the Chilean Society of Biological Anthropology asked in a statement released Wednesday.

The society, along with a number of Chilean researchers, also co-signed a letter that was on Wednesday to Genome Research, the journal where the Ata study was published. “The scientific community in Chile is deeply upset and concerned about this situation,” they wrote.

Hilary Sussman, editor of Genome Research, said the journal “is paying close attention” to the issue of studying DNA from human remains, and “will return to it in future issues of the journal.”",https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/chilean-scientists-outraged-by-research-on-infant-girls-mummy-rumored-to-be-of-an-alien/

“The scientific community in Chile is deeply upset and concerned about this situation,” they wrote.

Gabriel León, a geneticist at the University of Andrés Bello and a co-signer, said that he hoped the journal would retract the paper. “It would be a strong signal about this sort of research on human samples stolen from the country,” Dr. León said.

Hilary Sussman, the editor of Genome Research, said that the journal lacked a set of instructions for researchers to discuss ethical issues they had considered, citing a “technical error” that had been corrected. She added that the journal “is paying close attention” to the issue of studying DNA from ancient human remains, and “will return to it in future issues of the journal.”

Dr. Nolan, of Stanford, said that the researchers did not ask their universities for permission to examine the sample, because they suspected that it was possible the remains belonged to a nonhuman primate. In addition, the researchers said that the DNA and X-rays of the skeleton did not provide “identifiable information about a living individual, as defined by federal regulations, and does not qualify as human subjects research, per the Federal Office of Human Research Protections.”

Dr. Butte pointed out how the research had helped put an end to the outlandish stories about Ata. “The study has provided a definitive scientific basis to put a stop to unscientific accounts of the skeleton’s true human nature and accord it the respect it deserves,” he said.

Chip Colwell, the curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, said that the dispute over Ata is part of a long series of conflicts. “It’s hardly unique in the bigger story about human remains,” he said.

In the 19th century, scientists themselves routinely plundered burial grounds, with no thought about getting consent from families or communities for their work.

In recent years, the ethical controversies have shifted to the museums and private collections where many remains are now kept. Geneticists can use new technologies to retrieve DNA from those remains, often needing only a small amount of bone to get it.

Dr. Santana-Sagredo and other Chilean scientists said that research on DNA from ancient human remains in their country could yield important insights.

But the value of those findings should not override the ethical treatment of human remains, they said. Dr. Santana-Sagredo worried that the study on Ata might encourage more plundering. “People might follow their example,” she said.

“We have these powerful new tools in DNA research, but if it ends up destroying relationships between local communities and scientists, then are we losing more than we might gain?” Dr. Colwell asked.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/science/atacama-mummy-chile.html
6,chile,"VALLE DE COLCHAGUA, Chile — Dozens of tourists armed with sharp scissors and donning dusty gloves and aprons walk through rows of green vines, hand-picking dark purple grapes that will be turned into Chilean wines enjoyed around the world.

It’s hard work under a scorching sun and the professional pickers watching them from a distance grin knowingly. But the tourists have paid for the hands-on experience at Chile’s harvest, which draws thousands of visitors each year, so they carefully cut the precious grapes in bunches and deposit them into wooden crates at the Viu Manent winery.

“The truth is that you always drink the wine, but you don’t really know the process behind it,” said Gina Cuesta, a visitor from Colombia.

Chile is the world’s No. 9 wine producer, with an output of about 800 million litres last year. It was the world’s fourth-largest exporter by volume, and the leader among “New World” producers.

The South American country has been making wine since the mid-1500s, when Spanish settlers brought the first vines, and has become known for producing reliable and affordable wines.

Visitors pay up to $90 for the tour of Viu Manent, which includes riding on horse-drawn carriages or bikes in the pastures of the Colchagua Valley, one of Chile’s best-known wine regions.

And they get the grape-picking experience.

While the tourists don’t get to keep the grapes, they top off their work with grilled steak, fermented grape juice and a glass of malbec at the vineyard’s visitor centre, which this year was named best in the world by the British magazine Drinks International. Founded in 1935, Viu Manent was also awarded Winery of the Year in 2017 by the Wines of Chile association.

“There are some vineyards that offer similar initiatives, but none is as complete and focused on the integral experience of wine producing and enology as ours,” said Freddy Grez, who is in charge of Viu Manent’s tourist activities.

Each year, about 37,000 visitors — most of them from Brazil and the United States — visit the winery about 90 miles (140 kilometres) south of the Chilean capital. The two-hour drive from Santiago along the country’s “Wine Trail” gives tourists the chance to wine-hop at guesthouses and restaurants that offer carmenere, cabernet sauvignon and other varieties for which Chile is known.

Chile’s natural barriers have a lot to do with the successful growth of its wine industry. It is shielded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Andes mountains on the east, Antarctica to the south and the world’s driest desert to the north. This has helped protect Chile from plagues, allowing winemakers to grow vines ungrafted, using ancient cultivation techniques.

In recent years, Chilean winemakers have also been experimenting with other temperatures and terrains. In the quest for more interesting tastes and characters, they’ve grown grapes in extreme places such as the icy south and the Atacama desert.

Back at Viu Manent, the team of tourists has gathered about 1,100 pounds (500 kilograms) of grapes. It seems like a lot but Grez says that depending on the harvest, professional workers can pick two to four times as much — anywhere from 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) to 4,400 pounds (2,000 kilos) a day.

“I thought it was interesting because I put myself in the shoes of the people who do this work,” lawyer Ana Maria Farren said. “We were here for half an hour and ended up tired. The (workers) are here for hours at a time. This experience allowed me to understand all the heavy work that is behind a bottle of wine.”

The text messages are from 6,000 miles away in Santiago, Chile, where he's helping resettle a group of young Venezuelans trying to retrace his own immigrant's journey to a better future.

Between deciphering data and writing code, he fields questions that come flying fast: What's the fastest bus line downtown? How do you apply for an immigrant ID card? Any leads on a job?

""Sometimes I'm rude and tell them to look on Google, or I have to just turn off my phone because I get five messages all at once,"" says the 34-year-old.

The demands on Nunez-Mujica's time and energy are part of his solitary battle to give those trapped by his homeland's economic crisis a fresh start abroad. Since the end of last year, he has shelled out around $40,000 of his own money helping some 40 Venezuelans  most of them complete strangers  migrate to other South America nations.

The acts of generosity range from a few months of free rent at an apartment he manages in Santiago to bus fare for a surgeon so he could move to Peru with his wife and daughter.

Nunez-Mujica has now launched the crowd-funded Salto Project  based on the Spanish word for leap  to scale up the assistance effort, convinced that the only immediate solution to Venezuela's mess is helping those who can escape. So far he has raised $5,250 but the goal is more than $40,000.

""There's no way someone like me can do anything about the situation in Venezuela, but if I can do a little bit to help people leave that helps me to sleep at night,"" he said in an interview from the offices of Slice Technologies, where he earns a modest tech worker's salary coming up with solutions to improve the e-shopping experience. ""I know it's a drop in the ocean, but it's something within my reach to do.""

It's a homespun solution to an ever more desperate situation.

Mounting hunger, hyperinflation and an authoritarian government are increasingly driving Venezuelans abroad in one of the largest exoduses in Latin America's history. Independent groups estimate as many as 3 million to 4 million Venezuelans have abandoned their home country in recent years, with several hundred thousand fleeing in 2017 alone.

Daniel Klie, 25, is one of the recipients of Nunez-Mujica's ""micro-sponsorships,"" in his case $200 for a plane ticket to Santiago.

With almost no savings to his name, Klie's first two months in Chile were torment. A college graduate with two degrees, in journalism and library sciences, he worked under the table at a butcher shop, toiling long hours seven days a week for less than the minimum wage.

Then, buoyed by Nunez-Mujica's coaching and moral support, Klie won an internship at an advertising agency and now has a full-time gig earning about $550 a month  five times as much as he made in an entire year holding down three jobs back home.

""In Venezuela, trying to save money is a titanic undertaking,"" said Klie. ""It's all about trying to eat and survive each day. Planning ahead is impossible.""

Nunez-Mujica, who abandoned Venezuela in 2011, first for Chile and then three years ago the U.S., said the idea of helping others was born from the frustration he felt hearing stories and seeing pictures of friends who had lost weight struggling to feed themselves.

Born into a working class family in the Andean city of Merida, Nunez-Mujica recalls going days without eating as a struggling college student in Caracas during the early days of President Hugo Chavez's socialist revolution. He said it was only thanks to the bag of groceries provided each month by his thesis adviser that he was able not only to survive but eventually thrive while working toward a PhD in biology.

Now it's his turn to pay it forward.

The goal isn't just to rescue Venezuelans from a collapsing economy. While Nunez-Mujica has a fatalist view of Venezuela's ability to regain its economic footing, his own experience has taught him how immigration can jumpstart one's career and creativity.

""Everyone in Venezuela lives in a state of dependency  either on the government or remittances from abroad,"" he said. ""But if they move abroad they have the chance at social mobility denied to them in Venezuela. There's a multiplier effect.""

Many of those Nunez-Mujica has helped came through friends of friends. Most he has never met but developed a connection with based more on intuition than any deliberate screening process. To avoid becoming too vested in what are frequently heartbreaking tales of exile, he tries his best to keep communications to a minimum, preferring text messages instead of internet video calls.

The current group he is helping plans to stay in Chile, unable to obtain U.S. visas and with little in the way of savings to relocate to the U.S. or Europe, the preferred destination for earlier, wealthier waves of Venezuelan migrants.

Recently, with his American husband, Nunez-Mujica traveled to Santiago to meet in the flesh those he has helped evacuate. At an emotion-filled meeting in a downtown bar, the bond with people meeting for the first time was immediately apparent as Nunez-Mujica greeted Klie and three others he has helped with big hugs.

Over rounds of beer, the emigres laughed at their common clumsiness adapting to life outside Venezuela. For example, the experience of going to a supermarket at night without fear of being robbed or running into a military patrol.

""Our country is going through hell right now,"" said Nunez-Mujica. ""But you've got to move on. You can't be a victim forever.""

8,chile,"Conservative Sebastian Pinera was sworn in to his second term as president of Chile last week, replacing socialist Michelle Bachelet for the second time in eight years. (CLAUDIO REYES/AFP/Getty Images)

Chile’s new president, Sebastián Piñera, a self-made billionaire serving for the second time, was elected to lift up his nation’s economy, which stagnated under President Michelle Bachelet. He also inherits a large deficit and an investment community strangled by regulations . Just into his second week in office, Piñera sat down in Chile’s White House, La Moneda Palace, with The Washington Post’s Lally Weymouth to talk about his hard road — and which Trump administration policies concern him most. Edited excerpts follow:

Q: You spoke with President Trump on the telephone after your election. He invited you to Washington.

A: Yes.

Q: Did you accept?

A: Someday.

Q: Someday?

A: We have no set date yet. We have had a very good relationship with the U.S. I told Trump he shouldn’t be worried about our free trade agreement because the U.S. has a surplus with Chile, and we don’t care about that.

There are some areas that really concern me. For instance, there is no clear policy from the Trump administration with respect to Latin America. This is something every Latin American country worries about. When Trump went to [the World Economic Forum in] Davos, it was very strange for us that he was defending protectionism, and [Chinese] President Xi Jinping was defending free trade. I think that protectionism and commercial warfare are bad for everybody. We are also worried that the U.S. withdrew from the Paris agreement on climate change.

Q: What about the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Chile had a lot to do with saving it after the U.S. under Trump withdrew.

A: We spent many years negotiating that agreement. At the last minute, the U.S. dropped out. We signed this month — all 11 countries except the U.S. I think China is interested in joining the group. If they join the TPP, they will be the largest economy in that group, which means the U.S. might lose its influence in free trade, and that is something that worries us.

Q: How do you see Venezuela’s collapse? What are you willing to do?

A: In Venezuela, there is no democracy, no respect for human rights, no rule of law, and they are facing a huge and dramatic security and humanitarian crisis. Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America in the 1990s, and now they are starving and dying because they don’t have food or medicine. That is because of a very bad government, which is not respecting democracy or the rule of law and is violating human rights. Every democratic country in Latin America and the world cannot stay indifferent. We are planning to do whatever is possible to help the Venezuelan people.

Q: There were negotiations between the Venezuelan government and the opposition brokered by Chile and Mexico, but they broke down.

A: The talks failed because President [Nicolás] Maduro didn’t want to have free, open and fair elections.

Q: The Venezuelan generals have a lot of drug money, right?

A: Do you know how many generals there are in Venezuela? About 4,000. I suspect they are fueled by a lot of money coming from corruption and drug trafficking.

Q: Argentine President Mauricio Macri has called for a halt to buying Venezuelan oil. Do you agree?

A: The problem is, we don’t want to hurt the Venezuelan people. Their only source of foreign exchange is the export of oil.

Q: What will you do about Chile’s immigration problem?

A: Many Venezuelans are coming to Chile. Also we have a lot of immigrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic. We are a very open country, but we want immigration to be legal. We don’t want to open our frontiers to people who are coming to do harm, like drug traffickers and smugglers.

Q: This is your second week in office. Are you enjoying it?

A: We have been working almost 24 hours a day because there are so many things we need to change. Let me tell you about the most important priorities of the Chilean people: [First,] citizen security. The rate of crime is going up, and people are fed up. The former government didn’t perform well in this area. Second is growth, investment, employment and productivity. The rate of growth in Chile last year was 1.5 percent. The average for the last four years is 1.7 percent.

Q: What was the rate of growth when you were last president [from 2010 to 2014]?

A: It was 5.3 percent on average. [But recently] productivity became negative, and it was dragging our growth instead of pushing it. The fiscal deficit and public debt went up.

Q: Because Bachelet spent a lot?

A: Too much. We suffered a reduction in our credit rating because of that. . . . Public expenditure has increased in Chile too rapidly. We will establish an austerity policy. The last government tried to strengthen our economy by increasing public expenditure. That is not the way. We will improve our growth rate by promoting investment. . . . Since we were elected, expectations about the future are rising rapidly.

Q: But what can you accomplish without a majority in either house of Congress?

A: We are close to a majority. We want to build things [with] dialogue, agreements and cooperation. We have faith that some people in the opposition will collaborate with us. We will fight not to be caught in the kind of bipartisan war you have in the U.S. We need to convince at least seven members of the House and at least three members of the Senate in order to get our laws approved.

Q: You are trying to promote foreign and domestic investment, but your regulatory framework — especially the environmental requirements imposed by your predecessor — makes it very slow for businesses to get permits.

A: For big projects in Chile to go through that [environmental] process now takes six to eight years. We want to protect our environment and nature, but we cannot create a huge bureaucracy that doesn’t protect our nature and is stopping our capacity to invest and grow. We [also] want to promote a tax system which is in favor of investment. The [current] system has stopped investment and has damaged our capacity for growth. We need to improve our labor reform. There is no better labor policy than full employment.

Q: Chile has made amazing progress in the past 20 years.

A: Yes, but my dream is to transform Chile into a developed country without poverty. Real development is more than economic growth. It has to do with the quality of your democracy and your institutions. Latin America has everything to become a developed continent. We have vast territory and very generous natural resources. We don’t have the kind of wars that destroyed Europe in the last century or the kind of social and religious conflicts that are hitting the Middle East. Despite that, Latin America is still underdeveloped, and one-third of its population is living in poverty.

Q: But you are saddled with large financial commitments you inherited from the prior government, such as sending 60 percent of Chile’s children to college for free. How are you going to pay for all you want to do? Will you raise taxes?

A: We will not raise taxes. The best fiscal policy is having solid growth. If we are aiming to hit close to 5 percent growth, it will increase our revenue substantially.

Q: You grew up in a Christian Democratic household, and you are reported to be a moderate person.

A: I hate all kinds of extremists, because they only bring suffering and destruction.

Q: Is one of your tasks to free the center-right from the Pinochet right?

A: I opposed [dictator Augusto] Pinochet’s regime. But that happened 30 years ago. I am not the gatekeeper of the past; I want to be the builder of the future.

9,chile,"An epidemic that has decimated the world’s amphibians, wiping out many species altogether, could at last be coming to an end.

Since at least the 1980s, global populations of frogs and salamanders have been undergoing an “amphibian extinction crisis”.

Experts think over 100 species could be gone forever, and the populations of many more are severely depleted, thanks in large part to the spread of the deadly chytrid fungus.

""Imagine a deadly disease that affects not only humans but other mammal species like dogs, cats and cows,"" said Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute biologist Dr Roberto Ibanez, emphasising the scale of the epidemic caused by this fungus.

However, the results of a long-term study conducted by Dr Ibanez and his colleagues in Panama suggest the worst of this disease may have passed.

Following the epidemic’s devastating spread, some amphibians in the region appear to have developed resistance to infection.

By conducting post-epidemic analysis of 12 frog species, the scientists were able to obtain a status report on the Panamanian population.

Amphibians face raised extinction threat







4 show all Amphibians face raised extinction threat





1/4 Granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) Listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species, mainly because its severely fragmented range covers an area of less than 20,000 sqkm in Costa Rica and Panama, and is getting smaller due to farming, logging and human settlements

2/4 Darwin’s frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) Lives in the forest streams of Chile and Argentina. The males raise their tadpoles in the baggy skin folds of their vocal sacs, allowing the young froglets to hop out when ready. Some closely related species have not been seen for several decades

3/4 The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) first described in 2003, it is found in the Western Ghats region of India and has a distinctive snout. It lives underground, emerging during the monsoon for two weeks to breed

4/4 Rainbow burrowing frog (Scaphiophryne gottlebei) only recently discovered in the dry, hilly regions of the Vallée des Singes in Madagascar. It lives mainly below ground to avoid the heat, but its finger pads suggest that it may also climb. Many amphibians of Madagascar are threatened by habitat loss Alamy

They found that nine of the species, each of which had been driven to the brink of extinction, had shown considerable recovery in recent years.

The next step was to establish what had happened to save these amphibians from the fate that had met so many others.

Fortunately, another research team had observed the disease moving from Costa Rica to Panama around 10 years ago, and had gathered data on frog populations throughout the disease outbreak.

""Because we have pathogen and host samples from before, during and after the epidemic, we can ask whether some frogs survived because the pathogen grew weaker through time, or because the frogs' immune systems or resistance increased through time,"" said Dr Jamie Voyles, disease ecologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the first author of the study outlining these findings.

The scientists took more than 2,000 swabs of captured frogs’ skins, and found the prevalence of the disease-causing fungus had dropped compared to previous studies.

One reason for this could be that the fungus itself had become less potent, but analysis of samples taken from the frogs revealed this was not the case.

The disease-causing agent neither grew more slowly than it had done at the peak of the epidemic, nor were its interactions with frog immune cells any different.

In short, the researchers concluded, what must have changed was the frogs’ ability to resist the disease. These results were published in the journal Science.

This idea was confirmed when the scientists found frogs that had been kept in captivity away from the disease since before its outbreak were more susceptible to infection than their wild counterparts.

As the efforts begin to rebuild wild frog populations, this finding in particular will be crucial.

Although the fungus no longer has the deadly effect it once did on wild frogs, it is still lying in wait for any individuals that have not been lucky enough to develop resistance.

Dr Ibanez runs the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project, and he said care would have to be taken if scientists intend to release captive frogs into the wild.

“It is extremely important for us to realise that the defences of these frogs may be weaker than the defences of frogs that survived the epidemic in the wild,” he said.

While we have not seen a disease outbreak on the scale of chytrid fungus in humans in recent years, the researchers noted that this kind of work has applications closer to home as well.

“It is vital to understand how disease transitions work – from outbreak, to epidemic to coexistence – and our results have implications for a skyrocketing human population facing emerging diseases with the potential to cause global pandemics,"" said Dr Ibanez.",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/frog-numbers-species-population-deadly-fungus-amphibian-extinction-crisis-panama-a8280016.html
10,chile,"An unusual, tiny skeleton—previously touted as a possible ""alien""—has sparked curiosity since its discovery in Chile in 2003. Last week, scientists finally revealed the story behind the small form based on whole-genome analysis of the remains. Dubbed Ata, the skeleton belong to a girl who was stillborn or died just after birth. She likely had an array of genetic mutations that resulted in her atypical form.

However, the study published in Genome Research has sparked outrage among Chilean scientists who called the research unethical. Now, the Chilean government is questioning the legality of the work, Carl Zimmer reports for The New York Times. According to the government agency Chilean National Monuments Council, the skeleton may have been illegally exhumed and smuggled out of the country. An investigation into the matter is now underway.

As Cristina Dorado, a biologist at the University of Antofagasta, writes on the Chilean science news site Etilmercurio.com, the journey of and speculation about the girl has been “cruel and tragic.” Mummified in the harsh environment of the region, Ata is thought to originally have been found by a man named Óscar Muñoz back in 2003. As Dorado writes, ""due to her extremely unusual and irregular appearance, he sold her for the grand sum of 30,000 Chilean pesos (40 euros).” The girl has since appeared in a range of accounts, often referred to as an ""alien"" or ""humanoid."" She was even featured in the 2013 U.F.O. documentary, Sirius.

The research began in 2012 when Garry P. Nolan of Stanford University caught wind of the documentary and offered to examine the mummy’s DNA. Her current owner—Barcelona entrepreneur Ramon Navia-Osorio—acquiesced and sent X-ray images and bone marrow samples.

When the results of the analysis were published, the study was widely covered by the news media, including at Smithsonian.com. But since Ata is likely only decades old, her family could still be alive, Dorado writes, ""forced to relive events from forty years ago.""

Francisca Santana-Sagredo, a biological anthropologist at the University of Antofagasta in the Atacama region and the University of Oxford, tells Zimmer: “It’s offensive for the girl, for her family, and for the heritage of Chile.”​

Dorado also points out the legal concerns about the work. “No attention has been paid to the important ethical issue that a team of leading scientists have undertaken a study on an illegally obtained human infant without legal permission,” she writes.

Dorado writes that the progression of the research ignored Chilean laws regulating the study of such artifacts, pointing out that the journal where the study was published required no statement of ethics. “Like many other countries, human remains and historical objects are protected by law in Chile, including the girl from La Noria,” she writes. Dorado summarizes the relevant Chilean laws: ""Simply put, to fulfill legal requirements to conduct the research described, a permit is needed from the National Monument Council.""

She also writes that no Chilean researchers were included as part of this collaboration. Such collaborations with knowledgeable researchers could have ensured that the work followed the proper legal pathways.

Nolan and Atul Butte, researcher from the University of California, San Francisco, and co-author of the study, stand by the research. “We had no involvement or knowledge of how the skeleton was originally obtained nor how it was sold or exported to Spain,” Butte tells Zimmer. “We had no reason to suspect in this case that this sample was illegally obtained.”

Nolan also tells Zimmer that they did not check for university permission for the work because of initial suspicions that the subject was a nonhuman primate. He adds that the analysis did not provide ""identifiable information about a living individual,"" Zimmer reports, and thus is not regulated as human subject research under the U.S. Office of Human Research Protections.

This latest outcry is another chapter in the long debate over the ethics surrounding the study of ancient human remains. As Sarah Zhang writes for The Atlantic, archaeologists and anthropologists have long had to reckon with questions about the treatment of human remains. But geneticists have only just started to enter into the fray. ""Though they almost certainly will have to face up to this issue as the study of ancient DNA becomes a more and more common tool in anthropology,"" Zhang notes.

Editor of Genome Research Hilary Sussman tells Zimmer the journal did not have a instructions for researchers to detail any ethical considerations. She adds that the journal will look into the oversight for future issues.",https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/chilean-government-investigating-whether-alien-skeleton-was-illegally-exhumed-180968630/
11,chile,"Geneva/Panama, 21 March 2018– Aid workers working along the Colombia-Venezuela border are warning of rising vulnerabilities among people crossing the border and are calling on the international community to increase support for humanitarian efforts.

An estimated 796,000 people entered Colombia from Venezuela through official migration points in 2017. The volume of people on the move has already triggered regional repercussions, with many people now crossing from Colombia into Ecuador and Brazil, and from there to countries further south including Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.

“We are increasingly concerned about this situation, and we believe that additional, urgent action needs to be taken to ensure that people can access basic services and support,” said Walter Cotte, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Regional Director for the Americas.

“The sheer volume of people crossing the border has created a complex situation that requires immediate action. The Colombian Red Cross Society and IFRC have been working for more than a year to support people arriving in Colombia and travelling through the country. But we need to do more, and we are appealing to partners to invest in our operations,” said Mr Cotte.

Between 2,000 and 10,000 people are estimated to be on the move within Colombia every day, with the country being used as a transit area, supply point, or a place of temporary or long-term shelter. These figures do not include people using informal border crossings along the Colombia-Venezuela border. This is a major concern as these crossings are typically in areas where non-state armed groups are present.

The movement of people across the border is complex: some people are entering and leaving Colombia for specific purposes; some are migrating to other countries, and others are seeking a permanent home in Colombia. However, all should be able to access basic services, and should be protected from harm or harassment on their journeys, without any distinction.

This situation is generating significant humanitarian needs in transit zones, places of temporary settlement or host cities in Colombia, especially along the Colombia-Venezuela and Colombia-Ecuador borders.

IFRC and the Colombia Red Cross have launched an international emergency appeal for 2.2 million Swiss francs, with the aim of providing expanded support to about 120,000 of the most vulnerable people who have crossed from Venezuela. The Red Cross aims to provide a range of basic services, including health care, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash transfer programming and livelihoods support.

In 2017, the Colombian Red Cross assisted more than 300,000 people. Their actions received financial backing from IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF).

“No one organization, agency or government can address this issue alone,” said Mr Cotte. “Authorities must work closely with national humanitarian actors and other partners to coordinate and strengthen the humanitarian assistance available to people in need, and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.”",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/red-cross-warns-rising-humanitarian-needs-among-people-entering-colombia/

13,chile,"The National Center for Personnel Recovery is critical during natural disasters, search and rescue, medevac, and evacuation of service members and civilians.

Yolima Dussán/Diálogo |

Colombia’s disaster response system led to an increase in the number of relief missions in local communities, and also provided assistance during recent disasters in Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Costa Rica. The system is built around several public and private entities, and community and military organizations brought together under the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management (UNGDR, in Spanish). UNGDR was established in 2008 by the National Center for Personnel Rescue (CNRP, in Spanish) that the Colombian Air Force (FAC in Spanish) operates to aid the civilian population. The unit is based at the Military Air Transport Command in Bogotá.

Transfers and aeromedical evacuations are FAC’s most frequently flown missions. (Photo: Colombian Air Force)

“The level of disaster response coordination that Colombia attained saves more lives each time,” FAC Major Ricardo Ovalle, coordinator of Joint Operations for CNRP and UNGDR, told Diálogo. “FAC plays a decisive role in this process. It’s round-the-clock work that never lets up.”

Emergency response fronts

CNRP operates on three fronts. The center transports personnel and cargo to put out massive wildfires and responds to landslides and floods. CNRP also conducts aerial surveillance over areas where civilian populations are at risk, such as volcanoes, snowy regions, and rivers.

“Avalanches and mudslides are more critical. Fires have a huge impact on flora and fauna, but you have some time before they impact people. Avalanches involve a lot of wounded people, without houses, without services,” Maj. Ovalle said. “They require more effective assistance.”

The second front consists of search-and-rescue operations for military and civilian personnel following aircraft crashes or river accidents. The center’s third front is unquestionably the area of highest demand: relocation and aeromedical evacuation. In 2004, the Directorate of Special Air Operations (today’s CNRP) established a broad set of procedures in an efficient protocol for disaster response and rescue. Since then, the unit transported more than 19,000 service members and civilians from all places and especially from hard-to-reach areas that only military aircraft can access.

Every minute counts

CNRP never rests. Its command is made up of just 22 officers and enlisted who coordinate its interfaces with a large army of specialists from every unit of FAC, who almost always race against the clock when responding to emergencies.

“In our mission to save lives, every minute matters,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel John Jairo Baez, head of CNRP, told Diálogo. “In disaster response, every minute counts to save the lives of those who are in harm’s way. In search and rescue, a single minute can make the difference to find those injured or lost. And in aeromedical evacuation, time matters even more.”

Among its other missions, the National Center for Personnel Recovery helps relocate civilians impacted by disasters. (Photo: Colombian Air Force)

Every decision is based on a stream of information to carry out the procedure as quickly as possible. Strict adherence to established response protocols shape their use over time.

“Our mission during the April 2017 avalanche in Moca showed how our disaster response system evolved and how FAC’s response capabilities increased thanks to the incorporation of [response] developed resources and protocols,” Lt. Col. Baez said. “We’re at the forefront of disaster response in the region.”

FAC pilots execute CNRP’s operations. Trained to operate under the most stressful circumstances, pilots review every request for assistance to choose what resources to use to respond to each case. Pilots, who understand the implications of their choices, make quick but thoughtful decisions.

“To go where someone needs help is one of FAC’s commitments. We did entire military operations to bring women in labor out from far-flung places and transfer sick children and adults,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel José Luis Avendaño Hurtado, chief of CNRP’s Transportation and Aeromedical Evacuation Division, told Diálogo. “There are several factors to assess to ensure operational effectiveness: weather conditions, nearby treatment locations, and the amount of time needed for treatment based on indications from the medical evaluation system.”

The amount of combat evacuations for wounded soldiers across Colombia during the armed conflict required capacity building to overcome obstacles. Up to 2015, members of the public security forces represented the largest number of transfers. But, since 2016, civilian rescues lead the statistics.

“We follow a doctrine set forth by the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization—the governing bodies on search and rescue procedures—to determine the locations and conditions in which a person can survive,” FAC Lieutenant Colonel Fernando Mendoza, chief of CNRP’s Search-and-Rescue Division, told Diálogo. “We work with technology, but, when technology fails us, the power goes out, and there are no indicators, we are left with the experience of our pilots, trained in war operations and used to applying their knowledge of basic geometry and trigonometry to perform triangulations and find the target.”

Effective equipment and human commitment

To carry out these missions, CNRP has a fleet of three medically outfitted Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft, and three UH-60 helicopters, dubbed the “Angels Squadron,” which are equipped with a hoist system to perform personnel rescues in hard-to-reach areas. The aircraft are also equipped to carry the Bambi Bucket system, a must to put out fires. Three Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft supplement the fleet. When needed, a C-130 Hercules can be fitted with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS II).

“The experience gained from the conflict allowed us to know what’s needed to survive on land, in water, in poor visibility conditions, and at night—in extremely risky conditions,” added FAC Major Pablo Mora Díaz, deputy director of Human Resources and Technical Support for UNGDR. “We do whatever needs to be done. We follow protocols, and we’re creative. We work for the well-being of all. We’re soldiers who rescue people,” he concluded.",https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/colombian-air-force-bolsters-humanitarian-aid-capacity
14,chile,"The Mormon church announced Thursday that it plans to close two missionary training centers — one in Santiago, Chile, and the other in Madrid, Spain — in January.

A news release from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said ecclesiastical leaders “continue to seek the best use of resources worldwide according to the needs and demands of each area.”

Starting in January, missionaries who would have attended either of these centers will be trained at one of the remaining 13 missionary training centers around the world, including the flagship facility in Provo.

Both training centers are in church-owned buildings that also serve other church functions, such as temple patron housing, and the church will decide the best use of this space in the future, according to the release.

CARACAS: Just after dawn, dozens of Venezuelans gathered at the dark bus station in Caracas. They lugged one big suitcase each, as well as blankets, toilet paper, cheap bread and jugs of water.

Weeping wives, confused children and elderly parents hugged them over and over until it was time to check tickets and weigh bags, then hung back, waiting hours for the bus to leave.

When it finally pulled out, the passengers looked down at their loved ones, pounding on the windows and blowing kisses as they speeded out of this crumbling capital city.

On board the bus, web developer Tony Alonzo had sold his childhood guitar to help pay for his ticket to Chile. For months he had been going to bed hungry so that his 5-year-old brother could have something for dinner.

Natacha Rodriguez, a machine operator, had been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past year. She was headed for Chile, too, hoping to give her baseball-loving son a better life.

Roger Chirinos was leaving his wife and two young children behind to search for work in Ecuador. His outdoor advertising company had come to a bitter end: Protesters tore down his billboards to use as barricades during violent rallies against authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro.

Their bus tells the story of a once-wealthy nation in stomach-dropping free fall, as hundreds of people flee daily from a land where fear and want are the new normal.

By the time dawn rises over Caracas, hungry people are already picking through garbage while kids beg in front of bakeries. Come dusk, many Venezuelans shut themselves inside their homes to avoid muggings and kidnappings.

In a country with the world's largest proven crude reserves, some families now cook with firewood because they cannot find propane. Hospitals lack supplies as basic as disinfectant. Food is so scarce and pricey that the average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year.

""I feel Venezuela has succumbed to an irreversible evil,"" Chirinos said.

Many blame the country's precipitous decline on the government of Maduro, who has tightened his grip on power, holding fast to statist policies that have throttled the economy. His government says it is facing a U.S.-led conspiracy to sabotage leftism in Latin America by hoarding goods and stoking inflation.

Poorer by the day, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have concluded that escape is their only option. With the country's currency virtually worthless and air travel beyond the reach of all but elites, buses have

become Venezuela's caravans of misery, rolling day and night to its borders and returning largely empty to begin the process all over again.

The 37 Venezuelans leaving on this day had hocked everything - motorbikes, TVs, even wedding rings - to pay for their escape. Most had never been outside the country before.

For nine days, a reporter and a photographer from Reuters accompanied the migrants as they headed for what they hoped were better days in Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina.

For nearly 5,000 miles, they rolled through some of South America's most spectacular landscapes, including the vertiginous Andean mountain range and the world's driest desert in Chile.

But even though the Venezuelans were awed by the views whizzing by their window, their minds were mostly on the land they had left behind - and the uncertainty facing them in the lands ahead.

FROM CARACAS TO CONCON

A heavy silence fell over the bus after it pulled out of the Rutas de America terminal. Passengers glumly texted family members or stared out the window as the packed vehicle rolled by mango trees, shuttered factories and crumbling murals of the late President Hugo Chavez.

Natacha Rodriguez, the machine operator, had been running on adrenaline in the mad rush to pack, sell her television and washing machine, and endure long lines to get her documents in order. Now, on this day in

November, she was near exhaustion as she tried to get comfortable in her seat.

The 29-year-old single mom was traveling with her 12-year-old son, David, her sister Alejandra and a family friend, Adrian Naveda, to what she dreamed would be a quiet life. The group was bound for Concon, Chile, a beach resort where Venezuelan expat friends assured them there was plenty of work.

Rodriguez said she had hoped Venezuela's youth could bring about change. Like millions of her countrymen, she took to the streets to protest the unpopular Maduro last year, only to despair when he responded by consolidating his authority.

Fear added to Rodriguez's hopelessness: Her story of three robberies at gunpoint is a familiar one in a country awash with drugs and gangs. And with inflation fast outrunning her paycheck, the already petite woman had lost 13 pounds as she cut fruit and soft drinks from her diet so that David would not go hungry. She knew she had to act.

""In Venezuela you go to sleep thinking about what you're going to eat the next day,"" Rodriguez said. ""I never wanted to leave, but the situation is forcing me to.""

She had never left the country, and the enormity of what she was attempting was sinking in. In the days ahead she would visit four new countries, cross the equator and see the Pacific Ocean for the first time. But she couldn't stop thinking of how far she had traveled from the home she still loved.

'FIGHTING AGAINST THE TIDE'

Venezuelans elected Chavez, the late leftist firebrand, in 1998 with a mandate to fight inequality. A charismatic former lieutenant colonel, Chavez transformed the country during his 14-year rule, pouring oil revenue into wildly popular welfare programs. But he also nationalized large swaths of the economy and implemented strict currency controls, state meddling that economists say is the root of the current crisis.

Once a magnet for European and Middle Eastern immigrants during its 1970s oil boom, Venezuela now exports its people along with petroleum.

Spooked by Chavez, a first wave of engineers, doctors and other professionals began fleeing for the United States, Canada and Europe in the early 2000s. Most arrived to warm welcomes in their adopted homes, many with their savings intact.

Now, financially ravaged Venezuelans with fewer skills are pouring across South America in a frantic search for work in restaurants, stores, call centers and construction sites. Some travel only as far as their savings will stretch: A one-way bus ticket to neighboring Colombia from Caracas costs the U.S. equivalent of around $15; the fare for a trip to Chile or Argentina can run as high as $350, a small fortune for many. The plunging currency and rocketing inflation make financing the voyage more expensive with each passing day.

Sociologist Tomas Paez, an immigration specialist at the Central University of Venezuela, estimates that almost 3 million people have fled Venezuela over the past two decades. He believes nearly half of them have left in the last two years alone, in one of the largest mass migrations the continent has ever seen. The socialist government does not release emigration statistics, but Maduro says his enemies have exaggerated the extent of the exodus.

Reuters/ Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Neighboring Colombia has taken in the bulk of migrants in Latin America, although Argentina, Chile and Peru are also seeing a big influx.

In contrast to refugees fleeing Syria, Myanmar and North Africa who have met with violence and resistance, Venezuelans are moving easily across land borders on tourist visas. But tensions are increasing as their numbers strain the resources of South America's developing countries, which have their own problems with poverty and crime.

Carmen Larrea has a front-row seat to the migration. She is the owner of Rutas de America, a small Caracas-based bus company founded nearly 50 years ago to ferry Peruvians and Ecuadoreans to Venezuela in search of work.

At 75, she has lived long enough to see the world turned upside down. She now survives on Venezuelans heading in the other direction. Her customers included the 37 migrants whom Reuters followed.

Larrea's terminal sees dozens queue up daily to purchase tickets. Many must return repeatedly to pay in installments. Daily withdrawal limits on debit cards no longer keep up with inflation-fueled prices. Card readers frequently crash.

Requests for tickets abroad had roughly doubled in the last six months, Larrea said. Around 800 Venezuelans leave the country every month on her company's handful of Caracas-based buses alone.

But skyrocketing prices for spare parts and the plunging bolivar have hammered her profits, Larrea said. And while Rutas de America buses leave Caracas jam-packed, they often return empty, further denting business.

""We're fighting against the tide,"" she said.

'HERE NO ONE SPEAKS ILL OF CHAVEZ'

By daybreak, the bus had arrived in the garbage-strewn Venezuelan town of San Antonio del Tachira, near the Colombian border. The teeming frontier is a lifeline for desperate Venezuelans. They cross daily to sell goods like liquor, copper, even their own hair, often making more money in a day in Colombia than in a month back home.

Maduro has increased security at the border in an attempt to crack down on contraband. The bus riders were forced to disembark and pass through half a dozen checkpoints on foot, struggling to haul their suitcases, backpacks, blankets, food and water jugs under the searing sun. Trudging to the narrow Simon Bolivar International Bridge that links Venezuela to Colombia, they walked under a big government sign that read: ""Here no one speaks ill of Chavez.""

The gauntlet took five hours, in part because the Venezuelan migration office's computers crashed. The travelers' apprehensions grew as Venezuelan soldiers, known for shaking down border crossers, searched their bags repeatedly.

Passenger Chirinos, the ad man, was carrying $200 in U.S. currency, a precious hedge against inflation. A National Guard soldier demanded half of it to let him through with an old Playstation video game console deemed contraband. Chirinos handed over a $20 bill to end the standoff.

""Our own people rob us,"" Chirinos said later, recounting the humiliation.

The Armed Forces did not respond to a request for comment.

Just a few years ago, the 34-year-old Chirinos was solidly middle class. He boxed at a gym and splurged on vacations, including a 2014 trip to Rio de Janeiro with his wife.

Not being able to keep in touch with loved ones, was one of the things that most worried the travelers during the journey, so they were always trying to connect to the internet. Adrian said several times that he missed his mother and his girlfriend, so he decided to record messages for them despite not being able to send them or receive an answer, until the next free wifi network. Reuters/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

But as the crisis worsened, even small indulgences like movie tickets spiraled out of reach. Chirinos cut down on his own food intake to ensure his two children had enough to eat. He began to pray daily that his kids would never fall ill; there was no medicine to treat them.

The coup de grace came during anti-government protests last year when the demonstrators outside the capital knocked down his company's billboards to shield themselves from National Guard soldiers. The enterprise his parents had founded in the 1970s was all but lost.

Several passengers around him wept as they listened to his story. Chirinos, an athletic man with a shaved head and goatee, remained stony-faced.

""I don't have time for resentment,"" he said. ""What I feel is deep sadness.""

'I HAVE TO BE STRONG AND CONTINUE'

Once over the border in the buzzing Colombian town of Cucuta, Jehovah's Witnesses, vendors and hustlers of all stripes descended on the overwhelmed migrants. The streets of Cucuta were already full of poor Venezuelans, some sleeping in parks and washing their clothes in creeks because they had no money to travel farther.

The bus passengers immediately bought Colombian pesos in crowded exchange houses where wads of near-worthless Venezuelan bills flew out of money-counting machines. The bolivar has lost a mind-boggling 98 percent against the U.S. dollar in the last year, meaning $100 worth of local currency a year ago is worth just $2 now.

Pesos in hand, the migrants boarded a new Rutas de America bus waiting for them in Cucuta. The vehicle climbed upward into the foggy Colombian mountains. Out the window, farmers in traditional Andean ponchos tended their herds.

Crossing the city of Bucaramanga, Naveda, the family friend who was traveling with Rodriguez and her son, learned by text that his great-grandmother had died. The 23-year-old felt an urge to turn back. But he knew the rest of his family was depending on him to send money home once he reached Chile and found employment.

""I have to be strong and continue,"" Naveda said.

Even though entering other parts of Latin America on temporary tourist visas is easy for Venezuelans, some are struggling to secure jobs and work permits. Those who strike out often get back on the road to try their luck in another country. In the United States, for example, Venezuelans now lead monthly applications for affirmative asylum.

Others are forced to return to Venezuela, broke and distraught. Maduro has warned Venezuelans that life in ""capitalist"" societies is tough.

""In six months you'll be back in Venezuela,"" the president said in a recent televised address.

Meanwhile, his government is benefiting from migrant remittances that are helping to prop up Venezuela's economy and keep a lid on unrest in the nation of about 30 million. The government does not release remittance figures. But the Inter-American Dialogue think tank estimated that some $2 billion flowed into Venezuela last year from citizens working abroad.

Other Latin Americans have been largely sympathetic to Venezuelans' troubles. Chileans, for instance, note that Venezuela sheltered thousands of their exiled countrymen during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's right-wing dictatorship in the 1970s.

But the influx is stoking tensions with some South American workers who view Venezuelans as rivals. News broadcasts increasingly feature stories about Venezuelans committing crimes. In Brazil, Venezuelans are already living in shelters just over the border in Boa Vista. In Colombia, the government says it has treated more than 24,000 Venezuelans for medical emergencies, and authorities in January evicted more than 200 homeless Venezuelans from an athletic field in Cucuta. In a possible sign of further crackdowns ahead, Brazil and Colombia tightened their borders in February as they grapple with the influx.

Despite the hardships of starting over, almost all Venezuelans on the bus journey said they planned to help relatives leave - or ""get them out,"" as most now say.

Adrian Naveda (C) talks on the phone, as he stands next to his girlfriend Glenys Reyes, before he travels by bus to Chile, at their home in Caracas, Venezuela, November 2, 2017. The night before the bus was due to leave, Naveda received several calls from friends to invite him for a drink and farewell party, but he preferred to stay at home with his girlfriend. The atmosphere was melancholic. In the end the bus did not leave the next day, because the road was blocked by protests in Colombia. He had to wait four more days to start his journey to Chile.

'IT'S A NEW WORLD!'

The bus plowed on, stopping in Colombia's western Cauca province on the third day to let the Venezuelans shower and eat. The week before, hundreds of Venezuelans had been stranded there for several days after indigenous Colombian protesters blocked the highway to demand better living conditions from the government.



Milena Ramos, who works in a store at the roadside stop there, recalled the helplessness of the marooned Venezuelans.

""Some slept on the bus, others on the floor. People from the area brought them food and water. They were in a bad state,"" Ramos said. She estimated that up to eight buses full of Venezuelans pull up every day.

Just before 2 a.m. on the fourth day of the journey, the bus arrived at the frigid Colombian border town of Ipiales, near the Ecuadorean border, 9,508 feet high in the Andes. The shivering Venezuelans, almost none of whom had warm coats, lined up in the dark to get their passports stamped. Several more buses pulled up, unloading more of their countrymen.

As they crossed into Ecuador, the Venezuelans told border agents they were tourists; the bored-looking officials stamped their documents and waved them through. Any who are rejected just wait to cross during the next shift, handlers and food sellers there told Reuters.

As the bus kept heading southward, the Venezuelans expressed amazement at the views from their windows: Plump cows. Functioning traffic lights. Fully stocked store shelves. Thriving corn and coffee fields. People nonchalantly wearing gold jewelry on the streets.

""It's a new world!"" exclaimed 7-year-old Josmer Rivas. Back home, the boy sometimes missed school because his family couldn't afford a few U.S. cents' worth of transport costs. In the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, Josmer was so excited to find soap in a bathroom that he insisted on dishing it out to everyone.

Still, the mood on the bus was often heavy, especially among parents who took advantage of stops to call children left behind. Billboard company owner Chirinos, who disembarked in Ecuador and headed straight to the home of some Venezuelan friends who were putting him up, felt lost without his kids. Some migrants had swollen ankles or painful backs after several days on the road. Others were sick of munching their stashes of white bread and other cheap staples.

For Rodriguez, the single mom, warm food at the rest stops was a luxury she splurged on only for her son, David. He was excited about the trip at first, thinking it was a sort of vacation. But as the voyage dragged on, he became tired and threw up one night on a winding mountain road in Colombia. He wondered why they hadn't taken a plane.

Although many Venezuelan parents entrust their children to relatives and send for them once they have a toehold abroad, Rodriguez said she couldn't risk it.

""What if they limit emigration or entry to other countries, or everything becomes more expensive and I can't get him out?"" she said. ""I wasn't going to be at peace with myself if I went and left him.""

When in the early evening the bus pulled into Guayaquil, the last stop on the Rutas de America line, little Josmer Rivas flew into the arms of his overjoyed father, who had emigrated to Ecuador four months earlier.

Rodriguez's foursome and a few others boarded a midnight bus to continue their journey south to Chile, some carrying tuna and crackers given to them by those who had disembarked. Again, the buses were mostly filled with Venezuelans - easily recognizable by their bulky bags and jugs of water - although they were now rubbing shoulders with grungy Western backpackers.

The voyage across Peru was uneventful, punctuated by views of the Pacific Ocean and Hollywood action films on video screens hanging from the bus ceiling. But potential trouble loomed at the crossing into Chile, one of Latin America's most stable and prosperous nations. Police grilled the Venezuelans sharply.

""How much money do you have?"" one officer asked Rodriguez. ""Do you know Chile is an expensive country? Do you know there are Venezuelans sleeping under bridges here? Are you and your child going to sleep under a bridge?""

Rodriguez, unflustered, responded that she had a place to stay and enough money to get by.

She and the rest of the group eventually were admitted into Chile. Beaming, they hugged quickly before yet another bus journey, to Santiago - nearly 1,300 miles to the south. Alonzo, the Chile-bound web developer, was not so lucky. He had tarried a few days in Peru to spend time with a cousin. Arriving at the same border crossing just a few days after Rodriguez, he was refused entry by Chilean police.

Natacha Rodriguez (C), traveling by bus from Caracas to Chile, talks with fellow travelers while they wait to board at the bus station in Tumbes, Peru, November 11, 2017. In Tumbes, the first stop after crossing from Ecuador to Peru, passengers had to transport their luggage by three-wheel moto taxis from the arrival point to another bus station, as each company has its own terminal. When they got there, they realized that the only way to buy the tickets to continue the journey was with Peruvian soles. So they talked and agreed that one group would go to an exchange house several blocks away, carrying everyone's cash, while others waited and took care of the luggage. Reuters/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

STARTING OVER

It was just the latest in a series of setbacks for Alonzo, who had been trying to leave Venezuela for two years. His trip had been thwarted twice after he was forced to use savings for medical bills, first for a lung problem and another time to fix an infected molar.

When the 26-year-old web developer finally left Venezuela, he had just $230 in his pocket, scraped together from loans from friends as well as a fire sale of his dearest possessions.

""I sold the guitar I had since I was 16. I sold my computer. I sold my bed,"" Alonzo said.

He had hoped his programming skills would be snapped up in Chile, a budding technology hub. But after he was turned back at the border, Alonzo had little choice but return to his cousin's apartment in the Peruvian capital, Lima.

Chirinos and Rodriguez have fared better, both quickly obtaining work and legal papers.

Chirinos has rented an apartment in Quito and is working six days a week at a graphic design and advertising company. He spends what little free time he has with old friends from Venezuela.

A family man to the bone, Chirinos says he feels incomplete without his wife, 9-year-old son and baby daughter and wants to bring them over as soon as possible.

""I'm terrified about what's happening in Venezuela, and I don't want my children to grow up in such a heavy and negative environment,"" said Chirinos, whose family is surviving off the money he sends.

David Vargas (R), 12, cries as he sits next to his aunt after saying goodbye to relatives while he waits to board a bus to travel from Caracas to Guayaquil, at the Rutas de America's bus station in Caracas, Venezuela, November 7, 2017. The moment before getting on the bus was very sad, filled with silence, tension, hugs and tears. Carlos Garcia Rawlins: ""It was very hard to see the disconsolate way David was crying, once he said goodbye to his loved ones and realized that he was about to start the journey to Chile"". Reuters/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Down in Chile, Rodriguez waits tables at a busy seafront restaurant popular with tourists. She initially slept on the floor in a crowded two-bedroom apartment packed with Venezuelans. Now she sleeps in a room with

David because her sister and friend Naveda moved to their own place, freeing up space in the apartment.

Rodriguez relishes simple pleasures: walking alone to a nighttime party; finding soap at pharmacies. She was especially thrilled to buy her son a bicycle for Christmas.

David loves his new home. He quickly made friends - all Chileans - and has ditched baseball, a major sport in Venezuela, in favor of pick-up soccer at a field near his home. Photos sent from Rodriguez's cell phone show the boy grinning astride his black mountain bike in one shot, tucking into a hamburger at McDonald's in another.

Rodriguez herself, meanwhile, gets frequent news about Venezuela from her mother and siblings. Hungry mobs have been looting stores as shortages and inflation worsen. Maduro has just announced he is running for re-election in May. With the opposition's two main leaders barred from holding office, the unpopular president looks likely to clinch a six-year term.

In Chile, Rodriguez has found the tranquility she longed for. Still, she cannot let go of Venezuela.

16,chile,"Chile's state-owned bank has dumped three cryptocurrency exchange clients, according to a local media report.

Banco del Estado de Chile informed Orionx, CryptoMKT and Buda.com that their accounts would be closed in 10 days, the newspaper El Mercurio reported Thursday. The move came after Canada's Scotiabank and Brazil's Itaú said they would be closing the accounts of the three exchanges.

The Chilean bank, more commonly known as BancoEstado, was the last institution still providing financial services to the three exchanges, El Mercurio reported. As a result of the bank's decision to cut them loose, the exchanges - reportedly the only ones in the country to obtain traditional bank accounts - will no longer have access to wider financial services.

The bank did not give a reason for the move, but said in a statement:

""BancoEstado adopted the decision, for now, not to operate with companies that are dedicated to the issue or creation, brokerage, intermediation or serve as a platform for calls or so-called cryptocurrencies.""

Even before BancoEstado severed ties, Buda.com CEO Pablo Chavez said that without Scotiabank and Itau, his startup would ""have to move to a different format,"" possibly by opening a digital bank of its own. However, he described that option as being ""very bad.""

Similarly, CryptoMKT director and cofounder Martín Jofré said his startup was short on banking options prior to the BancoEstado bombshell. He added:

""That in no case means that customers could not recover their money or their cryptocurrencies ... if that happened, the assets are simply returned to the users.""

In contrast, Orionx reportedly downplayed the impact of losing its last bank account, telling El Mercurio that customer funds ""are fully backed and there is no risk of insolvency of them."" No details were provided in the article to support this claim.

BancoEstado's decision comes amid increased scrutiny by regulators worldwide of banks providing services to crypto exchanges.

In particular, Japan and South Korea have recently been strengthening regulations around exchange accounts, focusing on investor protection, anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules.

Note: Some statements in this article were translated from Spanish.

SANTIAGO, CHILE — A day’s work. That’s all Benissont Joseph needed.

As he stood by the side of a dusty road in a country more than 3,500 miles from home, clutching his backpack and a phone, he prayed: Please let one of the passing cars or trucks stop and give me a job.

This was not what he had envisioned for his new life in Chile. In October, before he left Haiti, the 28-year-old had considered going to Brazil or Mexico, the route for previous waves of Haitian migrants hoping to eventually make it to the United States, but he ruled those countries out after recent changes in U.S. immigration policy left thousands stranded at the U.S.-Mexico border.

So he gambled on Chile, a place that he’d heard about from others who had left as a country that still opened its arms to strangers without visas. He scraped together $1,200 for the airfare, flew 11 hours and wound up here: alone on a country road on a chilly morning, 19 miles north of the capital city of Santiago, hoping for a day laborer’s gig.

Every morning Benissont Joseph, 28, joins other job-seeking migrants from Haiti and elsewhere on a busy rural road in Colina, where he watches helplessly as tractors and pick-up trucks roar by, praying he would get work. Chile, he said, is “utter desolation,” and not the job paradise he envisioned when he left Haiti. Roberto González Vilajuana For the Miami Herald

Chile is anything but a land of boundless opportunities, he has realized.

“Chile is a real deception. It’s utter desolation,” said Joseph, as he kept an eye out for slowing cars that might signal work while also checking his cellphone for job leads so he could pay his $134 January rent. “But better you’re here than you are not.”

A country built mostly on white migration from Europe seems like an unlikely landing spot for Haitians. Yet nearly 105,000 flocked here in the last year — the equivalent of 1 percent of Haiti’s population — according to Chile’s border police. And hundreds continue to arrive daily, fearful that they may no longer be welcomed when a new Chilean government takes office on March 11.

The exodus is being driven by the French and Creole-speaking nation’s young people, both educated and uneducated, and particularly the rural poor. Mostly male, between the ages of 15 and 44, this group of migrants is propelled by a growing sense of hopelessness about what the future holds in Haiti.

And they’re part of a global migration trend of working-age people seeking a new start in higher-income countries, according to the United Nation’s International Organization for Migration.

In the case of Haiti, a series of natural disasters in the Caribbean nation coupled with a stagnant economy, and the imposition of harsher immigration policies in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and other traditional destinations, have fueled the shift in Haitian migration patterns to Latin America. Chile, with its stable economy, is increasingly replacing the U.S. as a promising destination for young Haitians.

“Chile has become an alternative,” said Rodrigo Delgado, mayor of Estación Central district in Santiago, which receives about 150 migrants — mostly Haitian — a day, some arriving at the city’s migrant office with suitcases still in hand. “And when someone has made the decision that they want to leave … they are going to do what they can.”

The journey often starts with hardship, even before departure from Haiti. Joseph spent 11 days sleeping in a park at Port-au-Prince’s international airport with hundreds of other Chile-bound passengers before he resorted to slipping an airline employee $100 to confirm a seat on a flight, he said.

Haiti lost 1 percent of its population, nearly 105,000 people, to Chile last year in search of a better life, but the unprecedented migration is not without consequences or controversy. Jacqueline Charles, Edited by Matias J. OcnerMiami Herald Staff

“You go to school, finish your studies and learn a profession. But if you don’t have a godmother or a godfather looking out for you, you can’t work,” said Joseph, repeating a familiar complaint about Haiti’s who-you-know nepotism culture. “That’s not a life. You’re forced to leave.”

Five years ago, opportunities in Chile were more plentiful. There were fewer Haitians, and Chile’s economy was stronger. Now, Haitians face the shock of a new culture, competition from an increasing number of Spanish-speaking migrants from Venezuela, and a sense that they aren’t always welcome. Employers abuse and underpay them. Landlords crowd them into overpriced, closet-sized rooms. Scam artists try to sell them useless work contracts that could put them on the wrong side of the law.

Misled about the golden prospects in Chile, many struggle against loneliness, occasional episodes of racism and resentment from some Chileans. Recently, a fight erupted in Estación Central between Chileans and unauthorized Haitian street vendors selling a popular chocolate-covered cookie called Super 8. The fight with sticks and fists was captured on video.

Even migrants who have found acceptance and a permanent home in Chile say the country is struggling to assimilate the Caribbean arrivals.

“We are new for the Chileans,” said Richard Joseph, 40, a Haitian who came to Chile four years ago and was celebrated as a hero after saving a Chilean woman who had thrown herself from the ninth floor of a building in a suicide attempt. “Up to now, we blacks are new.”

Richard Joseph, a Haitian immigrant in Chile, recently became a national hero after saving a Chilean woman from a suicidal fall in Santiago. Joseph recalls the moment she fell into his arms.

Political and social discontent

Haitians starting trickling into Chile after Chilean troops were stationed in Haiti as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in 2004 to stabilize the country after the bloody ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

With every new Haitian political and economic crisis since, a new wave of people has shown up, making Haitians the fastest growing migrant community along with Venezuelans. As a result, Haitians have become a flashpoint in a debate over migration and Chile’s immigration law that allows individuals to enter as tourists for up to 90 days and later apply for work visas and residency.

In 2010, there were 81 requests for permanent residency, but in 2016, that number had risen to 3,646, according to Social Development Minister Marcos Barraza.

Work visa requests, too, have soared — from 8,429 in 2015 to 35,277 a year later. And Haitians in Chile are increasingly wiring money home. Chile’s Central Bank said Haitians sent back $36 million in 2016 — five times more than they did in 2015.

In the Santiago metropolitan area, where most people are white, Haitians are a small but noticeable population. They’re on street corners selling everything from ice cream to tennis shoes, driving Ubers with small Haitian flags dangling above the dashboard, or hanging out in the Plaza de Armas, the main public square, where the free Wi-Fi allows them to speak their native Creole as they call friends and family.

Farther north along bustling San Luis Avenue in the Quilicura district near the airport, restaurants advertise Haitian food alongside Chilean cuisine, a corner store flies a large red-and-blue Haitian flag, and sellers at a local street market woo shoppers in Creole-accented Spanish marked by Chilean expressions.

But not everyone is embracing this more diverse Chile.

A 2017 survey by Chile’s National Institute of Human Rights found that 68 percent of Chileans want stricter immigration controls. Also, while many view migrants as “good workers,” about 47 percent believe they are taking jobs from Chileans. And nearly 25 percent surveyed in the metropolitan area believe that Haitians are “dirtier” than Chileans are.

Such perceptions, say migration advocates and scholars, underscore concerns that the influx may be generating growing feelings of racism against Haitians.

“You see them selling in street corners, working cleaning the streets … and there has been police violence against Haitians,” said Cristián Doña-Reveco, a Chilean migration expert who heads the Office of Latin American Studies at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

Haitians are also subject to exploitation, abuse and mistreatment as they seek work in construction and on farms, and other back-breaking manual labor.

Six weeks after arriving, Benissont Joseph found a three-week job building a pool. When he complained to his Chilean employer about the long hours, he was fired, he said.

“He owes me $340, and has blocked my calls,” Joseph said.

Critics say while Chile’s central government has been receptive to the newcomers, it has not done enough to absorb the flow. A draft immigration bill promoted by President Michelle Bachelet came under fire from human rights and migration advocates as well as some mayors for focusing on border security rather than protecting migrants’ rights. Parliament sidelined it in January.

“Migration frightens a lot of people,” said Rodrigo Sandoval, Bachelet’s former immigration chief, who resigned in protest over the proposal because he felt it failed to promote a legislative debate over Chile’s migration policies.

During last year’s presidential elections, migration figured prominently, with several candidates, including President-elect Sebastián Piñera, who comes into office in March, being accused of stoking anti-immigrant sentiments. Piñera, who said during the campaign that he wants to restrict foreigners’ access to the public health system and limit migration to those who will contribute to the development of the country, blamed Chile’s decades-old migration law for “importing evils like delinquency, drug trafficking and organized crime.” Among his accusations: Many criminal gangs in Chile consist of foreigners.

“There is no solid proof that the number of migrants is having a negative impact,” argued Peruvian lawyer and immigrant rights activist Rodolfo Noriega, who said there’s a lot of uncertainty about what Chile’s immigration policies will look like under Piñera. “I believe that the majority of migrants are making more contributions than what they are receiving back from the social welfare system.”

Calling the tone of Piñera’s campaign “strongly anti-immigrant,” Noriega, who heads the National Coordinator of Immigrants, said the question is whether the new president will go through with some of his hardline proposals to appease the far-right elements of the conservative coalition that helped him win the presidency.

He’s worried that migrant women with children born in Chile will be expelled, and noted that there have been calls to require travel visas for Haitians, a move he opposes.

“If they impose visa restrictions on Haitians, it would just increase an explosion in the numbers who are undocumented. They will just travel to Peru, Argentina or Bolivia and find a way to cross the frontier,” Noriega said. “Closing your borders doesn’t stop migration. It just drives it into the arms of traffickers.”

Waiting at the airport

At Port-au-Prince’s Guy Malary airport, the lines at the counters of two airlines that fly to Chile stretch outside most days. Hundreds sit calmly on their suitcases or huddle in the shade of trees, while others mill around in the parking lot and on the sidewalk awaiting their turn to travel to Santiago.

Because most of the tickets are purchased by friends or relatives in Chile through ticket brokers, and some have proven to be fraudulent, distrustful passengers arrive days in advance. The process of securing a seat is so fraught with worry that many raise their hands to the skies in a gesture of thanks to God when they finally board the plane.

No different from previous generations of Haitian migrants, they roll the dice, hoping that their South American destination will be better than the world they are leaving behind.

Passengers at Haiti’s domestic airport wait to check-in for a Chile-bound flight in February. Many of those rushing to get to the South American country lately are middle-class, educated youth said the manager of one of the airlines. Jacqueline Charles jcharles@Miamiherald.com

“This is despair,” Richard Hippolyte, who manages the Haiti operations for Latin American Wings, said in February as he surveyed the line of young men and women waiting to be checked in. “They’re trying to get something for themselves. Whether or not they succeed, that’s another story.”

Cottage industries have started springing up around the migration. Chile requires that migrants show they have at least $1,000 in cash, so sharp-eyed middlemen provide the money — at a fee of 10 percent or more. Other opportunists circle the airport offering to arrange the trips. Haiti’s government also has been cashing in, doubling the price of passports for first-time travelers.

Five months ago, Jacques Novembre was part of the line of Chile ticket-holders at the international airport during a particularly volatile period, when many were worried they wouldn’t get out of Haiti. The crowds became so disruptive, blocking airport traffic and arguing with airline employees, that airport officials eventually moved the Chile gates to the less-crowded domestic airport.

Novembre and his wife, Viviane — who came to see him off — traveled for hours on a public bus to get to the airport from Gonaives in the Artibonite Valley, then endured drenching rains in a park across the street as they waited together for five days until his departure.

They had spent a year contemplating their decision. Work was hard to find in Gonaives, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to make ends meet from Viviane’s food business.

“It was only when things became even more difficult, and more complicated for me that I decided to go,” said Novembre, 45.

Still, the decision was tough — until the day in September when three of their five children were sent home from school because of unpaid school fees.

“We wouldn’t like to leave our country and go live with foreigners, but the situation of the country leaves you no other choice,” he said.

Viviane Novembre, 41, said the move was a necessary sacrifice to save her children. “The country is plunging down a black hole,” she said. “As a parent, you have to do everything you can so that your children aren’t brought up in the same deplorable state as you.”

They contacted a relative in Chile who agreed to buy the $1,000 ticket.

His wife said she hoped Novembre “finds something to do and sends me something so that I can take care of the children.”

He still hasn’t. After moving four hours south to the smaller city of Chillán, he occasionally finds work picking strawberries on a farm for $10 a day — not even half of the $23-a-day minimum wage.

He finds the work physically grueling and the town difficult to adapt to. He struggles with homesickness and the chilly weather.

“The only reason you don’t hear me say I am headed back to Haiti next month is because I don’t have a penny in my hands,” Novembre said, his voice heavy with disappointment.

“You might have been a doctor, engineer, director of a school in Haiti,” he said. “But everyone here is equal and with the same chance … everyone has to trace the same route. If it wasn’t for the possibility of getting permission to work, there would be no reason to hope.”

Life in Chile

But getting that permission isn’t easy. To work in Chile, migrants need a temporary work visa, which comes with a Chilean ID number, the first step toward permanent residency. And to get a visa, they need a job offer with a contract. Yet most employers require an ID number before offering a job contract.

It’s a Catch-22 that makes undocumented Haitians vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.

The immigration rules don’t work, said Sandoval, Bachelet’s former immigration chief. The only way a migrant can legally enter Chile is as a tourist — with hotel reservations, pocket money and a return ticket. So migrants say they’re tourists. The law, Sandoval said, “promotes lying.”

And worse, he said, the system has “turned hostile, making the conditions immigrants find themselves in when they get to Chile even more precarious.”

Dieucilien Casseus has spent two years trying to legalize his work documents after a false contract landed him in trouble with Chilean authorities.

Dieucilien Casseus arrived in Chile two years ago, leaving behind a wife, four daughters and a 12-year teaching career. Since then, he’s been fighting deportation, shuffling between work and immigration appointments. Among the documents, his Haitian teaching degree that is useless in Chile. Roberto González Vilajuana For the Miami Herald

The 44-year-old former teaching administrator from Gonaives said he didn’t know his contract was fake until the immigration office turned down his work visa application. He’d paid someone to help him get a contract when he arrived in Chile and thought the agreement was legal.

Chile has been good to him, though. In August, he found steady employment as a machine technician at a textile factory, and his bosses have accompanied him to the immigration office to help him complete his resubmitted paperwork to legalize his status.

Pulling out a folder, he shows his copy of his visa application along with his Haiti training certificate and teaching degree, which isn’t recognized in Chile. He also had to leave his wife and daughters behind.

“Imagine having four children and no job,” said Casseus, who sold land to pay for his ticket and borrowed the rest. “I had no choice but to take the chance.”

Chile wasn’t his first choice. He had hoped to go to the U.S. But the Department of Homeland Security resumed deportations to Haiti in 2016 and the Trump administration in November ended Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, a humanitarian program that shielded nearly 60,000 from deportation. He’s mostly given up hope of getting to the U.S. for now.

“There was a time when there was anecdotal data showing that Haitians were coming to Chile to get to the United States,” said Doña-Reveco, the Chilean migration expert. “But when the U.S. restricted Haitians’ entrance last year, that migration can no longer go to the U.S. So it’s staying in Chile.”

Casseus’ $747 monthly salary, before taxes, is more than the $540 budget he had for the entire staff at the school in Haiti — 19 teachers plus support workers. But it comes at a steep price: He works 60 hours a week, leaving little time for social activities or Spanish classes, a necessity for a better job.

And he doesn’t make enough to support both households, even though his living quarters in Chile are so tiny that the room barely fits two twin beds with a small stove and refrigerator. He pays $260 a month, but he must share a bathroom with 15 other residents.

Jamsley Charles, 24, arrived in Chile at the end of December in hopes of finding a better life in the South American country. But some 22 days after his arrival from Haiti’s Artibonite Valley, Charles, staying in a tiny room with another Haitian whom he met in Chile, still had no job or prospects of finding one. Roberto González Vilajuana For the Miami Herald

Still, he says, he scrapes together money each month to send to Haiti.

He recently took in the relative of a neighbor, allowing Jamsley Charles, 24, to sleep on the other bed for free, remembering how a stranger did the same for him. Twenty-two days after arriving from Haiti, Charles was still trying to find work.

Casseus said it pains him to see “the generation who is supposed to participate in the development of the country [of Haiti] being chased out by misery.”

Missing Haiti

Kesnel Clerge doesn’t know yet whether Chile will be home for him in the long term, but for now, he’s enjoying what he didn’t have in Haiti: financial security.

“If any of my children get sick right now, I am not worried about not having the money for the doctor,” he said.

Shortly after arriving last year, Clerge, 32, walked into a local grocery store, took a photo and posted it on Facebook as a commentary on the promising new life he had found — and the dead-end one he’d left behind.

“The message I was sending was just how I was in a market in Chile, I would like to be in a market like that in Haiti. But in my country, you can’t,” he said, explaining that street violence and fears for personal safety can infect even the most routine interactions in Haiti. “Just as I am comfortable here, I would like to be comfortable in my country.”

Kesnel Clerge, 32, doesn’t know yet if Chile is for him, but for now, he’s enjoying what he didn’t have in Haiti: financial security. Clerge, who made less than $100 a month working in tourism in Haiti, now makes seven times more since moving to Chile and finding a job making furniture. Roberto González Vilajuana For the Miami Herald

In Chile, he works six days a week at a furniture factory in Casablanca, an hour drive northwest of Santiago. He makes around $800 a month — a vast sum compared to the $78 a month he earned in Cap-Haïtien in a tourism job tending to vacationing tourists. The salary couldn’t even cover school fees for his three children.

“I spent nine years working and if I had a sick child, I couldn’t even afford to send them to the hospital. … I was in a bad situation,” he said, sitting in his tiny room that is just large enough for a twin bed, a small dresser and his carry-on suitcase.

To fund his Chilean dream, Clerge borrowed money from a friend, and raised the $3,500 he paid a middleman to arrange the trip by selling a few goats and a cow.

“I sold them with tears in my eyes,” Clerge said, “imagining if I ended up not succeeding, I would be forced to return home with nothing.”

After six months in Chile, starting with a job picking limes and oranges, Clerge got his one-year worker’s visa. He’s already working on applying for his five-year visa.

But the pull back to Haiti is strong. Every day, his wife calls asking when he’s coming back. He misses his 1-year-old son, who was just starting to sit up when he left. “If I enter Haiti, he won’t even recognize me,” Clerge said, choking back the tears. “This life is very unfair.”

In Haiti, Vilcenat drove a motorcycle taxi. His goal is to make money and return to Haiti, he says. Roberto González Vilajuana For the Miami Herald

Most of the Haitian newcomers are rootless, ready to move on if they see a better opportunity. They don’t want to build dream homes here or start businesses. Instead, they harbor dreams of going somewhere else, the U.S., Canada, even back to Haiti.

Stanley Mentor, 27, was in his fourth year of agronomy studies at the private Université Polyvalente d'Haïti in Port-au-Prince in 2015 when he called a family meeting and told them, “The way I see the country, there is no hope for the youth.”

With the financial support of his grandfather, who lives in Boston, Mentor headed to Chile in August 2016.

He was conned a couple of times at the beginning, when a short taxi ride cost $300, and when he paid $250 for what turned out to be a fake work contract. A $50-a-day construction job ended after six months when the boss became nervous about his lack of papers.

But eventually he landed a job doing maintenance work with a real contract. With that in hand, he’s been able to apply for a work visa.

“Life for me is 10,000 times better in Chile than in Haiti,” said Mentor, who pays $500 a month for a three-bedroom apartment with water, electricity and internet access. “It’s been a year-and-a-half since I’ve been on my own and not had to rely on family.

“Before I used to have to call an aunt or an uncle in the U.S., and say, ‘I have a problem here. I need $100 to pay for transportation to go to school,’ ” said Mentor, who speaks some Spanish.

“The life I have now, I wouldn’t have had it in Haiti. I wouldn’t have been able to rent an apartment on my own,” Mentor said. “How would I have been able to do that in Haiti?”

He hopes to return to Haiti — but it will take more than longing for him to pack his suitcase.

“I am waiting on a change,” he said. “I am waiting on development.”

As he watches the flood of young Haitians who continue to arrive in search of a better life, he sees decades of bad governance and empty promises — a democracy that has offered only disillusionment.

“If all the past governments had put structures in place, I wouldn’t have been here today. And neither would a lot of other youths — the engineers, agronomists, doctors — who are in Chile, suffering,” Mentor said. “When all of these youth leave Haiti, who is going to be left to take over?”",http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article202590949.html

Sixteen Cleveland High School students have chosen to spend their spring break carrying out a humanitarian service project in South America.

On Friday, the group left Cleveland to make their way to Patagonia, a region at the southern tip of South America which includes parts of Argentina and Chile. There, the students are collaborating with a school in Neuquén, Argentina, to renovate a greenhouse at a school in an aboriginal community.

“It’s going to be a really cool trip for them, but they will be working on their spring break,” said Ben Williams, engineering teacher at CHS. “It’s been great to see how eager the students are to help.”

The original plan was for students in Williams’ engineering classes to develop a solar energy and arid hydroponics system which would allow the Patagonian school to produce its own food with ease. However, the project has since been tailored to better meet its current needs.



Williams said the school is a rural school set in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, in an area mostly populated by the Mapuche people. It is so rural, in fact, that some students must commute up to 10 miles through rugged mountain passes to get to class. Because of the problems this can present in the winter, the community school also functions as a boarding school.



To help provide food for the school even during the dry and cold seasons, the group from CHS will be “totally revamping” a greenhouse on the school property which is currently not being used.

“It hasn’t been working or producing in years,” said Williams. “We hope to get it working for them.”

The CHS group, working with the group from Neuquén, Argentina, will be installing a new cover, irrigation system and more to help the rural school have a working greenhouse. The CHS engineering students have also taken with them a working model of a hydroponics system they designed to teach school leaders about how hydroponics could eventually be added.

Though the greenhouse project is a main focus of the trip, the group from CHS also includes students who have chosen to focus on Spanish and broadcast journalism in their high school studies. The upper-level Spanish students will engage in projects related to language studies, while the broadcast journalism students will bedocumenting trip with projects of their own.



“I think it’s cool that we have students from different areas going,” said Justin Douglass, a senior engineering student at CHS. “It shows all the branches can work well together.”



The 16 students are being accompanied by Williams, CHS teacher Anna Hutt and Cleveland City Schools Director Dr. Russell Dyer.

When all is said and done, the group hopes to have helped provide the Patagonian school with an additional source of food. Williams noted the new greenhouse could also present teachers there with new educational opportunities for their students, who are in the equivalent of kindergarten through the eighth grade.

However, the students and educators going on the trip are especially excited about the learning experiences they expect to have.

“This is just such a cool opportunity to get to go and put what we are learning to use in a real setting,” said Collin Hubbard, a senior engineering student at CHS. “Plus, I’ve been really excited to visit Argentina.”



The group plans to spend the majority of this week working on the greenhouse project, before enjoying a time of sightseeing. They plan to return to Cleveland next Sunday, just in time to spend Easter with their families.

The students paid their own way for the trip, with donations from several community donors helping offset the cost. These donors included Terry and Michelle Stansberry and the Cleveland Rotary Club.

This is not the first time CHS has taken students on a humanitarian trip of this kind. Engineering students visited Nicaragua in 2016 and Jamaica in 2017 to install aquaponics systems in communities which needed them.","http://clevelandbanner.com/stories/chs-students-to-help-school-in-patagonia,76886"
19,chile,"Santiago de Chile, Mar 21 (EFE) – The United States and Chile today coordinated joint positions on the situation in Venezuela, and discussed the application of new sanctions by U.S. President Donald Trump, focused on “solving this humanitarian crisis.”

“Our common goal is that Venezuelans have freedom and resources. Our sanctions are not directed at people, but focus on getting humanitarian aid to people,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is visiting Chile, told reporters.

The US official arrived in the South American country after participating in a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-20, in Buenos Aires, where he announced that his country “is considering more sanctions” against Venezuela.

Now in Santiago, he added that the US is in talks with EU representatives regarding “the application of sanctions in coordination with ours…I think it’s very important to have a united front,” the secretary emphasized.

Mnuchin was received this Wednesday at the Palacio de La Moneda, the Chilean version of the White House, by president Sebastián Piñera, and finance minister, Felipe Larraín, to talk about Venezuela, US-Chilean cooperation, bilateral exchange, and investments.

“What is happening in the sister Republic of Venezuela is a humanitarian crisis, which is compromising the lives of Venezuelans,” Piñera said in a joint appearance before the press.

Minister Larraín, meanwhile, said the meeting was marked by “cooperation with Venezuela, aid, but also sanctions that do not harm the Venezuelan people, but those who now control the country and take it down a non-democratic path.”

The Chilean minister asserted that this matter will continue to be a key discussion topic during the meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund next month in Washington, which will be attended by several finance ministers of the region.

“Our vision is common: be prepared to support freedom, democracy, and progress in Venezuela, and be prepared to help the Venezuelan people, if necessary, materially,” said Larraín on the issues addressed at the G-20 summit, which was attended by representatives of the European Union and Japan, among others.

Trump signed a decree on Monday that prohibits Americans from buying the new Venezuelan cryptocurrency, the petro, arguing that the digital currency would be used as a means to evade sanctions, according to the White House.

Trump is currently evaluating imposing restrictions on the oil sector, with the aim of putting pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro.

The United States has also said that the Venezuelan elections of May 20 will not change its strategy.

Mnuchin will hold a bilateral meeting in Santiago with Minister Larraín and later a meeting with a group of businessmen, before returning to the United States.",https://panampost.com/efe_panampost/2018/03/22/us-and-chile-prepare-new-sanctions-against-venezuelan-regime/
20,chile,"Thousands of Venezuelans are crossing the borders daily into neighbouring countries in search of safety. Displaced by scarcity of food and medicines, but also because of violence and persecution, the growing numbers of Venezuelans fleeing their country are putting massive pressure on the region.

Over 4 million Venezuelans have fled to find safety in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Aruba, Curacao and Spain over the past 4 years. Neighbouring countries are overwhelmed and overstretched by the influx of Venezuelans.

""Neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador and Panama are stretched to capacity by the sheer number of families arriving in the past months.

Authorities tell us they need the international cooperation to respond to the situation,"" said Christian Visnes, country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Colombia. ""International community and governments in the region must step up their efforts immediately to provide much-needed protection and humanitarian assistance"".

Nazareth, mother of 2 children, fled Venezuela. She decided to flee from the country because of lack of food and extreme levels of violence. ""My children did not attend the school in Venezuela due to constant riots and violence,"" she told NRC. Additionally, Nazareth was recently treated at the hospital for chronic malnutrition. ""I was starving. My two children were hungry too,"" she said.

Although displaced Venezuelans are making it across the border, they face humanitarian needs in neighbouring countries. A comprehensive and rapid response to food, education, documentation and health needs will be vital throughout the region. In addition, the access to refugee status for Venezuelans in neighbouring countries is still uncertain.

""In Colombia, many Venezuelans are arriving to conflict areas and face serious protection risks such as forced recruitment, sexual exploitation and abuse, disappearances, threats and killings. They need protection now,"" urged Visnes.

Venezuela is facing the worst economic crisis in its history leading to an all -time high unemployment and scarcity of basic needs and services. In addition, the country is experiencing growing crime and violence. The murder rate ten is times the global average in 2017 - 89 deaths per 100,000 people, ranking as the most violent non-conflict country in the world.

Facts:

· There has been a 2,000 per cent increase in the number of Venezuelans seeking asylum worldwide since 2014, according to UNHCR.

· The number of asylum applications by Venezuelans has more than doubled in the past year.

· ln 2016, 27,000 Venezuelan asylum seekers were registered worldwide. In 2017, this increased to more than 52,000 applications.

· NRC is one of the few humanitarian actors working on both sides of the Colombian-Venezuelan border, as well in Panama and Ecuador.

· NRC has a long-standing presence in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Panamá, where it provides emergency assistance, legal services and education to the affected population.

· NRC projects provided assistance to over 4,000 Venezuelans and Colombian returnees from Venezuela in 2017 and will scale up the response in 2018.

· NRC is requesting an immediate 2.5 million USD in additional funds for scaling up activities and reach, particularly on the border areas between Colombia and Venezuela, but also elsewhere in Colombia and the region, including Panama and Ecuador 12,000 people.

21,chile,"For billions of people, opening a tap is a mundane task. But not for Nsoda Bokhilfa. That’s because until recently, she and hundreds of other women living in the Ait Baamrane tribal region of southwest Morocco didn’t have running water. Instead, they had to walk up to three hours a day to fetch water from local wells. Even with all that effort, it wasn’t always safe to drink.

But now all 1,200 villagers living there have access to safe drinking water.

This isn’t thanks to the rain gods. The region, only 20 miles from the Sahara, receives just about five and a half inches of rain a year — barely 10 percent of the global average. Instead, the water here comes from the territory’s bountiful source of fog — an average of 143 foggy days a year in the nearby mountains.

“On a really good day, you feel like you’re walking in a cloud,"" says Mounir Abbar, the fog technician for the NGO Dar Si Hmad.

At the top of nearby Mount Boutmezguida, the organization has installed 15 honeycomb-shaped nets that have the capabilities of turning fog into as much as 5,000 of gallons of water a day — that’s more than enough to service all the local villagers, whose average use is just under seven gallons of water a day.

Getting from fog to water

The fog harvesting process can only work in certain parts of the world. First, there has to be a mountain range. And second, there needs to be a nearby body of water. Ait Bamraane has both.

Using a German technology called Cloudfisher, the nets at the top of Mount Boutmezguida captures fog as it rolls off the Atlantic Ocean. Droplets condense on the nets and then fall into a basin and then through a filtration system before descending through pipes to the surrounding villages.

Residents pay a small price for the water, but they say it’s worth it.

“I now have a lot of free time to do other things,"" says Mohammed Hamou Ali, a 24-year-old student from one of the villages who also works on the fog net project.

Hamou Ali says he and his family can now focus on their work producing argan oil, one of the region’s most profitable products.

Spread out over several remote villages, the extra time freed up from not walking to get water can make a big difference.

Initial resistance

While the project has been an overall success, Dar Si Hmad is open about its initial challenges in getting people to trust the new technology.

“The common belief is that fog prevents the rain,” says Jamila Bargach, Dar Si Hmad’s director. “So people dislike fog. They don’t trust it.”

There was also resistance from some women, who took pride in their roles as ""water warriors,"" tasked with providing such an essential resource.

To help ease the transition, Dar Si Hmad opened a water school, where young boys and girls learn about the fundamentals of water management, irrigation and sustainability.

And community members say they're happy to now have the opportunity to send their kids to school instead of sending them to get water.

“My kids think about nothing but their studies,” says Nsoda Bokhilfa. “They don’t have to think about getting water.”

Fog harvesting as a global solution

Around 40 percent of the world’s population faces water shortages. That includes some two billion without safe drinking water and over 4.5 billion living without proper sanitation.

While fog harvesting isn’t a solution that can work everywhere, similar projects are underway in the mountainous regions of Yemen, Chile, Mexico and South Africa.

22,chile,"But the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which is leading the Nafta talks on the American side, is trying to head off the momentum. It is pushing to limit the ability of any Nafta member to require consumer warnings on the front of sugary drinks and fatty packaged foods, according to a draft of the proposal reviewed by The New York Times.

The American provision seeks to prevent any warning symbol, shape or color that “inappropriately denotes that a hazard exists from consumption of the food or nonalcoholic beverages.”

Some experts have likened the fight over food labeling to that over tobacco — and the fierce if ultimately unsuccessful opposition and lobbying that industry waged to prevent the imposition of health warnings on packaging. The Trump administration’s position on food labeling reflects the desires of a broad coalition of soft-drink and packaged-foods manufacturers in the United States.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association, a food industry trade group that sits on the advisory board to the trade talks, says it favors voluntary labeling programs. The group says it “supports a modernized Nafta that will ensure standards are based on science, minimize unnecessary trade barriers, and benefit consumers in all three countries.”

The organization is fighting to keep Chile’s model from being adopted more widely. Roger Lowe, a spokesman for the group — whose board members include executives from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Mondelez International, which owns brands like Oreos, Chips Ahoy and Ritz crackers — said it was concerned about the “evidence and impact” of Chile’s laws.

Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States Trade Representative, said she could not comment on what she called “alleged negotiating documents.” In general, she said, “the United States supports science-based labeling that is truthful and not misleading.”

Proponents of more explicit labels said the Trump administration’s proposal and the corporate pressure behind it hold the potential to handcuff public health interests for decades.

“It is one of the most invasive forms of industrial interference we have seen,” said Alejandro Calvillo, the founder of El Poder del Consumidor, or Consumer Power, a health advocacy group in Mexico that was illegally targeted with government spyware when it fought for a soda tax in Mexico. “The collusion between the industry and the government is not only at the level of spying — it reaches the level of the renegotiation of Nafta and the nation’s own policy against obesity.”

The American proposal conflicts with the guidance from Mexico’s national health institute and from the World Health Organization. Both have recommended that Mexico pass regulations to help combat diabetes, which claims 80,000 lives a year there. That is one of the highest rates in the world — and more than double the record number of homicides in the nation in 2017.

Mexico’s Ministry of Health, which is directly involved in the trade negotiations, said it was reviewing the American proposal with the nation’s health authorities.

Public health experts have hailed Chile’s rules as a new standard. They include a ban on the use of cartoon characters like Tony the Tiger, but the package warnings are considered the most aggressive of the tactics.

“We have shown that a simple message and a symbol is enough to communicate that you should be consuming less of certain foods,” said Dr. Camila Corvalán, a nutritionist at the University of Chile who helped develop the logos. “There’s nothing misleading about a warning logo, and clearly this is what worries the industry.”

Food companies have been forced to take note. Over the past two years, more than 1,500 products have been reformulated to make them healthier and to avoid having to carry a warning logo, according to AB Chile, a food industry association.

But passage of the regulation in Chile did not happen without a fight. Eleven countries, led by the United States, raised issues with the proposal before the World Trade Organization.

The Chilean government successfully argued that the measures were a necessary tool to fight the nation’s mounting obesity crisis. Today, Chile’s success has inspired nutrition advocates around the world, including those in Mexico.

“The fact that the industry is freaking out is reassuring, but at the same time it’s worrisome that the U.S. government is trying to defend the position of the food industry,” Dr. Corvalán said.

All told, at least 23 countries use some version of front-of-label consumer education. Some of the warnings already adopted or proposed include black boxes or red octagons that draw attention to foods that regulators deem unhealthy, using less intense imagery but the same approach as cigarette packaging.

Still, public health experts consider most of the labels other than those required by Chile to be relatively weak or ineffective.

“Chile’s warnings are the new frontier,” said Alexandra Jones, a lawyer at the George Institute for Global Health in Australia. “They represent a potentially much more effective public health intervention: Warn people away from the ubiquitous junk foods.”

Heading off pressure for more explicit warnings through the Nafta negotiation is especially appealing to the food and beverage industry because it could help limit domestic regulation in the United States as well as avert a broad global move to adopt mandatory health-labeling standards.

“It kind of kills a law before it can be written,” said Lora Verheecke, a researcher at the Corporate Europe Observatory, a group that tracks lobbying efforts. “And once you put it in one trade agreement, it can become the precedent for all future deals with future countries.”

In most cases, trade law allows governments to retain the right to make rules in the interest of public health, experts say, but the proposal by the United States appears to be aimed at curbing that.

Ms. Jones of the George Institute said research found that trade policy had also been used to try to block efforts to adopt warnings in Ecuador, Peru, Thailand, Chile and Indonesia. Chile has moved forward as has Ecuador, but with a less aggressive labeling system, Ms. Jones said.

Thailand and Indonesia “appear to have been deterred,” she said, adding, “We call this ‘regulatory chill.’”

One reason that the warning labels are seen as so vital to the efforts to curb obesity is that consumers appear to heed them.

Mexico’s current labeling rules allow for — but do not require — the display of daily intake recommendations of salt, sugar and fat. But they are “indecipherable to consumers” and “totally useless to people,” Ms. Jones said.

Government researchers at Mexico’s National Institute for Public Health recently found that only 17 percent of consumers bothered to look at the front-of-pack labels mandated by law.

In separate research, scientists asked college students to try and crack the current labeling system, which, to use effectively, requires mathematics.

“These college kids couldn’t even do it,” said Dr. Simón Barquera, the director of health research and nutrition policy at the Mexican public health institute. After starting a campaign several years ago to impose a tax on soda, Dr. Barquera and two other backers of the soda tax were targeted by sophisticated spyware sold only to governments on the explicit understanding that it be used strictly against terrorists and criminals.

Mexicans drink on average 167 liters — more than 44 gallons — of soda a year per person, eclipsing what are considered high consumption rates in the United States.
