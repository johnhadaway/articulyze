As delivered

Mr. President, members of the Security Council,



As you all know, the Syrian conflict has now entered its eighth year. When weapons speak, civilians pay the price. A relentless price, with horrific violence, bloodshed and unspeakable suffering.



The last few months have been some of the worst yet for many civilians inside Syria.



I want to start today with the situation in eastern Ghouta. Since the passing of Resolution 2401 on 24 February, military operations - airstrikes in particular - in eastern Ghouta reportedly killed more than 1,700 people. Thousands more were injured.



Attacks on critical civilian infrastructure like medical facilities continue to be reported. There have been at least 28 reported attacks on health facilities since mid-February and more than 70 verified incidents since the beginning of this year. WHO has reported that attacks on health facilities, health workers, and health infrastructure were recorded during the first two months of 2018 at three times the rate we saw during the course of 2017.



In Damascus city, at least 78 people were reportedly killed and another 230 injured by shells fired from eastern Ghouta in recent weeks. They include reports of at least 35 people killed and scores wounded on 20 March when Kashkul market in Jaramana, a south-eastern suburb of the city, was struck by a rocket.



Mr. President,



Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced from Duma, Harasta, Saqba and Kafr Batna in recent days and weeks. So far, reports indicate that some 80,000 civilians have been taken to places in Damascus city and Rural Damascus. Nearly 20,000 combatants and civilians have been transported to locations in north-western Syria.



Nearly 52,000 civilians from eastern Ghouta are currently being hosted in eight collective shelters in Rural Damascus. This is a displaced population which has endured months of limited access to food, medical care or other essential items. In the words of the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator Ali Al-Za'atari, who has met and spoken to some of them, these people are ""tired, hungry, traumatized and afraid.""



Most of the collective shelters do not have the capacity or infrastructure to accommodate such large numbers of people. They are extremely overcrowded and severely lacking in basic water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. There are a number of serious protection concerns, related to risks of gender-based violence, unaccompanied and separated children, and restrictions on movement.



Mr. President,



The United Nations is not in charge of the management of these shelters. However, since 13 March, together with humanitarian partners, the United Nations has mobilized a rapid response to provide evacuees with basic support, in close coordination with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other local partners. So far, more than 130,000 non-food items have been distributed, 130 emergency toilets have been installed, and water trucking services have been provided to most shelters. Additionally, supplies to feed over 50,000 people and a total of 38 mobile health teams and 18 mobile medical teams are currently providing support to those in need inside the shelters.



Mr. President,



Humanitarian organisations also need access to people still trapped inside eastern Ghouta - in Duma in particular, where fighting and besiegement continue.



The United Nations and its partners are ready to proceed to Duma with food for up to 16,500 people, as well as health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene supplies. But facilitation letters have to be signed by the Government of Syria.



I reiterate the Secretary-General's call for all parties to fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law, to ensure immediate humanitarian access and guarantee the protection of civilians, including in relation to displacements and evacuations.



The UN and its partners require unimpeded access to all those affected by the situation in eastern Ghouta. This means access to areas where civilians remain, transit and exit to, like collective shelters, in order to ensure that effective protection mechanisms are in place, so that we can deter any possible violations and that we can provide remedial protection support.



Mr. President,



Eastern Ghouta is not the only place in which humanitarian needs continue to rise. In north-west Syria, in recent weeks, an estimated 183,500 people have been displaced by hostilities in Afrin district in Aleppo Governorate. The majority, some 140,000 people, have fled to Tal Refaat and the remainder have gone to Nubul, Zahraa, Menbij and Hassakeh and surrounding areas. This massive influx of IDPs is putting a strain on host communities, which are already overwhelmed.



Two days ago, on 25 March, an inter-agency convoy to Tal Refaat delivered assistance for some 50,000 people. Overall, however, humanitarian partners are still struggling to gain sustainable access to this area. Moreover, access to Aleppo City for IDPs from Afrin district is currently restricted. Of particular concern are medical evacuations that are urgently required for severely sick people to receive care in specialized hospitals in Aleppo City. Four deaths due to the lack of proper healthcare have already been reported. Between 50,000 and 70,000 people are estimated still to be in Afrin City. Humanitarian access to the City and its outer perimeters is possible through cross-border operations mandated by this Council. The government of Turkey have told us today that they are positively disposed towards this, and we plan to run convoys in the very near future. We know that needs are very substantial.



Mr. President,



In Idleb Governorate, the situation remains catastrophic, with almost 400,000 people displaced since mid-December. Local capacity to assist is overstretched. Thousands of additional people are now coming there from eastern Ghouta, with no sites or shelters available for the vast majority of them.



Still in Idleb, we have received reports of an increase in violence in recent days. According to local sources, on 20 March, airstrikes hit an IDP shelter in the outskirts of Haas village in southern rural Idleb Governorate, reportedly killing at least ten displaced people and injuring another 15. On 21 March, airstrikes on Kafr Battikh village, also in southern rural Idleb Governorate, reportedly killed scores more.

The next day, the central market in Harim town was hit by an airstrike, reportedly killing 35 people, including many women and children.



Mr. President,



Airstrikes also resumed in southern Syria on 12 March, with attacks being reported in and around Dar'a City. There have not been airstrikes in these areas since an agreement was reached last year on the creation of a de-escalation zone for parts of the south of the country. This therefore appears to be a major unwelcome development.



Mr. President,



Let me turn to Raqqa. On 19 March, we received approval from the Syrian authorities for an assessment mission to Raqqa city by the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).



As you know, we have been seeking agreement to this for some time That was on 19 March. Three days later, on 22 March UNDSS deployed a team to conduct a security assessment. They report that while the city is considered ""calm and stable,"" considerable risk remains.

Raqqa City is still highly contaminated with landmines, unexploded ordnances, explosive remnants of war, and improvised explosive devices. We hope access to Raqqa City should be possible for humanitarian aid deliveries via Qamishly, Menbij, Aleppo, Hama and Homs, depending on operational and logistical arrangements. The United Nations and partners are now preparing a humanitarian assessment mission, which is likely to take place next week.



Next Rukban, on the Syria-Jordan border. The UN and its partners received permission from the Syrian authorities on 8 March to organize a humanitarian convoy from Damascus to people in need along the Syria-Jordan border. Last week, on 19 March, the United Nations received permission to join this humanitarian mission. Preparations are ongoing, and a first humanitarian convoy is expected to deploy soon. As you know, we have been seeking approval for this for many months.



Mr. President,



As we sit here today, almost at the end of the month, we have reached some 137,000 people in need through inter-agency convoys to Tal Refaat, Dar Kabira and Duma. This is limited incremental progress compared to the first parts of the year, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the team on the ground and some of you around this table.



But we are essentially just given crumbs - an occasional convoy here and there, often, coincidentally, shortly before our monthly briefings to you. 5.6 million Syrians in acute need cannot live on crumbs. And with a quarter of the year gone, our current level of access is far worse than it was this time last year.



Mr. President,



We need the support of all Council Members and the Members of the International Syria Support Group Humanitarian Task Force to do their part: to exert their individual and collective influence over the parties.



Mr. President,



The Government of Syria and others a few days ago asked for more UN help with humanitarian aid in eastern Ghouta.



In response, we have, first, proposed, a team of United Nations emergency response experts be deployed to strengthen efforts on the ground. Visa requests for the team have been submitted.



Second, we have confirmed a new allocation of $20 million from the Syria Humanitarian Fund, managed by my office, for eastern Ghouta and those displaced from Afrin to provide shelter materials, improve sanitation for displaced people, ensure safe water is available, provide life-saving medicines and medical services, and put in place measures to enhance protection in relocation sites.



Mr. President,



The UN and partners, on average, reach 7.5 million people every month with life-saving humanitarian assistance across the whole of Syria. Clearly without this assistance the situation would be even more catastrophic than it is now, and the loss of life even greater.



Mr. President,



The UN has no money of its own to do these things. We can only do these things because we receive voluntary contributions from our donors. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported our appeal over the last year, including our top donors: The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Norway, Canada, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Qatar, Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia



Mr. President,



Resolution 2401 was adopted just over a month ago.



I ask you all to make the resolution a reality for the people of Syria.



Whatever the difficulty, the United Nations and its partners, remain determined to follow through, for the sake of the Syrian people.



Thank you, Mr. President.

1,syria,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's unexpected announcement on Thursday that the US would ""be coming out of Syria like very soon"" is raising concerns among some national security officials who warn that withdrawing now would not only undermine American credibility in the region but prompt a significant escalation to an already devastating conflict.

While Trump has often touted the gains made against ISIS since taking office, his latest comments caught much of his own administration off-guard -- including defense officials who have warned that now is not the time to withdraw from Syria.

""We're knocking the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon,"" Trump told supporters outside of Cleveland during a speech that was meant to focus on infrastructure."" Let the other people take care of it now.""

Several US defense officials have told CNN that the Pentagon has not heard any additional details from the White House since the President's remarks -- adding that the policy hasn't changed and that they are continuing to focus on their fight against ISIS.

One official said the assumption is the President has had a number of briefings saying ISIS is about to be defeated and that many assume Trump was just rhetorically taking it to the next step.

Any decision by Trump to pull out of Syria would also go against the current military assessment, a fact that left some national security officials concerned about the impact of a withdrawal, another senior administration official told CNN.

Who has the most to lose?

The US maintains about 2,000 US troops in Syria, and primarily backs the Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against ISIS, a group that is about 50% Arab and 50% Kurdish; however, much of the group's leadership is Kurdish.

The President's apparent desire to exit Syria as soon as possible is likely to raise concerns among US backed groups in the region, particularly the SDF, and could embolden the forces of the Syrian regime, Iran and Turkey, all of which have mostly resisted attacking US allies in Syria due to concerns about US retaliation.

""A lot of what keeps SDF in the field is the other forces can't touch them,"" according to David Adesnik, the director of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Without US support how well will they perform and if they find themselves in a weak position will they cut a deal with regime?""

Recently, the presence of US Forces deterred Russian mercenaries and regime forces from attempting to seize oil fields and other territory controlled by the SDF but without the presence of American troops there is nothing stopping those same forces from attacking again.

A similar dynamic exists in Manbij and At Tanf, where US Forces have deterred Turkish and regime forces from any large scale attacks.

The US is also helping SDF forces secure Syria's border with Iraq as ISIS still maintains a presence in the area but that job becomes much more difficult without American assistance.

A US withdraw could help ISIS

If the US were to withdraw, the de facto spheres of influence that have spared eastern Syria the same kind of fighting and bloodshed that the civil war has brought to the west would likely collapse, inviting a major escalation in the conflict.

That chaos could be exploited by ISIS which has already benefited from Turkey's actions in northern Syria.

Earlier this month, the US warned that ISIS has begun reconstituting in some areas of Syria because a Turkish military offensive against a northern city has pulled the US' Kurdish allies away from the fight against the terrorist group.

""We are very concerned about the effect fighting there has had on our defeat ISIS efforts and would like to see an end to the hostilities before ISIS has the opportunity to regroup in eastern Syria,"" said Pentagon spokesman US Army Col. Rob Manning, discussing the Turkish offensive against Afrin.

The State Department went a step farther, saying that ISIS has already begun to rebuild in places.

""The fighting in western Syria over the last two months, including in Afrin, has distracted from the defeat ISIS campaign and provided opportunity for ISIS to begin reconstituting in some areas,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said last week.

US officials have been warning for weeks that the Turkish military campaign against Kurdish forces in Afrin, launched January 20, could undermine the fight against ISIS, as Kurdish fighters helping the US battle the terrorist group began leaving to help their compatriots there. But the Turks see the US' Kurdish allies as terrorists and have strongly pushed back against US claims that their involvement has a negative impact on the campaign against ISIS.

""The claim that the operation conducted against terrorists in Afrin would endanger the combat against DAESH is completely groundless,"" said a statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry last week, using the Arabic name for ISIS. ""The approach that actually undermines the combat against terrorism in Syria is the use of one terrorist organization against another.""

In a January speech laying out the Trump administration's policy on Syria, then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would remain in Syria until the group is routed. ""The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge,"" Tillerson said at Stanford University. ""The fight against ISIS is not over.""

Russia, Iran and Turkey stand to benefit

The involvement of both US and Russian forces in Syria has complicated the conflict, leaving the countries conduct a delicate dance in order to avoid directly attacking one another.

That hasn't always worked, though.

Several Russians hired as paramilitary contractors to fight with pro-Assad forces were killed by US air strikes in February , according to friends and family of those killed. The US and Russia have maintained ""deconfliction"" communications channels to avoid direct combat, but the lines do not prevent all conflicts.

A US withdrawal would create a vacuum in the area, similar to what happened after soldiers left Iraq, and most foreign policy experts agree that void would likely be filled by Russia.

Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, told CNN on Friday that ""if the US were to withdraw, it seems to me the Russians would have a free hand"" in Syria and the forces ""fighting Assad would be weakened.""

""I do wonder if that is something the President thought about when he made that announcement,"" Stent said, noting that any departure would elevate Russia's status to make it ""the main power broker in that area.""

Additionally, Stent said, a US withdrawal would help Iran, a country whose forces are fighting alongside Russians in Syria.

If the US were to leave its base located at the At Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, Iran would be able to secure its overland route from Damascus to Tehran, further securing its regional influence.

Given Trump has routinely advocated for tougher policies on Iran, the US would be ""cutting off our nose to spite our face"" by withdrawing from Syria, Adesnik said.

Along with Russia, Iran and the Syrian regime could also benefit from the economic advantages of seizing oilfields currently controlled by US-backed allies.

The regime lost roughly 90% of its oil production when the civil war began, according to Adesnik.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/31/politics/us-withdraw-syria-trump/index.html
2,syria,"Rola Hallam was practicing as a doctor in the United Kingdom when war broke out in her home country of Syria in 2011. “I did the only thing I knew I could do and got involved in the humanitarian response, delivering medical aid,” she tells Fast Company.

Hallam, worked with several Syrian-based organizations including Hand-in-Hand for Syria, a charity providing on-the-ground medical aid. Over the course of four years, she volunteered, helping to set up six hospitals. Her experience on the ground in Syria inspired her to launch CanDo, platform to directly fund the kind of work she and her fellow volunteers were carrying out. She is one of this year’s TED Fellows.

Throughout her time in Syria, Hallam “began to realize the humanitarian aid system is fundamentally flawed,” she says. The groups she volunteered with comprised mostly Syrians–nurses, doctors, and general aid workers. While these Syrian NGOs and aid workers were delivering around 75% of the humanitarian response in the country, they were receiving less than 1% of direct funding. “This is not just the case in Syria, but in most of the crises in the world,” Hallam says.

In 2014, for instance, over $2.1 billion in relief money flowed into Syria. The vast majority of it went to United Nations organizations or international nonprofits. Those large groups would contract with the smaller Syrian NGOs, like the ones Hallam was working with, to carry out relief projects, but funds often did not reach the aid workers on the ground.

To Hallam, that was an issue. The on-the-ground organizations in Syria were most effective at delivering aid because knew the communities they were serving. They knew where to go for supplies, which leaders among the community to tap for organizing, and the best routes to travel in between sites. They had the potential to work effectively and with a sensitivity to the cultural context and the circumstances in which they found themselves.

What they lacked was funding. In 2016, Hallam founded CanDo to directly fund local humanitarian groups carrying out aid work in their own communities. CanDo functions like a crowdfunding platform for local humanitarian aid campaigns, specifically those providing health care services, and also provides capacity-building support to the campaigns it partners with. “It’s like a startup accelerator for humanitarian organizations,” Hallam says.

CanDo launched its first campaign after bombs destroyed five hospitals, including a children’s facility, in Aleppo. The Syrian organization Independent Doctors Association wanted to rebuild the children’s hospital, which was the only children’s hospital in eastern rural Aleppo, and served around 170,000 young people. But the organization lacked adequate funds. CanDo set up a crowdfunding campaign to establish a “People’s Convoy” that would transmit not just funding, but building and medical supplies from the UK to Syria so IDA could begin the rebuild. Around 5,000 individual donors came up with over $250,000, and the rebuilt hospital opened in April 2017.",https://www.fastcompany.com/40551859/this-new-platform-lets-you-donate-directly-to-humanitarian-projects
3,syria,"Image copyright AFP Image caption President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected Emmanuel Macron's call for dialogue between Turkey and Kurds

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected France's offer to mediate in northern Syria, saying he is ""saddened"" by its position.

""We have no need for mediation,"" he said. ""We are extremely saddened by France's... wrong stance on this.""

Turkey is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

In a speech in Ankara, Mr Erdogan rebutted France's call for dialogue.

""Since when has Turkey been sitting down at the table with terror organisations?"" he said. ""You can sit down at the table with terror organisations but Turkey will continue its fight against terror.""

France says the YPG has no direct organisational links to the PKK, which Turkey says is a terror group.

Earlier on Friday, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan said countries should take a ""clear stance against all types of terrorism"".

""We reject any efforts to promote 'dialogue', 'contact' or 'mediation' between Turkey and those terrorist organisations,"" the spokesman said.

What's behind the French offer?

President Emmanuel Macron had met members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including the YPG and expressed hopes for dialogue between Turkey and the militia.

His office said he had ""paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role"" of the SDF in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters in Afrin

The SDF is a key US ally in the fight against IS and the Kurdish YPG forms a core part of it.

France and the US have given the militia weapons and training to support its battle against IS.

The president said France would support the ""stabilisation"" of the security zone in north-east Syria to stop IS regaining strength.

Kurdish officials said Mr Macron had committed himself to sending more troops to the area but Paris declined to comment on that.

France has suffered a series of deadly terror attacks claimed by IS in recent years, including the Paris attacks which killed 130 people in 2015.

A week ago an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, including a police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage.

How dangerous is the conflict in northern Syria?

Earlier this month Turkey ousted Kurdish fighters from the Syrian-Kurdish city of Afrin. Activists said 280 civilians had been killed, although this was denied by Ankara.

As many as a quarter of a million civilians are said to have fled the city.

Turkey has since threatened to attack the SDF-controlled town of Manbij, which was taken from IS in 2016 - and where the US has stationed troops.

The Turkish national security council issued an ultimatum on Wednesday, saying it would act if Kurdish fighters did not leave immediately.

Elsewhere in Syria, Turkey said five soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by the PKK in the south-eastern province of Siirt.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local):

7:55 p.m.

A member of the British armed forces has been killed in a bomb blast in Syria during an operation against the Islamic State group.

A U.K. defense ministry spokesman said Friday that an improvised explosive device in Syria killed the service member who was embedded with U.S. forces on Thursday.

No details on the casualty's service branch, unit or gender were immediately provided.

The spokesman said ""the family has been notified and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.""

A U.S. defense official says one of the two troops with the U.S.-led coalition who were killed in a roadside bomb attack in Syria was an American.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because details had not yet been publicly released, did not give the nationality of the second military member.

Earlier on Friday, the U.S. military said two coalition personnel were killed and five others wounded by a roadside bomb in Syria without specifying where exactly the attack occurred.

The U.S. official said no additional information about the American would be immediately available.

A Syrian rebel group based near the capital Damascus is denying reports that an agreement has been reached with the Russians to evacuate the area and move somewhere else.

Army of Islam military spokesman Hamza Bayraqdar tells The Associated Press that the reports are false, adding that his group's stance is to reject displacement and demographic change in the area known as eastern Ghouta.

Earlier on Friday, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military's General Staff said in a briefing that the agreement was that the rebels and their families leave the Syrian town of Douma in eastern Ghouta.

The announcement came after the Syrian government on Wednesday issued a three-day ultimatum to the Army of Islam group to leave Douma or face an all-out offensive.

12:30 p.m.

The Russian military says a deal has been reached for the largest rebel group in the enclave of eastern Ghouta to leave the area.

Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military's General Staff told Friday's briefing that the agreement envisages that the rebels and their families leave the Syrian town of Douma, just outside of Damascus.

The announcement came after the Syrian government on Wednesday issued a three-day ultimatum to the Army of Islam group to leave Douma or face an all-out offensive.

The Syrian government and the Russian military backing it have demanded that Army of Islam members leave the area for northern Syria, following other rebels who left eastern Ghouta.

Rudskoi said over 143,000 people, including 13,793 and 23,544 members of their families have left eastern Ghouta.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded angrily at France for suggesting that it could help establish a dialogue between Turkey and a Syrian group that is dominated by Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers to be terrorists.

Erdogan on Friday accused French President Emmanuel Macron of overstepping ""his limits"" and going ""over his head,"" adding that Turkey would never negotiate with ""terrorists.""

He was speaking after Macron met with members of the Syrian Democratic Forces, pledged French support to the group, and suggested that Turkey could establish dialogue with the group with Paris' help.

In his address in Ankara, the Turkish leader also said he held a telephone conversation with Macron last week during which the French leader made ""bizarre"" comments that forced Erdogan to raise his voice and respond with a ""high frequency.""

The U.S. military says two coalition personnel have been killed and five were wounded by an improvised explosive device in Syria.

A U.S. military statement says the incident occurred on Thursday night and that the wounded personnel were being evacuated for further medical treatment.

Friday's statement did not say where the explosion occurred and did not state the casualties are Americans.

A Syrian official had told The Associated Press earlier that a roadside bomb exploded in the mixed Arab-Kurdish town of Manbij. Mohammed Abu Adel, the head of the Manbij Military Council, an Arab-Kurdish US.-backed group in the town, says the bomb went off hundreds of meters away from a security headquarters that houses the council just before midnight on Thursday.

Speaking to students on campus and doing my own research shows me just how complex the situation in Syria is. Described by one interviewee as ‘proxy war on top of proxy war on top of proxy war’, the numerous parties involved in exacerbating or creating conflict is staggering. Oversimplified media representations of the conflict insist on the virtues of one side and the evil of another therefore confusing matters even further. One piece of clarity that this confusion affirms, however, is that innocent people suffer the consequences of governments and organisations who seek to further their own interests.

Recent developments in Syria reaffirm the seriousness of the crisis. The most up to date reports have shifted the focus on the humanitarian situation to the sensationalised coverage of the capture of two members of IS, the ‘Beatles’. Prior to this shift, however, many mainstream news agencies were focused on two developments, namely the recent bombing campaign in the Idlib province in the north-west of Syria, and in East Ghouta as well as the Turkish military operation in Afrin.

Turkish designation of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which seeks to establish a Kurdish state independent of Turkish rule, as terrorists has fuelled its campaign against them. This campaign has involved, among other action, arrest of elected officials, torture and the killing of civilians – just within Turkey. Their recent encroachment, ironically named ‘Operation Olive Branch’, into the parts of Syria with a significant Kurdish population – so far – consisted of the same atrocities. For example, Robert Fisk of the Independent discovered on a visit to Afrin hospital that – despite the Turkish government insisting on hitting YPG (a Syrian offshoot of the PKK) – many victims have been refugees, children and civilians. He recounts the haunting fact that one airstrike left a child refugee orphaned and another killed a family of eight in front of a single survivor. Whatever the intentions of either side or the situation on the ground, it is the innocent who are bearing the brunt.

The Syrian government’s attack on so-called ‘de-escalation zones’, in particular, the Idlib region, has resulted equally devastating consequences. Aron Lund from IRIN news, a news organisation set up by the UN to follow humanitarian crises, has described the area as a ‘refuge for pro-opposition forces’ and other displaced persons within Syria. Therefore, people made refugee at least once have been made refugees over again. He cites UN organisations, like OCHA (the emergency aid body) and other humanitarian organisations, as all confirming that children are disproportionately affected and non-military targets have been destroyed such as hospitals and schools.

It would not be a stretch to state that such levels of devastation are hard to comprehend for the majority of students. When the international media does report on what is happening inside of Syria, the tone and content give the impression of a failed state, completely devastated by bombing and civil war and, now, devoid of any civil society. In that context, it is understandable why people conclude that the situation is hopeless and there is nothing that they can do to help. This is certainly the feeling of the majority of students I spoke to on campus, with varying descriptions of a similar vein like ‘disaster’, ‘catastrophe’. Unwavering images of ‘rubble’, ‘decimation’ and ‘crying children’ characterise their images of Syria.

However, to give into a completely despairing and dystopian vision of the situation in Syria would be to ignore the number of organisations and individuals trying to help those affected. These do not feature so much in the media as is demonstrated by Fisk’s article. Firefly International is one such organisation, running an education project in order to enable ‘children whose lives have been turned upside down and their psychological well-being impaired by their experiences of the Syrian civil war to learn how to play again… The purpose is to improve the rate of learning, social interaction and overall well-being of refugee children.’ Interviewing Maria Chambers, volunteer co-ordinator of Firefly gave an insight into this work. She describes how some volunteers have ‘developed an amazing science program … Its learning through making things and working three-dimensionally as we are dealing with a lot of intelligent but quite illiterate children. They want to empower them to help to rebuild Syria so its very much applied science, learning about building, learning about electricity, basically equipping these children for their employability in the future in a very practical way.’

For Maria, one of the most striking things about the conflict has been “the painful stories that I have heard and the people I have met”, all of whom possess ‘an incredible level of resilience’. Her admiration for her staff is palpable as she describes how – despite not being paid very much – ‘they are making donations to people who are less well-off than themselves. That generosity is not what you get in the media. You don’t get any of that sense of really deep caring and deep concern.’ What is missing from media representation, from her perspective, is ‘this amazing sense of humanity, in spite of everything’. As such, what the media provides is a ‘very distorted view of reality’ which can manifest the levels of hopelessness and confusion present in people outside of the situation in Syria.

I was also able to speak to a worker for a development, education and relief organisation that is working throughout in Syria. He has asked that his name not be included for security reasons. His experience in Syria made him realise that ‘education is as important as food. Donors prioritise food and non-food items when they respond to an emergency situation but I found out that children should be prioritised as well.’ Working on the ground makes him ‘feel that I am a genuine human being when I contribute to helping the vulnerable people and the children who are deprived of Education. I feel proud and I feel my spirit embraces the sky when I save children from ignorance and child-labour, early marriage through the education projects that I run’.

The continued and immensely positive impact of education, while not completely ignored, is certainly not something that comes to mind when contemplating Syria. It is a country we have come to associate with violence and tragedy. This, perhaps, reflects what Joseph Ohayon, director of the award-winning film Crossroads, described as the ‘sociological snowball effect’. This effect refers to the way in which ‘headlines become more sensationalist, more gory, more violent and more extreme. We, on the other hand, are becoming more numb and indifferent. This in turn drives the produces to be more extreme.’ In other words, the price of the drive for higher ratings and more papers sold is our emotional connection to the information we hear. Hearing stories from those who are involved in these projects, however, emphasises that this is not the entire picture. And if it is not the entire picture, then we have permission to be hopeful for Syria. In the face of an onslaught of media representation of negative developments in the world, this hope is an increasingly important thing to hold onto.

Hope for the future of Syrian civil society also requires another realisation which, only through interviewing people closer to the country, have I been able to have. Speaking to one student from Damascus, I was surprised by his insistence that Syrians do not require people to act on their behalf. He spoke of a national resilience, hardworking nature and fierce independence which would allow Syrians to rebuild their country in over a decade. While he admitted that this was part of an optimism that he wouldn’t be caught without, I think it affirms how easy it can be to see victims of horror as helpless, particularly when there is a lack of contact with these people. Whilst it would be foolhardy to think that people don’t need material assistance in the form of donation, education or other forms of support, the rest of the world cannot be the ‘rescuers’ of the ‘victims’ of Syria. Instead, seeing victims of this crisis as capable human beings who are being denied the tools to be able to look after themselves – such as the children whose school has been bombed – is vital. As beneficiaries of relatively thriving civil society and educational institutions, we can assist with providing these tools. Ultimately, however, it will be Syrians who rebuild Syria.

The obstacles to this rebuilding process which are created by conflict is something that people can help with in numerous ways. The contradictions in Russia Today’s claims that Russian bombs only hit their targets while Western bombs hit civilians and American and British media’s claim that the opposite is true can only demonstrate that foreign military involvement is to be resisted. This can be done by lobbying governments. Canterbury’s recent election of Rosie Duffield, MP to an anti-war Labour government, presents an opportunity. Other things people can do are form or join solidarity campaigns, donating (after researching where funds go), raising funds, or getting involved with organisations already working in the area. In Canterbury, for instance, KRAN (Kent Refugee Action Network) has a mentoring scheme for resettled refugees in the UK as well as an education program. Furthermore, the Kent-based A Village in Syria was ‘dedicated to supporting one particular village in North East Syria. We have assisted with food production, health, education and creating work opportunities. Part of our aim has been to build a small-scale model of sustainability and keep rural communities in the public eye.’ The organisation now raises money for Firefly International. In fact, it was Rosemary Berry, of A Village in Syria, who put me in contact with the NGO volunteers I interviewed. In essence, there are many different opportunities to assist. Maria’s point that ‘I think if you can change and make a difference to one person, one child’s life then, in that way, you’re contributing to helping the future’ is, I think, very important.

In essence, an important first step in order to work out how best to help is to be educated, rather than relying entirely on media representations which focus on specific aspects of or distort an incredibly complex situation. As Maria pointed out ‘You have to have your eyes open and you need to be curious, don’t you? And if you’re curious then you question and you’ll find out a bit more and then you might actually think there is something you can do to help.’ In the results-oriented education system that many have experienced, curiosity can sometimes be lost. In order to work out whether one can or should help has to – then – stem from education. An understanding of the situation in Syria is as important as the tools education gives to students. By finding out what we love and are good at can we discover the best way to help.

In the din of negative, sensationalist press – not just on Syria – it is easy to let global tragedies seem farther away than they actually are. Media representations that emphasise tragedy and repeatedly use the images of devastation can numb us to the possibility that there is hope. Educating oneself about what’s happening there, speaking to people who have lived in this situation to undo those distortions might be exactly what is needed to unlock the humanitarian values within all of us. Only once that has happened can we hope to be of use to anyone suffering – whether that be in Syria, Myanmar, Yemen or even in the, austerity-ravaged, UK.",http://www.inquirelive.co.uk/opinion/syria-crisis-6-years/
6,syria,"Syria Is Threatening to Break the Aid World

MASNAA, Lebanon — The 4×4 passed into Lebanon at night, navigating the concrete barriers and stray dogs that populate the Syrian border crossing. In the back seat sat Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who just hours before had become one of the few international observers to visit the bombed-out suburbs of Eastern Ghouta, currently the scene of the worst humanitarian crisis in the Middle East.

Maurer was once second in command at the Swiss foreign ministry and still speaks with the careful diction of a diplomat. He had just completed a 10-day trip to Iran, Iraq, and Syria, and I had the duration of our journey back to Beirut to quiz him on what he had seen during his travels.

“Today was certainly for me one of the top five difficult places I went over the last six years, since I’m president of the ICRC,” he says.

It’s a significant statement for a man who regularly visits the worst humanitarian crises on the planet, from northern Nigeria to Afghanistan. The Syrian government and its allies have drawn on the same playbook they used two years prior in eastern Aleppo, subjecting residents to a withering siege and constant air and artillery bombardments, this time allegedly including chlorine and napalm attacks. Over 10,000 people have been evacuated from the region over the past week , bringing the government to the verge of eliminating the last rebel threat to the capital.

The residents of Eastern Ghouta are living an “underground life,” Maurer says, forced into shelters to escape the bombing. People are pale and cannot even manage the ever-growing number of dead bodies. “You walk in and people ask you if you have a bottle of water,” he says. “That doesn’t happen in many places. People want food, people want a lot of things, but we are down to the very basics.”

Maurer is confronted daily with how fraught the task of providing humanitarian can be. His latest struggle is to get medical aid into Eastern Ghouta: The Syrian government periodically allows flour bags and food parcels but blocks trauma kits and basic medicine, such as insulin, from entering the area. At the same time, he must contend with hostility from critics in the Syrian opposition, who contend that aid organizations have abandoned their principles in dealing with the Syrian government and serve to strengthen Bashar al-Assad’s grip on power.

The ICRC has recently had to fend off criticism spurred by a video of Assad driving himself on the road to Eastern Ghouta, in which the Syrian president briefly drives behind an ICRC vehicle. Some anti-government commentators seized upon the video as evidence that the aid organization provided him with protection. The ICRC responded by noting that the video appeared to be filmed near one of Damascus’s busiest squares — the ICRC vehicle was not protecting Assad but just one of many on a crowded thoroughfare. Nor, it said, did the organization even conduct an aid operation into Eastern Ghouta on the day the video was filmed. These facts, however, seem to have done little to stop criticism of the ICRC from spreading within anti-Assad circles. “Wounded children did not exit from Ghouta,” one opposition banner featuring the image reads. “But the criminal Bashar al-Assad entered it.”

There’s a reason for the opposition’s enduring suspicion of aid organizations. For years, journalists have reported on how these organizations’ desire to stay in the good graces of the Syrian government has skewed aid delivery and caused them to whitewash Assad’s behavior: U.N. aid organizations dragged their feet on delivering life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of civilians in rebel-held areas, for instance, and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) once allowed the Assad government to scrub any mention of “sieged” or “besieged” areas from a U.N. report.

For Maurer, these tensions are baked into the very DNA of the international aid community. The ICRC’s fundamental principles dictate that aid should be delivered without discrimination based on political belief and that the organization should remain neutral in conflicts — but the Geneva Conventions and the U.N. resolutions creating the humanitarian system all begin by acknowledging the primacy of states. “So it’s no surprise that our first address is always governments and to try to seek to negotiate with them on what we are able to do,” he says.

Maurer acknowledges that this has “led to a certain imbalance” when it comes to aid delivery. However, he is quick to point out the lengths that the ICRC goes to push the Syrian government to expand the scope of aid delivery. The organization has provided 3 million people with food across Syria in the past year, and more than 1 million people have been able to access health care services because of it. In Eastern Ghouta alone, tens of thousands of people benefit from food, clean water, and hygiene kits provided by the ICRC — aid that would be impossible to deliver without working with the Syrian government. “We do recognize that the result is imperfect,” he says. “But we have also to respect the power realities on the ground.”

These power realities include the leadership of the ICRC’s local affiliate, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). While its volunteers do extraordinary work and possess a range of political views, its top officials are deeply tied to the government. Its longtime former president, Abdulrahman al-Attar, boasted strong links to Rami Makhlouf, Assad’s cousin and a businessman who has funded pro-government militias: U.S. diplomatic cables reported in 2008 that Attar, acting as a “possible cutout” for Makhlouf, attempted to lease airliners in contravention of U.S. sanctions.

When Attar died in February, Maurer hailed his “leadership and life-long service to the people of #Syria.” I wanted to understand where Maurer draws the line: Is working with figures tied to the government simply the cost of working in Syria, or could the ICRC reach a point where it would jeopardize its relationship with Damascus to protect its principles?

It is yet another source of tension, Maurer admits, that he has to navigate. On the one hand, the SARC is legally linked to the government; on the other, it is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement and committed to its principles. But the ICRC does not appear close to reaching a breaking point with the SARC. “It was always my assessment that the chances of doing better assistance and protection to the Syrian people was outweighing the risk of having a leadership which was close to government,” Maurer says.

As if navigating war zones like Syria was not enough, Maurer also must manage relations with the ICRC’s donors — foremost among them the United States, which provides the largest percentage of its annual budget. Maurer says he has so far received no indications that ICRC funding is on President Donald Trump’s chopping block. The ICRC, he says, has “very positive interactions” with the United States as both a donor and a major power involved in conflicts across the globe.

I want to speak about an interaction that was not so positive. As we approach Maurer’s hotel in Beirut, I ask him about a report that the ICRC wrote in 2007 based on its visits to the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, where it found that several detainees had arrived at the prison by passing through CIA “black sites.” The CIA had used torture at those sites, the ICRC reported, including physical abuse, sleep deprivation, and waterboarding. Trump’s nominee for CIA director had previously been in charge of one of these CIA sites in Thailand.

Maurer demurs. The report had not been released by the ICRC but leaked to news outlets. “Our ability to operate in detention facilities is based on confidentiality,” he says. “So we will keep it that way.”

I try a different route: In the abstract, does the ICRC oppose giving leadership positions to officials implicated in torture?

“That’s not an issue that’s in our decision,” Maurer answers with a slight smile. “We certainly oppose torture as an institution.”

That’s as close as I will get Maurer to delve into U.S. politics. The countries change, but the strategy remains the same: Doing good, in Maurer’s world, means working with those who are complicit in the problems he’s trying to solve. It’s not only in Syria, after all, where he has to weigh his words carefully.",http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/27/syria-is-threatening-to-break-the-aid-world/
7,syria,"Syrian refugees arrive in Rome and are welcomed by members of the SantìEgidio community

A group of Syrian refugees from the devastated city of Homs were welcomed to Italy on Tuesday morning by members of the Sant'Egdio community thanks to the ecumenical 'humanitarian corridor' project.

By Linda Bordoni

“Welcome” and “Peace” were the words with which a group of children and adolescents and their families from the war-torn city of Homs in Syria were greeted on Tuesday morning as they arrived in Rome.

They were also offered a Palm Sunday olive branch and an Italian language tuition book by members of the Sant’Egidio Community who met them at the airport.

The refugees travelled safely to Italy thanks to the “humanitarian corridor” project carried out and funded by Sant’Egidio in collaboration with the Federation of Evangelical, Waldensian and Methodist Churches.

Support of Pope Francis

Pope Francis has welcomed the initiative describing it as a “concrete sign of commitment to peace and life” that helps people fleeing war and violence.

Speaking after the Angelus on 6 March 2016 he said ""As a concrete sign of commitment to peace and life, I want to mention and express admiration for humanitarian corridors in favour of refugees, launched recently in Italy. This pilot project, which combines solidarity and security, allows one to help people fleeing war and violence, as the hundred refugees who have already been transferred to Italy, including sick children, disabled people, war widows with children, and the elderly. I also welcome this initiative because it is an ecumenical one, supported by the Community of Sant’Egidio, the Italian Federation of Evangelical Churches, and the Waldensian and Methodist churches"".

Since February 2016 over 1000 refugees have arrived in Italy through a humanitarian corridor.

Aims of project

The aim of the project is to avoid journeys on the boats in the Mediterranean, which have already caused innumerable deaths; to avoid human trafficking by preventing exploitation by human traffickers who do business at the cost of those who flee from wars, persecution or hunger ; to grant people in ""vulnerable conditions""(victims of persecution, torture and violence, as well as families with children, elderly people, sick people, persons with disabilities) legal entry on Italian territory with humanitarian visas and the possibility to apply for asylum.

Organizers point out that it is a safe solution for all, because visa issuing procedures require all the necessary checks by Italian authorities.

Once in Italy, the refugees are hosted in houses and communities and taught Italian. The children are enrolled in school and the adults are assisted in searching for work.

Memorandum of Understanding

The “Humanitarian Corridors” are the result of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the faith-based groups involved and by the Italian Government that issues humanitarian visas with “limited territorial validity” meaning they are valid only for Italy. Once the refugees arrive in the country legally and safely, they can apply for asylum.",http://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2018-03/humanitarian-corridor-refugees-syria-sant-egidio.html
8,syria,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s president on Thursday assured the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of Paris’ support to stabilise northeastern Syria against Islamic State, and Kurdish officials said he had committed to sending troops to the region.

Emmanuel Macron has been criticized at home over his response to a Turkish military operation against YPG militants. The group makes up a large portion of the SDF, which have been at the forefront of the U.S.-led coalition’s strategy to defeat the hard-line militants.

Macron met earlier for the first time with a delegation that included the YPG, which Turkey is trying to sweep away from its border, its political arm the PYD, and Christian and Arab officials.

“The president ... paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role of the SDF in the fight against Daesh,” Macron’s office said in a statement.

“He assured the SDF of France’s support for the stabilization of the security zone in the north-east of Syria, within the framework of an inclusive and balanced governance, to prevent any resurgence of Islamic State.”

Former president Francois Hollande, who originally approved French support for the Kurds, bemoaned on March 23 Macron’s Syria policy, in particular his attitude to the YPG, accusing him of abandoning them.

Ankara considers the YPG to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency against the state within Turkey.

France, like the United States, has extended arms and training to the YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State, and has dozens of special forces based in the region, which has infuriated Turkey.

Turkey stormed the northern Syrian town of Afrin last week, and has repeatedly threatened to push its operations further east to Manbij where U.S. troops are stationed.

Speaking to Reuters after the meeting with Macron, Khaled Eissa, a PYD member who represents the northern Syria region in Paris, said Macron had promised to send more troops to the area, provide humanitarian assistance and push a diplomatic solution.

“There will be reinforcements to help secure from attacks by Islamic State and stop a foreign aggression,” he said, referring to Turkey. “It’s message that this irresponsible action from the Islamists in Ankara stops.”

The French presidency declined to comment on whether Paris was sending troops. However, it said in the statement that Macron was offering to mediate between the two sides given that the SDF had distanced itself from the PKK.

“Acknowledging the commitment of the SDF to have no operational link with this terrorist group ... he (Macron) hopes that a dialogue could be established between the FDS and Turkey with France and the international community’s help,” it said.

SECURITY COUNCIL

8217TH MEETING (PM)

Intense fighting in besieged eastern Ghouta had claimed thousands of lives in the last few months alone, the top United Nations humanitarian official told the Security Council today, as he pressed parties to the wider conflict in Syria to implement resolution 2401 (2018) and allow unimpeded aid delivery throughout the country.

[Resolution 2401 (2018), adopted on 24 February, also outlines the Council’s demands that parties to the conflict in Syria immediately cease hostilities and ensure a durable humanitarian pause to enable weekly aid deliveries and medical evacuations of the critically sick and wounded.]

Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, speaking via videoconference from Geneva, said more than 1,700 had been killed in eastern Ghouta since the passage of resolution 2401 (2018) on 24 February. Other fatalities had likewise been reported in the capital Damascus by shells fired from eastern Ghouta.

Meanwhile, nearly 52,000 civilians had taken refuge in eight shelters in rural Damascus, he said, most of them overcrowded with only limited access to food and medical assistance. It was imperative for humanitarian organizations to reach people in eastern Ghouta, particularly in Duma. The United Nations and its partners stood ready to enter Duma with food for up to 16,500 people, pending facilitation letters from the Government.

Elsewhere, he said an estimated 183,500 people in Afrin district had been displaced, the majority of them having fled to Tal Refaat where, despite the arrival of an inter-agency convoy two days ago, humanitarian partners had struggled to gain sustainable access.

Despite the violence, inter-agency convoys had reached 137,000 people Tal Refaat, Dar Kabira and Duma, he said, “but we are essentially just given crumbs — an occasional convoy here and there, often, coincidentally, shortly before our monthly briefings to you.” He called on Council members to exert influence over parties and to make resolution 2401 (2018) a reality.

In the ensuing debate, delegates decried the uptick in fighting and urged parties to immediately and fully respect resolution 2401 (2018). The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Council President for March, said the Syrian crisis was a grave violation of the long-established norm to protect civilians and their belongings during war. It was a humiliation for the Council that it had been unable to enforce basic obligations under international humanitarian law.

The representative of the United States said siege, starvation and surrender had become the awful rhythm of the war. Currently, surrender was taking place in eastern Ghouta, where in the 30 days since the Council’s demand for a ceasefire, suffering had only increased. History would not be kind when it judged the chamber’s effectiveness in addressing the crisis, she said, asserting that the Russian Federation had used its Council seat to shield its allies from criticism.

In response, the Russian Federation’s delegate said his country was the only Council member to have taken measures to implement resolution 2401 (2018). It was taking further steps to normalize the situation. The nearly 121,000 people evacuated from eastern Ghouta had left voluntarily, with many describing how difficult it had been to live under the repressive regime of armed groups. He accused Council members of squandering time with unfounded claims against the Russian Federation as a way to conceal their own failure to take constructive action.

Syria’s delegate said his Government was in fact liberating eastern Ghouta from armed groups. It would go on to liberate all other parts of the country. Civilian suffering had not been caused by his Government, but rather, by armed terrorist groups. The testimony of tens of thousands leaving eastern Ghouta affirmed that those groups had deprived residents of their liberty and prevented them from leaving by using them as human shields.

He described “a state of hysteria” in the Council as Syria sought to exercise its sovereign right, restore stability and implement the Council’s own resolutions against terrorism. He assured supporters of terrorism — some of whom were present in the chamber — that their plan had failed.

Also speaking today were representatives of Kuwait (speaking also on behalf of Sweden), France, United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, Peru, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Poland, Equatorial Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, China and Sweden.

The meeting began at 11:09 a.m. and ended at 1:15 p.m.

Briefing

MARK LOWCOCK, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, speaking via videoconference from Geneva, said the last few months had been among the worst for many civilians in Syria, where the conflict had entered its eighth year. In eastern Ghouta, since the adoption of resolution 2401 (2018) on 24 February, military operations, particularly airstrikes, had reportedly killed more than 1,700 people, injured thousands and displaced tens of thousands. There had been at least 28 reported attacks on health facilities since mid-February. In Damascus alone, at least 78 people had reportedly been killed, and 230 injured, by shells fired from eastern Ghouta in recent weeks, many of them in an attack on suburban Kashkul market. Tens of thousands had been displaced from Duma, Harasta, Saqba and Kafr Batna.

In eastern Ghouta, nearly 52,000 civilians were in eight collective shelters in rural Damascus, he said, with limited access to food and medical assistance. Most of those shelters were extremely overcrowded and severely lacking in water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. Protection concerns included the risk of gender-based violence, unaccompanied and separated children, and movement restrictions on internally displaced persons. While the United Nations was not in charge of managing those shelters, since 13 March it had mobilized the rapid provision of basic support to evacuees, in coordination with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and others.

He said it was imperative for humanitarian organizations to reach people trapped inside eastern Ghouta, particularly in Duma. The United Nations and its partners were ready to enter Duma with food for up to 16,500 people, as well as other supplies, but the Government had yet to sign facilitation letters. Reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for all parties to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, ensure immediate access and guarantee the protection of civilians, he said the United Nations and its partners required unimpeded access to all those affected in eastern Ghouta, including shelters.

In Afrin district, Aleppo Governorate, he noted the displacement of an estimated 183,500 people, the majority of whom had fled to Tal Refaat where, despite the arrival of an inter-agency convoy two days ago, humanitarian partners struggled to gain sustainable access. Medical evacuations were urgently required, following reports of four deaths due to lack of health care. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 people remained in Afrin city, where humanitarian access had been possible through Council-mandated cross-border operations. As Turkey had stated it was positively disposed to such operations, more convoys were soon expected.

More broadly, he described the situation in Idleb governorate as catastrophic, with almost 400,000 people displaced since mid-December and local capacity overstretched amid increased violence. In Raqqa, Syrian authorities had approved on 19 March an assessment mission by the United Nations Mine Action Service, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Health Organization (WHO). While the city was considered calm and stable, it was highly contaminated with landmines, unexploded ordnance, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices. Preparations were being made for a humanitarian convoy from Damascus to Rukban, on the Syria-Jordan border, after the United Nations had received permission on 19 March to participate in that endeavour.

Describing incremental progress, he said 137,000 people in need had been reached through inter-agency convoys to Tal Refaat, Dar Kabira and Duma, “but we are essentially just given crumbs — an occasional convoy here and there, often, coincidentally, shortly before our monthly briefings to you.” The 5.6 million Syrians in acute need could not live on crumbs, and three months into 2018, access was worse than it had been at the same time last year. “We need the support of all Council members and the International Syria Support Group Humanitarian Task Force to do their part — to exert their individual and collective influence over the parties,” he said.

On a recent request from Syria and others for more United Nations help with humanitarian aid in eastern Ghouta, he said visa requests for a team of emergency response experts had been submitted today, while a new $20 million allocation from the Syrian Humanitarian Fund had been confirmed for eastern Ghouta and for those displaced from Afrin.

On average, the United Nations reached 7.5 million people every month with life-saving humanitarian assistance across Syria. “The United Nations has no money of its own to do this,” he said, thanking those Member States which had made voluntary contributions. He asked all Council members to make resolution 2401 (2018) a reality. Whatever the difficulty, the United Nations and its partners were determined to follow through for the sake of the Syrian people, he said.

Statements

STEPHANUS ABRAHAM BLOK, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, said that despite differences, there was as a common belief that protecting children should come first. And yet, such protection was lacking, he said, noting that the Syrian crisis was a grave violation of the long-established norm to protect civilians and their belongings during war. In eastern Ghouta, the Syrian regime and its allies, including the Russian Federation, had trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians, relentlessly continuing their offensive. Families were seeing their homes destroyed, their loved ones killed and their dignity shattered. Meanwhile, in Afrin, the Turkey-led offensive had displaced more than 160,000 people and he called on that Government to refrain from extending its military activities to other border regions in Syria or Iraq. Citing resolution 2401 (2018), he said it was humiliating that the Council had been unable to enforce basic obligations under international humanitarian law. He called on all parties to implement Council decisions, stressing the need to strengthen resolution 2401 (2018) and end the culture of impunity.

MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI (Kuwait), speaking also on behalf of Sweden, said the Council must do its utmost to ensure full implementation of resolution 2401 (2018) throughout Syria, as it was the only way to improve the humanitarian situation. All evacuations in eastern Ghouta must be voluntary, with civilian representatives participating in negotiations on civilian evacuations. Humanitarian aid convoys should continue to enter eastern Ghouta for the benefit of those who decided to stay, he said, stressing that arbitrary detention, disappearances and forced conscriptions must end.

Syrian authorities, meanwhile, should immediately grant permission for a reinforced United Nations protection presence in collective shelters and in eastern Ghouta once the security situation allowed, he said, with the Organization also registering evacuees and taking note of where they were being taken. Maximum use must be made of the United Nations to help manage increasingly crowded collective shelters for internally displaced persons. Council members, specifically influential parties, must prod Syrian authorities to implement resolution 2401 (2018). Kuwait and Sweden expected the Astana guarantors — the Russian Federation, Iran and Turkey — to make progress in delivering on their commitments in their March 16 statement, particularly regarding humanitarian access and observance of ceasefire agreements, he said.

NIKKI R. HALEY (United States) said that siege, starve and surrender had become the awful rhythm of the Syrian war. Currently, surrender was taking place in eastern Ghouta, where in the 30 days since the Security Council demanded a ceasefire the suffering of residents had only increased. History would not be kind when it judged the effectiveness of the Council on Syria. She questioned Moscow’s responsibility for the current situation, given that it had voted for the ceasefire and negotiated resolution 2401 (2018), concluding that either Russia had been informing Syria about the content of the negotiations or taking directions from Damascus on the content of the resolution. Either way, Russia had negotiated a ceasefire that it had instantly defied. Indeed, it was supposed to facilitate humanitarian access; instead Russian and Syrian bombs continued to prevent their delivery. From the beginning, opposition groups expressed their readiness to implement the resolution and Russia’s response was to call them terrorists and pummel them into submission. However, cynical accusations from Russia and blatantly false narratives would not stop her Government. Russia was using its permanent seat on the Council to shield its allies from the faintest criticism. She reiterated her condemnation for what had taken place in eastern Ghouta, where 1,700 civilians died during a ceasefire that the Council demanded. That was a travesty and should be a day of shame for the Council, as well as a lesson for when we focus on fleeting symbols of unity rather than doing what was right.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France) said that one month after resolution 2401 (2018) was adopted, not only had it not been implemented, but the humanitarian situation had worsened. Hostilities had redoubled in intensity and the starved people of eastern Ghouta had been routinely shelled. Nothing could justify such a breach of international humanitarian law, he said, noting that not a single convoy had been authorized to reach eastern Ghouta since 15 March. That may have constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes. Moreover, the escalation of violence had forced 55,000 civilians to flee to nine camps near eastern Ghouta, where they were living in disastrous conditions. Gravely alarmed by their plight, they had no guarantees for protection or return. The overarching need was to protect those who could still be protected and for fighting to end so that humanitarian assistance could reach eastern Ghouta. At the same time, civilians who remained were entitled to protection and aid groups needed access to assess the needs of those people. He expressed support for the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria and the relaunch of Geneva negotiations to bring an end to the crisis, while reaffirming the importance of both the political and humanitarian track. It was never too late to save lives, he said. However, in the absence of decisive action, the worst was yet to come.

KAREN PIERCE (United Kingdom), reiterating the call to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, pressed the Council to take concerted steps so that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs could fulfil its mandate. It was “diabolical” that humanitarian access had worsened. Those supporting Bashar al-Assad had taken no steps to stop the fighting, and the violation of resolution 2401 (2018) by Syria’s President and his supporters had made a mockery of the Council’s authority. Welcoming United Nations plans to increase support for internally displaced persons camps and collective shelters, she said the Russian Federation must use its influence with the regime so that the Organization and its partners could provide assistance to civilians in eastern Ghouta, efforts that were required under international humanitarian law. It was the Council’s job to uphold that law. Those siding with the regime were guilty of violating international humanitarian law, she added, calling on Moscow to use its influence to ensure, at a minimum, the provision by the United Nations of humanitarian assistance on the basis of need. The Council had a “small opportunity” to put measures in place to reduce the risk of reprisal. If it could not do so, then who could, she asked.

KAIRAT UMAROV (Kazakhstan) said implementing resolution 2401 (2018) was a collective responsibility, with each Council member playing a significant role. “We must all continue to do everything we can to ensure full implementation across Syria,” he said, looking forward to further reporting in that regard. Welcoming that humanitarian convoys had reached besieged areas, he emphasized the need to create safe conditions for internally displaced persons, and for collective shelters housing civilians from eastern Ghouta to be urgently improved. He also looked forward to a new round of talks in its Astana in mid-May, stressing that dialogue between the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Government of Syria should be ongoing.

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru) expressed regret that since the Council’s demand for a ceasefire, violence and suffering in Syria continued unabated. Although there had been some improvement in the distribution of humanitarian aid, all assistance must be allowed. He expressed support for the protection of civilians in all humanitarian crises and called for the protection of residents in eastern Ghouta, who were particularly vulnerable. The responsibility to protect citizens must come without strings attached, he said, stressing the need to make headway towards a political solution, according to resolution 2244 (2015) and the Geneva Communiqué.

TEKEDA ALEMU (Ethiopia) condemned the increased violence in eastern Ghouta over the past month. Alleviating the suffering required urgent, coordinated action from all actors and respect for all relevant Council resolutions, especially resolution 2401 (2018), which must be implemented with utmost urgency and political will. All States with influence should exert maximum pressure on the Syrian Government, he said, expressing hope that the Astana guarantors would strengthen ceasefire conditions and facilitate humanitarian access. It was vital to ensure such access so that life-saving aid could reach all Syrians in need. Nevertheless, only a political dialogue under United Nations auspices could end the tragedy in Syria, he said.

PEDRO LUIS INCHAUSTE JORDÁN (Bolivia) regretted that obstacles were hampering full implementation of resolution 2401 (2018) and called on all parties to ensure the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid as well as the evacuation of the sick and injured. Highlighting the delivery of some humanitarian aid to Duma, he hailed efforts by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, international humanitarian agencies and the Russian Federation to channel aid to eastern Ghouta and other places. That should continue with the highest possible level of security. He reiterated the need to build on the political momentum of the Syrian national dialogue, to strengthen the Geneva process and to swiftly implement the Sochi declaration. He emphasized that it was up to Syria’s people to freely decide their political future, with an inclusive dialogue — by and for the people — being the only viable way to end the conflict.

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said a difficult humanitarian situation persisted in several parts of Syria. The Russian Federation was taking steps to normalize the situation, including through the implementation of resolution 2401 (2018). That might not be to the liking of some, but his country was the only Council member to take concrete measures to implement that text. The nearly 121,000 people evacuated from eastern Ghouta had left voluntarily, with many describing how difficult it had been to live under the repressive regime of armed groups. Russian specialists had organized the provision of hot food, drinking water and medical care, he said, going on to discuss evacuations in other parts of Syria. He said that some Council members were squandering time with unfounded claims against his country to conceal their own failure to do something constructive with resolution 2401 (2018).

He questioned the origin of some information in the Secretary-General’s report, including information attributed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who had no staff on the ground. He asked whether information was coming from anti-Government groups and terrorist henchmen such as the White Helmets and questioned why information from Damascus was cited in reports in a piecemeal way. He proposed that future reports discuss reconstruction, including in areas liberated from terrorists, adding that he was under the impression that external donors would not be interested in helping those parts of Syria under Government control. Concluding, he expressed the hope that, in close cooperation with the Syrian authorities, the United Nations would agree on an emergency humanitarian response plan for 2018, with an emphasis on assistance for liberated areas.

JOANNA WRONECKA (Poland) said it was unfortunate that resolution 2401 (2018) had not been implemented and there had been no substantial change on the ground. In consequence, human suffering was growing. No fight against terrorism could justify such actions. There was a need for accountability and urgent steps to ensure justice in the immediate and longer-term. She called for humanitarian access for women and children, to be overseen by the United Nations. Concerning evacuations, she said people must have the right to return and safe places to seek shelter. At the same time, all actors should use their influence to improve ground conditions and she called for the cessation of hostilities throughout Syria. Some positive steps had been made, with the highest number of humanitarian convoys witnessed in March. She called on the Russian Federation, Iran and Turkey to fulfil their obligations as Astana guarantors.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea) said the complicated backdrop of the conflict made it increasingly difficult to ensure the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid. The solution to the humanitarian crisis was closely linked to the cessation of hostilities, which were stoking instability and risked spilling over to neighbouring countries. The overall goal was to end the suffering of the Syrian people, who needed a cessation of hostilities, access to humanitarian and health aid, and an end to the sieges. All parties must accept that they could not impose a military victory. There was no victor in the current situation, only a loser — the Syrian people. Human blood was being shed due to inflexible positions. He went on to express support for any initiative that would end the suffering.

BERNARD TANOH-BOUTCHOUÉ (Côte d’Ivoire), emphasizing that resolution 2401 (2018) had fallen short of expectations, called for the effective implementation of that text to allow resumed humanitarian deliveries to besieged areas. Council members must set aside their differences and show unity, he said, adding that the humanitarian situation was unlikely to improve without progress on the political front.

WU HAITAO (China) said all parties in Syria must put that country’s destiny, and the security of its people, first. He welcomed the Russian Federation’s establishment of temporary truces and opening of humanitarian corridors, adding that implementation of resolution 2401 (2018) must continue in order to ease the situation, notably in eastern Ghouta. Further, the international community must support the United Nations mediation role while respecting Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, alongside a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process in line with resolution 2254 (2015). Concluding, he said the Council must remain united on the Syrian issue.

CARL ORRENIUS SKAU (Sweden) said there was broad agreement within the Council on several critical areas, including frustration with the lack of implementation of resolution 2401 (2018); a common concern over persistent hostilities, particularly in eastern Ghouta; and the need to better protect civilians. He asked the Under-Secretary-General if there were any more steps the United Nations could take to better protect civilians who were either inside eastern Ghouta or leaving that area. Expressing concern over Turkey’s operation in Afrin, he called on all parties, especially Turkey, to ensure the protection of civilians, and to facilitate both cross-border and cross-line humanitarian aid delivery, as well as the freedom of movement among internally displaced persons.

BASHAR JA’AFARI (Syria) expressed sympathy to the Russian Federation for the lives lost in a fire incident in that country. The two Council members that had embassies in Damascus were the only ones who had been able to provide an objective assessment of the situation in Syria. At the end of 2016, the Government was on the cusp of liberating eastern Aleppo from armed groups. Today, it was liberating eastern Ghouta from those groups as well, and would liberate all parts of Syria as it rejected any armed presence or occupying Power on its territory. Such victories would not have been possible without just cause and support by the Syrian army and its allies.

Syrians’ suffering had not been caused by his Government, but rather armed terrorist groups, he said. The testimony of tens of thousands leaving eastern Ghouta affirmed that such groups had deprived residents of their liberty, preventing them from leaving by using them as human shields. Yet, in recent days, there had been “a state of hysteria” in the Council, as Syria sought to exercise its sovereign right, restore stability and implement the Council’s own resolutions against terrorism. He assured supporters of terrorism — some of whom were present in the chamber — that their plan had failed.

He said this was indeed a day of shame, as the United States delegate had stated, but notably for the supporters and sponsors of terrorism. The Council had been presented with numerous reports on Syria, full of falsehoods, to serve the policy of certain Western members of the Council. They lacked professionalism and failed to note attacks by the Turkish regime, Israeli occupying force and others.

At the same time, the humanitarian crisis in Syria had resulted from the imposition of unilateral, coercive measures, he said. Despite what the Under-Secretary-General had stated, Syria was helping people in eastern Ghouta. As evidence that the report lacked objectivity, it had dedicated nine paragraphs to the suffering of people in eastern Ghouta by the Government, while allotting only one sentence to the 8 million civilians in Damascus that had been targeted by terrorists, with thousands killed and key infrastructure destroyed.

He expressed hope the United Nations would not succumb to the will of influential countries, nor repeat the same approach in eastern Ghouta it had taken in other liberated areas by not providing humanitarian support, as that would run counter to international law. Asserting that his Government had evidence, he went on to stress that State sponsors of terrorism had instructed non-State actors on the ground to use chemical weapons against civilians in Syria and falsely accuse his Government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/humanitarian-affairs-chief-calls-parties-syria-allow-aid-delivery
10,syria,"The UN has called for urgent access to fleeing civilians and those trapped in Syria's Eastern Ghouta, which continues to face devastating bombardment by government forces.

It says many of the 50,000 people who have fled in recent days are suffering from potentially fatal illnesses.

Although there was a lull in bombing for a few days, the situation is escalating and an estimated 32 civilians were killed in overnight shelling by government forces. About a dozen of those killed were children who had attempted to shelter from air raids in a school.

The Syrian rescue group the White Helmets says weapons like white phosphorous, which is banned in civilian areas, have again been used.

11,syria,"An estimated 150,000 people are in flight following Turkey’s capture of the northern Syrian city of Afrin, part of a wider Kurdish enclave of the same name. It is unclear if or when they will be able to go back home.

For the past two months, Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels have been fighting the YPG – a Syrian Kurdish offshoot of Turkey’s Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – for control of the Afrin enclave.

Violence had already displaced tens of thousands in the enclave, but when YPG troops finally permitted people to leave as they pulled out of the city over the weekend, a new wave of civilians flooded out towards areas still held by the YPG or controlled by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“We are really witnessing a humanitarian crisis with the ongoing influx of thousands of people fleeing the fighting who are sometimes forced to sleep in the open with no shelter, no food, no water, and no access to medical care,” Ingy Sedky, a Damascus-based spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told IRIN on Sunday.

The Kurds and the Kremlin

For much of Syria’s seven-year war, the YPG, which stands for People's Protection Units, have battled Arab insurgents for control over Kurdish parts of northern Syria, while in an uneasy, on-off truce with al-Assad's forces. Since 2014, the group played a major role in defeating the so-called Islamic State in and around Raqqa, with backing from the United States.

Turkey considers the PKK, which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the state for decades, to be a terrorist organisation. Keen to break up a PKK-linked Kurdish powerhouse near its borders, on 20 January it sent special forces across the border to assist a collection of Syrian rebels taking on the YPG.

Though the fighting itself was a brute force contest in which Turkey proved superior to lightly armed Kurdish guerrillas, the intervention was also tied up in a complex set of political deals.

Russia’s role was pivotal. While the YPG is a US ally in northeastern Syria, it has worked with Russia in Afrin – last year, Moscow stationed a symbolic monitoring force there to prevent Turkish incursions.

But an under-the-table deal between Ankara and Moscow appears to have ensured that the Russians would not get in the way of the Turkish intervention: monitors were moved aside; the Kurds cried foul, to no avail.

Despite his troubled relationship with the YPG, al-Assad sees Turkey as a far more capable and dangerous enemy. To ward off the Turks, the Syrian president reportedly asked that the YPG should place Afrin under his control, calculating that this would force Turkey to confront not just him but also his Russian ally. Al-Assad also appears to have sent anti-tank missiles to Afrin and helped the YPG resupply via government-held Aleppo.

But the YPG reportedly refused to relinquish its control over Afrin, and, more importantly, Russia refused to back al-Assad against Turkey in Afrin, forcing the Syrian president to scale down his ambitions. Instead of dispatching a formal Syrian Arab Army detachment, al-Assad merely green-lighted the arrival on 21 February of local militias from two nearby pro-government towns, Nubul and Zahra. The towns had previously been rescued by the YPG when under siege by Turkish- and US-backed Sunni rebels, and militia leaders now wanted to repay the favor.

Saleh Muslim, a Syrian Kurdish leader who is allied with the YPG, told IRIN in a 6 March interview that Russia’s role was paramount. Asked as the fighting was ongoing what could keep Afrin from falling into Turkish hands, he replied: “Put pressure on Russia. They are the only force that can stop this.”

The other thing that could have saved Afrin, Saleh Muslim said, was if the YPG was provided with anti-aircraft missiles. “Then we’ll stop them in one minute,” he said, acknowledging with a wry smile that it would never happen.

In the end, Russia faced little pressure and never changed its position. A 24 February ceasefire decreed by the UN Security Council should theoretically have halted the fighting, but it was ignored by almost all parties.

Bombing hospitals

Thrown to the wolves by its only powerful defender in Afrin, the YPG could not hold out for long. By early March, all that remained was the question of whether to pull out to save lives or mount a hopeless last stand to score political points.

“The Turks broke the YPG’s outer defences about two weeks ago and ever since then the question was whether the YPG would fight inside the city or withdraw,” Aaron Stein, an expert on the Turkish military and a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told IRIN. “They chose the latter, which spared the city from urban conflict.”

That decision likely saved many lives, but Afrin’s civilians suffered tremendously during the preceding weeks. Kurdish homes are reported to have been looted by rebels while Turkish air raids pummelled civilian areas.

The Turkish military flatly denies causing any non-combatant deaths and says all operations were “conducted without harming any civilians, innocent people, and the environment”. Plenty of evidence has emerged to the contrary.

Airwars, a London-based nonprofit that collects evidence on airstrike casualties in Syria, has published a dossier listing numerous cases in Afrin. Separately, a pro-YPG news agency claims 289 civilians have been killed by Turkish forces and their allies since 20 January, including 43 children.

Whatever the actual number, this rural, isolated, and underdeveloped region’s inability to handle large amounts of casualties has made matters worse.

“With only four hospitals currently operating in the area, health facilities and personnel are overwhelmed and struggle to cope with the increase in the number of casualties,” the ICRC’s Sedky said.

Just before the Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels entered the city, Turkish fighter planes reportedly bombed Afrin’s main hospital on Friday in an attack said to have killed 16 people.

The Turkish military denied the hospital had been hit, but photographic evidence confirmed the building had been damaged.

Civilians prevented from fleeing

In the midst of this mayhem, huge numbers of Kurdish civilians have been fleeing their homes.

The UN estimates that nearly 100,000 civilians were displaced from Afrin before the city fell on Sunday. Kurdish officials and humanitarian sources put the number at more than 150,000, out of the enclave’s total estimated population of 323,000. Most had gathered in the district’s capital, which filled up with desperate civilians even after water supplies were cut off in early March.

Until this weekend, most civilians had nowhere to run but the city centre. The UN reported that Afrin’s YPG-backed authorities closed all exits for civilians wishing to leave the enclave.

Syrian army checkpoints near Nubul and Zahra were also said to be turning back those civilians who did manage to escape, by either sneaking out or using YPG connections. Other UN reports said pro-Assad fighters were charging money for the right to pass into government-held territory.

UN sources confirmed to IRIN that Kurdish civilians were forcibly kept inside the enclave until the last days of the offensive. Only when Afrin’s defences neared collapse did the YPG decide to evacuate the city.

“In Afrin, both the YPG and Syrian government forces were preventing movement, but now we have a massive displacement towards Tel Rifaat,” Linda Tom, a Damascus-based spokeswoman for the UN’s emergency aid coordination body OCHA, told IRIN by email on Saturday, before Turkish troops entered the provincial capital. Tel Rifaat is a majority-Arab city east of Afrin where YPG fighters remain stationed alongside Russian monitors, amid rumours that the YPG will hand the area to al-Assad’s government.

With Afrin now having slipped from Kurdish control, 100,000 people are estimated to have arrived at Tel Rifaat in a matter of days, with additional thousands fleeing to other areas in the Afrin and Aleppo areas. Though the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent were distributing mattresses, blankets, and kitchen kits in Nubul and Zahra, on the road between Afrin and Aleppo, aid groups seem overwhelmed by the influx.

Uncertain fate for the displaced

Turkish authorities now seem to be working to put a friendly, local face on their presence. But Afrin has a decades-old reputation as a pro-PKK stronghold, and many of the displaced civilians may be unwilling – perhaps unable – to live under Turkish control, especially given Ankara’s discriminatory policies against its own Kurdish minority.

A Syrian civilian council is being formed to govern the area, organised by Turkey and Syrian dissidents, including Abdelaziz Tammo, a Syrian Kurdish opponent of the YPG and PKK. “This is a liberation,” Tammo told the New York Times, arguing that the YPG “took control [of Afrin] by force of arms and forced the people to live under their rule.”

Saleh Muslim insisted that such reports amount to no more than slander by “individuals” based in Turkey, but YPG-backed authorities have harshly repressed rival Kurdish groups since seizing control over northern Syria in 2012.

Tammo’s council seems intended to form the nucleus of a new civilian administration under Turkish oversight. But in practice, in so far as Syrians will exercise any real control over Afrin, it is the armed groups that will dominate civilians – not the other way around.

The Syrian rebels backing the Turkish forces are a collection of conservatively religious or Islamist Sunni groups that operate together under the Free Syrian Army moniker. They include token Kurdish units but are otherwise made up of Arab and Turkmen fighters, which is a troubling sign in a northern Syria pulsating with ethnic tension.

The YPG and its allies are predictably scornful of Afrin’s new masters, slamming them as little better than al-Qaeda.

“What they refer to as the Free Syrian Army is really jihadists,” Saleh Muslim told IRIN. “Look at the Sultan Murad Brigade set up by Turkey,” he said, referring to an Ankara-backed, religiously inclined Turkmen militia that played a leading role in the Afrin offensive. “That’s your Free Syrian Army? No, the game is out in the open now.”

This is hardly a characterisation that the rebels or their supporters would agree with, but Saleh Muslim’s view may well be shared by many of Afrin’s displaced villagers, currently seeking shelter in nearby cities or hiding in the mountains.

Tammo, the anti-YPG politician, has called on Kurds to return home and join the new Turkish-backed administration. But rebels are now looting shops and homes in central Afrin and it remains unclear how many could follow his advice, or would want to live under Turkish rule by proxy.

With the YPG vowing to carry on guerrilla-style war in Afrin, perhaps supplied with arms and a safe haven by al-Assad, it also remains to be seen how governable the area will be for Turkey and its militias.

As Newroz, the Kurdish new year, approaches on 21 March, many of the civilians scattered across northwestern Syria will see little cause for celebration.

There are a lot of good arguments for maintaining an American presence in Syria after the fall of the Islamic State, but President Trump doesn’t seem persuaded by any of them. Perhaps he would back off his urge to cut and run if he knew that the United States and its partners control almost all of the oil. And if the United States leaves, that oil will likely fall into the hands of Iran.

It’s one feature of a larger U.S. mission in Syria that is really about containing Iranian expansionism, preventing a new refugee crisis, fighting extremism and stopping Russia from exerting influence over the region. The United States has serious national security interests in making sure that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran don’t push America out of Syria and declare total victory.

But Trump has repeatedly said those tasks are not the United States’ responsibility. He promised to pull the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria at a campaign rally on Thursday in Ohio.

“We’re knocking the hell out of ISIS. We’ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,” he said. “Let the other people take care of it now.”

It’s not an offhand remark. Last month, Trump said that although he thinks the slaughter in eastern Ghouta by Russia, Iran and the Assad regime is “a humanitarian disgrace,” he has no intention of doing anything about it, because our mission is to “get rid of ISIS and go home.”

Of course, that contradicts his top national security officials. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said late last year that the troops would stay to prevent “ISIS 2.0” and stabilize the situation. In January, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson laid out in a carefully workshopped policy speech five long-term goals for U.S. policy in Syria, including ridding the regime of weapons of mass destruction and solving the political conflict. He promised that the United States “will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge.”

But if Trump disagrees and is looking for a Syria policy that fits his campaign, he might remember that he has constantly complained that in Iraq, “we should have kept the oil.” Of course, we can’t and shouldn’t take or keep Syria’s oil. But there’s a grain of truth in Trump’s idea. Control over oil is the only influence we have in Syria today.

“We have this 30 percent slice of Syria, which is probably where 90 percent of the pre-war oil production took place,” said David Adesnik, director of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “This is leverage.”

The actual people holding the land with the oil are not U.S. troops, but the mostly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces that were trained and armed by Washington, along with local Sunni Arab leaders who are resisting the ongoing onslaught by government- and Iranian-backed forces.

The Assad regime and Iran have a stated and ongoing strategy to take back all the land that Assad once controlled, including the land containing Syria’s most valuable energy resources.

What’s more, in May, Trump is expected to pull the United States out of the Iran deal, meaning that he will reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil. It would be profoundly counterproductive to hand Iran control over a swath of Syria that contains huge amounts of oil at the exact same time.

As Chagai Tzuriel, director general of Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence, told me, if the U.S. and its allies intend to stop Iran’s regional expansion, that mission must begin in Syria. Also, if there is to be any real peace negotiation, the U.S. military presence is crucial for America having influence there as well.

“If there is a true commitment to counter Iran, it needs to be done in Syria first. If it’s not done in Syria, we will lose that campaign,” Tzuriel said. “The presence of the American forces is very important … That buys you a seat at the table that decides the future of Syria.”

If the U.S. troops leave, the Kurds are likely to cut a deal with the regime and leave the Sunnis to Assad’s cruelty. Then, the Iranians will move into the area, completing their land bridge of control from Tehran to Beirut. If Trump doesn’t have a real Syria strategy, he doesn’t have a real Iran strategy.

“Iran is turning its proxy network, its axis of resistance, into a region-wide resistance army,” said Melissa Dalton, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She said Iran now has more than 250,000 proxy forces directly or indirectly under its influence around the region.

Syrian opposition leaders are asking for the United States to work with both the Kurds and the Sunni Arab local leaders to consolidate control in liberated areas and help organize local governance. Those who have fought the Islamic State don’t want to live under the rule of Assad and Iran, said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a nongovernmental organization that works with the Syrian opposition.

“It’s incredibly important that with all these oil-rich areas … we don’t end up in a situation where we do have to pull out and there is some sort of deal that allows Iran to essentially take the land, the oil, and these areas, and empower their land bridge that they’ve been building inside the country,” he said. “We took the oil. We’ve got to keep the oil.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/03/30/in-syria-we-took-the-oil-now-trump-wants-to-give-it-to-iran/

ISTANBUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's recent seizure of the Kurdish-held Afrin region in Syria has strengthened its position in the settlement of Syria's crisis, through not to the extent that it could go its own way, analysts said.

Ankara's message to the United States and Russia by the Afrin operation is that they cannot easily shape Syria's future without Turkish consent, Celalettin Yavuz, a security and foreign policy analyst, told Xinhua.

Turkish troops, backed by the Free Syrian Army rebel group, declared a ""full control"" of the Afrin region on March 24 following a two-month campaign against Kurdish militia known as the People's Protection Units (YPG), which is seen by Ankara as a terror group.

The capture of Afrin is strengthening Ankara's hand given that Turkey is already a legitimate player in Syria through the Astana peace process, said Huseyin Bagci, a professor of international relations with Ankara-based Middle East Technical University.

Turkey, Russia and Iran struck a deal last year in the Kazakh capital of Astana on peacemaking in Syria, launching a peace process in parallel with the peace talks in Geneva.

In a previous military operation completed a year ago, the Turkish army drove out the forces of Islamic State (IS) from an area on its border which lies between Afrin and the Euphrates River.

However, the analysts noted that Ankara's capacity in shaping the future of Syria, where the U.S. and Russia are the main players, has its limits.

Ankara must have dialogue with Damascus to have more sway over how Syria will be redesigned following the war, said Bagci.

It is still not clear how the Syrian crisis will be settled, Yavuz said, noting that neither the U.S.-led Geneva talks nor the Russia-led Astana peace process could offer much hope for a settlement for the moment as disagreements remain among parties.

The ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey used to support the rebel groups fighting to topple the Syrian government and refuses until now to have any political contact with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom it calls a terrorist.

The Turkish government insists that al-Assad should have no place in the future of Syria, taking side with the U.S. despite their differences on many issues.

""Turkey may push for al-Assad to go, but it is difficult to say it has the means to impose that,"" remarked Yavuz, who teaches at Istanbul Ayvansaray University.

Ankara would not, however, oppose an election to be held while al-Assad is in power if the YPG is left out of both the Geneva and Astana processes, he said.

The Kurdish militants have been excluded from the talks so far in both Geneva and Astana due to Ankara's pressure over Washington and Moscow.

Noting that Turkey has already managed to secure a modest seat at the negotiation table over Syria following its operation against the IS, Yavuz said Ankara's position has been strengthened by the Astana process and its role in the Syrian province of Idlib.

As part of the Astana deal, the Turkish military has established seven observation posts to monitor the ceasefire in Idlib, which is under the control of radical jihadist groups.

Ankara has repeatedly said that it would not allow terrorist entities to be based near its border in Syria, while Damascus has condemned the Turkish military presence on its soil as occupation.

""The seizure of Afrin sends a particularly strong message, considering it was one of the YPG's three self-declared cantons,"" said Yavuz.

The YPG has two other cantons on the eastern part of the Euphrates along the Turkish border.

The United States, which has angered Turkey by its military support to the YPG, has built 20 military bases in the YPG-controlled area, according to Ankara.

Turkey is concerned that a U.S.-backed Kurdish entity along its border may set a precedent for its own Kurdish population of nearly 20 million.

Remarks by top officials of Turkey's ruling party suggest that the Turkish government may be seeking to establish Sunni areas in northern Syria.

It is widely argued, however, that pushing for a Sunni zone, a move that could increase the risk of Syria's disintegration, would face the opposition of Russia and Iran, staunch supporters of Damascus.

Turkey would encounter no risks as long as it remains within the Astana deal, Bagci argued, saying Turkey's military presence allows it to arrange things in areas it captured only on a temporary basis as otherwise it risks being accused of occupation by the international community.

Turkey has stated its intention to resettle some of 3.5 million Syrian refugees on its soil and in areas under its control in Syria, while top government officials have repeatedly voiced Ankara's respect for Syrian territorial integrity.",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/29/c_137075321.htm
15,syria,"A map reportedly detailing the location of French military bases in northern Syria was published Friday by Turkish press agency Anadolu, a day after French President Emmanuel Macron assured the Syrian Democratic Forces of France’s support.

The visit by Syrian Kurdish representatives to the French presidential palace on Thursday was watched closely by the Turkish government who were anything but happy.

A map purportedly showing French military positions in Syria published by Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency on its website Friday could be seen as a direct response to Thursday's visit.

The five military bases are believed to be mostly located in the north of the country in regions controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces. According to Anadolu, close to 70 French soldiers may currently be operating in the northeast of Syria.

On Thursday, President Macron met representatives of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, at his presidential palace. The SDF are a multi-ethnic, multi-religious alliance of both Syrian Kurdish and Arabic fighters. Macron pledged his support to the SDF, stating that he hoped “dialogue would open up between the SDF and Turkey.”

Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted angrily to the meeting, declaring he was “extremely saddened by France’s… wrong stance on this.” He also slammed France’s offer to mediate between his country and “a terrorist organisation.”

If proved true, the information about the location of the military bases could prove dangerous for French troops. Its release could represent a warning from the Turkish government to France.

FRANCE 24 chose not to republish the map released by the Turkish agency, as the information on it couldn’t be verified.

Political crisis between France and Turkey

After meeting with Macron, a representative from the Syrian Kurds in Paris declared that the French president had promised to send French troops to Manbij.

On Friday however, the Office of the French President denied this, saying that “France is not planning any new military operation in northern Syria outside of the international anti-Daech coalition.”

In June 2016, the French Minister of Defence admitted that French special forces were deployed in Syria to advise the SDF on how to better fight the Islamic State organization, especially in Manbij. However, Paris has remained tight-lipped about the number and location of its military presence in Syria.

In July 2017, Anadolu news agency published a map of what it claimed were the locations of ten American military bases in the same zone, in reaction to US arms delivery to Kurdish Syrian fighters. At the time, it claimed that there were 75 French soldiers in the zone, many of them in a base near Racca. The Pentagon refused to comment on this information.

16,syria,"Moscow, Russia - On Sunday evening, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani arrived in Moscow for a short work visit. On Monday he is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the wars in Syria and Yemen and the situation in Palestine.

The work visit comes amid a massive evacuation of civilians and fighters from Eastern Ghouta near the Syrian capital Damascus after Russia negotiated with rebel groups to leave the area for opposition-controlled Idlib province.

According to Dmitriy Frolovsky, a Moscow-based analyst, Putin and Sheikh Tamim will discuss Russia's position on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Qatari support for the opposition, and the possible participation of Qatar in post-conflict reconstruction of Syria.

""There is going to be division of Syria and obviously the most powerful parties in Syria will be Russia and the United States. Qatar for various reasons will try to maintain stable contacts with both of the parties,"" Frolovsky said.

In late January, a Russian-sponsored peace conference in Sochi failed to bring together the Syrian regime and opposition for talks. Shortly after, forces loyal to Assad backed by Russian air support launched an operation against rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.

According to Frolovsky, after the regime takes full control of the Damascus suburbs another military operation against rebel-held Idlib province is likely.

Тhe Sheikh Tamim's visit was preceded by phone calls between Putin and Abu Dhabi Prince Mohammed bin Zayed in early March and Saudi King Salman in February. In October last year the Saudi king paid a three-day visit to Moscow.

""It's not only the [Gulf] crisis that boosted the relations [with Gulf countries] but also the general Russian presence in the region which has been augmenting since Putin took part in the Syrian crisis,"" Frolovsky said.

Russia has assumed a neutral stance on the Gulf crisis but it did offer to help Qatar with food shipments last year, he added.

A delegation of Qatari ministers of finance, foreign relations, energy, and culture, along with a number of other officials, accompanied Sheikh Tamim.

On the sidelines of official meetings, Qatar Petroleum and state-controlled Russian oil company Rosneft are expected to discuss possible contracts, and Qatar Airways will also sign a cooperation agreement with Rosaviatsia, Russia's federal air transport agency.

Five days before his visit to Moscow, Sheikh Tamim met Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Qatar where they discussed the possible export of Qatari liquified gas to Ukraine.

Since the fall out with Moscow over the annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbass region, Kiev has been trying to decrease its dependence on Russian oil and gas imports.

Sheikh Tamim's next foreign trip is expected to be in April to the United States where he will meet US President Donald Trump.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/qatari-emir-russia-discuss-syrian-crisis-180325195253621.html
17,syria,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's unexpected announcement on Thursday that the US would ""be coming out of Syria like very soon"" is raising concerns among some national security officials who warn that withdrawing now would not only undermine American credibility in the region but prompt a significant escalation to an already devastating conflict.

While Trump has often touted the gains made against ISIS since taking office, his latest comments caught much of his own administration off-guard -- including defense officials who have warned that now is not the time to withdraw from Syria.

""We're knocking the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon,"" Trump told supporters outside of Cleveland during a speech that was meant to focus on infrastructure."" Let the other people take care of it now.""

Several US defense officials have told CNN that the Pentagon has not heard any additional details from the White House since the President's remarks -- adding that the policy hasn't changed and that they are continuing to focus on their fight against ISIS.

One official said the assumption is the President has had a number of briefings saying ISIS is about to be defeated and that many assume Trump was just rhetorically taking it to the next step.

Any decision by Trump to pull out of Syria would also go against the current military assessment, a fact that left some national security officials concerned about the impact of a withdrawal, another senior administration official told CNN.

Who has the most to lose?

The US maintains about 2,000 US troops in Syria, and primarily backs the Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against ISIS, a group that is about 50% Arab and 50% Kurdish; however, much of the group's leadership is Kurdish.

The President's apparent desire to exit Syria as soon as possible is likely to raise concerns among US backed groups in the region, particularly the SDF, and could embolden the forces of the Syrian regime, Iran and Turkey, all of which have mostly resisted attacking US allies in Syria due to concerns about US retaliation.

""A lot of what keeps SDF in the field is the other forces can't touch them,"" according to David Adesnik, the director of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Without US support how well will they perform and if they find themselves in a weak position will they cut a deal with regime?""

Recently, the presence of US Forces deterred Russian mercenaries and regime forces from attempting to seize oil fields and other territory controlled by the SDF but without the presence of American troops there is nothing stopping those same forces from attacking again.

A similar dynamic exists in Manbij and At Tanf, where US Forces have deterred Turkish and regime forces from any large scale attacks.

The US is also helping SDF forces secure Syria's border with Iraq as ISIS still maintains a presence in the area but that job becomes much more difficult without American assistance.

A US withdraw could help ISIS

If the US were to withdraw, the de facto spheres of influence that have spared eastern Syria the same kind of fighting and bloodshed that the civil war has brought to the west would likely collapse, inviting a major escalation in the conflict.

That chaos could be exploited by ISIS which has already benefited from Turkey's actions in northern Syria.

Earlier this month, the US warned that ISIS has begun reconstituting in some areas of Syria because a Turkish military offensive against a northern city has pulled the US' Kurdish allies away from the fight against the terrorist group.

""We are very concerned about the effect fighting there has had on our defeat ISIS efforts and would like to see an end to the hostilities before ISIS has the opportunity to regroup in eastern Syria,"" said Pentagon spokesman US Army Col. Rob Manning, discussing the Turkish offensive against Afrin.

The State Department went a step farther, saying that ISIS has already begun to rebuild in places.

""The fighting in western Syria over the last two months, including in Afrin, has distracted from the defeat ISIS campaign and provided opportunity for ISIS to begin reconstituting in some areas,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said last week.

US officials have been warning for weeks that the Turkish military campaign against Kurdish forces in Afrin, launched January 20, could undermine the fight against ISIS, as Kurdish fighters helping the US battle the terrorist group began leaving to help their compatriots there. But the Turks see the US' Kurdish allies as terrorists and have strongly pushed back against US claims that their involvement has a negative impact on the campaign against ISIS.

""The claim that the operation conducted against terrorists in Afrin would endanger the combat against DAESH is completely groundless,"" said a statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry last week, using the Arabic name for ISIS. ""The approach that actually undermines the combat against terrorism in Syria is the use of one terrorist organization against another.""

In a January speech laying out the Trump administration's policy on Syria, then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would remain in Syria until the group is routed. ""The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge,"" Tillerson said at Stanford University. ""The fight against ISIS is not over.""

Russia, Iran and Turkey stand to benefit

The involvement of both US and Russian forces in Syria has complicated the conflict, leaving the countries conduct a delicate dance in order to avoid directly attacking one another.

That hasn't always worked, though.

Several Russians hired as paramilitary contractors to fight with pro-Assad forces were killed by US air strikes in February , according to friends and family of those killed. The US and Russia have maintained ""deconfliction"" communications channels to avoid direct combat, but the lines do not prevent all conflicts.

A US withdrawal would create a vacuum in the area, similar to what happened after soldiers left Iraq, and most foreign policy experts agree that void would likely be filled by Russia.

Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, told CNN on Friday that ""if the US were to withdraw, it seems to me the Russians would have a free hand"" in Syria and the forces ""fighting Assad would be weakened.""

""I do wonder if that is something the President thought about when he made that announcement,"" Stent said, noting that any departure would elevate Russia's status to make it ""the main power broker in that area.""

Additionally, Stent said, a US withdrawal would help Iran, a country whose forces are fighting alongside Russians in Syria.

If the US were to leave its base located at the At Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, Iran would be able to secure its overland route from Damascus to Tehran, further securing its regional influence.

Given Trump has routinely advocated for tougher policies on Iran, the US would be ""cutting off our nose to spite our face"" by withdrawing from Syria, Adesnik said.

Along with Russia, Iran and the Syrian regime could also benefit from the economic advantages of seizing oilfields currently controlled by US-backed allies.

The regime lost roughly 90% of its oil production when the civil war began, according to Adesnik.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/31/politics/us-withdraw-syria-trump/
18,syria,"Historically, sieges have been used to blockade a community, cutting off entrance routes, in order to lessen the resistance of the local population. Unlike many historical tactics, this one is still in active use: in Syria, the UN estimates that 2.9 million people in need live in communities that are either besieged or otherwise hard-to-reach (HTR). While there are signs that humanitarian conditions in these communities improved in 2017, these improvements often followed a spike in violence and critically low humanitarian conditions.

Since early 2016, REACH, in association with the Syria INGO Regional Forum (SIRF), has studied a selection of the besieged and HTR areas in Syria on a monthly basis. This project has served to provide humanitarian organisations with up-to-date monthly information (published as ‘REACH Community Profiles’) on the needs of the populations in the areas being studied, and on the barriers to movement to and from these areas.

During the assessment period, approximately 20 of the communities in this selection signed truce agreements, which meant that they reached deals with opposing parties on issues such as an end to the fighting, evacuations, and improving residents’ ability to travel between communities. REACH data shows that these communities largely benefited from improved humanitarian conditions in 2017. While slight improvements were also observed in the assessed communities without truce agreements in 2017, residents of truce communities generally lived in areas that afforded greater freedom of movement, while having significantly better access to basic services such as water, electricity and healthcare. However, in almost all cases, the truce agreements followed a period of increased violence and unprecedentedly low levels of access to basic goods and services, to the extent where resistance to an agreement was likely no longer bearable. Additionally, a number of communities that signed truces saw an increase in certain protection risks,such as conscription and detention, particularly for men.

These findings suggest that, while some improvements were observed in 2017, there is a continued need for humanitarian assistance in besieged and HTR communities in Syria, including those that have signed truce agreements. While truce agreements can go some way to lessen humanitarian needs, aid actors should be aware of the escalations that precede them, the pressures that residents face to sign, and the protection risks that can follow.",https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-truce-agreements-lead-humanitarian-improvements-besieged-and-hard
19,syria,"The conventional wisdom in Washington these days says that Secretary of Defense James Mattis is the one man who can save the nation from war. The new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is a hawk's hawk. And don't get the foreign policy establishment started on incoming National Security Adviser, John Bolton. President Donald Trump himself pines for military parades and asserts that torturing terrorists ""works.""

Like most conventional wisdom in the Trump era, however, this is all wrong -- for a number of reasons. But the first and most important one is Syria. Trump actually wants to cut and run from this tragic country. This is why there is no real strategy for the moment to counter the Russian-Iranian led campaign to unify the country for the dictator in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad. U.S. forces are in Syria only to destroy the Islamic State.

Trump made this point on Thursday at a rally in Ohio. ""We're knocking the hell out of ISIS, we'll be coming out of Syria very soon,"" the president told the crowd. ""Let the other people take care of it now.""

""Let the other people take care of it"" is a good summary of Barack Obama's approach to Syria. Consider this searing farewell statement from former diplomat Fred Hof as he prepares to leave his post as director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center this week. (Hof took on that post in 2012 after resigning from government to protest Obama's inactions on Syria.)

""President Obama would caricature external alternatives by creating and debating straw men: invented idiots calling for the invasion and occupation of Syria,"" he wrote. ""He would deal with internal dissent by taking officials through multi-step, worst-case, hypothetical scenarios of what might happen in the wake of any American attempt, no matter how modest, to complicate regime mass murder. The ‘logical’ result would inevitably involve something between World War III and an open-ended, treasury-draining American commitment.""

Hof concludes: ""He did not mean to do it, but Barack Obama’s performance in Syria produced global destabilization.""

This was the world Trump inherited in 2017. And despite his campaign rhetoric about the pointlessness of interventions, Trump did not just bug out. Instead he lifted restrictions on the rules of engagement for U.S. Special Forces fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and, in one of his administration's best moments, struck regime airfields after a nerve gas attack a year ago.

It's possible that Trump's promise to exit Syria is just bluster for the crowd. This was not a policy speech. It was a rally that focused mainly on building the border wall and immigration. Yet it's also possible Trump is finally taking control of the government, and we should expect policy to reflect his rhetoric in a way it has not up to now.

There are good strategic reasons to stop Assad from taking back the territory in Syria he has lost. It would deprive his patron, Iran, from a land bridge to the Mediterranean Sea. But the best reason to stop Assad is humanitarian. This butcher has killed enough. He should pay, if only to stop him from killing more and as a message to the other butchers watching.

This is where the conventional wisdom on Bolton and Trump's 'war mongers' collapses. The incoming national security adviser is no neoconservative. He does not believe in nation-building or using the U.S. military for humanitarian reasons. He is a cold-eyed realist who opposed President Bill Clinton's belated intervention in the Balkans. In his 2005 confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bolton said he didn't know if it would have been feasible for America to try to prevent the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Pompeo had a better record on humanitarian intervention when he was a member of Congress, but he also went along with a policy to end the feeble U.S. effort to fight the Assad regime. In July, when he was CIA director, Pompeo pulled the plug on the agency's program to support anti-regime rebels in Syria.

This leaves Mattis. He, too, is reluctant to use military force and was wary of getting involved in Syria in Obama's first term when we was the commander of U.S. Central Command. But Mattis is also a keen student of history. He understands the consequences of a hasty retreat from Syria, particularly if the alternative is a vacuum that could be exploited by the remnants of the Islamic State. This is particularly dicey at the moment now that Turkey has entered the war against America's allies, the Kurds.

No wonder Mattis signaled the U.S. would transition to stabilizing Syria in December, which undercuts the message Trump delivered in Ohio. While Mattis was not quite as keen on expanding the mission in Syria as outgoing National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster, he understood the folly of a hasty retreat from a war that Obama entered with half-measures and empty promises.

And that counts as an irony. The Washington establishment worries about Bolton and Pompeo for their bellicosity. It felt better when Trump was constrained by an axis of adults. And while that may have been true for the Iran nuclear deal, it is false when it comes to Syria. The grown-ups have urged Trump to give the war he inherited a chance. It's Trump who wants to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor.

Macron met Thursday with Syrian opposition forces in Paris. Afterward, a Kurdish leader at the meeting claimed that Macron had promised to send troops to Manbij near Syria’s border with Turkey. (Etienne Laurent/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)

PARIS — France denied claims of a military buildup against Turkish forces in Syria, scrambling Friday to calm tensions with NATO ally Turkey that threaten to further aggravate the Syria war.

French President Emmanuel Macron raised Turkey’s ire by meeting in Paris with Syrian rebels, including Kurdish fighters that Turkey considers terrorists. Worsening matters, Macron offered to mediate between them.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan angrily refused, accusing Macron on Friday of overstepping “his limits” and going “over his head.”

A French presidential official said the Turkish response was no surprise given the “sensitivities” around Kurdish separatist violence in Turkey.

Still, the official insisted that the Turkish offensive against opposition forces in northwest Syria “must stop.” The official argued that the operation is jeopardizing the broader U.S.-led military campaign against the Islamic State group.

After Macron’s meeting Thursday with members of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Kurdish figures claimed that the French leader had promised to send troops to Manbij near Syria’s border with Turkey.

The Kurdish-Arab town is under threat of a Turkish military operation that has already squeezed the rebels out of nearby towns. Turkey’s military argues Manbij is controlled by Syrian Kurdish militiamen it views as an extension of Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey.

The Kurdish claim raised fears that France was ready for a military conflict with Turkey, a fellow NATO member.

The French presidential official denied any plans to send ground troops — or launch any operation outside the coalition’s efforts against IS. He said Macron only offered renewed political support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, promising to “continue this fight together.”

The official said France is re-evaluating needs in the fight against IS but hasn’t received any requests so far from the U.S.-led coalition for reinforcements in the area.

France has led airstrikes on Syria as part of the anti-IS coalition and is believed to have special forces in Syria, but has not sent ground troops.

Macron’s office wouldn’t comment on the different interpretations of what happened at his meeting with the Syrian Democratic Forces.

In Turkey, Erdogan didn’t directly address the threat of French military action but insisted that “we don’t need a mediator” and warned Macron “don’t get into things that are out of your depth.”

“Those who go to bed with terrorists, or even host them in their palaces, will sooner or later understand the mistake they’re making,” Erdogan said in Ankara.

The Turkish leader said Macron made “bizarre” comments during a phone conversation last week that forced Erdogan to raise his voice and respond with a “high frequency.”

Macron’s office insisted it wants to maintain dialogue with Turkey.

Macron also pledged French support in maintaining security in Turkey, and reiterated France’s opposition to the Kurdish rebel group, PKK.

While U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. would be pulling out of Syria “very soon,” France insists that Islamic State extremists remain a threat to international security and wants the U.S. to stay until they are vanquished.

• In Syria, UNICEF has reached 305,600 people in 140 hard-to-reach locations with life-saving interventions and critical services and participated in an ICRC/UN Inter-Agency convoy to the besieged location in East Ghouta in February delivering supplies for about 9,000 people, and carrying-out rapid multi-sectoral needs assessments.

• UNICEF continues to face significant funding gaps (86% ) for WASH in Lebanon with minimum services in informal settlements covered only up to April 2018. Additional funding will be required to sustain the provision of safe water and quality sanitation services to the vulnerable populations.

• At the UNICEF-supported clinic at Jordan’s north-east border “Al Rukban”, 416 Syrian children (200 girls) under the age of five accessed health consultations, and 275 children and 446 pregnant and lactating women (PLW) were screened for malnutrition. One severe and three mod erate acute malnutrition cases among children and seven malnourished PLWs received treatment and Ready to Use Supplementary Food.

• In February, UNICEF continued its WASH support to over 68,600 Syrian refugees (29,529 children) in the eight Dahuk and Erbil refugee camps. This was achieved through more sustainable means of operation, mainly focusing on technical support through government partners.

• More than 188,400 refugee students in Turkey had access to safe and inclusive learning environments in over 300 temporary education centers in 21 provinces through financial support that was provided to cover essential maintenance costs (repair works and security upgrades, etc.).

• As of 14 March 2018, the UNICEF appeals for Syria and the Syrian Refugees are 40% and 42 % funded respectively, this includes funds carried-forward from the previous year. UNICEF’s response to Syrian refugees in Iraq is most underfunded (83%), followed by Jordan (70%) and Egypt (65%). Sustained and timely donor funding remains critical to help UNICEF and its partners reach vulnerable children with essential services and supplies.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs: On 24 February, the Security Council unanimously adopted UNSCR 2401 to demand (i) a cessation of hostilities (CoH) without delay across Syria for at least 30 days, (ii) immediate deployment of weekly convoys following the CoH, (iii) immediate medical evacuations, and (iv) the lifting of all sieges. There is an exception for military operations against UN listed terrorist groups and their affiliates. Despite the resolution, military activity in some parts of the country continued to impact the civilian population throughout the month, resulting in civilian deaths, injuries and displacement, as well as causing damage to civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools, and affecting the ability of United Nations agencies and their partners to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance. Persistent clashes between Syrian Government forces and non-State armed opposition groups, with the involvement of foreign militias and foreign government forces as well as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), contributed to significant re-escalation of hostilities in locations such as Rural Damascus, Idlib, and Deir-Ez-Zor. With the recent escalation of conflict in East Ghouta, children are the most vulnerable group who are paying the highest price with a collapsing health system, education services limited to shelters, movement outside shelters very limited and the shelters themselves neither equipped nor spacious. All of these factors are depriving children in East Ghouta from having any sense of normalcy due to the deprivation of access to basic living standards. Turkish forces, along with Syrian non-State armed opposition groups affiliated with the Turkish Euphrates Shield operation, continued the military operation “Olive Branch” against the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) in Afrin, Aleppo governorate. Turkish artillery shelling and airstrikes continued to hit areas near the borders with Turkey, in addition to other areas held by the YPG. There have been allegations of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as of displacement. Local authorities are also reportedly restricting movement, with civilians not allowed to exit the district at check points. Some 5,000 people have, however, been registered as displaced elsewhere into Aleppo governorate since 20 January.

More than 20,000 civilians reportedly returned to Ar-Raqqa city in February, although the city is not yet safe for civilian returns as the city is littered by a complex array of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnances, landmines and improvised explosive devices that pose a direct risk to civilians as well as humanitarian and reconstruction workers.4 The systematic assessment, marking and subsequent removal of such explosive hazards is a pre-condition to enable the safe return of civilians, as well as safe delivery of humanitarian aid. Health actors are now seeing an average of around 25-30 blast-related civilian injuries and deaths per week. This number has reduced from 50 per week in late 2017. The number of child victims, especially boys, is however increasing as more families move back.",https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/unicef-syria-crisis-situation-report-february-2018-humanitarian-results
22,syria,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants the U.S. military to maintain a presence in Syria, despite President Donald Trump’s declaration that American forces will be pulled from the war-torn country in the near future.

“We believe American troops should stay for at least the mid-term, if not the long-term,” he told TIME Thursday in a wide-ranging interview.

Bin Salman, a 32-year old who last year disrupted the line of succession when he became next in line for the Saudi throne, has emerged as the most powerful Saudi ruler in decades. In addition to being selected as the crown prince, he serves as First Deputy Prime Minister, President of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs, and Minister of Defense.

Bin Salman, who is midway through a multi-city tour in the United States, said the American troop presence inside Syria is the last effort stopping Iran, Saudi Arabia’s arch-enemy, from continuing to expand influence with regional allies. U.S. forces inside the country also allow Washington to have a say in Syria’s future, he said.

Iran, through proxy militias and regional allies, will establish a overland supply route that leads from Beirut through Syria and Iraq to Tehran, Bin Salman said. The so-called “Shiite Crescent” would give Iran a greater foothold in a tumultuous region through a string of allies.

The U.S. maintains a remote base at Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, in the middle of that corridor. It’s there that Special Operations forces coordinate with Syrian opposition fighters to wipe out the remaining ISIS fighters holed up in a series of towns along the Euphrates River and a stretch of desert straddling the Iraq-Syria border.

“If you take those troops out from east Syria, you will lose that checkpoint,” bin Salman said. “And this corridor could create a lot of things in the region.”

Bin Salman is the architect of the three-year old conflict in Yemen, pitting Saudi-backed forces against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The war has plunged the Arab world’s poorest nation into a humanitarian crisis which is worsened daily by famine, widespread disease and the deaths of civilians caught in the crossfire.

The Saudi leader made his remarks on Syria just hours after Trump told a cheering crowd in Richfield, Ohio that U.S. troops will soon be pulled out. “By the way, we’re knocking the hell out of ISIS,” Trump said. “We’re coming out of Syria very soon. Let the other people take care of it now, very soon. Very soon, we’re coming out.”

Trump’s comments were a departure from the previously stated positions of senior Pentagon and State Department officials, who have said the U.S. will keep troops inside the country to stamp out the last remaining fighters and prevent a new group from forming. An American service member was killed in Syria Thursday by an improvised explosive device, U.S. officials said Friday. A total of 14 U.S. troops have been killed fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria since the operation began nearly four years ago.

There are currently about 2,000 U.S. troops working with Syrian Democratic Forces to re-capture territory from ISIS, which includes the militants’ self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa. ISIS is on the verge of defeat as a conventional military force. Although they no longer are in control of any major city in Iraq or Syria, the fighting is not over completely. But American forces are not inside the country to act as a counterweight to Iran, despite bin Salman’s wishes.

Trump’s recent appointment of John Bolton, who has been an outspoken critic of Iran’s regional dominance, as National Security Adviser may re-shape American foreign policy toward Tehran.

Backed by Iranian military aid and Russian airpower, Syrian President Bashar Assad has nearly defeated the Islamist-dominated rebel groups spawned in the chaos of Syria’s 2011 revolution. The insurgents still hold scraps of territory, but they have no hope of challenging Assad’s hold on power. As a result, Iran has extended its influence and reach inside Syria.

Bin Salman said Assad is not likely to be ousted from power. He said he hopes that Assad will not become a “puppet” for Tehran.

“Bashar is staying,” he said. “But I believe that Bashar’s interests is not to let the Iranians do whatever they want they want to do.”",http://time.com/5222746/saudi-crown-prince-donald-trump-syria/

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected France's offer to mediate in northern Syria, saying he is ""saddened"" by its position.

""We have no need for mediation,"" he said. ""We are extremely saddened by France's... wrong stance on this.""

Turkey is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

In a speech in Ankara, Mr Erdogan rebutted France's call for dialogue.

""Since when has Turkey been sitting down at the table with terror organisations?"" he said. ""You can sit down at the table with terror organisations but Turkey will continue its fight against terror.""

France says the YPG has no direct organisational links to the PKK, which Turkey says is a terror group.

Earlier on Friday, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan said countries should take a ""clear stance against all types of terrorism"".

""We reject any efforts to promote 'dialogue', 'contact' or 'mediation' between Turkey and those terrorist organisations,"" the spokesman said.

What's behind the French offer?

President Emmanuel Macron had met members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including the YPG and expressed hopes for dialogue between Turkey and the militia.

His office said he had ""paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role"" of the SDF in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group.

The SDF is a key US ally in the fight against IS and the Kurdish YPG forms a core part of it.

France and the US have given the militia weapons and training to support its battle against IS.

The president said France would support the ""stabilisation"" of the security zone in north-east Syria to stop IS regaining strength.

Kurdish officials said Mr Macron had committed himself to sending more troops to the area but Paris declined to comment on that.

France has suffered a series of deadly terror attacks claimed by IS in recent years, including the Paris attacks which killed 130 people in 2015.

A week ago an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, including a police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage.

How dangerous is the conflict in northern Syria?

Earlier this month Turkey ousted Kurdish fighters from the Syrian-Kurdish city of Afrin. Activists said 280 civilians had been killed, although this was denied by Ankara.

As many as a quarter of a million civilians are said to have fled the city.

Turkey has since threatened to attack the SDF-controlled town of Manbij, which was taken from IS in 2016 - and where the US has stationed troops.

The Turkish national security council issued an ultimatum on Wednesday, saying it would act if Kurdish fighters did not leave immediately.

Elsewhere in Syria, Turkey said five soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by the PKK in the south-eastern province of Siirt.

The attack, the deadliest by the PKK for months, is likely to be in revenge for Turkey's offensive in northern Syria, BBC Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports.",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43595891
25,syria,"Syrian President Bashar al Assad's regime forces have continued to try to retake Eastern Ghouta, an area home to almost 400,000 people that has escaped government control since 2012.

The suburb located 15 kilometres east of Damascus has been besieged by intense bombardment almost ever since and is controlled by mostly Islamist and jihadist groups.

So far the assault has killed more than 700 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group.

The bombardment was widely considered to be preparation for a government ground assault to retake an area which lies within mortar range of central Damascus. Pro-government forces have now seized about a third of the enclave.

On February 18, 2018, Syrian regime forces intensified their bombardment of Eastern Ghouta.



Here are a few days of the assault as seen by Abdulmonam Eassa, a local photographer for AFP whose images have detailed the conflict.

Strikes on Eastern Ghouta leave at least 127 dead.

A strike hits very close today. I go to take a look. The whole area seems to have been burned. During the first few seconds, you think no one is dead, you just see ashes and destruction. That's because people hide as soon as they hear the sound of a rocket or a plane. But after a few seconds you see signs of life.

I see a woman coming out from a destroyed building with four children. They are screaming. One of the kids is carrying a notepad or a book, maybe a Koran, I can't remember.

The Syria Civil Defence volunteers known as the ""White Helmets"" arrive and begin to dig through the rubble. I see one of them carrying an infant. I am shocked that someone so young has been hurt.

I keep taking pictures and look at the back of my camera to see how they came out. Suddenly I see one my brothers-in-law staring at me from one of the images. He is standing next to a door of a building, screaming for help. He is injured. I didn't even realise it was him when I was shooting the scene, only after, when I quickly checked the photos. What should I do? Should I help him or continue to take pictures? It's a question that I constantly ask myself.

I'm about to leave when I see a White Helmet carrying a child. I realise it's the son of a friend. I hurry and take him and rush to the hospital. The boy holds on tight to me, he doesn't want to let me go. When we get inside, I want to take a picture of him, but he doesn't want to let go of my hand. I manage to free my hand, but he keeps holding his hand towards me. I can feel myself crying.

I leave a half hour later, heading home, which is about 700 meters away. After about 200 meters, I see that the area where I live has been shelled. I suddenly panic. My family lives there! What if one of them is dead?!

It's a friend of mine. He has a head injury. He is dead. But we have to just leave his body there because there are wounded children and they have to be taken to the hospital.

I hurry along and see that the building where my sisters and other relatives live has been hit. It's covered in dust and I can't see anything. Fear spreads through me as I get closer. I leave my motorbike in the middle of the street and run into our house. I see one of my brothers. ""Is Mum ok?"" I ask. ""Yes,"" he answers. ""Is everyone else all right?"" ""Yes,"" he says. I am about to breathe a sigh of relief when I catch a figure lying on the ground out of the corner of my eye. It's a friend of mine. He has a head injury. He is dead. But we have to just leave his body there because there are wounded children and they have to be taken to the hospital. I can't take pictures of scenes like this.

I take a look at the other side of the street. I see a woman wearing a prayer outfit. Her face is bleeding. I suddenly realise that it's one of my sisters. Two other female relatives are standing next to her, also injured. I try to calm my sister down. She has no shoes, so I want to carry her, but she tells me not to worry, she will walk barefoot. I take her and the others to the hospital, then drop off my mother and other siblings in Daraya. Then I go back to take a look at our house.

AAP

The doors and windows are completely smashed. I take a look around and realise that I no longer care about death. There is a plane in the sky again, a strike can come at any moment, but I am not scared. I have been hurt to the point where I can hurt no more.

My family spends the night in another house. No one really sleeps. As I record these words, I can hear planes in the sky. The building is shaking. Thoughts keep shooting through my mind. What if my loved ones die and I live? How will I bear the pain? I leave.

Tuesday, February 20

The attacks on Eastern Ghouta kill at least 128 civilians, including 29 children. Another hospital, Arbin, has been taken out of action.

The UN children's agency UNICEF issues a blank statement. ""No words will do justice to the children killed, their mothers, their fathers and their loved ones,"" it says.

I go to the hospital because I know the situation there is terrible. No one has eaten for a day. I walk into one room, it's full of dead bodies. Some died yesterday, some died before that, but haven't been buried yet.

I manage to sleep for a few hours at the hospital. I know in a few hours it's going to be the same routine - planes, strikes, barrel bombs, wounded civilians, horror, recognising loved ones wounded or dead. But I am still strong. I can still go out and take pictures. I don't know how... But I can.

Wednesday, February 21

UN chief Antonio Guterres describes what's happening in Eastern Ghouta as ""hell on earth."" Barrel bombs are dropped on the area.

We go into the Saqba neighbourhood after a barrel bomb strike. A woman and her children are crying. A man is stuck between two walls of a destroyed building. While we're here, a second barrel bomb hits, two streets away. I can't focus. It feels like there is a huge cloud above my head...

After a while, I head back to my neighbourhood. A Russian plane had hit it. People are screaming. People don't know how to deal with a situation like this. I know a little because I follow death and destruction for my work. I get closer to a building. A boy and a girl are stuck between two walls of a collapsed building. I see their legs dangling. I inspect the area to make sure it's safe. Then I pull out the boy. Then the girl.

I climb to the rooftop to get a better view. Everything is burning. It seems like everywhere was shelled - Saqba, Misraba, Douma, Kafr Batna... it seems like the whole area is burning.

My neighbours scream that there are more children under the rubble. I put away my camera and head to where they're pointing. Sometimes I take pictures and sometimes I help pull people out. I don't have a set formula for when I do what. I just go with my gut. The Civil Defence volunteers say there is one child still stuck, but we find a child and a father. The father has suffocated to death, the child has survived.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls for an end to ""massacre"" in Syria. The UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution on a ceasefire over objections from Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been helping him militarily.

I wake up at 6:00 am. It's quiet. There is destruction everywhere. People start to emerge, to check the damage and to try to get some food. A half hour later there is that dreaded sound - a plane in the sky. It starts shelling. People run back to their shelters. It's been four days now that the bombing hasn’t stopped. Everyone is scared.

Later I see White Helmets giving first aid to a man. ""Where is my bag of flour?! I need it!"" he keeps crying. Seems he was wounded getting food.

There are many people missing. Everyone seems to be searching for their relatives. Some are dead, some are just hiding, but communication is hard.

I don't have any electricity. I worry about being able to recharge my cameras and my computer. I need them, I can't work without them.

AAP

The number of dead has now risen to more than 300. Hospitals can't count the number of dead and injured. Some people are still stuck under the rubble. The Civil Defence volunteers are trying their best, but they just can't reach some areas because of the bombardment. The situation is so bad. God help us.

It's 3:00 pm as I record this and the planes haven't stopped the bombing. Not one area has been spared. The White Helmets are really struggling. Many of their vehicles are damaged. It's very difficult.

The UN Security Council postpones a vote on a truce in Eastern Ghouta.

People are cowering in shelters. Everyone is in shock. We can't understand anything. Everything is out of service. I can't believe the difference four days of bombardment has made. The whole area has been changed, erased. The streets aren't there anymore. They're full of dust, rubble. Only ambulances use them.

Maybe crying doesn't help, but today I cry. I can't say anything else. Please, someone stop the carnage. Please, someone has to stop what is happening here!

But life goes on. Today we take out four children from underneath a fully destroyed building. The things that I have witnessed here, I will never forget. If I remain alive.

The things that I have witnessed here, I will never forget. If I remain alive.

On Saturday, February 24, the UN Security Council approved a ceasefire resolution, which called for a ceasefire ""without delay"" to allow aid into the area. But air strikes continued and claimed more lives. On February 26 the regime carried out more bombings, in spite of the UN-agreed truce.

Frustrated, the UN and European Union demanded the immediate implementation of the ceasefire.

Moscow then announced President Vladimir Putin had ordered a daily five-hour ""humanitarian pause"" from February 27 and the opening of protected corridors to allow people to leave. The first pause took effect the next day but no civilians have since left. The Syrian regime continued to pound the area and by Monday had seized control of a third of the enclave.",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/syria-crisis-eastern-ghouta-through-a-photographer-s-lense
