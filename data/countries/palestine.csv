0,palestine,"At least six people have been killed by an explosion in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the Hamas-administered territory.

At least three others were wounded by Saturday's blast, the cause of which remains unclear, the ministry said.

The explosion took place in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian WAFA news agency reported.

Hamas' military wing has said Israel is responsible for the explosion, which it said took place during a ""complex security and intelligence operation"", AFP news agency reported.

Israeli officials have denied the allegation.

""The Israel Defence Force (IDF) is not involved in this incident in any way,"" a spokesperson for the Israeli military said.

Saturday's blast follows weeks of protests along the Israeli-Gaza border as part of the Great March of Return movement.

The rallies are set to culminate on May 15 to mark what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or catastrophe, a reference to Israel's establishment in 1948, when 750,000 Arabs were forcibly removed from Palestine.

Since the protests began on March 30, at least 41 Palestinians in the coastal enclave have been killed by Israeli forces and more than 7,000 wounded.",Six killed by Gaza Strip blast: Palestinian Ministry of Health,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/killed-gaza-strip-blast-palestinian-ministry-health-180505173602055.html
1,palestine,"“Such statements are unacceptable, deeply disturbing and do not serve the interests of the Palestinian people or peace in the Middle East,” said Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, in a statement on Wednesday.

“Leaders have an obligation to confront anti-Semitism everywhere and always, not perpetuate the conspiracy theories that fuel it,” Mr. Mladenov added.

“Apparently the Holocaust-denier is still a Holocaust-denier,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said, apparently referring to Mr. Abbas’s doctoral dissertation, in which he challenged the number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust and argued that Zionists had collaborated with Nazis to propel more people to what would become Israel — a theme Mr. Abbas alluded to again on Monday.

Jason D. Greenblatt, the White House’s Middle East envoy, wrote on Twitter: “President Abbas’ remarks yesterday in Ramallah at the opening of the Palestinian National Congress must be unconditionally condemned by all. They are very unfortunate, very distressing & terribly disheartening. Peace cannot be built on this kind of foundation.”

David M. Friedman, the United States ambassador to Israel, said Mr. Abbas had “reached a new low,” adding, “To all those who think Israel is the reason that we don’t have peace, think again.”

Mr. Abbas is presiding over the first regular meeting of the Palestine National Council in 22 years. It may well be his last. (The council convened for a more limited, “extraordinary” session in 2009 to replace six members of its 18-member executive committee who had died in the meantime.)

On the eve of the four-day gathering of about 700 council delegates in Ramallah, an Abbas adviser promoted it as a historic meeting dedicated to Palestinian unity, democracy and setting strategy for the coming months and years.

It seemed to have started out as anything but that.

Instead, it was taking place with a deeply splintered Palestinian leadership that has turned away from Washington because of President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and is largely disconnected from its own public. A March opinion poll found that 68 percent of Palestinians want Mr. Abbas to resign from office.

The Palestinian Authority has looked on while its archrival, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, has seized the popular initiative and focused international attention on the isolated and impoverished coastal enclave with its promotion of the so-called Great Return March. More than 40 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds have been wounded, many shot in the legs, by Israeli snipers over the past month during partly peaceful, partly violent protests along the Gaza border.

Mr. Abbas has long advocated nonviolent popular resistance against the Israeli occupation but is also wary of protests, fearing they could spiral out of control and be detrimental to the cause, or even turn against him, according to experts.

So he has found himself in the awkward position of trying to both pay lip service to, and dampen the enthusiasm for, the Gaza protests. In his speech he warned the children of Gaza to stay away from the border fence because “I do not want a disabled generation.”

Yet the weeks ahead could prove explosive. The United States is scheduled to open its embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, the 70th anniversary of Israel’s foundation, in a move that has infuriated the Palestinians. The Great Return March is expected to peak on May 15, when Palestinians mark the 70th anniversary of what they call the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” of the 1948 war when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians left or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel.

The Israeli military is bracing for a potential mass breach of its border fence with Gaza. The possible fallout in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, coinciding with the start of the holy month of Ramadan, is unpredictable.

Mr. Abbas has, in the meantime, ruled out an American monopoly over brokering Israeli-Palestinian negotiations because of the embassy move, and he has already rejected Mr. Trump’s long-awaited peace plan before it has been presented, expecting less favorable terms than have been offered in the past.

Aging and increasingly frail — Palestinian officials say an ambulance is now part of the president’s traveling detail — Mr. Abbas has offered few inspiring alternatives and a succession battle is already underway.

“It certainly feels like a very low point for the Palestinian national movement,” said Nathan Thrall, director of the International Crisis Group’s Israeli-Palestinian project. “Fragmentation and weakness,” he said, “just pervades the entire meeting.”

Mr. Abbas’s speech, Mr. Thrall said, was “just a simple reflection of an embittered leader at the end of his tenure whose life project has come to failure.”

At the same time, Mr. Thrall said, appearing defiant and having the United States condemn him will not harm Mr. Abbas domestically.

The Palestine National Council had not convened for years because many Palestinians wanted to wait for a genuine reconciliation between Mr. Abbas’s Fatah party and Hamas, which would have granted Hamas substantial representation in the P.L.O. Those efforts have also failed.

Aides to Mr. Abbas said it was necessary to meet now nevertheless, to replace 103 members of the roughly 700-member council, including more than 80 who have died.

The last regular meeting took place in 1996 in Gaza, during what were considered the “good years” of the Oslo peace process, which was meant to lead to a permanent peace settlement by the end of the 20th century.

Since then Mr. Abbas has lost much of the traditional support of many Arab states and has been facing increasingly right-wing Israeli governments that are unwilling to make concessions.

At an international conference organized by the P.L.O. on the eve of the council meeting, Palestinian officials and experts spoke gloomily to a half-empty hall in a Ramallah hotel about what went wrong and bemoaned the fate of the moribund organization.

“Instead of blaming the major powers we should blame ourselves,” said Asad Abdul Rahman, a Jordan-based delegate. After the Oslo accords, he said, “We neglected the P.L.O. and started focusing on the Palestinian Authority, and unfortunately we lost our bridges and contacts with the world.”

Muhammad Shtayyeh, a senior Palestinian official, recounted the P.L.O.’s journey from armed struggle to negotiations and, more recently, to an effort to internationalize the Palestinian struggle by turning to the United Nations and other bodies.

2,palestine,"Natalie Portman, one of the most famous Jewish celebrities on the planet, just announced she was boycotting a major Israeli event.

Portman was scheduled to travel to Jerusalem to receive the Genesis Prize, a prominent award sometimes referred to as the “Jewish Nobel.” On Friday, she abruptly canceled her visit, writing that she “did not want to appear as endorsing [Israeli Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu” in an Instagram post explaining her decision. It’s not yet clear what’s happening to the $2 million in prize money that comes with the award.

Celebrities deciding to avoid Israel on political grounds is not all that uncommon. Hollywood is left-leaning, and many celebrities are outspokenly pro-Palestinian. Netanyahu’s government is one of the furthest right in Israeli history, particularly when it comes to the conflict with the Palestinians. Tensions are to be expected.

But Portman is an altogether different case. She is an Israeli citizen, born in Jerusalem, though she was raised in America and currently lives in France. In the past, Portman has been an outspoken advocate of Israel — as an undergraduate at Harvard, she worked on a prominent book defending the Jewish state against its critics. She speaks fluent Hebrew; in 2015, she wrote, directed, and starred in a Hebrew-language adaptation of Israeli author Amos Oz’s memoir.

So Natalie Portman turning down a visit to Israel in protest is not business as usual, and Israeli politicians are not treating it as such. Oren Hazan, a member of Israel’s parliament from Netanyahu’s Likud Party, called for Portman’s Israeli citizenship to be stripped. A member of the cabinet, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said her decision “has elements of anti-Semitism.”

This is not a marginal controversy, some kind of celebrity sideshow. It is a leading indicator of the rising tensions between liberal American Jewry and the increasingly right-wing Israeli government. Portman is the canary in the coal mine, warning Israel that its policies on the Palestinians and African migrants are putting it increasingly at odds with its most natural friends abroad.

Why Natalie Portman is skipping Israel’s version of the Nobel Prize

The reason for Portman’s decision is more nuanced than it appeared at first blush.

The Genesis Prize, in its own statement, said “recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing to her,” adding that “she does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel.” This was widely interpreted as a reference to the crisis on the boundary between Israel and the Palestinian-populated Gaza Strip, in which Israeli troops have shot a number of Palestinians during occasionally violent demonstrations near a border fence.

If Portman were boycotting Israel entirely over Gaza, it would be a stunning development. It would suggest that she, one of a relatively few celebrities to have prominently defended Israel in the past, was supporting the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. She would have, in effect, been signing up to serve as a prominent advocate for the international Palestinian cause.

But Portman’s Instagram statement, which came after the Genesis Prize comment, gives a somewhat more subtle explanation. First, she explicitly denied that she was a BDS advocate; she was only skipping this event because Netanyahu was also scheduled to speak at it. “Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation,” she writes.

Second, her statement of grievance with Netanyahu’s government seemed to be at least in part about refugee policy. There are currently about 40,000 undocumented migrants, mostly African asylum seekers, in Israel. Netanyahu’s government backed off initial plans to deport them, but in early April reneged on an agreement with the United Nations that would give them permanent status in Israel, leaving the refugees in limbo. Portman’s statement seemed to imply that this was the “recent event” that had so upset her.

“Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust,” she writes. “But the mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values.”

However, focusing on the past month or so of Israeli political developments somewhat misses the point. Portman has long been a critic of Netanyahu’s government; after his 2015 reelection, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she was “very, very upset and disappointed,” blasting him for “racist” comments about Arab voters during the campaign.

Indeed, her statement contained a largely overlooked line — “because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power” — suggesting that this is about more than just current events, but rather broader concerns Portman has with the Netanyahu government. This is less about a boycott of the Israeli state writ large, and more an American Jew and Israeli citizen expressing her concern with the state’s current leadership.

That, however, is still a big deal. Very few Jews, Israeli or diaspora, support a wholesale boycott of Israel. But views on Netanyahu’s government, specifically, are far more mixed. The fact that Portman is framing her criticism as coming from a place of affection for the Jewish state, not hostility, makes it more likely that other Jews — especially Americans — will take it seriously.

“This is an important symbolic moment,” says Jeremy Pressman, a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Connecticut. “She cannot just be written off as a BDS supporter.”

Natalie Portman points to a growing divide between Israel and American Jews

If this were just one person taking a one-time stand, it wouldn’t be all that noteworthy. But Portman’s stand against the Netanyahu government points to much broader and deeper divides emerging between Israel and American Jews.

On one level, the divide between Israeli and American Jews couldn’t be simpler: Israeli Jews are, on the whole, more conservative than their American peers. Forty-nine percent of American Jews identify as liberal, per Pew data; only 8 percent of Israeli Jews say the same. Nearly twice as many Israeli Jews (37 percent) as American Jews (19 percent) described themselves as politically conservative in Pew’s survey.

This owes to profoundly different historical experiences. American Jewish identity comes from “a sense of exclusion from American society,” Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, told me. Israel has a long and robust socialist political tradition but has tilted sharply rightward after the 1990s peace process collapsed into the violence of the Second Intifada and a 2005 military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip ended up with a takeover of the territory by the Islamist group Hamas.

In every presidential election in recent memory, a majority of American Jews have voted for the Democratic candidate. Israel’s center-left Labour Party has not won an election since 1999.

The result is a slow but steady sense of alienation of American Jews from the Israeli political system. A growing number of American Jews look at Israel and see a country that is occupying Palestinian territory and breaking up peaceful Palestinian protests using force and a Jewish state that only recognizes one socially conservative strand of Jewry, Orthodox Judaism, as legitimate — which manifests in things like preventing liberal American Jews from praying in mixed gender groups at the Western Wall, the holiest prayer site in Judaism.

The Pew data shows a clear age gap here: Younger American Jews are, overwhelmingly, more skeptical about Israel’s political direction than their older peers. Five times as many American Jews between the ages of 18 and 29 think the United States is “too supportive” of Israel as those over the age of 65. Only a third of Jews between the ages of 18 and 49 believe Israel’s government is making a sincere attempt at peace with the Palestinians; the number is 10 points higher among Jews ages 50 and up.

Natalie Portman, age 36, is one of the most prominent members of the younger cohort of American Jews. Her decision to cancel the speech serves not only as an example of tensions between liberal America and conservative Israel boiling over, but actually stokes the conflict: She is serving as a role model, a Jew and Zionist in good standing who’s willing to take a vocal stand against the Israeli government.

This is why prominent Israeli politicians — who are, notably, right-wing — have called for her citizenship to be stripped, or tried to marginalize her as somehow anti-Semitic. They worry, not without cause, that she’s a harbinger of future conflict between Israel and its most important international ally.

Now, there have always been tensions between Israel and diaspora Jewry. Every community has internal issues. But the ideological divide, particularly with respect to the Palestinians and the synagogue-state divide, has never been sharper. Brent Sasley, a political scientist at the University of Texas Arlington, tells me this an example of “the harmful global effects of the rise of the neo-nationalist/religious right in Israel” on Israel’s relationship with the diaspora — and it’s hard to argue with him.

So long as Israel continues its rightward drift, incidents like this will almost certainly become more and more common.",How Natalie Portman became the latest Israel-Palestine flashpoint,https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/23/17270180/natalie-portman-israel-boycott
3,palestine,"Around 80% of the 32 Palestinians killed by the IDF during the ongoing Gaza border crisis were terrorist operatives or identified with terrorist organizations, an intelligence report asserts.



The report by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center said that 26 of the 32 Palestinians fit into those categories.





Nine of the dead Palestinians were part of military terrorist cells and four were part of Gazan security services, according to the report. The other 17 identified as connected with terrorist groups were so identified based on public statements made by various terrorist groups taking credit for the loyalties or activities of those individuals, the report said.The remaining six slain Palestinians were not mentioned by any terrorist groups and are presumed to have been civilians.The Meir Amit Center, located near Glilot, north of Tel Aviv, is viewed as unusually credible because it has ongoing connections to current military intelligence and is filled with top former Israeli intelligence officials.According to the report, five of the dead were part of Hamas’s Izzadin Kassam military wing, while four were part of security services controlled by Hamas. Hamas took credit for the loyalties and actions of another seven of the dead and their bodies were wrapped in Hamas flags.One of the dead was identified as being connected to Islamic Jihad’s military wing. Two of the dead were identified as operatives of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine – one as a military operative and one as a leader of the group in the Nuseirat refugee camp. One of the dead was identified with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.Six of the dead were both members of Fatah and involved in violent or provocative activities as part of the border standoff, according to the report and Meir Amit center director Reuven Ehrlich. Two were identified as operatives of the Aqsa Brigades, Fatah’s military wing. Four more were identified as members of Fatah when Fatah took credit for the connection and wrapped their bodies in Fatah flags.THE HIGH PROPORTION of persons identified with terrorist groups at the front showed that the protests and clashes are being orchestrated mostly by those groups and not by civilian leaders, the report said.According to the center, many of the dead were not merely celebrated by terrorist groups, but the terrorist groups published photos of them armed and in military clothing.Some of those killed were identified as being shot while trying to breach the border fence, during IDF attacks on Hamas lookout positions, and one, who was armed with a Kalashnikov and explosives, was shot by an IDF aerial vehicle.Slain photo journalist Yasir Murtaja was listed among those affiliated with terrorists, with the report repeating allegations about his holding the equivalent rank of captain, his past uses of drones to collect intelligence about IDF positions, and ongoing involvement with Hamas security services.All 32 of the dead except for two were men between the ages of 19 and 45 and none of them was among the original civilian protest organizers who were pushed aside by Hamas, Ehrlich told The Jerusalem Post.Ehrlich emphasized that this disproved accusations that Israel is targeting women and children and civilians generally.Two of the dead were minors with estimated ages of 14-16. While one of them was said to be part of Hamas’s student group, it was unclear under what circumstances they were killed and what justifications might be put forth.The report did acknowledge that regarding one of the dead, the family has disputed the IDF’s characterization of him as being connected to a terrorist group.Regarding a few of the dead, the report had more uncertain language, saying “it appears” that the individual was connected to a particular terrorist group. Some of these more borderline cases may account for the report identifying 80% of the dead as being connected with Hamas when an earlier report by the center said the percentage was at least as high as 60% (though that report said more research needed to be done). There have been situations in the past were terrorist groups have tried to claim “martyrs” as their operatives where that connection was debatable.The report added that there might be two additional dead Palestinians, but that details about those cases were still vague.",Report: 80% of Palestinians killed in Gaza border crisis were 'terrorists',https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-80-percent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Gaza-border-crisis-were-terrorists-549511
4,palestine,"The first US museum to be dedicated to Palestinian art has opened in Woodbridge, Connecticut

Connecticut has welcomed the nation’s first Palestinian art museum on Litchfield Turnpike. The 371-square-metre space, which occupies the ground floor of an office building, is the initiative of Faisal Saleh, a Palestinian entrepreneur. Motivated by a desire to celebrate Palestine’s cultural heritage and contemporary production, Palestine Museum US was conceptualised only in June 2017. It is also a reaction to the growing needs of US-based Palestinians for a space to exhibit their works without repercussions, exemplified by the Made in Palestine exhibition in 2003 at Station Museum of Contemporary Art which was met by controversy as US political figures claimed it glorified terrorism.

Aiming to function as a collecting institution with permanent and rotating apolitical shows, it currently features a programme of exhibitions to celebrate Palestinian heritage that span historical through to contemporary works. Initial highlights include the current show, which opened on 22 April, featuring 20 artists who currently reside in the West Bank, such as Ayed Arafah, Samia Halaby, Mohamed Saleh Khalil and Malak Mattar.

Though Palestine Museum US just opened, Saleh already plans to relocate the currently self-funded museum to a larger city and venue once financial backers are secured. In the meanwhile, it invites the public to learn about Palestinian art first hand and bring it to the fore. “The Palestinians are our first audience,” said Saleh to Palestine in America. “Whether they are in the US, or in Palestine, or in the diaspora, we want the Palestinians to have a place that they feel is their own, and that they can be proud of, and they can see it as a Palestinian institution that is excelling at showcasing the Palestinian arts.”

6,palestine,"Nobody is optimistic about what may happen in the region in the event U.S. President Donald Trump decides to withdraw from the “Iran Nuclear Deal” on May 12. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claims that Iran’s nuclear weapons plan is ongoing is considered mise en scène. However, Trump, his new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton appear to back Netanyahu’s claims. Bolton was the strongest advocate of the “chemical weapon” claim that was used as a guise for invading Iraq. It is also no secret that back then, Bolton was working in coordination with the Israeli government. Bolton, who was an anti-Iran hawk then, is now one of the highest-level names determining U.S. national security policy. The Americans, who are in favor of continuing the deal, are responding to Netanyahu’s provocative statements by saying, “The same thing happened before,” in reference to the invasion of Iraq.

Contrary to Netanyahu, who is in a tight corner because of the corruption investigation against him, the number of those in Israel who are worried Trump may break the deal is not to be taken lightly. Former Israeli Atomic Energy Commission Director Uzi Eilam said in his article in Maariv, “Netanyahu’s failure to present any evidence that Iran violated the nuclear deal, shows that Iran is abiding by this.” A group of 26 people like such as Uzi Eliam, Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Secret Service Shin Bet, Gilead Sher, Yitzhak Arad and Shomo Brom, who held positions in national security, military and intelligence institutions, argue that if the U.S. withdraws from the deal, such a move would lead to dangerous results for Israel’s security. This group warns that in the case the deal is broken, Iran is going to get close to nuclear weapons and this might thus drag the region into conflict. According to Ayalon and his friends, the U.S. sticking with the deal is the best option for Israel’s security interests.

On a different note, the U.S. Embassy is moving from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 14. The “Jerusalem decision” had severed ties between Trump’s so-called “Middle East Peace Team” and the Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas’s rule. Trump’s Middle East Peace Plan is currently being implemented by his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Chief Negotiator Jason Greenblatt. All three are Orthodox Jews.

Friedman was Trump’s personal lawyer and Greenblatt a legal adviser at Trump’s firm. All three support Israel’s settlement policy in West Bank. Kushner and Friedman even made financial contributions for these settlements. As a matter of fact, Friedman headed a donation collection group for the settlers. Trump’s suggestion to appoint Friedman, who argues that West Bank is a part of Israel and opposes the two-state solution, had drawn reaction. Though, former Ambassador to Israel Thomas Pickering, Dan Kurtzer, Edward Walker, James Cunningham and William Harrop, asked in the letter they sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs that Friedman not be approved, they could not succeed. Ambassador Friedman’s views contrasting the U.S.’s Palestine policy, were frequently rejected by the Department of State under Rex Tillerson.

These are the names Trump tasked to ensure peace between Palestine and Israel. The contents of Trump’s peace plan is yet to be revealed. Nobody knows what this plan is. Trump is expected to announce the plan after May 14. As for Kushner, he wants to solve the Palestine issue with his close friends Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed and Egyptian dictator Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Iran is the primary matter for the princes, not Palestine. Kushner trusts these princes to get Palestinians to accept the “non-peace peace.” As a result, a storm awaits the region after May 12.",Trump’s Palestine plan!,https://www.yenisafak.com/en/columns/abdullahmuradoglu/trumps-palestine-plan-2045435
7,palestine,"The Palestinian leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, has been widely condemned for his anti-Semitic remarks in a televised speech addressing a meeting of the Palestinian National Council on Monday 30th April. Among his critics, as the Belfast Telegraph notes, former US Secretary of State John Kerry

Former US Secretary of State John Kerry wrote on Twitter: “These comments are wrong, ugly, and unacceptable – anywhere from anyone – but particularly from anyone who says he wants to be a peacemaker. No excuses for anti-Semitism: words to be condemned, not explained away.”

In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland puts the question

Think of it as a test. Can you hold two apparently clashing thoughts in your mind at the same time? Or, put another way, can you condemn reprehensible words and deeds when they come from someone whose cause you otherwise believe is just? The question arises after the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, declared in a rambling speech on Monday that the root cause of the Holocaust was not so much the Nazis’ genocidal hatred of Jews as the Jews’ own conduct, specifically their “social behaviour”, adding that he meant “their social function related to banks and interest”. Loosely translated, Abbas seemed to be suggesting that Jews brought the mass slaughter of six million upon themselves, thanks to their supposed stinginess, fondness for money-lending and for driving a hard bargain – to cite just a few of the hoary anti-Jewish stereotypes Abbas apparently had in mind. On the face of it, those remarks are classically antisemitic, carrying an extra sting of victim-blaming for good measure. At a push, you could imagine someone justifying such a view by noting that tension between Jews and their neighbours in Europe was fuelled for centuries by antisemitic laws that banned Jews from owning land, excluded them from key professions and forced them to engage in financial activity religiously forbidden as “usury” to Christians. But Abbas didn’t say any of that. Besides, the Palestinian leader has form in this area. In a January speech, he implied that European Jews preferred to endure the Holocaust than move to Palestine: “The Jews did not want to emigrate even with murder and slaughter,” he said. Even during the Holocaust, they did not emigrate.” Of course, the truth is that after 1939 the British mandatory government that then ruled Palestine barred all but a trickle of Jewish migration to Palestine – and the Jews of Nazi-occupied Europe were not exactly free to move where they chose.

As Freedland notes

And yet, some will be wary of condemning them outright. They will worry that to do so is to side with Israel and its advocates, who have of course been quick to lambast Abbas. They will feel the urge either to justify or play down what the Palestinian leader has said or to look the other way. [added emphasis] But that would be to fail the test. For the right reaction is to condemn what Abbas said, safe in the knowledge that to do so does not in any way undermine the justice of the Palestinian demand for independence and statehood. Witness the tweeted reaction of the journalist, Mehdi Hasan, a forceful advocate for Palestinian rights: “Mahmoud Abbas’s claim, as reported by the BBC, that Europe’s Jews were mass-murdered in the Holocaust because of their financial activities (!) and not because of Nazi anti-Semitism, is dumb, offensive, ahistorical and, yes, deeply, deeply anti-Semitic.” Mahmoud Abbas's claim, as reported by the BBC, that Europe's Jews were mass-murdered in the Holocaust because of their financial activities (!) and not because of Nazi anti-Semitism, is dumb, offensive, ahistorical and, yes, deeply, deeply anti-Semitic. https://t.co/VISOMjCCHz — Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) May 2, 2018 That gets it right. Indeed, there are three conclusions one can draw from the Abbas speech, none of which should be unpalatable for supporters of the Palestinians.

As the Belfast Telegraph report also noted, Sinn Féin’s national chairman, Declan Kearney, who also spoke at the PNC meeting in Ramallah, tweeted his reaction to the speech at the time…

Which brings me back to Jonathan Freedland, and his third lesson of this episode

The third lesson of this episode stretches far beyond Israel-Palestine. There is a tendency in the current culture wars for partisans to behave as if their cause must be 100% just, while their opponents’ must be 100% unjust. It leads people to refuse to admit when their own side has got it wrong, as if that might undermine the wider case. It leaves supporters of Israel standing by Benjamin Netanyahu even when he engages in crude racism – warning that Arab citizens of Israel were heading to the polls “in droves” in the final hours of the 2015 campaign, for example – just as it can leave supporters of the Palestinians indulging Abbas. It’s the same cast of mind that leads Republicans to cover for Donald Trump no matter how badly he behaves, that leads Tories to excuse the Windrush scandal, or Labour supporters to play down antisemitism within their own ranks. It’s a bad habit. If your cause is strong enough, you should have no fear of pointing out when it, or its leaders, err – and err badly. [added emphasis throughout]

Citing Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon, Stalin and others, he insisted that Israel had grown out of a European colonial project that had nothing to do with Jewish history or aspirations.

Citing a widely discredited book from the 1970s by Arthur Koestler called “The Thirteenth Tribe,” he posited that Ashkenazi Jews — the tradition to which about half the Jews in Israel belong, including many of those prominent in the state’s founding — were descended not from the biblical Israelites but from the Khazars, a Turkic people who converted to Judaism in the eighth century.

Condemnations of Mr. Abbas poured in from Middle East envoys of the United States and the United Nations, from Israel, the European Union and from countries including Germany and Britain.

Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said such statements were “unacceptable, deeply disturbing and do not serve the interests of the Palestinian people or peace in the Middle East,” and he accused Mr. Abbas of perpetuating the conspiracy theories that fuel anti-Semitism.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called Mr. Abbas a “Holocaust denier,” and the speech prompted some liberal Israelis to rule Mr. Abbas out as a partner for peace.

“No Israeli prime minister can negotiate with someone who holds views like Abu Mazen,” Shlomo Avineri, a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said after the speech, referring to Mr. Abbas by his nickname.

Gilad Erdan, the country’s public security minister, said on Twitter that the “apology” — he put the word in quote marks, as if to mock Mr. Abbas’ sincerity — revealed distorted thinking and political opportunism. “He should start by making it clear that his revolting remark about the reasons for the Holocaust was a racist blood libel, and simply ask for forgiveness,” he added.

The uproar over the speech by Mr. Abbas reverberated on Friday at the 15-member United Nations Security Council, where the United States ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, submitted a statement subject to unanimous approval describing the speech as reprehensible and calling on him to “refrain from anti-Semitic comments.” Security Council diplomats said Kuwait, a nonpermanent member, objected to the statement, arguing that Mr. Abbas already had apologized, so it failed.

Ms. Haley reacted angrily. “Disgusting anti-Semitic statements from the Palestinian leadership obviously undermine the prospects for Middle East peace,” she said. “When the Security Council cannot reach consensus on denouncing such actions, it only further undermines the U.N.’s credibility in addressing this critical issue.”

Mr. Abbas has been accused of anti-Semitism, and reversed himself on the issue, in the past.

During a speech to the European Parliament in 2016, he accused rabbis in Israel of calling for their government to poison the water used by Palestinians, echoing a libel that led to the mass killings of Jews in medieval times. Barely a day later, he retracted the allegation, saying it had become “evident” that it was “baseless.”

Many critics have also pointed to Mr. Abbas’s doctoral dissertation, published as a book in the 1980s, in which he challenged the number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. He also argued that Zionists had collaborated with Nazis to propel more people to what would become Israel — a theme he alluded to again on Monday.

But in a 2011 interview he said he did “not deny the Holocaust” and that he had “heard from the Israelis that there were six million” victims, adding, “I can accept that.”

Mr. Abbas has also made some bold pronouncements condemning the Holocaust. In 2014, on the eve of Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day, he issued a formal statement calling the Nazi genocide “the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era” and expressing sympathy with victims’ families, a rare gesture from an Arab leader.

Going further, he then described the Holocaust as “a reflection of the concept of ethnic discrimination and racism, which the Palestinians strongly reject and act against.”

Scrambling to salvage his reputation and some semblance of the long-stalled peace process with Israel, he repeated some of those sentiments on Friday.

“I would also like to reiterate our long held condemnation of the Holocaust, as the most heinous crime in history, and express our sympathy with its victims,” he said in his statement. “Likewise, we condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms, and confirm our commitment to the two-state solution, and to live side by side in peace and security.”

But a response on Twitter from Israel’s hard-line defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, indicated that Mr. Abbas would not easily be forgiven by the Israeli government, for one.

“Abu Mazen is a wretched Holocaust denier who wrote his doctorate on Holocaust denial and then wrote a book on Holocaust denial,” Mr. Lieberman wrote. “That is how he should be regarded. His apology is not accepted.”",Palestinian Leader Apologizes After Speech Prompts Anti-Semitism Uproar,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/middleeast/mahmoud-abbas-speech-apology.html
9,palestine,"UK Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, attended the Palestinian National Council summit in Ramallah this week, where she slammed the policies of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump.

Thornberry wrote a lengthy Facebook post expressing her dismay with the two leaders and listed three solemn guarantees that the Labour party will take as soon as they are in office again.

“First, as we rightly mark this month the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the State of Israel, I said it is also right — and long overdue — for the United Kingdom to formally recognise the State of Palestine, and urge other countries to do the same, not in due course, not when the time is right, but now and without delay,” the Facebook post read.

Calling Donald Trump’s cut of aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) “cruel and spiteful”, Thornberry vowed that a “Labour government would host an international funding conference to address the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.”

“And third, I said a Labour government in Britain would immediately review the sale of arms by the United Kingdom to Israel to ensure that none of the weapons sold by our country are being used by the Netanyahu government to attack innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza or anywhere else,” she said.

The Shadow Foreign Secretary slammed the Netanyahu-led government’s actions, including “the expansion of illegal settlements, the crippling blockade against Gaza, the brutal and lethal suppression of protests on the Gaza border, and the unlawful detention and ill-treatment of Palestinian children.”

“And from the Trump administration, it includes the reckless and irresponsible decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem, and the cruel cuts in funding for the UN agencies providing healthcare, education and humanitarian relief to Palestinian refugees,” Thornberry wrote.

A future Labour government would also use its influence in the UN to improve the situation for the Palestinians, such as being a “constant voice on the Security Council urging action when Israel breaks international law, and exposing the hypocrisy of the United States and others who demand tough action and independent investigations when other countries break those laws, but turn a blind eye when it comes to the Netanyahu government.”

Addressing Israel’s detention of Palestinian children, Thornberry said “we would also demand a new independent investigation into the Netanyahu government’s breaches of international law when it comes to the detention, ill-treatment and unfair prosecution of Palestinian children, an issue on which we have already led the way in demanding action in the UK Parliament.”

Thornberry did not comment on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ speech at the Palestinian National Council summit in Ramallah, which was condemned by the EU, UN, and the US.

Abbas, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism before, suggested in a rambling address to a rare meeting of the Palestinian National Council on Monday night that the Holocaust was a result of Jews’ “social behavior, [charging interest], and financial matters.”

""From the 11th century until the Holocaust that took place in Germany, those Jews -- who moved to Western and Eastern Europe -- were subjected to a massacre every 10 to 15 years. But why did this happen? They say 'it is because we are Jews',"" he told the hundreds of delegates.

""The speech Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered on 30 April contained unacceptable remarks concerning the origins of the Holocaust and Israel's legitimacy,"" a spokesman for the EU's diplomatic service said in a statement.

In April, Israel's Labor Party leader Avi Gabbay suspended relations with UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his office in a letter amid burgeoning accusations of antisemitism thrown at the controversial British politician.

While there are many areas where our respective parties can and will cooperate, we cannot retain relations with you, Leader of Labour Party UK, while you fail to adequately address the anti-Semitism within Labour Party UK,"" the letter addressed to the ""Rt Hon Jeremy Corbyn MP"" read. ""I write to inform you of the temporary suspension of all formal relations.""

""It is my responsibility to acknowledge the hostility that you have shown to the Jewish community and the anti-Semitic statements and actions you have allowed as Leader of the Labour Party UK,"" Gabby added.

10,palestine,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came to Israel Sunday in the midst of the worst crisis in relations between Israelis and Palestinians in years, but he did not meet a single Palestinian representative and mentioned them publicly once.

For decades, American diplomats saw themselves as brokers between the two sides, and secretaries of state typically met Palestinian representatives on regional tours like this one. When relations between the two sides deteriorated, the United States sought to bridge the divide.

No more.

No one at the State Department called Palestinian leaders to ask for a get-together with Mr. Pompeo, according to Palestinian officials. And that may be because the Americans knew the answer they would have gotten: No.

Infuriated by President Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, paving the way for the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested holy city, Palestinian leaders have cut off political contacts with the Trump administration. They say the White House can no longer be considered an honest broker in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.",Pompeo and Palestinians Have ‘Nothing to Discuss’ Amid Gaza Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-israel-palestinians.html
11,palestine,"On June 27, 1976, a group affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked an Air France plane carrying 248 passengers and crew from Tel Aviv to Paris. Their plan was to exchange the hostages for $5 million and the release of more than 50 pro-Palestinian militants imprisoned around the globe. A week later, Israeli Defense Forces stormed the terminal of the Entebbe airport in Uganda where the hostage were kept, in a rescue mission led by Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

José Padilha’s (Narcos, Robocop, Tropa De Elite) cinematic resurrection of the acclaimed military rescue mission shines a light on crucial Israel-Palestine issues very much alive today. The poignant and powerful thriller by the experimental Brazilian film director assumes its viewers are in the know about the geopolitical issues at hand, the historical politicians on both sides and operates in a gray area without imparting moral judgement on any of the characters. Despite being a more rounded approach to the story, these were undoubtedly the reasons why 7 Days in Entebbe was was met with mixed reviews.

Entertainment One

The film focuses on the morally complex characters of the German militants, Brigitte Kuhlmann (Rosamund Pike) and Wilfried Böse (Daniel Brühl), known as radical terrorists--or revolutionary freedom fighters, depending on which side of history you’re on. The two leftist lead hijackers are part of the Baader-Meinhof group and entangled in the Palestinian cause. Parallel stories then emerge, showing the tensions and divisions of politicians in Jerusalem and their struggles for power.

“History is complex. Everyone has different versions of it and different truths,” Brühl told Newsweek. “José had a strong political conscience and didn’t want to make it a superheroes versus the cold blooded terrorist monsters film because that doesn’t really tell you anything.”

During the hijacking, Böse, a radical writer, assures the hostages he is a humanitarian and asks them not to fear him. Throughout the film, he struggles with the implication of being a German holding Jews at gunpoint. Kuhlmann, his female counterpart, is much more ruthless and unafraid to use violence to ensure the success of the operation.

“We had to find the right balance to not make them too likeable,” Brühl said. “I have zero empathy for radical thinking, extremism and terrorism, but still, behind that, they were human beings with their motivations and you have to understand what drives them.”

Perhaps the sole likeable character in the film was Jacques Le Moine (Denis Ménochet), the quietly courageous French flight engineer, who developed an intense relationship with Böse despite being his hostage. And while script writers, Kate Solomon and Greg Burke, provided the actors with interesting materials, Brühl said it was speaking with the real life Le Moine about his account of the incident that added depth to his portrayal of Böse.

Brühl says Wilfried Böse’s relationship with Le Moine was one that resembled the Stockholm Syndrome, in which hostages begin to sympathise with their captors. “Le Moine said they used to have long conversations about politics and philosophy. At the very end, he was looking inside the barrel and said Böse did make the deliberate choice not to kill anyone,” Brühl said. “He was a hostage but there was not much hatred or anger inside him when he spoke of Böse. I had no reason not to believe him.”

Entertainment One

The German-Spanish actor broke out in the 2003 comedy Good Bye, Lenin!, where he plays Alex Kerner, a young boy who sends his loyal party mother into a coma after she sees him participating in an anti-communist rally. Growing up in Cologne, Brühl’s exposure to post-Nazi Germany helped shape his understanding of these politically charged characters.

Brühl remembers his parents’ generation filled with rage and anger that there were still so many Nazis in high ranking positions in West Germany. “What was fascinating was to see how many of these young people came from a safe environment, most of them were middle class or bourgeois,” Brühl said. “And it wasn't just enough to be just politically active, to go to rallies and be really determined. Some of them took a weapon and became radical.”

In American cinema, Brühl has been somewhat typecast as the internally tortured dark foreigner. He played a young Nazi soldier in Inglorious Bastards, the evil villian Helmut Zemo in Captain America: Civil War and a well intended sociopath Dr. Laszlo Kreizler in TNT’s The Alienist. But he prefers these roles over the nice son-in-law parts he is often offered in Europe, thanks to his baby face.

Brühl admits he has always been drawn to deep-seated darkness, from the books he read as a teenager to pranks he would play on his mother. “I pretended I was dead when I was four or five. My mother came home to find me in the bathtub with a hairdryer. That was probably my first acting exercise,” he said.

“Darkness is the most interesting thing about a person. The evilness that all of us have within us is so often kept in, it is a part of us that we cannot express because its problematic,” Brühl added.

“I guess that’s what makes it interesting to explore.”",'7 Days In Entebbe' Star Daniel Brühl Says Everyone Has Their Own Version of History,http://www.newsweek.com/7-days-entebbe-star-daniel-bruhl-says-everyone-has-their-own-version-history-861681
12,palestine,"Around the world, millions of children are the unheard voices of war. And the horrors they witness today will inform the adults they become tomorrow. Will they grow up to be the next leaders, teachers or freedom fighters?

Gaza is a virtual prison with hardly any way in or out. In 2007, Al Jazeera entered Gaza to talk to the grandchildren of Fatima al-Najar, who had achieved a strange kind of fame as the oldest female Palestinian suicide bomber.

These children, whose lives had been shaped by the oppressive conditions imposed on the territory by Israel, spoke about the hopes and fears for their future.

Ebtehal was just 10 at the time and wanted to become the first female president of Palestine. She said she had three priorities: to clean up the mess left behind by the Israeli bulldozers, to give children their rights, and ""to build a new Gaza"".

Another young girl, Rana, hoped to become a journalist, ""so I can tell the people how we suffer here. I am a child, I know what death means, I know what war means, I know what blood means. Me and all the children here know what it means.""

A decade on, Rewind returns to Gaza in search of the children featured in Children of Conflict, now young adults. Once again they speak to Al Jazeera, contrasting their aspirations of 10 years ago with the reality of today.

Ebtehal is now 22 years old and a graduate, with a degree in health administration. However, owing to the ongoing terrible conditions in Gaza, she is unemployed, and has experienced personal loss several times over the years.

""The Palestinian people don't live in safety nor do they feel safe in their homes. One reason being the occupation and the other the siege,"" says Ebtehal.

""Because of the wars, we've lost two brothers. And we lost our house many times. This created a big wound in our family ... one that will stay forever,"" she adds.

Zana Bashir was only 11 years old at the time of filming and is now studying dentistry - her long-desired profession of choice - albeit not where she had anticipated.

""I had decided to study dentistry in Germany, as my brothers are there."" says Zana, ""I had no idea that the Gaza crossing would be the end of it. [I thought] the crossing will eventually open and I will travel. Until I found myself [here] studying at Al-Azhar University.""

""I don't remember a childhood of cartoons and toys. I remember the army a lot, I remember how scared I was. At five years old, I saw a lot of the army ... I tell myself that I want to do all that I can to be a very well-known dentist. So much that they will recognise me, from the army. That they remember a very long time ago they had locked me an my family in a room but today she is very successful. I always imagine this scenario.""

DHAKA - Islamic foreign ministers on Sunday launched a campaign to mobilise international support for action against Myanmar over the Rohingya refugee crisis, officials said.

Foreign ministers and diplomats of the 53-member Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) set up a campaign committee during two days of talks in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka. OIC secretary general Yousef bin Ahmed Al-Othaimeen called the move a key step toward ending a crisis caused by the exodus of about 700,000 Muslim Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar into camps in Bangladesh.

He said the new committee would ""mobilise and coordinate international political support for accountability for human rights violations against the Rohingya community."" ""This is very important. This is one of the concrete steps that has been taken to alleviate the problem for our (Rohingya) brothers and sisters,"" he said.

A military campaign launched in Myanmar's Rakhine state in August last year set off the massive influx of the Muslim minority into Bangladesh where they joined 300,000 refugees already living in squalid camps following previous violence. The United Nations and United States have said the crackdown amounted to ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar army has said it only targeted militants. Rohingya civilians have told of murders and rapes as they fled. They say the army burned hundreds of Rohingya villages to the ground. Al-Othaimeen said Muslim nations had to ""pressure the international community"". ""This is not religious, this is human basic rights of our brothers and sisters in the last 50 years,"" he said.

The International Criminal Court prosecutor has already called for the tribunal to rule on whether it can investigate the allegations of mass rape and killings. Bangladesh has put huge diplomatic effort into pressuring Myanmar to take back the refugees in safety.

The two nations signed a repatriation deal in November, but nobody has since returned. The Rohingya have been persecuted for decades in Myanmar, where they are regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.

Last month a UN Security Council delegation visiting the camps called for the safe return of the Rohingya and an end to discrimination against them. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland also called for ""accountability"" when she toured the Rohingya camps this week.

15,palestine,"As the Leonard Cohen song goes, “everybody knows” the two-state solution is dead and gone. Zionism’s 120-year quest to Judaize Palestine – to transform Palestine into the Land of Israel – has been completed. Every Israeli government since 1967 has refused to seriously entertain the notion of a genuinely independent and viable Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel. Any possibility of a viable Palestinian state in the OPT has long been buried under the massive “facts on the grounds.” Israel’s Matrix of Control has rendered its control over the entire country permanent.

The two-state solution nonetheless continues to be the solution-of-choice of governments. It provides a perfect vehicle for endless conflict management. Negotiations over negotiations or merely holding out slim prospects of negotiations lead nowhere but can be dragged on indefinitely, which is the point. Indeed, it is a trap in which the Palestinian Authority is caught, since disavowing the two-state solution casts it as the intransigent party.

Needed: A New Political End-Game

As important as protests, activism, BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and other campaigns and actions may be, there is no substitute for a political settlement that will finally end the oppression and violence. One cannot be in a political struggle without an end-game, and in our case it must address two key processes: achieve restorative justice through dismantling the structures and ideologies of domination on the one hand, while replacing them with structures of social, cultural, political, economic equality, accompanied by a process of reconciliation. For that dual political process to succeed – the first most urgent for Palestinians, the second most important to sell to, or impose upon, Jewish Israelis – we need a plan, a vision of the future, and an effective strategy for getting there. This is the challenge before us, and it is urgent and crucial. If we, the stakeholders, Palestinians and Jewish Israelis together, do not offer our own peoples a mutually acceptable way out, and if we do not offer you, individuals and organizations abroad dedicated to the cause of justice in Palestine/Israel, a political program for which to advocate, we will lose. Justice does not prevail by magic. Unless it is empowered politically, it remains a vague and far-off aspiration. Worse – and this seems to be happening – activists and supporters will simply drift off to other urgent causes if there is no movement or prospect of success. Mobilization over time requires movement, direction and strategy, and only a political end-game provides that.

The time is far overdue to begin formulating a genuinely just and workable political settlement, then follow it up with an effective strategy of advocacy within Israel/Palestine and abroad. Over the past year I have been engaged with a number of Israeli Jews and Palestinians over the formulation of a one-state program. We call ourselves the One Democratic State Campaign, (ODSC), and among are members are Awad Abdelfattah, a founder of the Balad Party and its long-time Secretary General; Ilan Pappe, the well-known Israeli historian; Diana Buttu, the well-known analyst and Palestinian activist; Daphan Baram, a lawyer, comedienne and the Director of ICAHD UK; As’ad Ghanem, a professor of Political Science at Haifa University; Siwar Aslih, a Ph.D. student in Social Psychology; Nadia Naser-Najjab, a doctoral student; Shir Hever, a political economist; Muhammad Younis, a high-tech engineer; Yoav Bar, ad Israeli activist; Mohamed Kabha, a student; Sami Ma’ari, a professor of economics; and others, including myself. We have identified, I believe, the key elements to a just peace and have formulated an approach that bridges them in ways that the “sides” can agree on, or at least live with.

The Vision: A Multi-Cultural Democracy

The ODSC promotes a one-state concept that is both democratic and just but that also acknowledges the multicultural character and the collective rights of the peoples living in the country, Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews. Within a constitutional democracy in which all citizens enjoy a common citizenship, one common parliament and thoroughly equal civil rights, constitutional protection would also be granted to national, ethnic or religious collectivities desiring to retain their various identities and cultural lives if they so choose. Such an approach, acceptable to most Palestinians, addresses a key concern of Jewish Israelis: protection of their collective rights in a future country in which they will be the minority. Parliament, under the Constitution, will have no power to pass laws discriminating against any community.

Return of the Refugees

Key to any solution is the return of the Palestinian refugees and their descendants, or compensation and resettlement for those who choose not to return. But return is only part of the story. Where would they return to? Their homes and communities were demolished years ago. Well, according to the Palestinian geographer Salman Abu-Sitta, 85 percent of the lands taken from the Palestinians in 1948 are still available for resettlement. Although more than 530 villages, towns and urban areas were systematically demolished following the 1948 Nakba, their agricultural lands still exist, incorporated now into Israeli kibbutzim and other rural ventures. Other lands lie under public parks and forests. So refugees could actually return, if not to their former homes, at least to the parts of the country where they originated.

This ties into yet another issue: how do we prevent the refugee population, traumatized, impoverished, severely under-educated and unskilled, from becoming an underclass in their own country? A project run partly by the Israeli-Palestinian organization Zochrot has young Palestinian planners and architects designing modern communities for the refugees in the areas they left – new communities with economic infrastructure and integrated with other segments of the society. That, together with lands redistribution, financial compensation, and equal access to education, training and the economy, bolstered by affirmative action, would enable the refugees, like other Palestinians, to achieve economic parity with Israelis within a fairly short time. We must keep in mind the resources Palestinian enjoy: the high numbers of Palestinians in Israel, the OPT and abroad that have completed higher education, together with the likely investment of their highly-educated and affluent Diaspora. Even in this most difficult of issues, practical, just and workable solutions exist.

The Question of Bi-Nationalism

As I mentioned earlier, our initiative proposes a constitutional democracy in which all citizens enjoy a common citizenship and equal rights. Having said that, we cannot ignore the fundamental reality that two national groups – Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews – inhabit the country. Nor can we ignore the fact that the majority will be Palestinians. The prospect that Jews will live as a minority community contradicts perhaps the fundamental principle of Zionism: that Jews as a national group control their own destiny.

Now the very fact that we must engage in a search for an alternative to the two-state solution arises from the incompatibility of this principle with Israeli policy of settling and annexing Palestinian territory and permanently ruling over a Palestinian (majority) population, even if we call our rule “autonomy.” The minute Israeli decision-makers decided to link the demand for a “Jewish state” with the policy of incorporating a Palestinian population and territory larger than its own, it created an impossible and unacceptable reality: Jewish apartheid. Jewish Israelis would certainly prefer a non-democratic Jewish state over a non-Jewish democratic state. Our program must wrestle with this dilemma. Providing constitutional recognition and protection of the collective rights of Jewish Israelis, enabling them to maintain their community within the framework of a democratic state, addresses their concerns about their security as a minority while dismantling structures of privilege and domination.

A bi-national state would be easier to sell to Jewish Israelis than a unitary one – though barely – as the various schemes of confederation or “one country/two peoples” demonstrate. But here we hit up against Palestinian resistance. While the vast majority of Palestinians recognize the permanent presence of Jewish Israelis, to be forced to acknowledge them as a national group places Palestinians in a position of having to legitimize settler colonialism in its Zionist form, which is a bridge too far. Offering to protect the “collective rights” of groups to maintain any type of community they wish within the framework of a multi-cultural democracy (which may include communities of ethnic Russians, African asylum-seekers, foreign workers who remain, anti-Zionist ultra-orthodox Jews and others) gives Jewish Israelis the collective security they seek as a minority while facilitating the forging of a common civil society.

The Challenge: Forging a Common New Civil Society

Having ensured the integrity of collective identities and associations, the thrust and primary energy of our vision of a single state is directed towards building a shared civil society. Indeed, it is the breaking of the “bi-“national model that allows people to move out of rigidly bounded ethno-national blocs into a more integrated, fluid and shared form of civil society. As the years pass and both citizens and communities of Palestine/Israel develop a sense of mutual trust, inter-connectivity and security, as younger generations emerge for whom life in a common civil society is normal, a common civil identity will invariably emerge and expand. Attracting primarily the younger generation and the more secular middle classes, an inclusive civil society would take root as a shared national life becomes routinized through common citizenship and political life, collective experiences arising out of daily life, civil marriage, integrated communities and schools (for those who choose them), shared languages, a common media, common holidays and symbols that arose from shared national existence, etc., etc. We aspire not merely to a new political entity but to a new society.

Decolonization, Restoration and Reconciliation

While achieving a just political settlement is our most urgent task, establishing a just and working state and civil society requires three more difficult processes: decolonization, restoration and reconciliation. Decolonization does not end the moment one people ceases dominating the others. Indeed, that is the moment it begins. It then continues until all forms of domination – economic and cultural as well as political and legal – are rooted out. Decolonization requires a country to be completely reimagined and reinvented so as to be as egalitarian, inclusive and sustainable as possible. This means, of course, restoring to the expelled, excluded and oppressed their rights, properties (actual or through compensation), identities and social position. Only then can the third process, reconciliation, be pursued. We therefore “bracket” the still open wounds of the Nakba, the Occupation and the suffering they have caused so that we may reach an agreed-upon political settlement.

The Issue of Secularism

Virtually everyone involved in the ODSC project supports the idea of a secular state. Yet we recognize that the majority of both the Palestinian and Jewish Israeli populations are not secular: the vast majority of Palestinians can be defined as moderate to strict Muslims and Christians, while 58% of Jewish Israelis define themselves as religious, ranging from ultra-orthodox to “traditional.” “Secular,” then, can be a red-flag term making it even more difficult to “sell” an already daunting program.

Still, we believe that most people will accept a liberal democracy if we make it palatable, if we build in progressive elements but not rub their faces in them. Our program thus avoids the term “secular state,” but presents such a state de facto in two senses. First, it specifies that the authority to govern and pass laws emanates from the electorate, the people; what is left unsaid is that religious law (halakhah, sharia, ecclesiastical law) may continue to pertain within its religious communities – no one will ban religious marriages, for example – but will accompany, not displace, civil law where people choose to observe it. And second, there will be no official state-sponsored religion or religious authority.

Finally, the new state will exist in an extremely conflicted, autocratic and under-developed Middle East, albeit a region with great progressive potential as demonstrated by the massive (yet failed and repressed) uprisings in favor of democracy. It cannot exist in a vacuum. Sovereignty and borders, refugees, water, security, trade and economic development, tourism and the environment – these are only a few of the issues that are regional in scope. We envision a country that will join forces with all progressive forces in the Arab world struggling for democracy, social justice and egalitarian societies free from tyranny and foreign domination. Although this may sound utopian at a time when the region is in a melt-down, the resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict will eliminate a major source of polarization and militarization in the region, thus releasing positive forces of development and conflict resolution.

These are the main issues at stake, in our view, and I believe the approach we lay out here has great potential in bridging the deep differences and mistrust between our peoples. Our overall program, prefaced by a Preamble that sets out the historical context and being strategized by our members, is as follows:

THE ODSC PROGRAM FOR ONE DEMOCRATIC STATE BETWEEN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THE JORDAN RIVER

Haifa

April, 2018

PREAMBLE

In recent years, the idea of a one democratic state as the best political solution for Palestine has re-emerged and gained support in the public domain. It is not a new idea. The Palestinian liberation movement promoted this vision in the PLO’s National Charter until it entered the peace negotiations in the late 1980s. In the wake of the Oslo accord and other historical developments, the PLO shifted its support to the two-state solution as the basis for a future peace, a vision endorsed by all the Palestinian parties represented in the Israeli Knesset as well.

But the two-state solution is dead, buried under Israeli settlements and other massive “facts on the ground,” the world’s governments unwilling to exert the pressures needed to create a viable Palestinian state. This history clearly indicates that the only way to bring peace and reconciliation to Palestinians and Israelis is through the decolonizing historical Palestine based on granting equal rights, upon the full implementation of the Palestinian right of return and on the creation of a mechanism for rectifying past injustices. This is the urgent need of the moment.

As a result, several organizations and individuals have reintroduced the one-state idea over the past decade with models varying from bi-nationalism to a liberal, secular democracy. They are all united, however, in the belief that a substantially just political settlement can today only be achieved through the creation of a single state – a democratic state to replace the single apartheid state Israel has already imposed on the entire country.

The basic principles of liberation offered by the PLO in its 1968 charter still form an important element in the vision of those now engaged in formulating and advancing the one-state solution. There is a strong consensus among us that only decolonization and the rectification of past sins, in particular the right of Palestinian refugees to return to a democratic country, can bring equality, self-determination, reconciliation, prosperity, peace and justice to the land.

The following program of the One Democratic State Campaign (ODSC) provides a basis for consolidating a one-state solution. In it we seek to garner support from both Palestinians and Jewish Israelis for our joint struggle for this vision. This is the only way we will end the ongoing the ongoing colonization, racism and hatred that are destroying our lives, to prevent and reverse the takeover of Palestinian land and its burial under settlements. Only an inclusive democratic state, thoroughly decolonized, will provide for a future for all our children, a future of peace, justice and equality in all of historic Palestine.

THE ODSC PROGRAM

A Single Constitutional Democracy. One Democratic State shall be established between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River as one country belonging to all its citizens, who will enjoy equal rights, freedom and security. The State shall be a constitutional democracy, the authority to govern and make laws emanating from the consent of the governed, in which all of its citizens shall enjoy equal rights to vote, stand for office and contribute to the country’s governance. Individual Rights. No State law, institution or practices may discriminate among its citizens on the basis of national or social origin, color, gender, language, religion or political opinion, property, sexual orientation or other status. A single citizenship confers on all the State’s residents the right to freedom of movement, the right to reside anywhere in the country, and equal rights in every domain. All mechanisms of governance, law enforcement and security shall be thoroughly integrated on the basis of individual merit, including the military and internal security and police forces. The IDF and other Israeli security and police forces will be replaced by newly constituted national forces.

Collective Rights. Within the framework of a single democratic state, the Constitution will also protect the collective rights of Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews to freedom of association – national, ethnic, religious, class or gender – within the framework of a common state and democracy. Constitutional guarantees will ensure that all languages, arts and culture can flourish and develop freely. All citizens shall have equal rights to use their own dress, languages and customs, to freely express their cultural heritage, and to maintain such cultural institutions as universities, museums, theatres, newspapers and all other forms of communication. No group or collectivity will have any privileges, nor will any group, party or collectivity have the ability to leverage any control or domination over others. Parliament will not have the authority to enact any laws that discriminate against any community under the Constitution. Right of Return of Restoration and of Reintegration into Society. In accordance with UN Resolution 194, the State recognizes the right of Palestinian refugees – those who currently live in Palestine/Israel, all those who were expelled over the past century, their descendants and all others of the Exile/Diaspora – to return to their country and to the places from where they were expelled, to rebuild their personal life and to be fully reintegrated into the country’s society, economy and polity. To the most practicable degree, the private property of the refugees shall be restored and/or compensation arranged. Restoring the rights of the Palestinians will be done while respecting the rights and protections of all citizens under the law. Normal procedures of obtaining citizenship will be extended to others choosing to immigrate to the country. Constructing a Shared Civil Society . The State shall nurture a vital civil society in which common educational institutions, civil institutions such as marriage, and both the Arabic and Hebrew languages will be official languages. The State will not establish or accord special privilege to any religion, but shall provide for the free practice of all religions. Economy and Economic Justice. Our vision seeks to achieve justice, and this includes social and economic justice. Economic policy must address the decades of exploitation and discrimination which have sown deep socioeconomic gaps among the people living in the land. The income distribution in Israel/Palestine is more unequal than any country in the world. A State seeking justice must develop a creative and long-term redistributive economic policy to ensure that all citizens have equal opportunity to attain education, productive employment, economic security and a dignified standard of living. Decolonization, Restoration and Reconciliation. The liberation of Palestinians and the creation of a genuinely equal and inclusive society entails more than just a political settlement or new governmental arrangements. It requires a process of thorough decolonization, a reimagining and reinventing of the country in a way that fundamentally alters relations of domination. This includes what Fanon and Ngugi call the “decolonization of the mind.” Only then will a process of national reconciliation be possible. The Commitment to Human Rights, Justice and Peace. The State shall uphold international law and seek the peaceful resolution of conflicts through negotiation and collective security in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The State will sign and ratify all international treaties on human rights and its people shall reject racism and promote social, cultural and political rights as set out in relevant United Nations covenants. Our Role in the Region. The ODS Campaign will join forces with all progressive forces in the Arab world struggling for democracy, social justice and egalitarian societies free from tyranny and foreign domination. In particular, the State shall seek democracy and freedom in a Middle East that respects its many communities, religions, traditions and ideologies, yet strives for equality, freedom of thought and innovation. Achieving a just political settlement in Palestine, followed by a thorough process of decolonization, will contribute measurably to these efforts. Our Global Responsibility. On a global level, the ODS Campaign views itself as part of the progressive forces striving for an alternative global order that is just, egalitarian, inclusive, pluralistic and sustainable, one in which exploitation, racism, repression, wars, imperialism and colonialism give way to respect for human dignity, human rights, freedom, a just distribution of wealth, equal access to resources and a sustainable environment.

A&E EDITOR

Palestine is the hottest foreign policy issue upon which no politician will act.

What needs to be absolutely clear is that the Palestinian humanitarian crisis is not a partisan issue. Both U.S. parties have made their stance crystal clear—neither are willing to confront the Israeli government on an ongoing apartheid taking place in occupied territory.

It would be a futile effort to explain the long, conflict-ridden history surrounding the region in a short newspaper article. However, readers should understand that this is a humanitarian issue above all else. Treating this as a geopolitical conflict with equally powerful sides is simply incorrect.

A common misconception about the Palestinian crisis is that the issue is too complex for the outside world to act. While the issue is highly complicated, that hardly justifies the global community’s inaction.

One of the most recent incidents of Israeli oppression occurred toward the end of March. According to Al Jazeera coverage, 17 Palestinians were killed and 1,400 were injured when the Israeli army engaged protestors. The march was calling for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homelands.

This military engagement with protestors is not uncommon. While this latest incident yielded more staggering casualties, the Israeli army frequently engages peaceful protests (or children throwing rocks) with rubber bullets, tear gas and occasionally live ammunition.

According to BBC’s Israel/Palestine event timeline, in December, President Donald Trump ordered that the U.S. government recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Additionally, the order called for the U.S. embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv—the city most countries recognize as Israel’s capital—to Jerusalem. The move hasn’t happened yet, but it’s scheduled to occur in the near future.

Jerusalem is one of the most culturally significant cities for several religions that have spread across the globe. Israel seized the city from Palestinian control in 1967, in a brutal military conflict known commonly as the Six Day War. Since assuming control of the city, countries have been reluctant to recognize it as Israel’s capital.

The president’s decision to recognize Jerusalem was met with immediate backlash on the world stage—and very little action outside of Palestine.

A comprehensive Reuters article published on Dec. 29, 2017 detailed Palestinian protests against the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem. No Israelis were hurt. Many Palestinian protesters were injured by Israeli soldiers. These incidents, after filtering through American media, are seen as clashes between equally-powerful opposing forces.

The fact that the president’s decision to move an embassy—essentially to prove a point—has caused serious injury should alarm Americans. United States leadership cannot continue to make irrational decisions that cause this harm.

It doesn’t matter how many other countries denounce Israel’s decimating of Palestine. Until the United States takes a stand, very little is going to change. This is a decision that is, unfortunately, in the American people’s hands. Plagued by misinformation and overwhelming complication, many Americans appear to be content with letting a U.S. sanctioned apartheid unravel across the sea.

This isn’t a matter of expanding U.S. influence in the Middle East, gaining the favor of Arab nations or endorsing a religious group. Taking action to resolve this conflict is about protecting innocent civilian lives.

There is no simple solution to century-old conflict that has plagued the region, but Americans have to take that first step. Raising awareness for the situation and pressuring government representation is the only way citizens can push for change overseas.",The U.S. must do more to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,https://unothegateway.com/u-s-must-resolve-israeli-palestinian-conflict/
17,palestine,"Stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties, the youth in Gaza are rising up.

Seventy years ago, more than 170,000 Palestinian from historic Palestine were forced to leave their homes, villages, cities and lands, as refugees to the Gaza Strip. They were part of the 710,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave, seeking refuge in Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere.

The images of elderly people and kids fleeing the killings of the Zionists gangs and militias in 1948, still occupy the vivid memories of Palestinians as well as comprising the visual identity of the Nakba (Catastrophe). Today, after seven decades, the grandsons and granddaughtersof those refugees are making their way back to their villages. They have never seen their villages, homes or land, but they kept the memories of their grandparents, linking their identity to their villages, vowing to return to their homes, relying on the international recognition of their right to return, and the moral responsibilities of their right.

The Great Return March is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza

The Great Return March (GRM) is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza, and the increasingly severe humanitarian crisis, but rather it is a protest against the Nakba, that has been ongoing since 1948. The young generation of Palestinians know that the current humanitarian crisis and the disintegration on the Palestinian system is a result of the Nakba, as well as thedehumanization and the apartheid that is institutionalized against the indigenous people of Palestine. Therefore, any discussion on the GRM should consider the protests as an action and a reaction. Action against the ongoing imprisonment of 1.8 million Palestinians in the Gaza strip for more than ten years, and a reaction to the apathy of the international community.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, forty Palestinian civilians were killed and 5511 were wounded since March 30. Two journalists were assassinated deliberately by the Israeli forces, despite each bearing a clear sign that they are journalists. In addition to this, hundreds of the wounded were children and minors. Each of the forty people who scarified themselves had a story to tell, and a mission to accomplish. They were humans, who loved, and were beloved bytheir families, friends and relatives.

One of those killed was Mohammed Ayoub, 15 years old from Jabbaliya, who was shot in the head in front of cameras, without threatening or causing any harm to the Israeli Army. In his photos there is one where he drew aheartbetween his initials and those of another person. He did not think that he would be a target ofan Israeli sniper who might have even cheered after shooting a civilian, as one video showed soldiers cheering as they were shooting at civilians. Mohamed died and left a story to remember.

Another person killed was the beloved journalist, Yasser Mourtaja, who was well- known in Gaza for his kindness tochildren and his professionalism as a photojournalist. Weeks before he was killed by the Israeli snipers despite wearing a vest marked by “PRESS”, he was awarded a USAID fund for his media organisation.

A third person lost was the artist Mohamed Abu Amro, who was shot in the head while participating in a nonviolent protest on the eastern borders of Gaza.

19 year old Abdulfatah Abdulnabi was running away from the fence between the besieged Gaza Strip and Israel, when an Israeli sniper shot him dead.

A video published by the Israeli media shows how the Israeli soldiers and army view the Palestinians. The video shows an Israeli Armyofficer asking one soldier to “shoot the guy in blue”, but the soldier tells him that he will take the one in red. This interaction shows how the Palestinians have been dehumanized by the Israelis, with the removal of their names, history, families, and humanity. The video illustrates the approach of the Israeli Army which sees millions of Palestinians as objects rather thanhumans. It is evidence that the conflict is not only about freedom, but also aboutlife.

This killing doctrine and the dehumanisation of the Palestinians can be seen clearly in the words of Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who said after nine Palestinians were killed that there were “no Innocent people in Gaza”.

The population of the Gaza Strip that has been under intense siege since January 2006 and has been suffering enormously. Since the early 1990s, Israel imposed movement restrictions on the Gaza Strip, where 1.8 million people live, making itone of the biggest open air prisons in the world.

It is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable

In 2015, a UN report warned that, under the current conditions, the Gaza Strip will be “uninhabitable” by 2020. However, it is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable.

The ongoing Israeli blockage, and the sanctions imposed by the Palestinian authority against the Gaza Strip, was the result of failed reconciliation efforts with Hamas. Since then the economy and life in Gaza has been crippled, with suffering growing rapidly. In 2015, the GDP in the Gaza Strip was 971 USD, while it was 5754 USD for the same period in the West Bank.

Comparatively in Israel it is at 44,019 USD. The unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip and West Bank reached 26.9% in 2016, with Gaza hardest hit at 41.7% unemployment compared to 18.2% in the West Bank. Yet, the real numbers of youth unemployment in Gaza have reached more than 75%. This shows the inequality that the Palestinians suffer compared to Israel, and also how the Gaza Strip is suffering from huge inequality compared to the West Bank.

The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are walking through a dark tunnel, with no end in sight. They are stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties. This reality pushes them to take the lead and organize nonviolent protests, shifting attention to the real cause of the problem, which started in 1948.

The youth of the Gaza Strip are rising up in the face of Israeli colonialism, and the status-quo, as well as an act of rejection ofthe political parties in the Gaza strip, including Hamas and Fatah. The youth in Gaza struggle for their dignity, and prefer to fight for life and die in dignity, rather than die slowly from the blockade.","The Palestinians in Gaza: fighting for life, struggling for rights",https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/abdalhadi-alijla/palestinians-in-gaza-fighting-for-life-struggling-for-rights

• During the first quarter of 2018, the deteriorating socio-economic situation in the Gaza Strip, characterized by shortages in the electricity and fuel supply, uncertainty in the funding of key services and renewed clashes has deepened the severe humanitarian situation for Palestinian children and their families.

• Ongoing demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have so far resulted in the death of 33 Palestinians, including three children (source: UN).

• In addition to 3,193 children reached with child protection and MHPSS services, psychosocial support was provided to 40 children directly affected.

• Two stocks of prepositioned essential drugs and medical consumables were released to cover emergency medical care for 111,532 children and their families.

• UNICEF supported the rehabilitation of water systems to improve access to safe drinking water in the most vulnerable communities of the Gaza Strip and of the West Bank. More than 24,640 people benefited from improved access to water as a result of UNICEF’s interventions in Gaza.

• UNICEF is currently supporting the training 180 pre-schools and 600 school teachers on positive discipline, in view of activating 60 school mediation teams as part of its non-violence programming.

• UNICEF and its partners provided protective accompaniment and presence to 5,400 children and 144 teachers crossing military checkpoints to and from schools in the West Bank.

• The current deterioration of the situation in Gaza and rising tensions in the West Bank require urgent funding for child protection, health and education interventions to address the growing humanitarian needs and funding gap of 72 percent.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tensions have been running high in the State of Palestine following the announcement of the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem at the end of December 2017, planned for 14 May 2018. This comes at a time when Gaza’s economy continues to deteriorate as the intra-Palestinian reconciliation process appears stalled, having brought no real improvement in the lives of children so far. On 13 March, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority’s convoy was hit by a roadside Improvised Explosive Device as he visited Gaza to inaugurate the new Northern Gaza Emergency Sanitation Treatment Plant.

In Gaza, families have access to less than five hours of electricity a day and continue to face difficulties to access safe drinking water. Added to a reduction in the salaries of civil servants, further cuts in services and strict movement restrictions, the situation has negatively affected the entire population of two million, half of them children, and deepened the humanitarian needs in terms of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and child protection services.

Every Friday since March 30, over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza have participated in demonstrations along the fence with Israel to protest the ten-year-old blockade and support the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees. While the protests were overall peaceful and most demonstrators did not approach the fence, 33 Palestinians have been killed, including three children (source: UN). According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 2,835 Palestinian have been injured, of which 277 are children. This is the highest number of casualties since the 2014 hostilities. In the West Bank, tensions have been running high since December, with clashes sporadically erupting in various parts of the territory. UNICEF has appealed to all actors to put the protection of children first.

The total number of people in need in 2018 is 2. 5 million, of which 90 per cent live in the Gaza Strip. 1.8 million people are in need of WASH services suffer from poor water quality due to poor infrastructure, restrictions on fuel supplies and acute power cuts. With the escalation in violence, injuries and deaths, more children are in need of mental health and psychosocial support.","State of Palestine: Humanitarian Situation Report, January – March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/state-palestine-humanitarian-situation-report-january-march-0

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has described Israel’s pullout of a race for a seat on the U.N. Security Council as a “victory”.

“The withdrawal of Israel - an occupying power - from the race for a Security Council seat is a victory for humanitarian principles and values that are based on international law and the Charter of the United Nations,” the ministry said in a statement.

It said the withdrawal “unequivocally confirms that Israel is not qualified to compete for membership of the Security Council, which seeks to achieve world peace and security.”

On Friday, Israel withdrew from a race for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council in an election on June 8.

Israel was in a three-way contest with Germany and Belgium for two seats representing the western-democratic group of nations on the Council.



The Palestinian ministry said it has worked with friendly countries and organizations to thwart Israel’s efforts to gain Security Council membership.

“The ministry worked from day one on exposing Israel’s invalidity to gain a seat in the Security Council and explained to all countries why Israel should not be allowed to have that seat,” Foreign Minister Riad Malki said in the statement.

Since 2000, Israel has been seeking a temporary seat on the Security Council, which requires the vote of two-thirds of the 193 members of the U.N. General Assembly.

The Security Council has five permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France – and 10 members elected by the U.N. General Assembly for two-year terms.

Dareen Tatour, who has denied the charges, was convicted by a Nazareth court on Thursday for a 2015 social media post of a video with her reading one of her poems, titled ""Resist, my people, resist.""

In the video, which received less than 300 views, Tatour urged Palestinians to never ""agree to a peace solution"".

After the hearing, Tatour said she expected a conviction. ""I am ready for anything, and I do not regret anything I have done.""

She said there was no call for violence in her poem, but calls for a struggle, which Israeli authorities interpreted as violent.

{articleGUID}

""The whole world will hear my story. The whole world will hear what Israel's democracy is. A democracy for Jews only. Only Arabs go to jail. The court said I am convicted of terrorism. If that's my terrorism, I give the world a terrorism of love,"" she said.

Tatour was arrested in an Israeli police raid on October 11, 2015, and spent the next 16 months under house arrest, during which time she was barred from publishing her work and accessing the internet.

Since then, more than 150 American literary figures, including nine Pulitzer Prize winners, have called on Israel to free Tatour, including Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, Natasha Trethewey and Jacqueline Woodson.

International writers group PEN defended Tatour in a statement on Thursday. ""Dareen Tatour has been convicted for doing what writers do every day - we use our words to peacefully challenge injustice,"" it said.

'Buried freedom of speech'

""In essence what the court has done has buried the right of freedom of speech in its decision while we brought the court many many different poems of Jewish poets that have written through history, things that are harsher than what Dareen has written, and nobody even thought to criminalise their poems,"" said Tatour's lawyer Gaby Lasky.

The prosecution had argued Tatour's posts ""created a real possibility of inspired individuals committing acts of violence or terror.""

The court is expected to deliver its sentence against the 36-year-old sometime this month.

Israel has historically handed Palestinians lengthy prison sentences for minor offences.

Three years ago, Israel's Knesset approved a law that imposes up to 20 years in prison on people convicted of throwing rocks, despite condemnation from rights groups.

Ahed Tamimi, a 16-year-old who has had three of her family members killed in the past year, is facing eight months in jail after slapping Israeli soldiers who raided her home.

The incident took place shortly after her 15-year-old cousin suffered life-threatening injuries after he was shot in the face with a rubber bullet.

All of the cyclists on the Gulf states teams are naturalised citizens.

Palestinians have protested the decision to hold the event in Israel, and boycott activists have demonstrated against it.

The Giro itself caused a minor uproar when organisers billed the opening leg as in ""West Jerusalem,"" angering Israel, which considers the entire city to be its eternal capital.

The Giro ultimately reverted back to simply using ""Jerusalem,"" which in turn enraged Palestinians, who said it served to ""legitimise the annexation of Jerusalem.""

The new Executive Committee was not elected but were chosen by consultation with the PLO factions who took part.

Abbas, 82, is thought to have achieved most of his goals at the meeting, including the removal from the committee of some of his rivals, including Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Palestinian Authority prime minister and negotiator Ahmed Qurei.

Abbas left the door open for other factions who boycotted the session, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, to win one of three seats that have yet to be filled.

He also said that a rival Islamist group such as Hamas was welcome to come on board ""if it accepted the national unity and if it accepted the PLO.""

Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycotted the meeting, along with some PLO factions.

Some did not want to attend an event held in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and others wanted the meeting postponed to allow for greater consultation and more time for reconciliation between the two main rival factions, Hamas and Fatah.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

Lebanon remains at the forefront of one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time. The situation in the country continues to be precarious, with extensive humanitarian and development needs. Lebanon hosts the highest per capita population of refugees in the world. As of January 2018, the Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians who have fled the conflict in Syria (including 995,512 registered as refugees with UNHCR), along with 34,000 Palestine Refugees from Syria (PRS), 35,000 Lebanese Returnees, and a pre-existing population of more than 277,985 Palestine Refugees in Lebanon (PRL). The vulnerabilities of each of these groups have different root causes, requiring the overall crisis response to include a multifaceted range of interventions from emergency aid to development assistance.

High poverty levels

Eight years into the crisis, poverty levels are high and the longterm resilience of Lebanon’s vulnerable communities is eroding as they run out of savings and struggle to access income. At present, 1.5 million Lebanese live below the poverty line, of whom 470,000 are children. More than 76 per cent of Syrian refugees are living below the poverty line, along with 65 per cent of PRL and 89 per cent of PRS, who are one of the most vulnerable groups in the region. In response to protracted poverty, which is leading to rising food insecurity, 96 per cent of Syrian refugees are adopting negative coping strategies such as selling household goods, productive assets and housing or land, or withdrawing children from school. Households are sinking deeper into debt. In addition, constraints related to labour and residency policies have compelled refugees to resort to illegal and exploitative labour.

Increasing socio-economic disparities

Lebanon has witnessed an increased demand on its infrastructure and services, which lack the capacity to meet increased demand. The distribution of refugees in areas with a high concentration of Lebanese living below the poverty level, in conjunction with unemployment and a deteriorating economic situation, is exacerbating poverty and social tensions between communities while deepening socio-economic disparities. Between 2014 and 2017, the percentage of Lebanese who did not report any inter-community tensions dropped from 40 to 2 per cent.

Food Security

The food security situation remains very critical despite provision of direct food assistance, with an increase of food insecure households compared to 2015: 91 per cent of Syrian refugees live in some degree of food insecurity in 2017, compared to 89 per cent in 2015.

Gender-Based Violence

Socio-economic vulnerabilities, exacerbated by a protracted crisis, have translated into an increase in the levels of violence against children and women. There is an increased reliance on harmful practices such as child marriage and child labour, and an amplified risk of traffickers preying on the heightened vulnerability of populations.

Disability

One of the main objectives of the LCRP is to ensure a tailored provision of protection and other services for persons with specific needs such as persons with disabilities, older persons as well as women and children. However, data on persons with disabilities who are at high risk of violence, discrimination and exclusion is a persisting gap. Persons with disabilities have specific needs that entail additional costs on the family and require continuous assistance to improve their integration in society and access to services. Therefore, special attention should be given to this specific group through a holistic multi-sectoral response.

Education

The protracted nature of the Syria crisis has overstretched the capacity of Lebanon’s education system to address critical needs. Despite the efforts of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and partners, there are still unmet needs and challenges to be tackled. It is estimated that half of Syrian refugee children – more than 250,000 – remain out of school.

Healthcare

Despite the institutional support provided, health facilities at the level of primary healthcare and hospitalization across Lebanon are heavily strained with an increased demand on services due to the crisis. For instance, Akkar and Bekaa, which are traditionally underserved areas and hosting respectively around 10 per cent and 25 per cent of the Syrian refugees, are in particular need of more support. Mortality and morbidity are expected to increase due to inadequate access to healthcare.

WASH

64 per cent of the population in Lebanon do not have access to safe drinking water services. The presence of a large numbers of refugees has led to a stress on resources, but also to an increase of 15 per cent of solid waste, 14 per cent of waste water, and 12 per cent in water demand.",Lebanon Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/lebanon-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Pain Killers: How can impact investors help stop the opioid addiction epidemic? If impact investors are worth their salt, they’ll soon –– if not soon enough –– come up with a whole raft of investible solutions to the crushing burden of opioid addiction. The problem may have snuck up over the past decade, but there’s no escaping the costs of the crisis now. Action has been slow to mobilize on the front of positive impact to reverse the epidemic. “Why hasn’t the impact community embraced this issue more aggressively, given that it ticks so many boxes of things they care about and things they are good at?” Imogen Rose-Smith wonders in the latest episode of ImpactAlpha’s Returns on Investment podcast. “I’m surprised the voice of the impact community hasn’t been louder.”

Investors, and many others, can be overwhelmed by large, complex problems. Climate-change, for example, is at least as multi-faceted and huge, but there now exists a coordinated set of activities for combating it. AIDS presented novel scientific and social challenges, but the health crisis came under control after decades of dedicated efforts. It would be wrong to say that the opioid crisis is insoluble, or that it won’t in time be solved. The floor is open for both practical and innovative approaches to reducing the burden of addiction.
