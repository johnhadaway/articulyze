U.S. President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy in December, when he decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv. This incensed Palestinians and other U.S. allies.

The administration is also putting the final touches on a Middle East peace plan, and U.S. officials said the conference was integral to future negotiations.

“Fixing Gaza is necessary to achieve a peace agreement,” one of the senior administration officials said. The officials stressed that the multi-nation humanitarian and reconstruction effort remains in beginning stages.

Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump who is overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian peace-process for the White House, gave a two-hour presentation to the attending countries, officials said, but the potential U.S. peace plan was not addressed.

Attendees included representatives from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several European nations. The format did not allow for direct discussions between Israel and the Arab states, officials said.

Potential electricity, water, sewage, and health projects were discussed, but officials declined to outline specific proposals. A senior administration insisted that many projects could be implemented without assistance of the Palestinian Authority, but the goal was to have it ultimately engage in the multi-lateral process.

Gaza faces a 43.6 unemployment rate, and many in Gaza blame Israel for the hardships, accusing it of placing an economic blockade on the enclave that has drastically reduced movement of people and goods.

But Gazans also fault their own leaders, complaining of a power struggle between Hamas, the armed group that seized military power in Gaza in 2007, and Fatah, the secular party of Western-backed Palestinian President Abbas.

Israel, which pulled its settlers and soldiers out of Gaza in 2005, says it has been forced to control access to and from the territory to prevent Hamas from sending out gunmen and bombers, and from smuggling in weapons or material to make them.

The Palestinian Authority’s prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, escaped an apparent assassination attempt in Gaza on Tuesday, when a bomb struck his convoy. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement in October that called for the Islamist group to hand administrative control of Gaza to the Authority, but it remains to be fully implemented.",White House hosts meeting on Gaza crisis without Palestinians present,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-palestinians-gaza/white-house-hosts-meeting-on-gaza-crisis-without-palestinians-present-idUSKCN1GP34M

3,palestine,"The livelihoods and long-term futures of thousands of Palestinian refugee families across Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza and the West Bank are at risk due to Donald Trump’s catastrophic decision to cut the American donation to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).

The US president’s decision to contribute only US$60m to UNRWA in 2018 – instead of US$125m – has been widely denounced as a brutal form of collective punishment for the Palestinian people.

To fill the gap in UNRWA’s budget, on January 22, its commissioner-general, Pierre Krähenbühl, launched a major emergency fundraising campaign. The #DignityIsPriceless campaign aims to mobilise donor states and civil society worldwide to secure funds to keep open the 700 UNRWA schools that educate 525,000 Palestinian children. It also aims to ensure that UNRWA can continue providing lifesaving emergency food aid, emergency cash assistance, and essential medical services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the Middle East. Krähenbühl said: “At stake are the rights and dignity of an entire community.”

There is clearly an urgent need to fill an immediate gap to keep schools and medical services open. However, a related, unspoken crisis is also threatening Palestinian refugees’ future in another way: if services are at threat there is also a looming employment crisis for the tens of thousands of Palestinians who provide these services as UNRWA staff.

Palestinian jobs and pensions at risk

UNRWA is both an agency that provides services and assistance, and the employer of 30,000 Palestinians, including doctors and nurses, teachers, psycho-social workers and administrative and support staff.

UNRWA’s budget has been precarious since its inception in the 1950s and in December 2017 it had a deficit of US$49m. Because of this, in addition to its full-time employees on fixed-term and indefinite contracts, UNRWA has long employed thousands of people on daily contracts, often for years and even decades on end. These precariously employed “dailies” are called upon to fill short-term gaps as they arise, including as substitute teachers and doctors to cover sick leave.

Nabil Mounzer/EPA

Many UNRWA employees – including the Palestinian teachers, guards and sanitation workers I have been speaking with across Lebanon as part of my ongoing research – fear that their jobs and very futures are at risk. Potential redundancies in Lebanon’s educational vocational centres have already been announced. My interviewees inform me that dozens of UNRWA “dailies” have either been made redundant or have not had their contracts renewed since Trump’s announcement.

Exceptional measures and major insecurities

On January 17 2018, UNRWA headquarters in Amman, Jordan sent UNRWA employees an internal Area Staff Circular noting that, “in view of the severity of the funding shortfall that the Agency currently faces,” the commissioner-general was announcing a series of exceptional measures.

The circular – which a number of my interviewees personally showed me – announced that UNRWA would no longer grant any extension of service to those over 60-years-old, the official age of retirement, and that posts that become vacant because of retirement would not be filled “until further notice”. The conversion of fixed-term appointments to indefinite appointments was also suspended. This means that staff with ten years of continuous service would no longer automatically be eligible for an indefinite appointment.

Sara, a Palestinian teacher I interviewed in early February, told me her heart dropped when she read this circular. Born in a camp in Lebanon, Sara – whose name has been changed – was first employed as a “daily” teacher, and, for the past eight years, as a fixed-term, full-time UNRWA employee. Since 2012, she has been teaching Palestinian children from Syria who arrived in Lebanon seeking sanctuary. She explained why she felt that her future had been pulled out from under her:

If my contract is not converted to an indefinite one, I will have nothing to support me or my family after I am 60. As a ‘B’ employee [the term Palestinians use to refer to workers on fixed-term UNRWA contracts], I would only receive my own savings (tawfeer) as a lump sum, with no contribution from UNRWA.

This is because upon retirement, only UNRWA employees who are on indefinite contracts (known as “A” employees) are eligible to receive the full “Provident Fund” lump sum or what Palestinians refer to as ta’weed: the full compensation paid by UNRWA for their many years’ service.

Ta’weed combines monthly contributions that are deducted directly from Palestinian refugees’ monthly salaries (the tawfeer), plus an UNRWA contribution. As UNRWA employees receive no monthly pension after retirement, without the combined payment Sara would effectively only receive her own savings (tawfeer) in one lump sum, which would never be sufficient to support herself and her family as she grows older.

My interviewees told me they were partially relieved to receive a second UNRWA circular on January 21, stating that “the conversion of fixed-term to indefinite appointment is reinstated.”

However, they remained concerned that with UNRWA’s ongoing financial insecurity, it won’t actually be possible for fixed-term staff to be offered indefinite contracts in the coming years. And they also remain concerned about the future of their pensions.

A fair future

In light of what UNRWA itself has called the “worst financial situation in its 70-year history”, Palestinian staff members are being implored to continue serving the refugee community.

However, UNRWA employees and their families are facing increasing insecurities. They fear for what the future may hold, both for their employment prospects, and for their lives beyond retirement.

For each UNRWA staff member whose contract is not made indefinite, for each person made redundant or removed from the “daily” roster, for each potential employee not recruited to fill a gap left by retirement, and for each person whose full “Providence Fund” (ta'weed) may not be paid by UNRWA, an entire family’s and community’s livelihood is being undermined.",Palestinian refugees lament as Trump funding cuts create job insecurity and a pension crisis,http://theconversation.com/palestinian-refugees-lament-as-trump-funding-cuts-create-job-insecurity-and-a-pension-crisis-93447

● Donations of $3.5 million avert a halt of emergency fuel program in Gaza, preventing the collapse of vital services; available funding will be exhausted by mid-2018.

● Newly-built classrooms demolished in a Bedouin community located in an area planned for settlement expansion; 44 schools in Area C and East Jerusalem at risk of demolition.

● Closure of a West Bank village, ongoing for over one month, generates hardship and raises concern about collective punishment.

OVERVIEW

Last month’s Humanitarian Bulletin warned that the Gaza Strip was on the brink of collapse. The key drivers identified then were the lack of progress in the implementation of the reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas; the unprecedented financial crisis facing UNRWA, one of the territory’s main service providers; and the risk that funding for the emergency fuel provided by the UN in Gaza would be exhausted by mid-February.

The latter threat has been temporarily averted following last moment donations for a total of $3.5 million. However, currently available funding will cover only around half of the bare minimum required to maintain emergency fuel deliveries during 2018, assuming no further deterioration in the availability of electricity. The impact of the energy crisis in all sectors of society is illustrated in this month’s Bulletin by the case of a nine-year-old boy, whose dialysis sessions are being regularly disrupted due to electricity cuts, with serious ramifications on his health; and by an interview with a Gaza municipality official, who highlights the health and environmental risks stemming from the thousands of tons of uncollected rubbish currently piling up across the city due to lack of fuel to run the garbage trucks.

While UNRWA’s crisis remains largely unchanged, some emergency funding mechanisms have been recently mobilized to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable. On 13 March, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) approved an exceptional grant of $15 million to UNRWA to support urgent food assistance through in-kind vouchers and cash for work opportunities for more than 600,000 Palestine refugees across the oPt. An additional loan of $15 million will support UNRWA’s life-saving humanitarian activities in all it fields of operation in the Middle East, until additional funding is received. Prior to that, the Humanitarian Fund for the oPt, managed by OCHA, released $900,000 to provide support to 140,000 of the most vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank, left by the cut in funding.

The allocation supports the deployment of mobile clinics in 39 West Bank communities, and maintains food distributions to Bedouin and herding in Area C, for a period of six months. An international conference to raise funds for the agency, with the attendance of the UN Secretary General, will be held on 15 March in Rome.

Another article in this Bulletin, which provides an overview of demolitions and displacements in the West Bank in January and February 2018, highlights the vulnerability of Palestinian communities in Area C. Among the structures targeted during this period, citing the lack of building permits, were two newly-built classrooms funded by donors in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Abu Nuwar. It is located in an area planned for the expansion of the Ma’ale Adumim settlement (the E1 plan) and is one of 46 communities in the central West Bank at risk of forcible transfer due to a coercive environment, including the promotion of relocation plans. A recent assessment indicates that 36 primary schools in Area C and eight in East Jerusalem, currently serving about 5,000 children, are at risk of demolition or seizure.

The final item in this month’s Bulletin concerns the Israeli military’s blocking of vehicular access to and from Hizma, a Palestinian village of over 7,000 people in the Jerusalem governorate, reportedly in response to stone-throwing by Palestinian youth at Israeli vehicles. The closure, which is ongoing for over 40 days as of the time of writing, has disrupted the access of Hizma residents to services and livelihoods, with a disproportionate impact on young children, the elderly and disabled people. The closure of Palestinian localities following Palestinian attacks against Israelis, including stonethrowing, has been taking place on a regular basis since late 2015. According to the UN Secretary-General this practice may amount to collective punishment, strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law.

Referring to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in his February briefing to the Security Council, the UN Special Coordinator to the Peace Process, Nikolay Mladenov, warned that implementation of the intra-Palestinian agreement “has stalled”, and that in the absence of “immediate steps to address the humanitarian crisis and to revive the economy, we will face a total institutional and economic collapse in Gaza. This is not an alarmist prediction – it is a fact.” Regarding the West Bank, Mr. Mladenov reiterated “that we in the international community must continue advocating for substantial Israeli policy changes … including a halt to settlement construction, demolition of structures and prevention of Palestinian development in Area C.” He also called “upon all sides to reject violence, condemn terror, ensure accountability and work to reduce tensions.”",Humanitarian Bulletin occupied Palestinian territory - February 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-bulletin-occupied-palestinian-territory-7

At least 31 Palestinians have been martyred by Israeli forces since Mar. 30, when peaceful Palestinian demonstrations dubbed ""The Great March of Return"" began along the Gaza Strip’s eastern border with Israel, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

The rallies are part of a six-week-long demonstration that will culminate on May 15. That day will mark the 70th anniversary of Israel's establishment -- an event Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" or ""Catastrophe.""

Demonstrators demand that Palestinian refugees be granted the ""right of return"" to their towns and villages in historical Palestine from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for Israel.

In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry criticised what it described as Israel's ""indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population.""

Hamas decries Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza Strip Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip at dawn Monday were intended to distract attention from Israel’s “ongoing aggression against unarmed protesters, children and journalists” along the Gaza-Israel border, according to Gaza-based resistance movement Hamas. In a statement, group spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Monday’s shelling of Hamas sites in northern Gaza “betrays the extent of [Israel’s] internal crisis and the state of confusion into which the Zionist entity has been thrown by the success of the ongoing ‘return’ rallies in Gaza”. “The rallies have tarnished the prestige of the Israeli occupation and have exposed its criminality,” Barhoum added, going on to describe the mass border rallies as “an evolution of the tools of confrontation and popular struggle”.Early Monday morning, Israeli warplanes struck a Hamas site in the northern Gaza Strip. No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the strike.According to Israeli army spokesman Avichai Adaree, the air raids came in response to attempts by a “Palestinian cell” to plant explosive devices near the Gaza-Israel border.At least 31 Palestinians have been martyred by Israeli forces since Mar. 30, when peaceful Palestinian demonstrations began along the Gaza Strip’s eastern border with Israel, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.Turkey condemns Israeli attacks on innocent civiliansICC prosecutor voices concern over Gaza violenceIsrael admits Palestinian journalist posed no threatThe rallies are part of a six-week-long demonstration that will culminate on May 15.

Husam Zomlot, the Palestine Liberation Organization’s envoy to the United States, urged the United States to renew its support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“Things are boiling in front of everybody. It’s a pressure cooker. It’s going to explode sooner or later. It’s not like we can wait,” Zomlot told AFP in an interview in Washington.

Zomlot’s office broke off contact with the White House team drawing up a plan for a US-mediated solution to the crisis after US President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

There is little sign of a plan emerging and protests have erupted in Gaza, where Palestinians have burned tires and thrown firebombs and rocks at Israeli soldiers, who responded with tear gas and live fire.

The White House has called for Palestinian leaders to keep their supporters back from the border, but has not spoken out against Israel’s use of force, further enraging Palestinians.

The White House on Thursday called on Palestinians to engage in solely peaceful protests and stay at least 500 meters from Gaza’s border with Israel. While the UN issued a warning to Israel to use “extreme caution” in facing the mass protests, US President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt put the onus squarely on Palestinians.

Greenblatt said protesters “should remain outside the 500-meter buffer zone; and should not approach the border fence in any way or any location.” He added, in a statement: “We condemn leaders and protestors who call for violence or who send protestors — including children — to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed. Instead, we call for a renewed focus by all parties on finding solutions to the dire humanitarian challenges facing Gazans.”

“Look at the situation in Gaza,” Zomlot said. “It deserves the US government strongest condemnation and action to uphold international law. We did not see condemnation.”

Zomlot insisted the Palestinians were sincerely happy to work with Trump’s administration and hopeful for peace until he recognized Israel’s claim on Jerusalem.

“If the US administration changes its position and returns to the long-held US policy of a two-state solution on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital of a sovereign state of Palestine, yes we will engage,” he said.

“Neither we can wait on the ground there — things are really boiling — nor we can wait for the US to change their position.”

Tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered along the Gaza border on Friday, burning tires and throwing firebombs and rocks at Israeli soldiers, who responded with tear gas and live fire, the army and witnesses said, as Palestinians held a second “March of Return” protest.

The Palestinian ambassador to the UN said late Friday that nine Gaza civilians were killed and over 1,000 wounded in the clashes, and urged the Security Council to demand an independent investigation into the deaths.

Earlier, Kuwait, which represents Arab countries on the council, circulated a draft press statement to members affirming the Palestinians’ right to peaceful protest, calls for an independent and transparent probe of the clashes over the past week, and calls for all sides to show restraint and prevent escalation.

On Twitter, Kuwait’s UN mission said the council “should address this matter and have a unified positions… What is happening is a violation of international law.”

The IDF said Friday it thwarted multiple efforts to breach the border fence during the protests — and that it used live fire to do so in some instances — as well as attempts to activate bombs against the troops under the cover of smoke.

“Rioters have attempted to damage and cross the security fence under the cover of smoke from their burning tires. They also attempted to carry out terror attacks and hurl explosive devices and firebombs,” the IDF said on Friday evening. “Our forces prevented breaches” of the fence.

Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said Hamas organizers were trying to use protesters as a diversion to “open up the fence and then to insert terrorists into Israel.” Conricus said snipers were used “sparingly” and only against those that pose a “significant threat.”

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, speaking to protesters on Friday afternoon, warned that the Strip was ready to “explode in the face of the occupation.” Sinwar said the world should “wait for our great move, when we breach the borders and pray at Al-Aqsa,” referring to the major Muslim shrine in Jerusalem.

Friday’s demonstration was the second of what Gaza’s ruling Hamas terror group said would be several weeks of “March of Return” protests which Hamas leaders say ultimately aim to see the removal of the border and the liberation of Palestine.

Israel has accused Hamas of trying to carry out border attacks under the cover of large protests and said it will prevent a breach of the fence at all costs.","Palestinian envoy slams US stance on Gaza protests, warns Strip at boiling point",https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-envoy-slams-us-stance-on-gaza-protests-warns-strip-at-boiling-point/
9,palestine,"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — As Gazans continue to participate in mass protests amid heightened frustrations at their dire humanitarian situation, Qatari aid and infrastructure projects in the besieged strip have been dying out following the blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017.

An Israeli study by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University found that the blockading quartet is working to stop the Qatari aid that enters through Israel from reaching the civilian population in Gaza. The researchers argue that Israel believes the Qatari support will help delay the inevitable confrontation between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The study stresses the difficulty and complexity of transferring the aid to Gaza since the blockade. Egypt has halted the movement of goods and raw materials from Qatar through the Rafah crossing and is pressuring Israel to do the same. The study suggests that increasing Qatari influence in Gaza would escalate tension between Israel and the Egyptian regime.

On March 17, the New Arab reported the formation of a US-Egyptian-Israeli committee to carry out humanitarian and relief tasks in Gaza, disregarding the Palestinian Authority and directly coordinating with US institutions linked to nongovernmental organizations in the Gaza Strip in order to maintain calm and avoid a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The newspaper pointed out that the committee is basically working to reduce Qatar’s humanitarian role in the Strip, with which Egypt has become concerned as it struggles to regain control of the Palestinian dossier.

The chairman of Qatar’s Gaza Reconstruction Committee (QGRC), Ambassador Mohammed Al-Emadi, said in a press conference in Gaza Feb. 24 that there is great pressure on Qatar to abandon its humanitarian work in the Strip. Emadi noted in another press conference on Feb. 19 that his country will carry on providing assistance.

The QGRC was founded after the Israeli-Gaza war in 2012 with a grant from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani amounting to $407 million. Its main task was to implement housing, agricultural and health projects, in addition to paving roads and fixing infrastructure.

A source from the QGRC, speaking to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, said that while the committee has carried out 90% of its planned projects, “the money is running out, and we are yet to find out whether or not the grant will be renewed."" The source noted that Emadi had stressed during his recent visit that Qatar will focus on relief and humanitarian aid and not development projects and infrastructure, projects currently stalled due to the difficult economic situation in the Strip. The Qatari funds announced during the International Conference on Palestine and Reconstructing Gaza in Cairo in 2014 only amount to a few million dollars out of the pledged billion in funds.

Political analyst and writer Hani Habib told Al-Monitor that Egypt sees the Gaza Strip as critical to Egyptian national security given the geopolitical situation linking the two regions. Cairo believes that Qatar’s role in providing humanitarian support to Gaza and its support of the Palestinian cause in general come at the expense of Egypt and squeeze it out of the picture. He stressed that the state of polarization resulting from the blockade on Qatar has directly affected Egyptian-Qatari relations.

“Israel seems to be two-timing both Qatar and Egypt. It is trying to please Qatar by allowing it to bring in its aid to the Gaza Strip, all the while winning Egypt over by claiming it is allowing the entry of the Qatari aid to Gaza to ward off a possible confrontation between Tel Aviv and Gaza,” Habib said. “Israel is counting on the US in the coming period to ease Egypt’s anger toward Qatar’s support to Gaza.""

He continued, “The Gaza Strip is a consumer and vital market for Egyptian goods. Stopping Qatari aid serves Egypt’s economic and political interests.” He pointed out that excluding Qatar from the Palestinian scene was predictable since it was not an honest sponsor of the Palestinian reconciliation given its bias to Hamas, saying that Egypt has proven its efficiency in ending the division.

The head of the political science department at Al-Azhar University, Mukhaimer Abu Saada, told Al-Monitor that Egypt thinks of the Gaza Strip as its own backyard, and thus does not want any foreign intervention, particularly by Qatar, which supports political Islam groups strongly opposed by Cairo.

He explained that any interference would mean competing with Egypt, noting that Israel does not want to prevent Qatari aid from entering through its crossings for fear the security situation in the Gaza Strip will escalate. “Qatar is the only Arab country that has influenced Hamas' political decisions since Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal moved from Damascus to Doha. This why Israel does not want to exclude Qatar,” he said.

Abu Saada pointed out that Hamas will not accept the funding that the UAE may send through dismissed Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan to the Gaza Strip to avoid alienating Qatar. “Hamas is well-aware that this would only aim to marginalize it and force it out of the political Islam circle, which includes Qatar, Turkey and Iran,” he added.

Political analyst Mustafa al-Sawaf said Israel will not respond to Egyptian pressure. “A recent Qatari grant in February had amounted to $9 million and aimed to ease the situation in the Strip and prevent it from imploding,” Sawaf told Al-Monitor.

Economic analyst Amen Abu Aisha told Al-Monitor that the Qatari aid and projects have failed to effect overall economic growth, noting that politically linked financing is conditional and seeks only to achieve a certain agenda.",Egypt struggles to edge Qatar out of Palestine,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/egypt-efforts-keep-qatar-outside-palestinian-political-scene.html
10,palestine,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The family of prominent Palestinian protester Ahed Tamimi on Monday released excerpts from a video in which an Israeli interrogator threatens the then-16-year-old with the arrest of her relatives if she refuses to cooperate.

The interrogator also comments on her body, fair skin and “eyes of an angel.”

The interrogator, identified as an agent of the Israeli military intelligence branch, at times moves within centimeters (inches) of the teenager, who doesn’t respond and repeatedly asserts her right to remain silent.

The Israeli military said a complaint of improper conduct on the part of the investigator, filed by Tamimi’s lawyer, has been handed to the Justice Ministry and is being “thoroughly examined.”

Ahed’s father, Bassem, told reporters that the video is evidence of Israel’s failure to break his daughter. He portrayed Tamimi, who has become an icon to Palestinians, as a symbol of resistance to Israel’s 51-year-old military occupation. Her silence under pressure shows that “we are not victims, we are fighters for the cause of freedom of our people,” he said.

A West Bank-based rights group said a majority of minors have reported being verbally abused, intimidated or humiliated in Israeli custody.

Tamimi is serving an eight-month prison term — the result of a plea deal — for slapping and kicking two Israeli soldiers outside her West Bank home in mid-December.

The teen’s arrest and full-throttle prosecution by Israel has garnered international attention. It has also touched on broader issues, such as Israel’s detention of Palestinian minors — currently 356, according to Israeli figures — and the debate on what constitutes legitimate resistance to Israel’s rule over millions of Palestinians.

Her supporters see a brave girl who struck the soldiers in anger after having just learned that Israeli troops seriously wounded a 15-year-old cousin. In Israel, she is seen either as a naive youth manipulated by her elders or a threat to Israel’s military deterrence.

The interrogation video was part of the case file handed to the defense after Tamimi was indicted, said Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak, who helps coordinate her legal strategy.

Tamimi’s lawyer filed a complaint with the military’s judge advocate general over the interrogation tactics, including apparent threats, coercion and sexual innuendo, said Pollak.

The interrogation took place Dec. 26, a week after Tamimi’s arrest, at an Israeli police station in the West Bank, said Pollak. In the video, one of the interrogators is identified as a police officer and the second as a member of Israel’s military intelligence.

At the beginning, Tamimi is asked whether she had spoken to a lawyer, and she nods her head. From then on, she refuses to answer questions.

The military intelligence agent, who sits in a chair close to her, attempts to get her to speak, at times threatening her, then telling her that with her blond hair, blue eyes and fair skin she reminds him of his younger sister.

“When I think of my little sister, her eyes look like your eyes,” he tells here. “She is white like you. In the sun, she looks like the hamburger. And what about you? What do you look like in the sun? Red, red, red? When I see your eyes, I say, it’s a shame (haram), you are here (in detention),” he says.

At another time, he tells her she has the “eyes of an angel.”

He also threatens her, mentioning names of family members, and telling her that “we will take everyone if you don’t cooperate.”

Rights groups say Tamimi’s experience is typical of what Palestinian minors experience in Israeli custody.

“The majority of Palestinian minors experience a wide range of serious rights violations from the moment of arrest through the conclusion of their trial proceedings,” said Ivan Karakashian of Defense for Children International Palestine, a group based in the West Bank.

He said the assessment is based on affidavits collected in 2017 from 137 minors who had been in detention. Karakashian said between 500 and 700 minors are prosecuted and convicted in military courts each year.

Under Israeli military law applied in the West Bank, minors can consult with a lawyer before an interrogation, but don’t have the right to legal representation during questioning, defense lawyers said.

Even the right to prior consultation is often not honored, said Yael Stein of the Israeli rights group B’Tselem and Farah Bayadsi of Defense for Children International Palestine.

If the minors don’t have the phone number of attorneys, or the attorneys can’t get to the location in time, interrogators can start questioning without them.

The Israeli military said Palestinian minors have been involved in violence, including deadly attacks on Israelis.

“In such cases, it is necessary to take appropriate steps to enforce the law, including investigation, arrest and prosecution,” it said. “When the law is enforced against minors, it is done taking their age into account,” adding that they stand trial in special youth military courts.

As Lord Mayor of the capital city of Ireland I am travelling to acknowledge that East Jerusalem is the designated capital of Palestine under the two-state solution, recognised by the international community, but forcibly prevented from being implemented by successive Israeli governments.

“Jerusalem is a place of huge cultural and religious significance for people all over the word, including in Ireland,” Mac Donncha, a long-standing member of Sinn Féin, said. “It is, of course, a place of immense importance to the people of Palestine.”

I am also here to express solidarity with the people of Palestine who are suffering violence from Israeli forces, as witnessed in Gaza most recently with the shooting down of protesters.

The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney TD, today called for calm in Gaza as nine Palestinians were killed last weekend in confrontations between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces along the Israel-Gaza border. 31 people are estimated to have been killed in Gaza since protests began at the end of last month.

“I call again for the utmost restraint, and urge the Israeli authorities, in particular, to ensure that any force used is only as a last resort, and is proportionate to the circumstances,” Coveney said. “The number of people injured by live ammunition is very troubling, and I support calls by the EU and by the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation.”

Councillors also passed a motion from People Before Profit Councillor John Lyons calling on the city council to boycott Hewlett Packard goods and services with the company's contract with the council due to expire in September.

Cllr Lyons said Hewlett Packard technology is used by the Israeli government in checkpoints, ID cards and naval systems to impose apartheid on the Palestinian people.

There were also complaints that the issue was brought up through emergency motions, which are defined in standing orders as ""urgent business related to a local authority function"".

Labour Cllr Mary Freehill said the council, in which Sinn Féin is the largest party, had ""no political leadership"".

She complained: ""We have this focus on saving the world. We are elected to save Dublin.""

Fine Gael Cllr Anne Feeney said the motion to expel the Israeli ambassador was ""nonsense"", as well as ""extreme and headline grabbing"".

Council Chief Executive Owen Keegan said he would not implement a boycott of Hewlett Packard, which he said was against State and EU law procurement law.

14,palestine,"Blog: The long-time activist and former wife of Nelson Mandela was not just an anti-apartheid activist in South Africa, but also a prominent voice calling for justice for Palestine.

The news of the death of Winnie Mandela, the former wife of the late South African president, Nelson Mandela, marks an important watershed moment in the history against colonialism and oppression.



Another formidable giant in the fight for both racial and social equality has been lost. She was 81 years old and her death was confirmed by her personal assistant this past Sunday. According to a family spokesman, she died after a long illness for which she had been in and out of hospital since the beginnning of the year.

Dubbed ""The Mother of the Nation"", Winnie Mandela, who was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years, played a high-profile role in the battle to end white-minority rule in South Africa - which was until 1994 in support of apartheid practices; separating and subjugating black South Africans across different spheres of society.



She herself was imprisoned for her activism for 491 days in solitary confinement by the South African apartheid government.



No doubt, her place in history - which was also stained by controversy - will provoke mixed reactions to her death, with debates and essays provided in the following days as to what her true legacy in South Africa's anti colonial struggle looks like. On the one hand, accusations of her links to ""necklacing"" which saw suspected traitors burnt alive, trapped in petrol-soaked car tyres, her conviction of kidnap and assault over the killing of 14-year-old Stompie Moeketsi and suspicions of her elicting an affair makes for difficut digestion for a woman as formidable as her.





One area for which she and Nelson Mandela were praised was their support for the Palestinian cause. Nelson and Winnie's activism and support for equality and fairness on the world stage was exemplified by their approach to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.



Like many of her contemporaries, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, she believed that the fight against racial inequality was inextricably linked to the Palestine question; accusing Israel of implementing apartheid policies against Palestinian communities.



If anything, the recent Land Day commemorations which saw at least 15 Palestinians But it also reveals a haunting truth, that our heroes - however formidable - can never have a truly purist legacy in whatever fight they found themselves, and is as true for Winnie as anyone else.One area for which she and Nelson Mandela were praised was their support for the Palestinian cause.

16,palestine,"Palestinian officials and human rights activists have sharply criticised Israeli support for the actions of Israeli snipers filmed celebrating after shooting a Palestinian standing inside the Gaza Strip.

In the video clip, which was first posted on Monday and has been widely shared on social media, the soldiers are heard discussing opening fire on what appeared to be Palestinians posing no immediate threat, nor engaging in any hostile acts near the fence.

A shooter then appeared to open fire on one, knocking the person to the ground.

Israeli soldier shoots an unarmed Palestinian and then celebrates, calling him a “Son of a B***h”. pic.twitter.com/8byDZtr1fK — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) April 10, 2018

""Wow. What a video! Yes! That son of a b***h,"" one of the voices behind the camera is heard saying in Hebrew.

It was not possible to determine whether the person shot in the video died.

Israel's military said the incident in the video ""apparently"" dated back several months.

The footage comes at a time when Israel's military faces mounting criticism over its use of live fire on the Gaza Strip border and the killing of at least 31 Palestinians protesting there in two mass demonstrations in as many weeks. More than 1,400 Palestinians were also wounded.

Palestinian condemnation

The video clip elicited sharp criticism from Palestinian officials, with Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, saying in a statement on Tuesday that it represented ""hate and contempt"" for a Palestinian's life.

This, he said, was ""a reflection of the cruel mentality of Israel's military occupation and the drive of its systematic shoot-to-kill policy against the Palestinian civilians, in defiance of their very existence on the land of Palestine and in a flagrant violation of all international and humanitarian norms and laws"".

The video drew similar condemnation from Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.

""This recording is an example that proves the rule. This is a killing spree commanded by [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, [Defence Minister Avigdor] Lieberman and [Chief of General Staff Gadi] Eisenkot,"" said Zahalka, chairman of the Joint List.

""No wonder the soldiers behave this way when ministers, legislators, the media and public opinion are party to the jubilation at the mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza,"" he said.

Israeli support

However, Israeli right-wing politicians have expressed their support for the shooting.

""The sniper deserves a commendation, the photographer a court martial,"" Lieberman said, according to Israeli media.

Education Minister Naftali Bennett, of the far-right Jewish Home party, also justified the behaviour depicted in the video.

""Judging soldiers because they are not expressing themselves elegantly while they are defending our borders is not serious,"" Bennett told army radio.

Meanwhile, Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan sought to downplay the actions of those in the video: ""We are going overboard with this video,"" said Erdan, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party.

""It doesn't show gunfire at everyone, but at a terrorist who approaches the barrier in an unauthorised zone coming from an area controlled by Hamas terrorists,"" he told public radio.

""I am convinced that everything is OK,"" he added, while also speaking of a ""human reaction"" by the soldiers confronted with a ""tense situation"".

But Yael Stein, of the B'Tselem human rights group, said that the delight the soldiers take in hitting their target does not change the fact that the Israeli leadership will not consider their actions unlawful.

""You keep hearing that anybody who is coming close to the fence will be shot, and anybody who is participating in those demonstrations 'is part of Hamas, they want to destroy Israel, everybody is a terrorist, the demonstrations are totally illegitimate',"" said Stein.

""So, if the public debate here that is being conducted and being led by the political level is on that level, showing the Palestinians as not deserving the same rights as any other person, it's not surprising that this is the result.""

Elor Azaria case

For Israelis and Palestinians, the footage was also a reminder of another video from March 2016 that showed an Israeli soldier shooting dead a prone Palestinian.

Caught on camera by a human rights group and spread widely online, it showed Abdel al-Fattah al-Sharif, A 21-year-old Palestinian, lying wounded on the ground; he had been shot along with another Palestinian after stabbing and wounding a soldier, according to the army.

Some 11 minutes after the initial shooting, Israeli soldier Elor Azaria shot him in the head without any apparent provocation.

Azaria was convicted of manslaughter after a trial that captivated Israel and highlighted deep divisions in public opinion between those who denounce the shooting and others who say it was justified.

Top military brass denounced Azaria's actions, but right-wing politicians, including Netanyahu, called for him to be pardoned.

Azaria was initially sentenced to 18 months in prison, but his sentence was later reduced to nine months.",Anger erupts over video of Palestinian shot by Israeli sniper,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/anger-erupts-video-palestinian-shot-israeli-sniper-180410160058867.html

During a press conference from the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), alongside Palestinian ministers, issued an appeal to the international community to the sum of $539 million to ‘address urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.’

Should the appeal be successful, it would secure funding for the agency’s 2018 plan which ‘consists of 240 projects to be implemented by 99 organizations, including 51 national and 35 international NGOs, and 13 UN agencies,’ reads the press statement from UNOCHA.

‘Approximately 75 per cent of the requested funds target Gaza, where humanitarian needs are highest due to Israel’s prolonged blockade and recurrent hostilities, further exacerbated by the impact of internal Palestinian divisions and Egypt’s restrictions on the Rafah crossing.’

‘Without donor-funded emergency fuel distributed to critical water, sanitation and health facilities, we would face a total systems collapse, with the result, a humanitarian disaster,’ said UN Humanitarian Coordinator Jamie McGoldrick at the press conference in Beit Lahiya in the Gaza strip.

‘There is no place more fitting to launch the humanitarian plan than Gaza, where we see a man-made tragedy unfolding daily. Today, Gaza is on the brink of catastrophe and humanitarian needs run deep,’ McGoldrick said.

McGoldrick went on to highlight the issues also faced in the Occupied-West Bank, which while, as McGoldrick describes, ‘the volume of needs are less, but (are) no less serious or urgent.’

‘The combined impact of a number of policies has created for many Palestinians, in areas like Area C, East Jerusalem and the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron city, a coercive environment that pressures them to leave and generates a risk of forcible transfer,’ he said.

Communities in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are allocated 25 percent of the funding according to the 2018 plan.

In his speech, McGoldrick also raised the issue of defunding to the United Nations Refugee Works Agency (UNRWA), which earlier this year suffered its greatest budgetary shortfall in its 70 year history when the United States decided to withhold $65 million.

‘Against this worrying backdrop of needs in the oPt, the massive funding crisis faced by UNRWA, one of the main service providers and a main employer, particularly in Gaza, should be of concern to everyone, not just Palestine refugees,’ said McGoldrick.

Half of the overall funding amount will contribute to emergency UNRWA projects.

Separately, on Thursday a donor conference is being held to discuss UNRWA’s budgetary shortfall.

In his opening remarks, the Secretary General for the United Nations remarked that, ‘In the early days of the United Nations, the General Assembly created UN Relief and Works Agency to provide Palestine refugees with assistance, and to help them achieve their human potential. Today, UNRWA’s mission is just as crucial as it was sixty-eight years ago. But until a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is achieved, the work of UNRWA remains vital.’

The Secretary General announced a number of emergency measures during his opening remarks, but also underlined the dire state of the agency.

‘Recognizing the urgent needs, the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund is releasing an exceptional combined rapid response grant and loan allocation of $30 million,’ he said.

‘But we must also recognize that the financial crisis facing the Agency today is unlike those in the past. It is far more grave, and threatens to cut programmes far more savagely.

‘For 2018, with pledges reduced, UNRWA faces a shortfall not of millions, not even of tens of millions, but an estimated $446 million. Critical services could be reduced or eliminated entirely – from schools to sanitation, from medicine to microfinance to food security for some 1.7 million refugees in abject poverty or affected by conflict.

‘This would have severe impacts – a cascade of problems that could push the suffering in disastrous and unpredictable directions.

‘So today I ask you to bridge the Agency’s shortfall for 2018 with predictable, sustained and additional funding.’

18,palestine,"BEIRUT: Lebanon will set the stage for a group of stilt- walkers who will cover a distance of 100 km starting at 10 am on April 23, with the goal of shedding light on the suffering taking place in Palestine.



Stilt walking was practiced in ancient Greece as far back as the 6th century BC, with stilts being poles equipped with platforms for an individual to stand on.

Zaher Adwan and Mohamad Jammoul are two out of five stilt walkers who will be walking from Martyr’s Square in Beirut to South Lebanon, in a show of solidarity they called “Against Injustice.”

The group added that others familiar with the art of stilt walking are welcome to join in the demonstration march.

Adwan, a 25-year old stilt-walker and actor tells Annahar that “this is a way of showing solidarity with Palestine, and this is how are able to express ourselves.”

How would stilt-walking show solidarity though?

Adwan explains that “in order to do perform this task, and complete this distance, it needs lots of effort. So, every one hour of stilt walking is equal to two or more hour’s normal walking,” so the effort done is to show that anyone can take action from where they are and what they can do.

He adds that everything he does in life has a message behind it.

“Sometimes it’s just for entertaining people, and at other times, it would be for a cause,” he says, adding that “entertainment and drawing smiles is a cause by itself, since making people happy is one of the greatest causes.”

The young man saw in stilt walking a unique sport and adventure he loves. “It felt like another life for me,” he says, adding that it all started when he joined a workshop a few years back.

On the activity starting on the 23rd, they will be walking for about 20 to 24 hours, and will divide the hours in a way that permits the stilt walker to walk 10 hours per day and then rest in Tyre before continuing their journey.

The second day will be the hardest though, since the terrain will be more challenging.

Given the fact that he’s been a stilt walker for seven years, Adwan doesn’t need lots of preparation, but will only see how much distance he can cover in an hour to predict better.

Two days before the walk, the stilt walkers are expected to rest their bodies, in order to be both mentally and physically ready for the challenge ahead.

The stilt walkers aim to shed light on the Palestinian cause. “If we were able to do that, we will encourage other people to do it.”

After all, resistance has many forms, and stilt walking could be considered a form of modern-day resistance, activists note.

There will be no direct benefit for Palestine, yet the fact that there are people getting killed in their own land, is a humanitarian cause, and the artists do not want to politicize it.

“The Arabs and the world should wake up and defend a just cause where people are fighting the occupier by throwing rocks to defend themselves from advanced weapons,” Adwan says.

He noted that “Palestinians have been resisting for a long time, and there should be more solidarity with them, so that they know that not everyone has forgotten the Palestinian cause.”

“Our message is always about happiness and love,” Adwan says.

Mohamad Jammoul, a stilt walker and trainer for almost a decade, tells Annahar that his team, called “Jokers,” is the first in the MENA region to be performing extreme stilt walking. “We used the stilt for dancing, acting and other things as well,” he says.

The walk for Palestine, he says, is a way to prove themselves in their craft, and to support Palestine in their own way.

In days gone by, the team, which includes seven individuals from all sects and religions in Lebanon, has supported many causes in Lebanon in several regions.

“If everyone works more for humanity, we will succeed,” Jammoul says.

The 25-year-old theater graduate is adamant that smiles and goodwill can help Palestine.

He says that “Wherever there is injustice in the world, we will be there to fight it in our way,” mentioning that the team used to walk every year on independence day in Lebanon on Beirut’s seaside, aiming to unify the Lebanese people under one flag.

The feedback they used to get from people was their laughs and smiles while watching the crazy stilt show.

Joker’s next activity will be in solidarity with Syria.

“Perhaps people aren’t convinced by any message being delivered from someone ordinary, Jammoul says. “They admire people who are somehow different and are convinced by the messages they deliver.”

What has been happening in Palestine in the past few weeks as part of the Great Return March has driven many people in the world to take action in solidarity with a country that has been occupied since 1948.





25- year old Benjamin Ladraa, from Sweden, began a 4,800-kilometer journey on August 5, 2017, from Sweden to the Palestinian territories in order to raise awareness for the injustice.

In an interview with “The Jerusalem Post”, Ladraa mentioned that the goal of the walk was to “shine a light and bring attention to the situation and hopefully inspire more people to do something about the occupation.”

19,palestine,"Tightly wound and anticipating trouble, Israeli troops opened fire before the Gaza border protests had even begun. The Palestinian health ministry said Omar Samour, a 31-year-old farmer, was picking parsley in his field near Khan Yunis early on Friday morning when he was killed. Another farmer was injured by shrapnel. Israel’s military later confirmed its tanks had fired at “suspicious figures” on the border.

Samour’s death was a grim augury of what was to come. As Palestinians observed a day of mourning on Saturday, both sides warned of possible escalation in the weeks ahead. But a bigger question is exercising regional analysts. Will this violent yet long-predicted rekindling of the Israel-Palestine conflict trigger a wider crisis drawing in Lebanon, Syria and Iran?

The absence of a credible peace process underlies the latest confrontation, as happened in 2000 when the second intifada began, and again in 2014. Once again, Hamas and its supporters in Gaza, blockaded by Israel and Egypt and at odds with their Fatah rivals in the West Bank, are using mass civilian protest to end their isolation. Once again, Israel’s rightwing leaders, unwilling or unable to contemplate a two-state solution, compound myopic intransigence with a disproportionate use of force.

The dangerous difference now is timing and context. Friday was the start of six weeks of protests leading up to the 70th anniversary of Nakba day on 15 May, literally the “catastrophe”, as Arabs see it, that followed Israel’s declaration of independence on 14 May, 1948. The US will also move its embassy to Jerusalem in May, effectively recognising the city as Israel’s sovereign capital while ignoring Palestine’s claims. In short, a spring season of looming flashpoints is now begun.

Historical precedents also suggest local confrontations produce negative, region-wide reactions. The biggest worry is Lebanon, where Hezbollah, Israel’s sworn foe and Iran’s close ally, is the dominant political and military force. Strains are already apparent over Israel’s erection of a Gaza-style fence on its northern border and over disputed offshore oil and gas fields.

But for Israel’s generals, the main threat is Hezbollah’s modernised stockpile of an estimated 130,000 short-, medium- and long-range missiles and rockets, and its 50,000 fighters, many of them battle-hardened in Syria.

If the Gaza violence continues and spreads, Hezbollah hardliners can be expected to try to intervene. Iran’s leadership has repeatedly warned, in turn, that unlike the last Lebanon war in 2006, it will directly assist Hezbollah in any fight. Israel, it says, will be “eradicated”.

And Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has made plain, to Russia’s Vladimir Putin among others, that current efforts by Iran to create a permanent military presence in Syria and Lebanon cross an Israeli red line. Netanyahu recently underscored his stance by shooting down an Iranian drone and launching air raids on Syrian bases used by Iran.

Previous checks and balances are missing. It is no use looking to the UN security council. When it met in “emergency” session on Friday night to discuss Gaza, it could not even agree a joint statement. Saudi Arabia, which once pursued its own peace plan, is firmly (though tacitly) in the pro-Israel, anti-Iran camp. Likewise Egypt, where Sisi obsesses about jihadists, not justice.

Urging the Americans to step in as honest broker is a waste of breath, too. On this subject, Donald Trump has shown himself to be as ignorant as he is partisan.

20,palestine,"“If the concept of intervention is driven by universal human rights, why is it — from the people who identify themselves as liberal interventionists — why do we never hear a peep, a word, about intervening to protect the Palestinians?”

That was the question I put to the French philosopher, author, and champion of liberal (or humanitarian) interventionism, Bernard-Henri Lévy, on my Al Jazeera English interview show “Head to Head” in 2013.

The usually silver-tongued Levy struggled to answer the question. The situation in Palestine is “not the same” as in Syria and “you have not all the good on one side and all the bad on the other side,” said Levy, who once remarked in reference to the Israeli Defense Forces, or IDF, that he had “never seen such a democratic army, which asks itself so many moral questions.”

I couldn’t help but be reminded of my exchange with the man known as “BHL” this past weekend, as I watched horrific images of unarmed Palestinian protesters at the Gaza border being shot in the back by the “democratic army” of Israel. How many “moral questions” did those Israeli snipers ask themselves, I wondered, before they gunned down Gazan refugees for daring to demand a return to their homes inside the Green Line?

On Friday, the IDF shot an astonishing 773 people with live ammunition, killing 17 of them. Yet a spokesperson for the IDF bragged that Israeli troops “arrived prepared” and “everything was accurate. … We know where every bullet landed.” On Sunday, Israel’s hawkish defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, roundly rejected calls from the European Union and the United Nations for an independent inquiry into the violence and insisted that “our soldiers deserve a commendation.”

To be clear, then: Israeli troops will continue to murder and maim Palestinians while the Israeli government guarantees that there will be no consequences for their actions.

So, where is the outcry from liberal interventionists across the West? Where is BHL, as Palestinians are being shot and wounded in the hundreds in 2018?

Where is the call from former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose 1999 speech in Chicago defending the concept of a “just war” and a “doctrine of the international community” became a key text for liberal interventionists, for a “no-fly” zone over Gaza? Why does a guest speaker at Ariel Sharon’s funeral have nothing to say about the increasing number of Palestinian funerals?

Where is the moral outrage from former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, the famously pro-intervention, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a “A Problem From Hell,” which lamented U.S. inaction in Rwanda, over the sheer number of unarmed Palestinians shot, killed, and injured in recent days? How does she have time to retweet a picture of an elephant and a lion cub, but not to make a statement about the violence in Gaza?

Where is the demand from Canadian academic-turned-politician Michael Ignatieff, who was once one of the loudest voices in favor of the so-called responsibility to protect doctrine, for peacekeeping troops to be deployed to the Occupied Territories?

Where are the righteously angry op-eds from Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, or Richard Cohen of the Washington Post, or David Aaronovitch of The Times of London, demanding concrete action against the human rights abusers of the IDF?

And where is the appeal from former U.S. Secretary of State and arch-interventionist Madeleine Albright for economic and financial sanctions against the state of Israel? For an arms embargo? For travel bans on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Lieberman, and IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot?

Their silence is deafening — and telling. Palestinians, it seems, have been so dehumanized that they don’t deserve a humanitarian intervention; their blood is cheap, their plight is unimportant, and, perhaps above all else, their killers are our friends.

Should we really be surprised, though? After all, this isn’t the first time that members of the liberal intervention brigade have shamelessly ignored the tragic deaths of innocent Palestinians.

In March 2001, towards the start of the “Second Intifada,” and with the Palestinian civilian death toll mounting, the U.N. Security Council proposed a resolution that would have “set up an appropriate mechanism to protect Palestinian civilians, including through the establishment of a United Nations observer force” on the ground in the Occupied Territories. The United States, however, in the form of the George W. Bush administration, vetoed that resolution. What was the response from U.S. liberals? They stayed mum.

In the summer of 2014, the Israeli air force — for the third time in six years — pounded the Gaza Strip, dropping bombs on schools, hospitals, and apartment buildings, and killing more than 1,500 Palestinian civilians — including 500 children — in the process. What was the position of then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (who would later throw her support behind a “no-fly” zone over Syria)? “Hamas provoked another attack” while “Israel has a right to defend itself.” And what was the response from her fellow liberals? Most of them didn’t say a word.

Fast forward to 2018: This time round, 17 dead and 1,400 wounded. Videos going viral of Israeli soldiers — armed and funded by U.S. taxpayers — shooting fleeing Palestinians in their backs. Again, not a peep on Twitter, or elsewhere, from the leaders of the Democratic Party in Congress, such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. For liberal Democrats, #resistance is supposed to be against the Trump administration and the so-called alt-right, not against the longest military occupation in the world.

This moral blindness that so many liberals and progressives in the United States have for the Palestinians has never ceased to amaze — or disgust — me. As the Israeli writer and economist Abraham Gutman notes, “This blind spot is so pronounced that it created a whole new type of progressive, the PEP, ‘Progressive-Except-on-Palestine.’” The PEP, he continues, “is horrified by the appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, but willing to argue that there is nuance and perhaps support the government of Israel, with [Ayelet] Shaked as the Minister of Justice, who posted on Facebook an article calling Palestinian children ‘little snakes.’”

Indeed. The PEP will loudly condemn the bigotry and nativism of the Republican Party in the United States, and the ongoing segregation and racism in the Deep South, while averting their gaze from the brazen racism of the Israeli government and the ongoing apartheid in the Occupied Territories.

The PEP rails against Trump and his hawkish minions while standing to applaud Netanyahu or smiling in photos with Lieberman — this despite the fact that the similarities between the Trump and Netanyahu administrations have been well–documented.

And the PEP who happens to be a proud supporter of liberal interventionism will back interventions almost everywhere except the Occupied Territories. Their heart bleeds for Syrians, Libyans, Afghans, Iraqis, Rwandans, Kosovars … but not for Palestinians.

This is not an exercise in whataboutism; it is about drawing attention to blatant double standards and moral hypocrisy. On Palestine, liberal interventionists who happen to be “progressive-except-on-Palestine” borrow from the Trump playbook when they cynically blame “both sides” for the violence. They claim that Palestinian deaths are the consequence of “clashes” and “confrontations.” Yet the reality is that one side is the occupier and the other is the occupied; one side has rockets and rifles and the other side has rocks and slingshots; one side is doing the killing and the other side is doing the dying.

There is no other conclusion: The ongoing and glaring refusal of liberal interventionists in the West to say even a word about the need to protect occupied Palestinians from state-sponsored violence is a reminder of just how morally bankrupt and cynically hypocritical the whole “liberal intervention” shtick is.",Israel Kills Palestinians and Western Liberals Shrug.

21,palestine,"Support for Palestinian rights and pro-Palestine student organizations at Georgetown University is too often unnecessarily and undeservedly derided. And while this problem is not exclusive to Georgetown, what is unjust beyond our campus remains unjust within it.

Last week, a Palestinian flag was hung in Red Square by pro-Palestine student organization Students for Justice in Palestine to honor the 17 lives lost during the peaceful protests in Gaza and to commemorate Israeli Apartheid Week, a series of events, lectures and rallies meant to raise awareness of Israel’s apartheid system over the Palestinian people. The flag was torn down, only to be found by the side of the road a few hours later. This desecration is, of course, a bias incident. However, this problem reaches far beyond a single act — or even a short-term pattern.

At Georgetown, support for Palestine is often treated as a lost cause. Indeed, it has come to my attention, and the attention of many Palestine-supporters on campus, that little to no attention is paid to Palestine-related bias incidents. After all, it is one thing to tear down a flag, but quite another thing to leave it on the side of the road, to equate support for Palestine in its entirety on campus to anti-Semitism, to spread false accusations about a student organization or to send death threats to the leaders of those organizations — which Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), former president of SJP, has received in the past — and not be penalized.

When pro-Palestine student organizations — such as SJP or GU Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment, a group of students and faculty that have held Georgetown accountable for the university’s role in perpetuating state violence as it refuses to divest from companies that enable and profit from the Israeli occupation of Palestine — host a public event about Palestinian rights, the result is almost always the same: Vandalism and a reminder about the impossibility of speaking about Palestinian rights on our campus without receiving a hard slap in the face in return.

The most prevalent example of this bigotry arose during Israeli Apartheid Week in 2016, when a group of students sabotaged the Israeli Apartheid bulletin board, which was placed in front of the Dean’s Office in the Intercultural Center to symbolize apartheid. The posters on the board were not only defaced, but were also tarnished with a series of offensive slurs and hateful, anti-Palestine messages. While the incident was addressed by Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber and was covered by several news outlets, it did not receive administrative attention and was ultimately overlooked.

Another example occurred soon after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December — an action not only reversing seven decades of American foreign policy, but also denying Palestinians the right to their native land. A group of students poured water over the statements chalked on Red Square tiles in support of Palestine and Palestinians. Members of SJP had to rechalk the statements the next day to show Palestinian students on campus they were not alone. Even as they were doing so, the members were verbally harassed by passers-by.

To further examine the Georgetown community’s fear of and intolerance toward pro-Palestine activity, I finally turn to SJP’s recent Facebook post asking Georgetown to “act on the principles to which it owes its clout by enacting a zero tolerance policy for petty actions that directly target Georgetown’s student population.”

While other bias incidents, such as last semester’s abhorrent anti-Semitic and Islamophobic acts, have been heard and responded to, today this plea been swept under the rug by the university’s general antipathy toward Palestinian rights organizations. As a result, SJP revealed in a recent statement that it is now “seeking outside legal aid.”

While I want to believe Georgetown’s commitment to social justice and free speech holds true, I have time and time again seen the university systematically disdain Palestinian Georgetown students and supporters of Palestine. And while I believe that the lines must be drawn at some point, let us be reminded that this is only a gist of what it is like to be Palestinian, where your cause is constantly devalued and your voice is unheard.
