0,palestine,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian eyes are on the Yarmouk refugee camp just south of Damascus, where the Syrian regime and its supporting Palestinian factions, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are fighting Islamic State (IS) militants. On May 2, the Syrian army was able to deploy troops around the area, which was previously controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra.

In April 2015, IS had control of 90% of the camp after fighting with Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis and gunmen from various factions.

The Palestinians hope for a quick end to the military operations in the camp, with IS’ defeat and the liberation of the camp. This will allow the reconstruction process to begin and the displaced to return. To that end, Palestinians seem to be betting on good relations between the PLO and the Syrian government.

On April 25, the director of the political department of the PLO in Syria, Anwar Abdel Hadi, revealed to the Voice of Palestine that he met with Syrian Minister of State for National Reconciliation Affairs Ali Haidar and UN Resident Coordinator in Syria Ali al-Zaatari and discussed the need to provide assistance and support for refugees and to begin reconstruction in refugee camps in Syria to ensure the refugees’ safe return once the militants are eradicated.

Haidar had stressed in several meetings with Palestinian delegations — most recently on June 7 and Sept. 25, 2017 — that the Syrian army was working on a plan to rid the camp of militants and allow people back, noting that Syria is keen to preserve refugee camps as a focal point of the Palestinian cause.

Ahmad Majdalani, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' envoy to Syria and a member of the PLO’s Executive Committee, told Al-Monitor, “There was a decision to establish a PLO committee to manage the reconstruction of the camp,” adding, “The committee will raise funds for reconstruction and the return of the camp’s residents, coordinating with the Syrian authorities.”

Majdalani explained that the committee is waiting for the end of the military operations between the Syrian army and the militants and the clearing of the rubble to begin its operations.

After getting a clearer idea of the magnitude of the damage, the PLO will coordinate with the Syrian authorities on the details of the reconstruction process and with international parties to bring in support and funding for reconstruction. It may also run a fundraising campaign among Palestinians.

The Yarmouk camp is one of the largest Palestinian camps in Syria and some consider it the capital of the diaspora. It was established in the 1950s and hosted 200,000 refugees before violence erupted at the beginning of the Syrian crisis that left IS in control.

Meanwhile, Abdel Hadi told Al-Monitor on the sidelines of the PLO National Council session in Ramallah held April 30-May 3, “The national committee will work on the reconstruction of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria under the auspices of the PLO.”

He added, “We have contacted relief agencies such as the UNRWA and some donor countries such as Norway, and they are ready to help finance the reconstruction. Coordination with the Syrian authorities is ongoing and they have agreed to start reconstruction after clearing the camp of terrorists.” Abdel Hadi noted, “The committee will meet with the Palestinian factions and the rest of the parties to determine details of the reconstruction process after the camp is fully liberated.”

In addition to Yarmouk, several other camps are in need of reconstruction, such as Daraa and Sabinah in southern Rif Dimashq governorate as well as Handarat in Aleppo.

The Palestinians are counting on starting reconstruction in the camp immediately after the clashes end, taking advantage of international eagerness to make donations for reconstruction in Syria. Most recently, the UN Brussels Conference on April 25 allocated $4.4 billion to all Syria. On May 31, 2017, Norway pledged to assist in the reconstruction of the camp’s infrastructure in cooperation with UNRWA after calm is re-established in the area.

The Palestinians are betting the camp's reconstruction will become a top priority for the Syrian government for various reasons. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's central information officer, Anwar Raja, told Al-Monitor, “Reconstruction is inevitable as the Syrian state removes rubble and starts working on infrastructure and reconstruction immediately upon the liberation of any area recaptured from militants,” as it did in Raqqa, for example.

He added, “The Yarmouk camp is more important than other areas, for Syrians or for Palestinians alike, for several reasons, such as its strategic location and proximity to Damascus. It is also an important commercial and economic market, not only for the Palestinians but also for low- and middle-income Syrians. Reconstruction and allowing residents back in the camp will alleviate social and economic problems and contribute to resolving the Syrian and Palestinian humanitarian crisis.”

He continued, “Palestinian factions discussed Yarmouk's reconstruction with the Syrian state. They were promised that rehabilitation works would kick off after the camp is liberated and all the wreckage of the war is cleaned out. This process only takes a few weeks and infrastructure will be first on the to-do list.”

Raja is not holding his breath for the PLO or international relief agencies to play an active role in the reconstruction process. “We do not expect the PLO to make significant contributions to Yarmouk's reconstruction because it is simply unable to do so. International bodies are providing support to Palestinians little by little, and are blackmailing them in return, not to mention UNRWA’s financial deficit,” adding, “The Syrian government has, however, promised to do its best to rebuild the camp as soon as possible.”

For his part, the secretary of the Alliance of Palestinian Resistance factions in Syria, Khaled Abdul Majid, said the destruction in Yarmouk is not as severe as some opposition parties might like to claim, asserting that reconstruction will proceed based on the Syrian government’s arrangements.

“There are understandings with Syria on opening offices for the Palestinian factions in the camp and on expediting the reconstruction pace in Yarmouk compared to other [Syrian] areas,” he told Al-Monitor. “International bodies such as Arab, Islamic and international relief organizations, in addition to businesses, will be funding the reconstruction process.”

Abdul Majid called on the PLO to assume a prominent role in reconstruction and mobilize Arab and international groups.

Despite the optimism, the reconstruction of the camp and the return of the displaced Palestinian refugees remain dependent on field developments in the camp and its surroundings, as well as the outcomes of the Syrian army’s battles against IS fighters and its capacity to liberate the camp and clear it of mines. Only after all this happens can the reconstruction process begin.",Palestinians to partner with Damascus on refugee camp reconstruction,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/palestinian-refugees-yarmouk-camp-liberation-reconstruction.html
1,palestine,"Stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties, the youth in Gaza are rising up.

Seventy years ago, more than 170,000 Palestinian from historic Palestine were forced to leave their homes, villages, cities and lands, as refugees to the Gaza Strip. They were part of the 710,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave, seeking refuge in Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere.

The images of elderly people and kids fleeing the killings of the Zionists gangs and militias in 1948, still occupy the vivid memories of Palestinians as well as comprising the visual identity of the Nakba (Catastrophe). Today, after seven decades, the grandsons and granddaughtersof those refugees are making their way back to their villages. They have never seen their villages, homes or land, but they kept the memories of their grandparents, linking their identity to their villages, vowing to return to their homes, relying on the international recognition of their right to return, and the moral responsibilities of their right.

The Great Return March is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza

The Great Return March (GRM) is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza, and the increasingly severe humanitarian crisis, but rather it is a protest against the Nakba, that has been ongoing since 1948. The young generation of Palestinians know that the current humanitarian crisis and the disintegration on the Palestinian system is a result of the Nakba, as well as thedehumanization and the apartheid that is institutionalized against the indigenous people of Palestine. Therefore, any discussion on the GRM should consider the protests as an action and a reaction. Action against the ongoing imprisonment of 1.8 million Palestinians in the Gaza strip for more than ten years, and a reaction to the apathy of the international community.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, forty Palestinian civilians were killed and 5511 were wounded since March 30. Two journalists were assassinated deliberately by the Israeli forces, despite each bearing a clear sign that they are journalists. In addition to this, hundreds of the wounded were children and minors. Each of the forty people who scarified themselves had a story to tell, and a mission to accomplish. They were humans, who loved, and were beloved bytheir families, friends and relatives.

One of those killed was Mohammed Ayoub, 15 years old from Jabbaliya, who was shot in the head in front of cameras, without threatening or causing any harm to the Israeli Army. In his photos there is one where he drew aheartbetween his initials and those of another person. He did not think that he would be a target ofan Israeli sniper who might have even cheered after shooting a civilian, as one video showed soldiers cheering as they were shooting at civilians. Mohamed died and left a story to remember.

Another person killed was the beloved journalist, Yasser Mourtaja, who was well- known in Gaza for his kindness tochildren and his professionalism as a photojournalist. Weeks before he was killed by the Israeli snipers despite wearing a vest marked by “PRESS”, he was awarded a USAID fund for his media organisation.

A third person lost was the artist Mohamed Abu Amro, who was shot in the head while participating in a nonviolent protest on the eastern borders of Gaza.

19 year old Abdulfatah Abdulnabi was running away from the fence between the besieged Gaza Strip and Israel, when an Israeli sniper shot him dead.

A video published by the Israeli media shows how the Israeli soldiers and army view the Palestinians. The video shows an Israeli Armyofficer asking one soldier to “shoot the guy in blue”, but the soldier tells him that he will take the one in red. This interaction shows how the Palestinians have been dehumanized by the Israelis, with the removal of their names, history, families, and humanity. The video illustrates the approach of the Israeli Army which sees millions of Palestinians as objects rather thanhumans. It is evidence that the conflict is not only about freedom, but also aboutlife.

This killing doctrine and the dehumanisation of the Palestinians can be seen clearly in the words of Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who said after nine Palestinians were killed that there were “no Innocent people in Gaza”.

The population of the Gaza Strip that has been under intense siege since January 2006 and has been suffering enormously. Since the early 1990s, Israel imposed movement restrictions on the Gaza Strip, where 1.8 million people live, making itone of the biggest open air prisons in the world.

It is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable

In 2015, a UN report warned that, under the current conditions, the Gaza Strip will be “uninhabitable” by 2020. However, it is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable.

The ongoing Israeli blockage, and the sanctions imposed by the Palestinian authority against the Gaza Strip, was the result of failed reconciliation efforts with Hamas. Since then the economy and life in Gaza has been crippled, with suffering growing rapidly. In 2015, the GDP in the Gaza Strip was 971 USD, while it was 5754 USD for the same period in the West Bank.

Comparatively in Israel it is at 44,019 USD. The unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip and West Bank reached 26.9% in 2016, with Gaza hardest hit at 41.7% unemployment compared to 18.2% in the West Bank. Yet, the real numbers of youth unemployment in Gaza have reached more than 75%. This shows the inequality that the Palestinians suffer compared to Israel, and also how the Gaza Strip is suffering from huge inequality compared to the West Bank.

The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are walking through a dark tunnel, with no end in sight. They are stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties. This reality pushes them to take the lead and organize nonviolent protests, shifting attention to the real cause of the problem, which started in 1948.

The youth of the Gaza Strip are rising up in the face of Israeli colonialism, and the status-quo, as well as an act of rejection ofthe political parties in the Gaza strip, including Hamas and Fatah. The youth in Gaza struggle for their dignity, and prefer to fight for life and die in dignity, rather than die slowly from the blockade.","The Palestinians in Gaza: fighting for life, struggling for rights",https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/abdalhadi-alijla/palestinians-in-gaza-fighting-for-life-struggling-for-rights
2,palestine,"Around 80% of the 32 Palestinians killed by the IDF during the ongoing Gaza border crisis were terrorist operatives or identified with terrorist organizations, an intelligence report asserts.



The report by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center said that 26 of the 32 Palestinians fit into those categories.





Nine of the dead Palestinians were part of military terrorist cells and four were part of Gazan security services, according to the report. The other 17 identified as connected with terrorist groups were so identified based on public statements made by various terrorist groups taking credit for the loyalties or activities of those individuals, the report said.The remaining six slain Palestinians were not mentioned by any terrorist groups and are presumed to have been civilians.The Meir Amit Center, located near Glilot, north of Tel Aviv, is viewed as unusually credible because it has ongoing connections to current military intelligence and is filled with top former Israeli intelligence officials.According to the report, five of the dead were part of Hamas’s Izzadin Kassam military wing, while four were part of security services controlled by Hamas. Hamas took credit for the loyalties and actions of another seven of the dead and their bodies were wrapped in Hamas flags.One of the dead was identified as being connected to Islamic Jihad’s military wing. Two of the dead were identified as operatives of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine – one as a military operative and one as a leader of the group in the Nuseirat refugee camp. One of the dead was identified with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.Six of the dead were both members of Fatah and involved in violent or provocative activities as part of the border standoff, according to the report and Meir Amit center director Reuven Ehrlich. Two were identified as operatives of the Aqsa Brigades, Fatah’s military wing. Four more were identified as members of Fatah when Fatah took credit for the connection and wrapped their bodies in Fatah flags.THE HIGH PROPORTION of persons identified with terrorist groups at the front showed that the protests and clashes are being orchestrated mostly by those groups and not by civilian leaders, the report said.According to the center, many of the dead were not merely celebrated by terrorist groups, but the terrorist groups published photos of them armed and in military clothing.Some of those killed were identified as being shot while trying to breach the border fence, during IDF attacks on Hamas lookout positions, and one, who was armed with a Kalashnikov and explosives, was shot by an IDF aerial vehicle.Slain photo journalist Yasir Murtaja was listed among those affiliated with terrorists, with the report repeating allegations about his holding the equivalent rank of captain, his past uses of drones to collect intelligence about IDF positions, and ongoing involvement with Hamas security services.All 32 of the dead except for two were men between the ages of 19 and 45 and none of them was among the original civilian protest organizers who were pushed aside by Hamas, Ehrlich told The Jerusalem Post.Ehrlich emphasized that this disproved accusations that Israel is targeting women and children and civilians generally.Two of the dead were minors with estimated ages of 14-16. While one of them was said to be part of Hamas’s student group, it was unclear under what circumstances they were killed and what justifications might be put forth.The report did acknowledge that regarding one of the dead, the family has disputed the IDF’s characterization of him as being connected to a terrorist group.Regarding a few of the dead, the report had more uncertain language, saying “it appears” that the individual was connected to a particular terrorist group. Some of these more borderline cases may account for the report identifying 80% of the dead as being connected with Hamas when an earlier report by the center said the percentage was at least as high as 60% (though that report said more research needed to be done). There have been situations in the past were terrorist groups have tried to claim “martyrs” as their operatives where that connection was debatable.The report added that there might be two additional dead Palestinians, but that details about those cases were still vague.",Report: 80% of Palestinians killed in Gaza border crisis were 'terrorists',https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-80-percent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Gaza-border-crisis-were-terrorists-549511

He continued: “What is happening in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, is nothing other than the efforts of tyranny to justify its oppressions, even to institutionalise them. ""The violence that the Israeli administration has recently inflicted on the Palestinians shows that tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day.” The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing battle between the two nations that started in the 20th century.

There has been constant shelling between the two sides over the last year as the conflict continues to escalate. The president also skewered the international community’s “indifference over the sufferings of Palestinians.” Mr Erdoğan said:“The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people in these Israeli attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society or individual will be safe.”

He also praised Turkey for its humanitarian aid work, contrasting the country with “great economic powers” motivated only by “economic, political or military interests.” Turkey has so far spent $31billion (£22.9billion) on Syrian refugees living in Turkey. Mr Erdoğan said: “Humanitarian aid, entirely an issue of conscience and morality, does not rely on money, oil, gold, or political power.

4,palestine,"A paralysed and indecisive Palestinian leadership, faced with mounting pressure from the Americans and Israelis, is undermining key national goals, analysts say.

They say the decisions taken by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) during its meeting in Ramallah last week show that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lacks the will to respond to American and Israeli efforts to thwart Palestinian statehood.

While in session, the PNC took several decisions including the redefinition of relations with Israel as one of ""conflict"".

It dismissed the PLO-Israel interim agreements signed in Washington and Cairo in the 1990s as ""expired"", and rejected the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

In the past, Abbas, 82, has repeatedly insisted that the path to achieving statehood for the Palestinians lies only through peace negotiations with Israel, not armed struggle.

'Strategic mistake'

On the face of it, the PNC decisions indicate a departure from the negotiations path, the analysts say.

However, in reality, the Palestinian leadership is too weak and fragmented to either withdraw from existing agreements with Israel or end the policy of treating peace negotiations as a strategic choice.

Mohamad Dalbah, a Washington-based Palestinian analyst, says the crisis confronting Palestinians today is rooted in the ""catastrophic"" Oslo agreement that Abbas and the late Yasser Arafat signed with Israel.

Oslo was a ""strategic mistake"" for the Palestinians, he told Al Jazeera, because it never stipulated the establishment of a Palestinian state and left open-ended the core issues of the status of Jerusalem and the right Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel in 1948.

In 1993 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo agreement with Israel and established an interim Palestinian Authority.

The Oslo Accords stipulated that within five years of the signing of the agreement - that is, in 1999 - both parties should enter into negotiations for the final-settlement status, including the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

Twenty-five years later, Palestinians and Israelis have yet to start any final settlement negotiations.

'Legally solid'

Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset, told Al Jazeera the decisions of the PNC are ""meaningless"" as long as the PA continues security coordination with Israel, which is the most important objective for Israel.

Zahalka said the current Palestinian condition, defined by a weak local government, is in the best interest of Israel but not the Palestinians because it is conducive to neither peace nor resistance.

By maintaining internal security in Palestinian areas on behalf of Israel, the PA reduces Israel's military burden of maintaining its military occupation.

However, Abdallah Abueid, a Palestinian legal expert, says the international position of the Palestinians in light of the PNC decisions is ""legally solid"".

This is because Israel has repeatedly violated the agreements, refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories and is unwilling to conclude final-status negotiations with the Palestinians, says Abueid, who teaches International law at Bethlehem University.

That being said, ""Palestinians are in a very precarious position today and are unable to move forward or even go backward if they wanted to"".

Zahalka, the Knesset member, says Palestinian leaders should now take a strategic decision to reinvigorate popular and peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation.

""Only then would Israel find itself compelled to end its illegal occupation,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Issue of successor

During its session in Ramallah, the PNC also re-elected Abbas president of the State of Palestine and chairman of the PLO.

It further elected 15 members of the executive committee out of 18 representing different Palestinian factions most of whom are Abbas loyalists.

Neither the PNC nor any governing body formally discussed the issue of a successor for the octogenarian Abbas, who is reportedly suffering from multiple ailments.

According to sources familiar with internal deliberations on the succession issue, Abbas supports the separation of the powers of the PLO, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, and the chairman of Fatah.

Abbas is in favour of having a different person to lead each body, the sources told Al Jazeera.

A four-day meeting of the PLO’s parliament, the Palestinian National Council, which was not attended by Abbas’s Islamist rivals Hamas, backed Abbas and selected a new leadership of the PLO’s executive committee.

“President Abu Mazen (Abbas) was nominated and unanimously approved as the president of the State of Palestine,” senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath told AFP.

“An executive committee was chosen and an executive council was chosen.”

The PLO, an umbrella group which is dominated by Abbas’s Fatah party and includes most Palestinian factions but not Hamas, represents the Palestinians internationally.

The first regular PNC meeting in 22 years was seen as an opportunity for 82-year-old Abbas to try to increase his legitimacy.

Although his term as president expired in 2009, infighting with Hamas has made elections impossible.

But the event was overshadowed by comments made by Abbas during his opening speech in which he appeared to blame Jewish behaviour for their persecution in Europe.

Israel, the European Union, United States and others lined up to criticise his words, which were labelled anti-Semitic.

In closing remarks early Friday, Abbas did not respond to the criticism.

He also did not directly address the upcoming US move of its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that prompted the Palestinians to boycott the Trump administration.

The new executive committee, the most senior body of the PLO and effectively Abbas’s cabinet, included nine new names out of 15.

A number of potential rivals, including Yasser Abed Rabbo, were removed.

The previously 18-member committee was kept to just 15 representatives to leave space for Hamas and two smaller parties that boycotted the event.

Some opposed the event being held in the West Bank, where Israel controls movement, and others wanted the meeting to be postponed until a later date.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dismissed the PNC meeting.

ISTANBUL

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on May 7 that the Palestinians were the “symbol of all oppressed people” in the world and Israeli attacks on them showed that “tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day.”

“What is happening in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, is nothing other than the efforts of tyranny to justify its oppressions, even to institutionalize them. The violence that the Israeli administration has recently inflicted on the Palestinians … shows that tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day,” Erdoğan said in a speech at the International Mount of Olives Peace Awards in Istanbul.

“The Palestinians are the symbol of all oppressed people in the world because of the persecution, massacres and injustices they have been subjected to,” he added.

The Turkish president said Palestinian women and children were most “exposed to the oppression of the Israeli administration,” paying the price “for wars and crises whose decisions are mostly not taken by them.”

“A significant number of Palestinian children are continuing their lives outside their homeland, in refugee camps or in other countries. Those who are able to stay in their homeland, meanwhile, are exposed to psychological and physical discrimination everywhere, from the moment they leave their house on the way to their schools, at checkpoints, in public transport, in educational institutions,” Erdoğan said.

He also slammed the international community’s “indifference over the sufferings of Palestinians.”

“The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people in these [Israeli] attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society or individual will be safe,” Erdoğan said, accusing international institutions responsible for ensuring peace and security in Palestine of “hypocrisy.”

He also praised Turkey for its humanitarian aid work, contrasting the country with “great economic powers” motivated only by “economic, political or military interests.”

“Humanitarian aid, entirely an issue of conscience and morality, does not rely on money, oil, gold, or political power,” Erdoğan said, noting that Turkey has so far spent $31 billion on Syrian refugees living in Turkey.

“Whatever anyone else does, as Turkey we will continue to use the facilities and opportunities we have in our hands for the benefit of humanity, especially our Palestinian, Syrian and African brothers. In a way appropriate to the orders of God and the inheritance left by our ancestors, wherever there is a victim we’ll worker harder to stand by them,” he said.

The Palestine cause is not an issue exclusive to any nation or city, Erdoğan said, suggesting that “the future of humanity will be determined according to the stance taken regarding the cause of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

A&E EDITOR

Palestine is the hottest foreign policy issue upon which no politician will act.

What needs to be absolutely clear is that the Palestinian humanitarian crisis is not a partisan issue. Both U.S. parties have made their stance crystal clear—neither are willing to confront the Israeli government on an ongoing apartheid taking place in occupied territory.

It would be a futile effort to explain the long, conflict-ridden history surrounding the region in a short newspaper article. However, readers should understand that this is a humanitarian issue above all else. Treating this as a geopolitical conflict with equally powerful sides is simply incorrect.

A common misconception about the Palestinian crisis is that the issue is too complex for the outside world to act. While the issue is highly complicated, that hardly justifies the global community’s inaction.

One of the most recent incidents of Israeli oppression occurred toward the end of March. According to Al Jazeera coverage, 17 Palestinians were killed and 1,400 were injured when the Israeli army engaged protestors. The march was calling for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homelands.

This military engagement with protestors is not uncommon. While this latest incident yielded more staggering casualties, the Israeli army frequently engages peaceful protests (or children throwing rocks) with rubber bullets, tear gas and occasionally live ammunition.

According to BBC’s Israel/Palestine event timeline, in December, President Donald Trump ordered that the U.S. government recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Additionally, the order called for the U.S. embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv—the city most countries recognize as Israel’s capital—to Jerusalem. The move hasn’t happened yet, but it’s scheduled to occur in the near future.

Jerusalem is one of the most culturally significant cities for several religions that have spread across the globe. Israel seized the city from Palestinian control in 1967, in a brutal military conflict known commonly as the Six Day War. Since assuming control of the city, countries have been reluctant to recognize it as Israel’s capital.

The president’s decision to recognize Jerusalem was met with immediate backlash on the world stage—and very little action outside of Palestine.

A comprehensive Reuters article published on Dec. 29, 2017 detailed Palestinian protests against the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem. No Israelis were hurt. Many Palestinian protesters were injured by Israeli soldiers. These incidents, after filtering through American media, are seen as clashes between equally-powerful opposing forces.

The fact that the president’s decision to move an embassy—essentially to prove a point—has caused serious injury should alarm Americans. United States leadership cannot continue to make irrational decisions that cause this harm.

It doesn’t matter how many other countries denounce Israel’s decimating of Palestine. Until the United States takes a stand, very little is going to change. This is a decision that is, unfortunately, in the American people’s hands. Plagued by misinformation and overwhelming complication, many Americans appear to be content with letting a U.S. sanctioned apartheid unravel across the sea.

This isn’t a matter of expanding U.S. influence in the Middle East, gaining the favor of Arab nations or endorsing a religious group. Taking action to resolve this conflict is about protecting innocent civilian lives.

There is no simple solution to century-old conflict that has plagued the region, but Americans have to take that first step. Raising awareness for the situation and pressuring government representation is the only way citizens can push for change overseas.",The U.S. must do more to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,https://unothegateway.com/u-s-must-resolve-israeli-palestinian-conflict/
9,palestine,"RAMALLAH – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed a US$1.6 million (CAD$2 million) contribution from the Government of Canada to support vulnerable non-refugee Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank.

The Canadian contribution will enable WFP to provide assistance for up to one month and a half for 100,000 of the poorest and most food-insecure people in Gaza and the West Bank through electronic vouchers, or cash-based transfers. Families will be able to use their electronic vouchers to buy nutritious and fresh foods at local retailers. A third of the families receiving assistance are headed by women.

“Thanks to our longstanding partnership with Canada, we can help tens of thousands of poor families facing acute hardships every year,” said WFP Country Director in Palestine Daniela Owen. “With so much suffering and challenges at their greatest, particularly in Gaza, WFP food assistance is one thing vulnerable Palestinians can count on. We greatly appreciate Canada’s support in making this assistance possible.”

The contribution will also allow WFP to hold nutrition and health awareness sessions for women, men and children receiving food assistance. Participants will attend interactive classes for six months where they can learn about the best practices to prepare healthy and vitamin-rich meals from the food they purchase with vouchers. The sessions have a proven positive impact on participants’ dietary habits such as reducing the consumption of sugar and fried food.

“Canada recognizes the vital work that WFP carries out in the West Bank and Gaza. As humanitarian conditions deteriorate and more people come to depend on food assistance, WFP is an important partner in meeting the daily needs of vulnerable Palestinians,” said Douglas Scott Proudfoot, Representative of Canada to the Palestinian Authority.

WFP’s assistance programme complements the national safety net for poor families who have exhausted all their resources in trying to cope with a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. Thanks to the support of Canada and other donors, WFP food vouchers cover approximately 60 percent of people’s daily calorie needs and free some of their limited income to spend on other basic needs such as healthcare, water and electricity.

Under its Country Strategy Plan for Palestine (2018-2022), WFP aims at providing electronic food vouchers and in-kind food to non-refugee families most affected by food insecurity, primarily in Gaza and Area C in the West Bank. People receiving WFP support live below the official national poverty line of less than US$4 per person per day.

WFP assistance also boosts the local economy through local purchase and electronic food vouchers. Since 2011, WFP has brought more than US$260 million into the Palestinian economy, including US$170 million through the use of electronic vouchers.

• During the first quarter of 2018, the deteriorating socio-economic situation in the Gaza Strip, characterized by shortages in the electricity and fuel supply, uncertainty in the funding of key services and renewed clashes has deepened the severe humanitarian situation for Palestinian children and their families.

• Ongoing demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have so far resulted in the death of 33 Palestinians, including three children (source: UN).

• In addition to 3,193 children reached with child protection and MHPSS services, psychosocial support was provided to 40 children directly affected.

• Two stocks of prepositioned essential drugs and medical consumables were released to cover emergency medical care for 111,532 children and their families.

• UNICEF supported the rehabilitation of water systems to improve access to safe drinking water in the most vulnerable communities of the Gaza Strip and of the West Bank. More than 24,640 people benefited from improved access to water as a result of UNICEF’s interventions in Gaza.

• UNICEF is currently supporting the training 180 pre-schools and 600 school teachers on positive discipline, in view of activating 60 school mediation teams as part of its non-violence programming.

• UNICEF and its partners provided protective accompaniment and presence to 5,400 children and 144 teachers crossing military checkpoints to and from schools in the West Bank.

• The current deterioration of the situation in Gaza and rising tensions in the West Bank require urgent funding for child protection, health and education interventions to address the growing humanitarian needs and funding gap of 72 percent.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tensions have been running high in the State of Palestine following the announcement of the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem at the end of December 2017, planned for 14 May 2018. This comes at a time when Gaza’s economy continues to deteriorate as the intra-Palestinian reconciliation process appears stalled, having brought no real improvement in the lives of children so far. On 13 March, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority’s convoy was hit by a roadside Improvised Explosive Device as he visited Gaza to inaugurate the new Northern Gaza Emergency Sanitation Treatment Plant.

In Gaza, families have access to less than five hours of electricity a day and continue to face difficulties to access safe drinking water. Added to a reduction in the salaries of civil servants, further cuts in services and strict movement restrictions, the situation has negatively affected the entire population of two million, half of them children, and deepened the humanitarian needs in terms of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and child protection services.

Every Friday since March 30, over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza have participated in demonstrations along the fence with Israel to protest the ten-year-old blockade and support the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees. While the protests were overall peaceful and most demonstrators did not approach the fence, 33 Palestinians have been killed, including three children (source: UN). According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 2,835 Palestinian have been injured, of which 277 are children. This is the highest number of casualties since the 2014 hostilities. In the West Bank, tensions have been running high since December, with clashes sporadically erupting in various parts of the territory. UNICEF has appealed to all actors to put the protection of children first.

The total number of people in need in 2018 is 2. 5 million, of which 90 per cent live in the Gaza Strip. 1.8 million people are in need of WASH services suffer from poor water quality due to poor infrastructure, restrictions on fuel supplies and acute power cuts. With the escalation in violence, injuries and deaths, more children are in need of mental health and psychosocial support.","State of Palestine: Humanitarian Situation Report, January – March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/state-palestine-humanitarian-situation-report-january-march-0

The MDM chapters working in Palestine expressed their deepest concern regarding Israel’s violent response against Palestinian civilians demonstrating near the perimeter fence with Israel in Gaza.

In the short span of only six Fridays, the Israeli army has killed 45 Palestinians, including four children, and injured more than 7,930 civilians protesting for their right to return. Furthermore, according to the WHO, more than 99 healthcare staff have been injured and 18 ambulances have been damaged as a result of the violent response.

So far, the hospitals in Gaza have treated 4,045 victims with severe injuries, 18 per cent of them are under age and less than half of the urgent patients requiring referral to other hospitals outside Gaza have received the necessary exit permit from Israel. The high number of emergency cases is challenging hospitals’ capacity and putting on hold thousands of elective surgeries.

The excessive use of force against Palestinians demonstrating in Gaza is a violation of the right to life, health and freedom of assembly. To this date, the use of live ammunition has severely injured 2,178 civilians. The majority of gunshot wounds have been to lower limbs, causing severe orthopaedic and vascular injuries leaving hundreds of the victims handicapped.

This crisis comes on top of a protracted situation. For over 11 years the Israeli government has imposed a strict land, air and sea military blockade to Gaza. Qualified as a violation of international humanitarian law, this collective punishment has had disastrous consequences on the daily life of millions of Palestinians. While the availability of goods is the most visible aspect, the impacts of the blockade are ubiquitous along the Strip and felt every single day. Health services in particular are constantly struggling to cope with the increasing problems:

Water pollution and lack of potable water represent an imminent risk of waterborne diseases.

Almost half of the essential drugs and disposables are constantly unavailable.

Electricity cuts limit the regular provision to four hours, and therefore hampering the quality and services primary health centres and hospitals provide.

Present in Gaza for over 16 years, MDM medical teams have been working with volunteers, primary health centre staff and emergency departments of six hospitals improving emergency preparedness, as well as providing paediatric orthopaedic surgeries.

The three MDM Chapters in Palestine, namely Doctors of the World France, Spain and Switzerland, condemn Israel’s excessive use of force against healthcare staff and civilians demonstrating in the Gaza Strip since March 30 and adhere to the international call for an independent investigation of each incident.

MDM chapters call for the absolute respect to the right to health, in particular eliminating any obstacle to access to health services outside the Gaza strip.

Finally, the MDM chapters urge the European Union to take concrete measures in order to implement the EU Parliament resolution 2018/2663(RSP)calling for the immediate and unconditional end to the blockade and closure of the Gaza Strip.","MDM: In six Fridays, Israel has killed 45 Palestinians – PNN",http://english.pnn.ps/2018/05/08/mdm-in-six-fridays-israel-has-killed-45-palestinians/
12,palestine,"Speaking at the International Mount of Olives Peace Awards at the Cemal Resit Rey Concert Hall in Istanbul, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said:

Palestinians are the symbol of all oppressed people in the world because of the persecution, massacres, and injustices they have been subjected to.

Erdogan said the Palestine cause was not an exclusive issue of a nation or a city, adding that the future of humanity would be determined according to its stance against the Palestine and Jerusalem cause, reports Anadolu Agency.

“If the reverse happens, a dark future will be awaiting us, one in which all rights, freedoms, and moral and conscientious measures are absent or eliminated and in which tyranny prevails.”

Erdogan said what was happening in Palestine was the legitimization of tyranny, highlighting Israel’s mounting persecution against Palestinians whose sole guilt was trying to defend their own land.

The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people during these [Israeli] attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society and individual will be safe.

Erdogan accused the international institutions responsible for ensuring peace and security in Palestine, calling them “hypocrites”.

He also stressed that when it came to delivering aid, great economic powers fiercely competing with each other whenever an economic, political or military interest was at stake had fallen behind Turkey.

13,palestine,"David M. Friedman, the United States ambassador to Israel, said Mr. Abbas had “reached a new low,” adding, “To all those who think Israel is the reason that we don’t have peace, think again.”

Mr. Abbas is presiding over the first regular meeting of the Palestine National Council in 22 years. It may well be his last. (The council convened for a more limited, “extraordinary” session in 2009 to replace six members of its 18-member executive committee who had died in the meantime.)

On the eve of the four-day gathering of about 700 council delegates in Ramallah, an Abbas adviser promoted it as a historic meeting dedicated to Palestinian unity, democracy and setting strategy for the coming months and years.

It seemed to have started out as anything but that.

Instead, it was taking place with a deeply splintered Palestinian leadership that has turned away from Washington because of President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and is largely disconnected from its own public. A March opinion poll found that 68 percent of Palestinians want Mr. Abbas to resign from office.

The Palestinian Authority has looked on while its archrival, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, has seized the popular initiative and focused international attention on the isolated and impoverished coastal enclave with its promotion of the so-called Great Return March. More than 40 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds have been wounded, many shot in the legs, by Israeli snipers over the past month during partly peaceful, partly violent protests along the Gaza border.

Mr. Abbas has long advocated nonviolent popular resistance against the Israeli occupation but is also wary of protests, fearing they could spiral out of control and be detrimental to the cause, or even turn against him, according to experts.

So he has found himself in the awkward position of trying to both pay lip service to, and dampen the enthusiasm for, the Gaza protests. In his speech he warned the children of Gaza to stay away from the border fence because “I do not want a disabled generation.”",Palestinian Leader Incites Uproar With Speech Condemned as Anti-Semitic,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/middleeast/palestinians-abbas-israel-jews.html
14,palestine,"In a remarks Sunday in Tel Aviv while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Pompeo mentioned that the boundaries of Jerusalem should still be the subject of negotiations between the parties. “We remain committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future for both Israel and the Palestinians,” he said.

But the escalating protests along the border between Gaza and Israel — which have led to hundreds of injuries and 46 deaths and have generated global sympathy for the Palestinian cause — went unmentioned.

“No meeting in Ramallah on his first visit sets an ominous tone about prospects for any progress, or even dialogue, with the Palestinians,” said Daniel B. Shapiro, an American ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration.

Aaron David Miller, a former negotiator for the United States in the Middle East, said Mr. Pompeo’s seeming indifference toward the Palestinians “at the very least suggests a casual disregard of the Israeli-Palestinian explosion that may be building and the U.S.’s inability or unwillingness to influence the course of events.”

Instead of discussing the Palestinian issue, Mr. Pompeo’s focused message on his sweep through the region has been a denunciation of Iran. He met with Saudi leaders on Saturday and Sunday morning, and they all agreed that Iran is a destabilizing force. He met on Sunday afternoon with Mr. Netanyahu, who blistered Iran alongside Mr. Pompeo.

And on Monday, he is scheduled to meet King Abdullah of Jordan in Amman, when Iran is again likely to be the most important subject of conversation.

In two weeks, Mr. Trump is expected to walk away from the Iran nuclear accord, which he has denounced as “the worst ever.” Countering Iran has become one of the few unambiguous policy themes of the administration.

Mr. Trump and his advisers disagree on how to confront Moscow. A potential trade war with China has caused deep unease across the Midwest. The administration’s policy on Syria is in flux. And North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is suddenly looking like a statesman.

But there is consensus that Iran needs to be opposed, and Mr. Pompeo hammered away at them Sunday.

“We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region, and Iran’s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains,” Mr. Pompeo said beside a delighted Mr. Netanyahu. “The United States is with Israel in this fight. And we strongly support Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself.”

As for the nuclear accord, “President Trump made it pretty clear: This deal is very flawed,” Mr. Pompeo said.

“He’s directed the administration to try to fix it,” he said. “And if we can’t fix it, he’s going to withdraw from the deal. It’s pretty straightforward.”

Mr. Netanyahu agreed. “Mr. Secretary,” he said, “I think the greatest threat to the world and to our two countries — and to all countries — is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons, and specifically the attempt of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.”

United States officials and international inspectors agree that Iran is abiding by the nuclear deal, which has substantially degraded the country’s ability to pursue nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have said the country may restart its nuclear program if the United States withdraws from the nuclear accord.

On May 14, the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, the United States will formally open its embassy in Jerusalem, and a host of American dignitaries are expected. Mr. Trump has suggested he may come.

But that opening also coincides with the time that Palestinian protests are expected to crest, coming on the eve of the Palestinian commemoration of the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes and became refugees during the hostilities surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948.

The first senior American official to feel the Palestinians’ furor over the Jerusalem decision was Vice President Mike Pence, who postponed what was expected to be an emotional visit over the Christmas holidays after several Christian leaders in the region refused to meet him. When he finally made it in January, the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, boycotted him.

Since nothing has been done to assuage the Palestinians in the meantime, Mr. Pompeo could have expected the same treatment.

“We refused to see Mr. Pence twice,” said Nabil Shaath, an Abbas adviser on international relations. He added: “We have declared our position and we don’t accept an American role in unilaterally controlling the peace process. To us, Trump is irrelevant, whether he announces the deal of the century or not.”

On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O.’s legislative body, is scheduled to hold its first formal meeting in nine years. If Mr. Pompeo had a strategy to bridge the divide, he could hardly have picked a better moment to address the movement’s leadership.

Instead, he will fly home Monday after seeing King Abdullah.",Pompeo and Palestinians Have ‘Nothing to Discuss’ Amid Gaza Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-israel-palestinians.html
