A four-day meeting of the PLO’s parliament, the Palestinian National Council, which was not attended by Abbas’s Islamist rivals Hamas, backed Abbas and selected a new leadership of the PLO’s executive committee.

“President Abu Mazen (Abbas) was nominated and unanimously approved as the president of the State of Palestine,” senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath told AFP.

“An executive committee was chosen and an executive council was chosen.”

The PLO, an umbrella group which is dominated by Abbas’s Fatah party and includes most Palestinian factions but not Hamas, represents the Palestinians internationally.

The first regular PNC meeting in 22 years was seen as an opportunity for 82-year-old Abbas to try to increase his legitimacy.

Although his term as president expired in 2009, infighting with Hamas has made elections impossible.

But the event was overshadowed by comments made by Abbas during his opening speech in which he appeared to blame Jewish behaviour for their persecution in Europe.

Israel, the European Union, United States and others lined up to criticise his words, which were labelled anti-Semitic.

In closing remarks early Friday, Abbas did not respond to the criticism.

He also did not directly address the upcoming US move of its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that prompted the Palestinians to boycott the Trump administration.

The new executive committee, the most senior body of the PLO and effectively Abbas’s cabinet, included nine new names out of 15.

A number of potential rivals, including Yasser Abed Rabbo, were removed.

The previously 18-member committee was kept to just 15 representatives to leave space for Hamas and two smaller parties that boycotted the event.

Some opposed the event being held in the West Bank, where Israel controls movement, and others wanted the meeting to be postponed until a later date.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dismissed the PNC meeting.

A reconciliation deal signed by Hamas and Abbas’s Fatah party in October has collapsed.

• During the first quarter of 2018, the deteriorating socio-economic situation in the Gaza Strip, characterized by shortages in the electricity and fuel supply, uncertainty in the funding of key services and renewed clashes has deepened the severe humanitarian situation for Palestinian children and their families.

• Ongoing demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have so far resulted in the death of 33 Palestinians, including three children (source: UN).

• In addition to 3,193 children reached with child protection and MHPSS services, psychosocial support was provided to 40 children directly affected.

• Two stocks of prepositioned essential drugs and medical consumables were released to cover emergency medical care for 111,532 children and their families.

• UNICEF supported the rehabilitation of water systems to improve access to safe drinking water in the most vulnerable communities of the Gaza Strip and of the West Bank. More than 24,640 people benefited from improved access to water as a result of UNICEF’s interventions in Gaza.

• UNICEF is currently supporting the training 180 pre-schools and 600 school teachers on positive discipline, in view of activating 60 school mediation teams as part of its non-violence programming.

• UNICEF and its partners provided protective accompaniment and presence to 5,400 children and 144 teachers crossing military checkpoints to and from schools in the West Bank.

• The current deterioration of the situation in Gaza and rising tensions in the West Bank require urgent funding for child protection, health and education interventions to address the growing humanitarian needs and funding gap of 72 percent.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tensions have been running high in the State of Palestine following the announcement of the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem at the end of December 2017, planned for 14 May 2018. This comes at a time when Gaza’s economy continues to deteriorate as the intra-Palestinian reconciliation process appears stalled, having brought no real improvement in the lives of children so far. On 13 March, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority’s convoy was hit by a roadside Improvised Explosive Device as he visited Gaza to inaugurate the new Northern Gaza Emergency Sanitation Treatment Plant.

In Gaza, families have access to less than five hours of electricity a day and continue to face difficulties to access safe drinking water. Added to a reduction in the salaries of civil servants, further cuts in services and strict movement restrictions, the situation has negatively affected the entire population of two million, half of them children, and deepened the humanitarian needs in terms of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and child protection services.

Every Friday since March 30, over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza have participated in demonstrations along the fence with Israel to protest the ten-year-old blockade and support the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees. While the protests were overall peaceful and most demonstrators did not approach the fence, 33 Palestinians have been killed, including three children (source: UN). According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 2,835 Palestinian have been injured, of which 277 are children. This is the highest number of casualties since the 2014 hostilities. In the West Bank, tensions have been running high since December, with clashes sporadically erupting in various parts of the territory. UNICEF has appealed to all actors to put the protection of children first.

The total number of people in need in 2018 is 2. 5 million, of which 90 per cent live in the Gaza Strip. 1.8 million people are in need of WASH services suffer from poor water quality due to poor infrastructure, restrictions on fuel supplies and acute power cuts. With the escalation in violence, injuries and deaths, more children are in need of mental health and psychosocial support.","State of Palestine: Humanitarian Situation Report, January – March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/state-palestine-humanitarian-situation-report-january-march-0
2,palestine,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came to Israel Sunday in the midst of the worst crisis in relations between Israelis and Palestinians in years, but he did not meet a single Palestinian representative and mentioned them publicly once.

For decades, American diplomats saw themselves as brokers between the two sides, and secretaries of state typically met Palestinian representatives on regional tours like this one. When relations between the two sides deteriorated, the United States sought to bridge the divide.

No more.

No one at the State Department called Palestinian leaders to ask for a get-together with Mr. Pompeo, according to Palestinian officials. And that may be because the Americans knew the answer they would have gotten: No.

Infuriated by President Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, paving the way for the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested holy city, Palestinian leaders have cut off political contacts with the Trump administration. They say the White House can no longer be considered an honest broker in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.",Pompeo and Palestinians Have ‘Nothing to Discuss’ Amid Gaza Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-israel-palestinians.html
3,palestine,"Pakistan has always sought to maintain a policy of neutrality — or let’s call it balance — between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In this regard, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy long term strategic ties backed by various economic, defence and military-to-military cooperation agreements, not to mention the religious affinities that underscore this bond.

At the same time, Pakistan has also been very conscious of Iran’s genuine concerns when it comes to managing its ties with Saudi Arabia and has been making great strides in enhancing the spectrum of cooperation with Iran too.

Pakistan’s refusal of Saudi request to send forces to the Yemen war is usually taken as an important example of Pakistan’s commitment to the policy of neutrality. In order to understand the dynamics and the future trajectory of the triad — Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran — and Pakistan’s role in it, an important element that needs careful consideration is the growing Saudi-Israel cordiality and their perception of the changing dynamics on the conflict ridden geo-political landscape of the Middle East.

None of the three countries has formal diplomatic relations with Israel. Their opposition to the state of Israel in Palestine largely stems from religious, humanitarian and legal considerations and the fact that the Israeli occupation forces have left many Palestinians homeless in their own home through illegal settlements, brutal use of force and territorial expansion. The Arab Muslim world and Pakistan do not have adequate reasons to look for any cordial ties with Israel either considering not only the 1967 Arab-Israel war but also the recent US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reflecting a major departure from traditional US approach to the issue and a violation of the relevant UN resolutions.

Pakistan’s perception of Israel is not only shaped by the latter’s abominable treatment of Palestinians but also by its strategic ties with India and the US

Paradoxically, despite being the ‘Guardian’ of Islam’s two holy mosques and a self-proclaimed champion of the Palestinian cause, Saudi ruling elite in recent times have become more overt and accommodative in their dealings with Israel and the US.

The general view about this development is that Saudi Arabia seeks modernisation and diversification on economic and defence fronts. Saudi Crown Prince, and its de facto ruler, Muhammad bin Salman’s move to de-link religion from politics by allowing more personal freedom to the citizens explains this pragmatism.

Indeed, his assertive regional policy has led the kingdom into seemingly intractable competition for power and influence in the region with the other regional giant Iran, in Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon etc. Therefore, in the absence of any considerable indigenous military industrial base and prowess, Saudi Arabia is compelled to look for multiple partners and options to sustain its influence, at a time when the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East witnesses declining hegemony of the long term ally i.e. the US, and rising influence of Russia and Iran.

As a result, Saudi Arabia considers cooperation with Israel a logical response in the light of its capacity for providing hi-tech military hardware to Saudi Arabia, not to mention its enmity towards regional ‘antagonist’ Iran and influence in the US policymaking circles.

As for Pakistan and Iran, there are no prospects of good relations with Israel, at least in the near future. This presents a bleak picture for them in the light of current trends in Saudi-Israel relations indicating that the two countries have gone a long way to establish various channels of interaction and cooperation, overtly or covertly, to achieve mutual goals.

The foremost reason that drives Saudi Arabia and Israel closer undoubtedly remain their shared threat perception of Iran. In recent times, Iran appears to have prevailed in various theatres of conflicts, including in Syria where it backs Bashar al-Assad regime along with Russia. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel consider Iran’s growing influence in the region as a threat to their respective security and strategic interests.

Indeed, by gaining a level of working relationship with Saudi Arabia, Israel seeks to concretise its occupation of Palestine while at the same time continuing with its atrocious policies against the Palestinians.

In this complex web of things, Pakistan is confronted with a delicate situation. Because Pakistan’s perception of Israel is not only shaped by the latter’s abominable treatment of Palestinians but also by its strategic ties with Pakistan’s arch rival India and the US. Keeping these facts in view, if we are to assume a conflict situation involving Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel, this inevitably has some implications for Pakistan’s policy of balance, and creates strategic anxiety in Islamabad.

Pakistan’s policy of balance in the turbulent region of Middle East is increasingly under threat owing to the implicit and explicit Saudi overtures to Israel. And in this context, Pakistan should keep its dialogue channels open on all sides.

4,palestine,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian eyes are on the Yarmouk refugee camp just south of Damascus, where the Syrian regime and its supporting Palestinian factions, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are fighting Islamic State (IS) militants. On May 2, the Syrian army was able to deploy troops around the area, which was previously controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra.

In April 2015, IS had control of 90% of the camp after fighting with Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis and gunmen from various factions.

The Palestinians hope for a quick end to the military operations in the camp, with IS’ defeat and the liberation of the camp. This will allow the reconstruction process to begin and the displaced to return. To that end, Palestinians seem to be betting on good relations between the PLO and the Syrian government.

On April 25, the director of the political department of the PLO in Syria, Anwar Abdel Hadi, revealed to the Voice of Palestine that he met with Syrian Minister of State for National Reconciliation Affairs Ali Haidar and UN Resident Coordinator in Syria Ali al-Zaatari and discussed the need to provide assistance and support for refugees and to begin reconstruction in refugee camps in Syria to ensure the refugees’ safe return once the militants are eradicated.

Haidar had stressed in several meetings with Palestinian delegations — most recently on June 7 and Sept. 25, 2017 — that the Syrian army was working on a plan to rid the camp of militants and allow people back, noting that Syria is keen to preserve refugee camps as a focal point of the Palestinian cause.

Ahmad Majdalani, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' envoy to Syria and a member of the PLO’s Executive Committee, told Al-Monitor, “There was a decision to establish a PLO committee to manage the reconstruction of the camp,” adding, “The committee will raise funds for reconstruction and the return of the camp’s residents, coordinating with the Syrian authorities.”

Majdalani explained that the committee is waiting for the end of the military operations between the Syrian army and the militants and the clearing of the rubble to begin its operations.

After getting a clearer idea of the magnitude of the damage, the PLO will coordinate with the Syrian authorities on the details of the reconstruction process and with international parties to bring in support and funding for reconstruction. It may also run a fundraising campaign among Palestinians.

The Yarmouk camp is one of the largest Palestinian camps in Syria and some consider it the capital of the diaspora. It was established in the 1950s and hosted 200,000 refugees before violence erupted at the beginning of the Syrian crisis that left IS in control.

Meanwhile, Abdel Hadi told Al-Monitor on the sidelines of the PLO National Council session in Ramallah held April 30-May 3, “The national committee will work on the reconstruction of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria under the auspices of the PLO.”

He added, “We have contacted relief agencies such as the UNRWA and some donor countries such as Norway, and they are ready to help finance the reconstruction. Coordination with the Syrian authorities is ongoing and they have agreed to start reconstruction after clearing the camp of terrorists.” Abdel Hadi noted, “The committee will meet with the Palestinian factions and the rest of the parties to determine details of the reconstruction process after the camp is fully liberated.”

In addition to Yarmouk, several other camps are in need of reconstruction, such as Daraa and Sabinah in southern Rif Dimashq governorate as well as Handarat in Aleppo.

The Palestinians are counting on starting reconstruction in the camp immediately after the clashes end, taking advantage of international eagerness to make donations for reconstruction in Syria. Most recently, the UN Brussels Conference on April 25 allocated $4.4 billion to all Syria. On May 31, 2017, Norway pledged to assist in the reconstruction of the camp’s infrastructure in cooperation with UNRWA after calm is re-established in the area.

The Palestinians are betting the camp's reconstruction will become a top priority for the Syrian government for various reasons. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's central information officer, Anwar Raja, told Al-Monitor, “Reconstruction is inevitable as the Syrian state removes rubble and starts working on infrastructure and reconstruction immediately upon the liberation of any area recaptured from militants,” as it did in Raqqa, for example.

He added, “The Yarmouk camp is more important than other areas, for Syrians or for Palestinians alike, for several reasons, such as its strategic location and proximity to Damascus. It is also an important commercial and economic market, not only for the Palestinians but also for low- and middle-income Syrians. Reconstruction and allowing residents back in the camp will alleviate social and economic problems and contribute to resolving the Syrian and Palestinian humanitarian crisis.”

He continued, “Palestinian factions discussed Yarmouk's reconstruction with the Syrian state. They were promised that rehabilitation works would kick off after the camp is liberated and all the wreckage of the war is cleaned out. This process only takes a few weeks and infrastructure will be first on the to-do list.”

Raja is not holding his breath for the PLO or international relief agencies to play an active role in the reconstruction process. “We do not expect the PLO to make significant contributions to Yarmouk's reconstruction because it is simply unable to do so. International bodies are providing support to Palestinians little by little, and are blackmailing them in return, not to mention UNRWA’s financial deficit,” adding, “The Syrian government has, however, promised to do its best to rebuild the camp as soon as possible.”

For his part, the secretary of the Alliance of Palestinian Resistance factions in Syria, Khaled Abdul Majid, said the destruction in Yarmouk is not as severe as some opposition parties might like to claim, asserting that reconstruction will proceed based on the Syrian government’s arrangements.

“There are understandings with Syria on opening offices for the Palestinian factions in the camp and on expediting the reconstruction pace in Yarmouk compared to other [Syrian] areas,” he told Al-Monitor. “International bodies such as Arab, Islamic and international relief organizations, in addition to businesses, will be funding the reconstruction process.”

Abdul Majid called on the PLO to assume a prominent role in reconstruction and mobilize Arab and international groups.

Despite the optimism, the reconstruction of the camp and the return of the displaced Palestinian refugees remain dependent on field developments in the camp and its surroundings, as well as the outcomes of the Syrian army’s battles against IS fighters and its capacity to liberate the camp and clear it of mines. Only after all this happens can the reconstruction process begin.",Palestinians to partner with Damascus on refugee camp reconstruction,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/palestinian-refugees-yarmouk-camp-liberation-reconstruction.html
5,palestine,"Mr Erdoğan said the Palestinians were the “symbol of all oppressed people” in the world “because of the persecution, massacres and injustices they have been subjected to.” The Turkish president said Palestinian women and children were most “exposed to the oppression of the Israeli administration,” paying the price “for wars and crises whose decisions are mostly not taken by them.” He said: “The future of humanity will be determined according to the stance taken regarding the cause of Palestine and Jerusalem. “If the opposite happens a dark future awaits us in which all rights, freedoms, moral and conscientious measures are absent or eliminated and in which tyranny prevails.”

GETTY Erdoğan said the Palestinians were the ""symbol of all oppressed people""

He continued: “What is happening in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, is nothing other than the efforts of tyranny to justify its oppressions, even to institutionalise them. ""The violence that the Israeli administration has recently inflicted on the Palestinians shows that tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day.” The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing battle between the two nations that started in the 20th century. Both groups have been fighting over Gaza on and off for decades.

There has been constant shelling between the two sides over the last year as the conflict continues to escalate. The president also skewered the international community’s “indifference over the sufferings of Palestinians.” Mr Erdoğan said:“The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people in these Israeli attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society or individual will be safe.”

He also praised Turkey for its humanitarian aid work, contrasting the country with “great economic powers” motivated only by “economic, political or military interests.” Turkey has so far spent $31billion (£22.9billion) on Syrian refugees living in Turkey. Mr Erdoğan said: “Humanitarian aid, entirely an issue of conscience and morality, does not rely on money, oil, gold, or political power.

6,palestine,"The Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip recently suggested holding indirect negotiations with Israel regarding a long-term cease-fire — known in Arabic as a “hudna” — Haaretz reported. According to the May 6 report, Hamas used various channels to convey the message on several occasions in recent months.

Two days later, Hamas' military wing — the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades — tweeted a denial in Hebrew, saying, “Hamas denies reports of a long-term cease-fire with the Zionist occupation.” Nonetheless, a Hamas source confirmed to Al-Monitor that such a proposal exists, similar to the one it had conveyed at the end of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war codenamed Operation Protective Edge. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 2014 proposal was amended in light of the changed circumstances, but declined to elaborate. Hamas has never made a secret of the fact that its leadership would adopt “significant decisions” if Israel were to lift the siege it imposed on Gaza in 2007, the source added.

The recent failure of the reconciliation talks with the rival Fatah movement and the Palestinian Authority (PA) that runs the West Bank dashed Hamas' hopes of easing the economic crisis in Gaza. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas officially “buried” the reconciliation in a harsh speech he delivered after the failed March 13 assassination attempt against Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah and PA intelligence chief Majid Faraj in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the economic situation in the Strip continues to decline. Hamas leaders’ hopes that Egypt would open its Rafah border crossing with Gaza and thereby ease the effects of the siege are no longer relevant. Egypt had urged the two major Palestinian movements to end their protracted conflict as a condition to opening the crossing. It is currently unwilling to budge from the terms of reconciliation and the demand that PA forces assume control of the Gaza border crossing. This stance by Cairo obviously expresses its distrust in Hamas, and the organization’s leadership fully realizes that.

Paradoxically, Israel remains the only default option — the only lifeline left to Hamas. Only Israel can save Hamas and the Gaza Strip it rules from a total system collapse. According to Haaretz defense affairs analyst Amos Harel, the Hamas leadership is suggesting a significant relaxation of the Israeli siege as part of the hudna deal, as well as Israeli approval of major infrastructure projects in Gaza and probably an exchange of prisoners and return of Israeli soldiers’ bodies.

“We said so clearly more than once and not in any secret talks that if the siege is lifted from Gaza, we are willing to discuss a cease-fire — all the [Palestinian] factions are willing to discuss it,” the Hamas source told Al-Monitor. He confirmed that Egypt has served as a conduit for messages between the sides involved “because it places supreme importance on finding a worthy humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza.”

This is not the first hudna Hamas has offered Israel. The first was conveyed in 1997 by then-King Hussein of Jordan, but Israel did not respond. Former Mossad agency chief Efraim Halevy found out about it (ex post facto) when he went to Jordan that year to handle the fallout from Israel’s attempted assassination of Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal. In his book “Man in the Shadows,” Halevy writes that he first heard the suggestion from the monarch, who wondered why Israel had failed to respond.

In 2005, a European intermediary conveyed another hudna proposal via then-Shin Bet head Yuval Diskin. The document was headlined, “Offer of a reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Israel” and was addressed to Ehud Olmert, Israel’s prime minister at the time. Israel did not respond to this deal, the existence of which I revealed in my 2012 book, “Getting to Know Hamas.”

Hamas made an additional attempt, as mentioned, after Operation Protective Edge, but an Israeli defense official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that Israel did not respond either “because there was no reason to conduct a dialogue with a bruised and beaten movement.” Israel would rather maintain its position of deterrence, threatening Hamas with a harsh response should it fire missiles at Israeli targets. Israel regards the Hamas fear of an additional round of violence as a guarantee of the cease-fire deal reached in Cairo in 2014, to which Hamas has studiously adhered for almost four years.

Hamas offers truce deals whenever it runs into serious trouble. In 1997, the movement felt isolated after being left out of the Palestinian institution-building that appeared a preparation for the establishment of a Palestinian state under the terms of the Oslo peace agreements with Israel. In 2005, the hudna suggestion was born of the fear that Israel would continue its policy of taking out the Hamas leadership after it assassinated Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his successor, Abdel Aziz Rantisi.

The Hamas political leadership has been aware for a while that absent a significant easing of the siege, the organization will no longer be able to run the Strip since the popular protests by desperate residents would not only be directed at Israel but would also turn against Hamas.

One of the main hudna advocates pushing for understandings with Israel is Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, but he too is only suggesting a cease-fire and is unwilling to entertain the idea of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza. In fact, despite the cease-fire agreed upon after the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas continued to enlarge its army and is trying to rebuild the attack tunnel project. For Hamas, the cease-fire actually means that it is careful not to fire rockets at Israel so that it does not retaliate.

Hamas will quickly discover that the obstacles that eventually derailed reconciliation with Abbas are also those that will prevent any understandings with Israel. Abbas demanded that Hamas give up its weapons as a condition for any deal, and Israel has posed similar conditions in return for a significant easing of its siege. In his vision of Gaza that he presented to reporters at the beginning of the year, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said a disarmed Hamas was a precondition for rehabilitation of the devastated enclave.

The latest Hamas truce proposal is born of weakness. The leadership does not hold any significant bargaining chips that would entice Israel to consider the offer seriously. In other words, the long-term cease-fire proposal that Hamas is presenting does not include disarming its military forces. The violent Palestinian demonstrations along the Gaza border with Israel in recent weeks are a major headache for Israeli security forces, but they do not constitute a substantial security threat to Israel.

Hamas post-2014 is a weak, rundown organization, and the hudna it is now offering has already been in force for nearly four years. The only question is how long the Protective Edge deterrence and the siege of the Gaza Strip can last.",What's behind Hamas' offer of cease-fire to Israel?,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/israel-egypt-gaza-palestine-hamas-long-term-truce-hudna.html
7,palestine,"RAMALLAH – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed a US$1.6 million (CAD$2 million) contribution from the Government of Canada to support vulnerable non-refugee Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank.

The Canadian contribution will enable WFP to provide assistance for up to one month and a half for 100,000 of the poorest and most food-insecure people in Gaza and the West Bank through electronic vouchers, or cash-based transfers. Families will be able to use their electronic vouchers to buy nutritious and fresh foods at local retailers. A third of the families receiving assistance are headed by women.

“Thanks to our longstanding partnership with Canada, we can help tens of thousands of poor families facing acute hardships every year,” said WFP Country Director in Palestine Daniela Owen. “With so much suffering and challenges at their greatest, particularly in Gaza, WFP food assistance is one thing vulnerable Palestinians can count on. We greatly appreciate Canada’s support in making this assistance possible.”

The contribution will also allow WFP to hold nutrition and health awareness sessions for women, men and children receiving food assistance. Participants will attend interactive classes for six months where they can learn about the best practices to prepare healthy and vitamin-rich meals from the food they purchase with vouchers. The sessions have a proven positive impact on participants’ dietary habits such as reducing the consumption of sugar and fried food.

“Canada recognizes the vital work that WFP carries out in the West Bank and Gaza. As humanitarian conditions deteriorate and more people come to depend on food assistance, WFP is an important partner in meeting the daily needs of vulnerable Palestinians,” said Douglas Scott Proudfoot, Representative of Canada to the Palestinian Authority.

WFP’s assistance programme complements the national safety net for poor families who have exhausted all their resources in trying to cope with a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. Thanks to the support of Canada and other donors, WFP food vouchers cover approximately 60 percent of people’s daily calorie needs and free some of their limited income to spend on other basic needs such as healthcare, water and electricity.

Under its Country Strategy Plan for Palestine (2018-2022), WFP aims at providing electronic food vouchers and in-kind food to non-refugee families most affected by food insecurity, primarily in Gaza and Area C in the West Bank. People receiving WFP support live below the official national poverty line of less than US$4 per person per day.

WFP assistance also boosts the local economy through local purchase and electronic food vouchers. Since 2011, WFP has brought more than US$260 million into the Palestinian economy, including US$170 million through the use of electronic vouchers.

8,palestine,"Stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties, the youth in Gaza are rising up.

Seventy years ago, more than 170,000 Palestinian from historic Palestine were forced to leave their homes, villages, cities and lands, as refugees to the Gaza Strip. They were part of the 710,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave, seeking refuge in Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere.

The images of elderly people and kids fleeing the killings of the Zionists gangs and militias in 1948, still occupy the vivid memories of Palestinians as well as comprising the visual identity of the Nakba (Catastrophe). Today, after seven decades, the grandsons and granddaughtersof those refugees are making their way back to their villages. They have never seen their villages, homes or land, but they kept the memories of their grandparents, linking their identity to their villages, vowing to return to their homes, relying on the international recognition of their right to return, and the moral responsibilities of their right.

The Great Return March is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza

The Great Return March (GRM) is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza, and the increasingly severe humanitarian crisis, but rather it is a protest against the Nakba, that has been ongoing since 1948. The young generation of Palestinians know that the current humanitarian crisis and the disintegration on the Palestinian system is a result of the Nakba, as well as thedehumanization and the apartheid that is institutionalized against the indigenous people of Palestine. Therefore, any discussion on the GRM should consider the protests as an action and a reaction. Action against the ongoing imprisonment of 1.8 million Palestinians in the Gaza strip for more than ten years, and a reaction to the apathy of the international community.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, forty Palestinian civilians were killed and 5511 were wounded since March 30. Two journalists were assassinated deliberately by the Israeli forces, despite each bearing a clear sign that they are journalists. In addition to this, hundreds of the wounded were children and minors. Each of the forty people who scarified themselves had a story to tell, and a mission to accomplish. They were humans, who loved, and were beloved bytheir families, friends and relatives.

One of those killed was Mohammed Ayoub, 15 years old from Jabbaliya, who was shot in the head in front of cameras, without threatening or causing any harm to the Israeli Army. In his photos there is one where he drew aheartbetween his initials and those of another person. He did not think that he would be a target ofan Israeli sniper who might have even cheered after shooting a civilian, as one video showed soldiers cheering as they were shooting at civilians. Mohamed died and left a story to remember.

Another person killed was the beloved journalist, Yasser Mourtaja, who was well- known in Gaza for his kindness tochildren and his professionalism as a photojournalist. Weeks before he was killed by the Israeli snipers despite wearing a vest marked by “PRESS”, he was awarded a USAID fund for his media organisation.

A third person lost was the artist Mohamed Abu Amro, who was shot in the head while participating in a nonviolent protest on the eastern borders of Gaza.

19 year old Abdulfatah Abdulnabi was running away from the fence between the besieged Gaza Strip and Israel, when an Israeli sniper shot him dead.

A video published by the Israeli media shows how the Israeli soldiers and army view the Palestinians. The video shows an Israeli Armyofficer asking one soldier to “shoot the guy in blue”, but the soldier tells him that he will take the one in red. This interaction shows how the Palestinians have been dehumanized by the Israelis, with the removal of their names, history, families, and humanity. The video illustrates the approach of the Israeli Army which sees millions of Palestinians as objects rather thanhumans. It is evidence that the conflict is not only about freedom, but also aboutlife.

This killing doctrine and the dehumanisation of the Palestinians can be seen clearly in the words of Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who said after nine Palestinians were killed that there were “no Innocent people in Gaza”.

The population of the Gaza Strip that has been under intense siege since January 2006 and has been suffering enormously. Since the early 1990s, Israel imposed movement restrictions on the Gaza Strip, where 1.8 million people live, making itone of the biggest open air prisons in the world.

It is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable

In 2015, a UN report warned that, under the current conditions, the Gaza Strip will be “uninhabitable” by 2020. However, it is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable.

The ongoing Israeli blockage, and the sanctions imposed by the Palestinian authority against the Gaza Strip, was the result of failed reconciliation efforts with Hamas. Since then the economy and life in Gaza has been crippled, with suffering growing rapidly. In 2015, the GDP in the Gaza Strip was 971 USD, while it was 5754 USD for the same period in the West Bank.

Comparatively in Israel it is at 44,019 USD. The unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip and West Bank reached 26.9% in 2016, with Gaza hardest hit at 41.7% unemployment compared to 18.2% in the West Bank. Yet, the real numbers of youth unemployment in Gaza have reached more than 75%. This shows the inequality that the Palestinians suffer compared to Israel, and also how the Gaza Strip is suffering from huge inequality compared to the West Bank.

The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are walking through a dark tunnel, with no end in sight. They are stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties. This reality pushes them to take the lead and organize nonviolent protests, shifting attention to the real cause of the problem, which started in 1948.

The youth of the Gaza Strip are rising up in the face of Israeli colonialism, and the status-quo, as well as an act of rejection ofthe political parties in the Gaza strip, including Hamas and Fatah. The youth in Gaza struggle for their dignity, and prefer to fight for life and die in dignity, rather than die slowly from the blockade.","The Palestinians in Gaza: fighting for life, struggling for rights",https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/abdalhadi-alijla/palestinians-in-gaza-fighting-for-life-struggling-for-rights
9,palestine,"Donald Trump’s torpedoing of the Iran nuclear deal on highly specious and misleading grounds is an act of wanton diplomatic vandalism fraught with dangers. While the 2015 agreement may not yet be wholly sunk, it is holed below the waterline. Many in Tehran will see the sweeping reimposition of US sanctions as a declaration of war. As for Trump, he has once again proved himself the master of chaos.

This aggressive bid to further isolate Iran appears designed to ultimately enforce regime change. In the short-term it will destroy remaining mutual goodwill, undermine pro-western Iranian opinion, empower hardliners, trigger an oil price crisis, and increase the risk of conflict centred on Syria and Israel. It raises the spectre of a regional nuclear arms race, and damages the western alliance to the advantage, among others, of Russia. It is a Crimea-sized blow to the primacy of international law.

Yet Trump’s short-sighted folly, far from being unprecedented, is entirely consistent with a long history of similarly disastrous Middle East policy missteps by previous US presidents. The region is littered with the corpses of momentously misconceived and wrong-headed US policies, spawned by the same noxious mix of ignorance and arrogance now permeating the White House. In this respect, Trump is no different from many of his modern predecessors.

By ending the nuclear deal, Trump has handed a gift to Iranian hardliners | Sanam Vakil Read more

Iran, as ever, is a case in point. The 1979-81 Tehran hostage crisis is usually referenced by those seeking to explain enduring, official US enmity. It’s true America’s national humiliation was considerable, and Jimmy Carter paid the political price. But the Iranian people’s real offence was not the embassy siege. It was their presumptuous overthrow of the shah’s autocratic, pro-American regime in the 1979 revolution.

The US and the UK, after all, had gone to considerable trouble in 1953 to keep Iran in line, covertly ousting its democratically elected government of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Their loss of influence, consequent on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s assertion of absolutist clerical rule, was the product of their own machinations. Here was the genesis of lethal US backing for Saddam Hussein in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

The fight to repel Saddam’s invasion took 300,000 Iranian lives. Its cost, and causes, are not forgotten. Close by the Khomeini mausoleum south of Tehran, I once walked among the well-tended, shaded graves of hundreds of “martyrs” interred in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The war was a national trauma. Yet there has been no US apology, nor any thought of one. Although the US finally turned on Saddam in 1990, although Iran helped track al-Qaida following the 2001 attacks, and even though the nuclear deal elicited significant concessions, venomously irrational, unmitigated US hostility persists.

Among the many US-fomented catastrophes in the Middle East, George W Bush’s 2003 decision to invade Iraq without a plan was a standout moment, unrivalled in its strategic incoherence and staggering incompetence. It destabilised Iraq territorially and economically. Bush’s “axis of evil” rhetoric and “global war on terror” fuelled sectarian violence and jihadism, playing midwife to Islamic State. And the ensuing, lengthy occupation failed to entrench inclusive democratic governance, as this weekend’s Iraq elections may again demonstrate.

Ronald Reagan used covert Middle East arms sales to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Likewise, the US armed the Afghan mujahideen, then blanched as they morphed into the Taliban. George HW Bush liberated Kuwait in 1991 only to betray Iraq’s Kurds and Shias when they demanded liberation, too.

Bill Clinton tried to end the Palestine-Israeli conflict, inspiring great optimism. I recall standing on the White House’s south lawn in 1993 as Clinton physically pulled Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin together for a reluctant handshake that had taken decades in coming. “Enough of blood and tears, enough … The time for peace has come,” Rabin solemnly declared.

Play Video 2:30 What is the Iran nuclear deal? – video

But the time had not come. Blood continued to flow. Clinton’s efforts to play honest broker failed, like those of other American presidents, because, ultimately, the just claims of the Palestinians always proved unequal to Israel’s political, emotional, and financial clout in Washington. Far from endowing peace in Palestine, US policy has underwritten a deepening divide, the expansion of illegal settlements, and now the provocative recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city. Arafat and Rabin are both dead. So too, almost, is the two-state solution.

In the decades after the Suez Crisis in 1956, when Britain and France were shoved aside, successive US administrations war-gamed the Middle East as part of a bigger strategic contest with the Soviet Union. If that meant propping up pro-western dictators such as Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and the Saudi and Gulf monarchs, then so be it. Yet as Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, conceded in Cairo in 2005, it was a self-defeating policy. “For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region, here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither,” she said.

In another famous Cairo speech, in 2009, Barack Obama promised a “new beginning”. The US had treated Middle East countries as either proxies or enemies, he said. Instead, Obama promised, it would tackle religious extremism, Palestine, nuclear proliferation, democratic deficits and women’s rights. Yet for all that, not much changed in the Obama years. Only the Iran deal marked a clear shift – until Trump wrecked it.

In many respects, the region’s problems have grown steadily worse under American tutelage. Witness Somalia, a failed state-turned-shooting range for US special forces. Witness Yemen, a humanitarian disaster wrought by the US-armed Saudi regime. Witness Libya, anarchic product of made-in-America regime change. Witness Turkey where, in the age of Guantánamo, human rights increasingly count for naught.

Unsurprisingly, terrorism, in many forms, is proliferating, as is displacement, poverty and youth unemployment. And all this without mentioning the post-2011 Syrian holocaust of half a million dead. Syria’s fate symbolises perhaps the biggest US failure of all: its hard-nosed refusal to support the Arab spring uprisings and stand up, despite Obama’s promises, for democratic self-determination.

Know-nothing Trump is the direct heir to this grim litany of catastrophic presidential blundering. But that is not to say Britain and Europe should tolerate yet another avoidable Middle East disaster wrought in Washington. Just as Russia has been told certain actions are unacceptable and incur painful consequences if not reversed, so too should the US.

The European allies must, by all available means, undercut, circumvent and subvert Trump’s attempt to wreck the Iran deal. Closer ties should be pursued with Tehran, while escalating, punitive diplomatic and economic sanctions are levelled at Washington. Joint action should also be taken to censure the US at the UN. A price must be paid for perfidy.

Theresa May can make a start by withdrawing her ill-judged invitation to Trump to visit Britain. With his Middle East warmongering, as with his climate change denial and his other dangerous and divisive policies, Trump threatens British interests and international peace and security. It is no longer enough simply to complain and condemn. The moment for active resistance has arrived.

10,palestine,"-- Inaugural issue of peer-reviewed papers includes commentaries on the needs for palliative care for Syrian refugees in Jordan and continued assistance for Palestinian refugees

The Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and The Lancet today published the first issue of the Humanitarian Health Digest, a quarterly bibliography of the latest published, peer-reviewed journal articles on humanitarian health work.

The Digest will provide links to primary research and systematic reviews sourced from a variety of journals, divided into three main categories: conflict and forced migration, natural disasters, and technological disasters like Chernobyl. The Digest debuts at time when the world is facing some of the most dire humanitarian crises in decades, challenging those working in the field to think of new ways to deal with increasingly complex situations.

""The United Nations predicts that more than 128 million people across the world will need humanitarian assistance and protection,"" said Paul Spiegel, MD, MPH, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. ""Giving humanitarian health workers a resource for the latest learnings in their area of specialization could greatly benefit the people they are trying to help.""

Commentary: support for palliative care in humanitarian emergencies

Each issue of the Digest will also feature original commentary. In the inaugural issue, Spiegel uses one of the articles listed in the Digest as a springboard to discuss the role of palliative care in addressing the health needs of Syrian refugees in Jordan. Palliative care includes pain management and psychosocial support for patients, including social and spiritual aspects. ""Palliative care is rarely discussed in humanitarian settings, but it is essential as there is often insufficient funds to provide treatment for cancer and other expensive life-threatening conditions,"" writes Spiegel.

The paper, published February 27, 2018 in the journal Medicine, Conflict and Survival, indicates that palliative care, beyond providing dignity and comfort, is cost-effective compared to curative interventions and reduces the number and length of stay of hospitalizations. Yet funding to Syrian refugees is decreasing, notes Spiegel, creating a need for solutions such as allowing refugees the right to work.

""Just as the need for mental health interventions in humanitarian emergencies has become clearly recognized, the need for palliative care in such settings should also be self-evident,"" writes Spiegel.

Commentary: need for continued assistance for Palestinian refugees The inaugural issue also includes a commentary published in The Lancet in January 2018 by the director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and his colleagues. They note that the agency faces major challenges in upholding its mandate and preserving key services such as education and health care for Palestinian refugees due to funding constraints.

UNRWA provides health and protection services-including keeping schools open and health clinics running--to over 5 million Palestinian refugees and provides more than 9 million patient visits each year.

""We are calling on UN member states and partners to uphold the human rights and future of Palestinian refugees and to rally support and establish new funding alliances to preserve the dignity, health status and the future of Palestinian children and families,"" write the authors.

The scope of the Digest

All Lancet articles cited in the Digest will be free to read. For ease of browsing, the list of articles in the Digest will be divided into seven public health-related areas such as communicable disease; non-communicable disease; nutrition and food security; water, sanitation and hygiene; and more. Lastly, the articles in each sub-category will be grouped between research done in low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries.

Just as the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health Center draws upon a variety of disciplines-including epidemiology, demography, emergency and disaster medicine, health systems management, nutrition/food security, environmental engineering, mental health, political science and human rights-so too does the bibliography seek to cover applicable research in those areas.

""We hope that other journals will follow The Lancet and make peer-reviewed articles free to read so humanitarian health workers can benefit immediately from the lessons learned on the issues they are facing every day in the field,"" said Spiegel.

12,palestine,"The Palestinian Authority sharpened its tone regarding the inauguration of the new American embassy in Jerusalem in five days’ time.

By: Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News

May 14th will be the latest “day of rage” called for by the Palestinians if the celebration turning the American consulate in Jerusalem into an embassy takes place on its scheduled date, said senior PLO official Ahmad Majdalani on Tuesday.

As reported in the Jerusalem Post, “The fourteenth of this month will be a huge, popular day of rage everywhere,” Majdalani said, according to Voice of Palestine, the official Palestinian Authority (PA) radio station. “Our people will express their rejection of relocating the embassy to occupied Jerusalem.”

What commonly occurs on such days are mass street protests and rioting, with some violently clashing with Israeli security forces, whether at checkpoints or other sites.

According to Palestinian mouthpiece Wafa, other possible steps may include “enhancing popular resistance,” which are code words for terror attacks on Israelis. The Palestinians may also bring more cases against Israelis in the International Criminal Court in the Hague or “revive the Palestinian Jerusalem municipality,” an apparent reference to the PA’s attempt to run the civil affairs of Jerusalem’s Arab inhabitants through Orient House in violation of the Oslo Accords. Israel closed the Orient House in 2001.

The Palestinians have been furious ever since Trump made his historic announcement in December. Using bombastic language, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, said that it showed a “determination to violate international law, destroy the two-state solution and provoke the feelings of the Palestinian people as well as of all Arabs, Muslims and Christians around the globe.” A wave of demonstrations on the Palestinian street followed, as well protests in many Muslim and Muslim-majority countries.

The PA declared then that the move disqualified the US from acting as an acceptable partner in the peace process, and that it would not accept any plan the Trump’s team would put forward on the issue.

The administration has recently said that its proposals are almost ready, and many rumors of its contents have been publicized in the media, including the idea that Israel would be asked to relinquish control of four Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem to Palestinian control.

The call for a “day of rage” could also be seen as just an echo, however, of the stance taken by the PA just prior to Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, regarding his oft-stated promise to transfer the embassy from Tel Aviv. At that time, PA head Mahmoud Abbas stated that if the president followed through, “The Middle East peace process, and even world peace would be plunged into a crisis that would be impossible to defuse.”

Hamas, which has the Gaza Strip in its grip and has led a month-long series of violent confrontations on its border with Israel that is to culminate next week, has never budged from its attitude that the move was “a declaration of war on all Muslims.”",Palestinians to mark US Jerusalem embassy opening with ‘huge day of rage’,https://worldisraelnews.com/palestinians-mark-us-jerusalem-embassy-opening-huge-day-rage/
13,palestine,"Erdoğan slams Israeli ‘tyranny’ over Palestinians

ISTANBUL

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on May 7 that the Palestinians were the “symbol of all oppressed people” in the world and Israeli attacks on them showed that “tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day.”

“What is happening in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, is nothing other than the efforts of tyranny to justify its oppressions, even to institutionalize them. The violence that the Israeli administration has recently inflicted on the Palestinians … shows that tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day,” Erdoğan said in a speech at the International Mount of Olives Peace Awards in Istanbul.

“The Palestinians are the symbol of all oppressed people in the world because of the persecution, massacres and injustices they have been subjected to,” he added.

The Turkish president said Palestinian women and children were most “exposed to the oppression of the Israeli administration,” paying the price “for wars and crises whose decisions are mostly not taken by them.”

“A significant number of Palestinian children are continuing their lives outside their homeland, in refugee camps or in other countries. Those who are able to stay in their homeland, meanwhile, are exposed to psychological and physical discrimination everywhere, from the moment they leave their house on the way to their schools, at checkpoints, in public transport, in educational institutions,” Erdoğan said.

He also slammed the international community’s “indifference over the sufferings of Palestinians.”

“The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people in these [Israeli] attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society or individual will be safe,” Erdoğan said, accusing international institutions responsible for ensuring peace and security in Palestine of “hypocrisy.”

He also praised Turkey for its humanitarian aid work, contrasting the country with “great economic powers” motivated only by “economic, political or military interests.”

“Humanitarian aid, entirely an issue of conscience and morality, does not rely on money, oil, gold, or political power,” Erdoğan said, noting that Turkey has so far spent $31 billion on Syrian refugees living in Turkey.

“Whatever anyone else does, as Turkey we will continue to use the facilities and opportunities we have in our hands for the benefit of humanity, especially our Palestinian, Syrian and African brothers. In a way appropriate to the orders of God and the inheritance left by our ancestors, wherever there is a victim we’ll worker harder to stand by them,” he said.

The Palestine cause is not an issue exclusive to any nation or city, Erdoğan said, suggesting that “the future of humanity will be determined according to the stance taken regarding the cause of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

“If the opposite happens a dark future awaits us in which all rights, freedoms, moral and conscientious measures are absent or eliminated and in which tyranny prevails,” he added.",Erdoğan slams Israeli ‘tyranny’ over Palestinians,http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-slams-israeli-tyranny-over-palestinians-131468

A&E EDITOR

Palestine is the hottest foreign policy issue upon which no politician will act.

What needs to be absolutely clear is that the Palestinian humanitarian crisis is not a partisan issue. Both U.S. parties have made their stance crystal clear—neither are willing to confront the Israeli government on an ongoing apartheid taking place in occupied territory.

It would be a futile effort to explain the long, conflict-ridden history surrounding the region in a short newspaper article. However, readers should understand that this is a humanitarian issue above all else. Treating this as a geopolitical conflict with equally powerful sides is simply incorrect.

A common misconception about the Palestinian crisis is that the issue is too complex for the outside world to act. While the issue is highly complicated, that hardly justifies the global community’s inaction.

One of the most recent incidents of Israeli oppression occurred toward the end of March. According to Al Jazeera coverage, 17 Palestinians were killed and 1,400 were injured when the Israeli army engaged protestors. The march was calling for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homelands.

This military engagement with protestors is not uncommon. While this latest incident yielded more staggering casualties, the Israeli army frequently engages peaceful protests (or children throwing rocks) with rubber bullets, tear gas and occasionally live ammunition.

According to BBC’s Israel/Palestine event timeline, in December, President Donald Trump ordered that the U.S. government recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Additionally, the order called for the U.S. embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv—the city most countries recognize as Israel’s capital—to Jerusalem. The move hasn’t happened yet, but it’s scheduled to occur in the near future.

Jerusalem is one of the most culturally significant cities for several religions that have spread across the globe. Israel seized the city from Palestinian control in 1967, in a brutal military conflict known commonly as the Six Day War. Since assuming control of the city, countries have been reluctant to recognize it as Israel’s capital.

The president’s decision to recognize Jerusalem was met with immediate backlash on the world stage—and very little action outside of Palestine.

A comprehensive Reuters article published on Dec. 29, 2017 detailed Palestinian protests against the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem. No Israelis were hurt. Many Palestinian protesters were injured by Israeli soldiers. These incidents, after filtering through American media, are seen as clashes between equally-powerful opposing forces.

The fact that the president’s decision to move an embassy—essentially to prove a point—has caused serious injury should alarm Americans. United States leadership cannot continue to make irrational decisions that cause this harm.

It doesn’t matter how many other countries denounce Israel’s decimating of Palestine. Until the United States takes a stand, very little is going to change. This is a decision that is, unfortunately, in the American people’s hands. Plagued by misinformation and overwhelming complication, many Americans appear to be content with letting a U.S. sanctioned apartheid unravel across the sea.

This isn’t a matter of expanding U.S. influence in the Middle East, gaining the favor of Arab nations or endorsing a religious group. Taking action to resolve this conflict is about protecting innocent civilian lives.

There is no simple solution to century-old conflict that has plagued the region, but Americans have to take that first step. Raising awareness for the situation and pressuring government representation is the only way citizens can push for change overseas.",The U.S. must do more to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,https://unothegateway.com/u-s-must-resolve-israeli-palestinian-conflict/
15,palestine,"A paralysed and indecisive Palestinian leadership, faced with mounting pressure from the Americans and Israelis, is undermining key national goals, analysts say.

They say the decisions taken by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) during its meeting in Ramallah last week show that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lacks the will to respond to American and Israeli efforts to thwart Palestinian statehood.

While in session, the PNC took several decisions including the redefinition of relations with Israel as one of ""conflict"".

It dismissed the PLO-Israel interim agreements signed in Washington and Cairo in the 1990s as ""expired"", and rejected the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

In the past, Abbas, 82, has repeatedly insisted that the path to achieving statehood for the Palestinians lies only through peace negotiations with Israel, not armed struggle.

'Strategic mistake'

On the face of it, the PNC decisions indicate a departure from the negotiations path, the analysts say.

However, in reality, the Palestinian leadership is too weak and fragmented to either withdraw from existing agreements with Israel or end the policy of treating peace negotiations as a strategic choice.

Mohamad Dalbah, a Washington-based Palestinian analyst, says the crisis confronting Palestinians today is rooted in the ""catastrophic"" Oslo agreement that Abbas and the late Yasser Arafat signed with Israel.

Oslo was a ""strategic mistake"" for the Palestinians, he told Al Jazeera, because it never stipulated the establishment of a Palestinian state and left open-ended the core issues of the status of Jerusalem and the right Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel in 1948.

In 1993 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo agreement with Israel and established an interim Palestinian Authority.

The Oslo Accords stipulated that within five years of the signing of the agreement - that is, in 1999 - both parties should enter into negotiations for the final-settlement status, including the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

Twenty-five years later, Palestinians and Israelis have yet to start any final settlement negotiations.

'Legally solid'

Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset, told Al Jazeera the decisions of the PNC are ""meaningless"" as long as the PA continues security coordination with Israel, which is the most important objective for Israel.

Zahalka said the current Palestinian condition, defined by a weak local government, is in the best interest of Israel but not the Palestinians because it is conducive to neither peace nor resistance.

By maintaining internal security in Palestinian areas on behalf of Israel, the PA reduces Israel's military burden of maintaining its military occupation.

However, Abdallah Abueid, a Palestinian legal expert, says the international position of the Palestinians in light of the PNC decisions is ""legally solid"".

This is because Israel has repeatedly violated the agreements, refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories and is unwilling to conclude final-status negotiations with the Palestinians, says Abueid, who teaches International law at Bethlehem University.

That being said, ""Palestinians are in a very precarious position today and are unable to move forward or even go backward if they wanted to"".

Zahalka, the Knesset member, says Palestinian leaders should now take a strategic decision to reinvigorate popular and peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation.

""Only then would Israel find itself compelled to end its illegal occupation,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Issue of successor

During its session in Ramallah, the PNC also re-elected Abbas president of the State of Palestine and chairman of the PLO.

It further elected 15 members of the executive committee out of 18 representing different Palestinian factions most of whom are Abbas loyalists.

Neither the PNC nor any governing body formally discussed the issue of a successor for the octogenarian Abbas, who is reportedly suffering from multiple ailments.

According to sources familiar with internal deliberations on the succession issue, Abbas supports the separation of the powers of the PLO, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, and the chairman of Fatah.

Abbas is in favour of having a different person to lead each body, the sources told Al Jazeera.
