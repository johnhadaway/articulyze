The Palestinian health ministry said Omar Samour, a 31-year-old farmer, was picking parsley in his field near Khan Yunis early on Friday morning when he was killed. Another farmer was injured by shrapnel. Israel’s military later confirmed its tanks had fired at “suspicious figures” on the border.

Samour’s death was a grim augury of what was to come. As Palestinians observed a day of mourning on Saturday, both sides warned of possible escalation in the weeks ahead. But a bigger question is exercising regional analysts. Will this violent yet long-predicted rekindling of the Israel-Palestine conflict trigger a wider crisis drawing in Lebanon, Syria and Iran?

The absence of a credible peace process underlies the latest confrontation, as happened in 2000 when the second intifada began, and again in 2014. Once again, Hamas and its supporters in Gaza, blockaded by Israel and Egypt and at odds with their Fatah rivals in the West Bank, are using mass civilian protest to end their isolation. Once again, Israel’s rightwing leaders, unwilling or unable to contemplate a two-state solution, compound myopic intransigence with a disproportionate use of force.

The dangerous difference now is timing and context. Friday was the start of six weeks of protests leading up to the 70th anniversary of Nakba day on 15 May, literally the “catastrophe”, as Arabs see it, that followed Israel’s declaration of independence on 14 May, 1948. The US will also move its embassy to Jerusalem in May, effectively recognising the city as Israel’s sovereign capital while ignoring Palestine’s claims. In short, a spring season of looming flashpoints is now begun.

Historical precedents also suggest local confrontations produce negative, region-wide reactions. The biggest worry is Lebanon, where Hezbollah, Israel’s sworn foe and Iran’s close ally, is the dominant political and military force. Strains are already apparent over Israel’s erection of a Gaza-style fence on its northern border and over disputed offshore oil and gas fields.

But for Israel’s generals, the main threat is Hezbollah’s modernised stockpile of an estimated 130,000 short-, medium- and long-range missiles and rockets, and its 50,000 fighters, many of them battle-hardened in Syria.

If the Gaza violence continues and spreads, Hezbollah hardliners can be expected to try to intervene. Iran’s leadership has repeatedly warned, in turn, that unlike the last Lebanon war in 2006, it will directly assist Hezbollah in any fight. Israel, it says, will be “eradicated”.

And Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has made plain, to Russia’s Vladimir Putin among others, that current efforts by Iran to create a permanent military presence in Syria and Lebanon cross an Israeli red line. Netanyahu recently underscored his stance by shooting down an Iranian drone and launching air raids on Syrian bases used by Iran.

Previous checks and balances are missing. It is no use looking to the UN security council. When it met in “emergency” session on Friday night to discuss Gaza, it could not even agree a joint statement. Saudi Arabia, which once pursued its own peace plan, is firmly (though tacitly) in the pro-Israel, anti-Iran camp. Likewise Egypt, where Sisi obsesses about jihadists, not justice.

Urging the Americans to step in as honest broker is a waste of breath, too. On this subject, Donald Trump has shown himself to be as ignorant as he is partisan.

1,palestine,"The livelihoods and long-term futures of thousands of Palestinian refugee families across Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza and the West Bank are at risk due to Donald Trump’s catastrophic decision to cut the American donation to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).

The US president’s decision to contribute only US$60m to UNRWA in 2018 – instead of US$125m – has been widely denounced as a brutal form of collective punishment for the Palestinian people.

To fill the gap in UNRWA’s budget, on January 22, its commissioner-general, Pierre Krähenbühl, launched a major emergency fundraising campaign. The #DignityIsPriceless campaign aims to mobilise donor states and civil society worldwide to secure funds to keep open the 700 UNRWA schools that educate 525,000 Palestinian children. It also aims to ensure that UNRWA can continue providing lifesaving emergency food aid, emergency cash assistance, and essential medical services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the Middle East. Krähenbühl said: “At stake are the rights and dignity of an entire community.”

There is clearly an urgent need to fill an immediate gap to keep schools and medical services open. However, a related, unspoken crisis is also threatening Palestinian refugees’ future in another way: if services are at threat there is also a looming employment crisis for the tens of thousands of Palestinians who provide these services as UNRWA staff.

Palestinian jobs and pensions at risk

UNRWA is both an agency that provides services and assistance, and the employer of 30,000 Palestinians, including doctors and nurses, teachers, psycho-social workers and administrative and support staff.

UNRWA’s budget has been precarious since its inception in the 1950s and in December 2017 it had a deficit of US$49m. Because of this, in addition to its full-time employees on fixed-term and indefinite contracts, UNRWA has long employed thousands of people on daily contracts, often for years and even decades on end. These precariously employed “dailies” are called upon to fill short-term gaps as they arise, including as substitute teachers and doctors to cover sick leave.

Many UNRWA employees – including the Palestinian teachers, guards and sanitation workers I have been speaking with across Lebanon as part of my ongoing research – fear that their jobs and very futures are at risk. Potential redundancies in Lebanon’s educational vocational centres have already been announced. My interviewees inform me that dozens of UNRWA “dailies” have either been made redundant or have not had their contracts renewed since Trump’s announcement.

Exceptional measures and major insecurities

On January 17 2018, UNRWA headquarters in Amman, Jordan sent UNRWA employees an internal Area Staff Circular noting that, “in view of the severity of the funding shortfall that the Agency currently faces,” the commissioner-general was announcing a series of exceptional measures.

The circular – which a number of my interviewees personally showed me – announced that UNRWA would no longer grant any extension of service to those over 60-years-old, the official age of retirement, and that posts that become vacant because of retirement would not be filled “until further notice”. The conversion of fixed-term appointments to indefinite appointments was also suspended. This means that staff with ten years of continuous service would no longer automatically be eligible for an indefinite appointment.

Sara, a Palestinian teacher I interviewed in early February, told me her heart dropped when she read this circular. Born in a camp in Lebanon, Sara – whose name has been changed – was first employed as a “daily” teacher, and, for the past eight years, as a fixed-term, full-time UNRWA employee. Since 2012, she has been teaching Palestinian children from Syria who arrived in Lebanon seeking sanctuary. She explained why she felt that her future had been pulled out from under her:

If my contract is not converted to an indefinite one, I will have nothing to support me or my family after I am 60. As a ‘B’ employee [the term Palestinians use to refer to workers on fixed-term UNRWA contracts], I would only receive my own savings (tawfeer) as a lump sum, with no contribution from UNRWA.

This is because upon retirement, only UNRWA employees who are on indefinite contracts (known as “A” employees) are eligible to receive the full “Provident Fund” lump sum or what Palestinians refer to as ta’weed: the full compensation paid by UNRWA for their many years’ service.

Ta’weed combines monthly contributions that are deducted directly from Palestinian refugees’ monthly salaries (the tawfeer), plus an UNRWA contribution. As UNRWA employees receive no monthly pension after retirement, without the combined payment Sara would effectively only receive her own savings (tawfeer) in one lump sum, which would never be sufficient to support herself and her family as she grows older.

My interviewees told me they were partially relieved to receive a second UNRWA circular on January 21, stating that “the conversion of fixed-term to indefinite appointment is reinstated.”

However, they remained concerned that with UNRWA’s ongoing financial insecurity, it won’t actually be possible for fixed-term staff to be offered indefinite contracts in the coming years. And they also remain concerned about the future of their pensions.

A fair future

In light of what UNRWA itself has called the “worst financial situation in its 70-year history”, Palestinian staff members are being implored to continue serving the refugee community.

However, UNRWA employees and their families are facing increasing insecurities. They fear for what the future may hold, both for their employment prospects, and for their lives beyond retirement.

For each UNRWA staff member whose contract is not made indefinite, for each person made redundant or removed from the “daily” roster, for each potential employee not recruited to fill a gap left by retirement, and for each person whose full “Providence Fund” (ta'weed) may not be paid by UNRWA, an entire family’s and community’s livelihood is being undermined.",Palestinian refugees lament as Trump funding cuts create job insecurity and a pension crisis,http://theconversation.com/palestinian-refugees-lament-as-trump-funding-cuts-create-job-insecurity-and-a-pension-crisis-93447
2,palestine,"Palestinian terror groups on Wednesday accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of paving the way for “normalization” between the Arab countries and Israel.

Salman, in an interview published Monday, recognized Israel’s right to exist and extolled the prospect of future diplomatic relations between his kingdom and the Jewish state.

His remarks, which have enraged many Palestinians and Arabs, were made during an interview with The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg.

Asked whether he believes “the Jewish people have a right to a nation-state in at least part of their ancestral homeland,” he replied: “I believe that each people, anywhere, has a right to live in their peaceful nation. I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land.”

The Palestinian Authority chose to ignore Salman’s remarks in an apparent attempt to avoid triggering a crisis between Ramallah and Riyadh.

In a move designed to stave off such a crisis and to relay a message to the effect that the Palestinians were keen to remain on good terms with Saudi Arabia, PA President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday expressed “appreciation” for the Saudi monarch’s (Salman’s father) for his “fixed and constant support for the Palestinian cause and Jerusalem and its holy sites.”

Commenting on the younger Salman’s statements, Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzouk said in a tweet: “All those who are addressing the Americans and Zionists with ambiguous words and are talking about concessions in order to appease them are living under an illusion.”

Ahmed Yusef, a senior Hamas official in the Gaza Strip, accused Salman of waging a campaign to “market and promote” Israel in the Arab world.

“I’m surprised to see how this entity [Israel] can be marketed,” Yusef said. “This is a very dangerous matter that needs to be reconsidered. Regrettably, the virus of normalization [with Israel] has begun penetrating some Arab regimes, while the Arabs and Muslims remain categorically opposed to normalization with Israel. Normalization is a dangerous germ.”

The Palestinians, he added, are “capable of thwarting all these conspiracies.”

Wasfi Qabaha, a senior Hamas official in the West Bank, said that Salman’s statements were “part of a dangerous scheme aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause.” The statements, he added, were aimed at paving the way for “full normalization between the Arab countries and Israel.”

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), one of several PLO terror groups, said that Salman’s statements “expose his role as patron of the American deal of the century, which is directed against Palestinian rights.”

The “deal of the century” is the phrase US President Donald Trump used to describe his long-awaited plan for peace in the Middle East.

Jamil Muzher, a senior PFLP official, said that the statements by the Saudi crown prince “reveal the malicious role that the Saudi regime is playing to undermine stability in the Arab region to serve Israeli and American interests there.”

Salman’s statements, he said, are aimed at “normalizing” relations between Saudi Arabia and the “Zionist entity.” The statements are also part of the efforts to build a coalition against Iran, Hezbollah and the Palestinian “resistance,” Muzher charged.

Salman’s statements, the PFLP added, are part of Riyadh’s effort to endear itself to the “Zionist entity and lobby.”

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror organization also condemned Salman’s statements, and said that the “Palestinian’s right to Palestine was absolute and not relative.”

Daoud Shehab, spokesperson for the terror group, said that Salman’s statements were “deplored and rejected.” Claiming that the statements were aimed at “appeasing the US and Israel at the expense of the rights of the Arabs and Muslims,” Shehab said that Salman’s views demonstrated “an obvious ignorance of the facts of history and the nature of the [Israeli-Arab] conflict.”

Recognition of Israel’s right to exist, Shehab added, was “void and illegitimate.” He claimed that Slaman’s views did not reflect those of the Arabs and Muslims. “Recognizing the Zionist entity poses a threat to our cultural identity,” he argued.

Also on Wednesday, Abdul Aziz Al Ishaq, Outreach Manager at Doha Center for Media Freedom, asked in a tweet to his 90,000 followers why Salman had not also recognized Jews’ right to parts of Saudi Arabia.

سؤال برئ . .

هل يقصد ابن سلمان حق يهود بني قريظة أم حق يهود بني النضير في أرضهم (طالما أنه لا يحق له الحديث عن فلسطين المحتلة) ؟ أم أنه لا يعتبر ليهود ""يثرب"" حق في أرضهم لأنهم موجودين فعلاً فيها الآن . . و ""يحكمونها"" ؟!! https://t.co/7Ic7gwbSte — عبدالعزيز آل إسحاق (@AbdulazizSay) April 3, 2018

Saudi Arabia, along with five other Arab countries, last year cut off their diplomatic relations with Qatar, citing the emirate’s alleged support for terrorism as the main reason. Since then, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been engaged in a smear campaign against each other.

The campaign against Salman is currently being countered by another effort spearheaded by many Saudis and supporters of Salman throughout Arab and Islamic countries. They are calling Salman a “history-maker” and an “honest” and “brave” leader.",Palestinian terror groups seethe over Saudi crown prince’s pro-Israel comments,https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-terror-groups-slam-saudi-crown-prince/
