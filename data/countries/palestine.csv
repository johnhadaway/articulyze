0,palestine,"The so-called “deal of the century” is unrealistic and unacceptable to Palestinians regardless of its substance and how its announcement is timed, say Palestinian politicians.

They hold that the US cannot act as a fair mediator, should negotiations resume, especially given Washington’s repeated stances in international forums indicating its unmitigated pro-Israeli bias in spite of Israel’s cold-blooded slaughter of defenceless Palestinian demonstrators who have taken part in peaceful protests against the Trump administration’s recent decisions.

Trump's decisions include recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moving the US embassy to the city, abolishing the Palestinian Right of Return and to destroying the UN Relief Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides humanitarian relief to millions of Palestinian refugees.

Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said last week that the PLO could not even speak with the US administration as long as it considers Jerusalem the capital of Israel.

There is no sense of a Palestinian state without Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in its capital he said.

Responding to Israeli press reports that the US plans to propose its “deal of the century” after it opens the US Embassy in Jerusalem 14 May, Erekat stressed that Trump’s deviation from international law and its frames of reference “put him outside the game”.

“Trump has isolated himself from the peace process,” Erekat continued. “His administration cannot act as a mediator or partner unless it changes its position on Jerusalem.” He cautioned against tendentious rumours and fabrications regarding the Palestinian position.

“President Mahmoud Abbas’s position is clear and succinct. Unless the US retracts its decision to regard Jerusalem as a capital of Israel the US cannot be a sponsor or a mediator in the peace process, whatever pressures are brought to bear and regardless of the fabrications and falsehoods that do not fool our people who have expressed their pride and esteem with regard to the historic stance taken by President Abbas and the Palestinian leadership in reaction to the decisions of President Trump.”

He added that in the face of the Washington’s decisions to cut humanitarian aid from the Palestinian people and UNRWA, to close the PLO office in Washington and to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, “We should not succumb to the illusion that it has anything balanced to offer.”

“What does Trump have left to offer without Jerusalem and the refugees?” he asked, stressing that the Palestinian people could not agree to a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. He added that the US administration had become “part of the problem, not part of the solution”.

Nabil Shaath, political affairs adviser to the Palestinian president, reaffirmed these stances. The Palestinian people will continue to reject the deal of the century; it cannot be forced on them, he said.

“American President Donald Trump can say what he likes, but we will not allow him to impose a deal on us. He should realise, as should we all, that the US no longer owns this world as it had following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, because things have changed. This is why he threatens Mexico and backs down, threatens China and backs down, threatens North Korea and backs down, threatens to abolish NATO and backs down. So, he can propose his deal of the century as he likes, but we will not accept it. We will never accept it.”

“We have said this repeatedly,” Shaath continued. “This is not about accepting or rejecting the deal of the century. It is about rejecting the US as a manager of the peace process. Its role has become suspect. This is why we will reject anything it has to offer.”

Conflicting stances have emerged from the US on the matter. New Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a press conference in Amman, said that Washington supported the two-state solution although the borders of Israel would remain open to discussion.

He also said that the deal of the century had to be approved by both sides and stressed the need for them to return to the negotiating table.

At the same time, however, a high level Israeli political source said that Trump would unveil a new peace plan, the so-called “deal of the century”, after the inauguration of the US Embassy in Jerusalem on 14 May.

The plan, according to the source, calls for payment of compensation to the Palestinian Authority, as an inducement to coax the Palestinians back to negotiations.

The Hebrew media that published the remarks by that source also reported that Israeli authorities were taken by surprise by Trump’s announcement that he was studying the possibility of personally attending the opening of the embassy, which is timed to coincide with the commemoration of the Palestinian Nakba in 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven from their homes.

Trump has said that all US presidents made the same pledge to move the US embassy but never had the courage to fulfil it. “I did. This is why I might go there,” Israeli i24 news reported him as saying.

Meanwhile, demonstrations for the Right of Return are still in progress and are likely to continue. Nevertheless, there are growing fears that the situation will escalate to military clashes because of the repercussions of the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli army.

Israeli officials have threatened to expand the violence and to strike the interior of Gaza as a means to end the protests.

The casualty toll has risen to 44 dead and more than 6,000 wounded since the beginning of the Great March for Return on 30 March.

The Gazan Ministry of Health has announced that it suffers the most acute medical supply shortage in 11 years.

Fifty per cent of medicines and basic medical supplies have been depleted in hospitals and clinics, and especially emergency service centres in Gaza.

The ministry attributes the shortage to the occupation forces’ targeting of 7,000 civilians who took part in the demonstrations for the right of return.

Secretary-General of the Palestinian National Initiative Mustafa Barghouti said that when the Palestinians used armed resistance against the occupation, Israel described the resistance as terrorism.

When they used popular resistance, Israel described the peaceful movement as violent. When the Palestinians and their supporters launched the peaceful boycott movement, Israel described the movement as anti-Semitic.

When the Palestinians criticise and expose the crimes committed by Israel and the occupation and its racist nature, they are accused of incitement. When humanitarian-spirited Jews reject Israeli policies and the occupation, and declare their support for Palestinian rights, Israel condemns them as “self-haters”.

Barghouti stressed that it matters little what Israel says. Like every repressive and racist regime, it uses every means to falsify the facts and distort the truth.

But the problem is that other countries, governments and some politicians parrot everything the Israeli government says without bothering to think about the substance.

He continued, “when, as occurred in the Security Council with Nikki Haley, the insolence reaches the stage of criminalising the victims and defending the criminal murders, in spite of the fact that Israel has been exposed and all other members of the Security Council are unanimous in their opposition to the use of deadly live ammunition against defenceless demonstrators, it becomes hypocrisy to pay lip service to international law and human rights and double standards prevail.

""This begs the questions to whether we are living in an era in which the law of the jungle rules. Has mankind undergone centuries of regression to the point where the arrogance of might and the barbarity of colonialism and hegemony have become acceptable?”

The PNI secretary-general added that the German parliament’s endorsement of a bill recognising the “Jewishness” of the State of Israel and the unsuccessful bid on the part of certain quarters in Romania, the Czech Republic and some other countries to have their governments move their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem in contravention of international law, “confirm that the Palestinian struggle for freedom and justice extends around the world”.

This month, Israeli snipers shot hundreds of Palestinian protesters — including one journalist wearing a vest marked “PRESS” — who posed no life-threatening danger to them, or to the people they’re meant to protect. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman then justified these shootings on the grounds that “there are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip,” suggesting that the area’s 1.8 million Palestinian men, women, and children are all legitimate targets of state violence. Meanwhile, Israel reneged on an agreement with the United Nations to grant legal status to 40,000 African asylum-seekers (whom the Netanyahu government had previously intended to jail en masse or deport), leaving those long-suffering refugees in a state of limbo.

And then, Natalie Portman did something controversial.

Last Friday, the Israeli-American actress abruptly canceled plans to accept a prestigious award in Jerusalem. Initially, this decision appeared to be an endorsement of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement; the organization behind the Genesis Prize said that Portman had declined their honor because “she does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel.” But the actress promptly denied that claim, and detailed her true rationale in an Instagram post:

I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony. By the same token, I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it. Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation. I treasure my Israeli friends and family, Israeli food, books, art, cinema, and dance. Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust. But the mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values. Because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power.

Portman’s statement is a model of liberal Zionist dissent. It focuses its fire on Israel’s elected leadership, while evincing love for its people; insists that one need not choose between the Jewish value of empathy for the marginalized, and support for the Jewish state; and frames her criticism of Israeli policy as a defense of Israel’s own best interests — all while explicitly disavowing the BDS movement.

For decades, progressive Jews have been assured that such sentiments are kosher. The notion that there is a fundamental distinction between the righteousness of Israeli policy and Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state has enabled countless American Jews to reconcile their liberal values with unconditional support for the latter premise. Radicals might have insisted that illiberalism and state Zionism were inextricable; that the maintenance of a majority-Jewish nation in a predominantly Muslim region would inevitably require discriminatory policies. But liberal Jews knew better; they could support both the Israelis and Palestinians — one day, there would be two states for two peoples, Zionism and democracy, from the river to the sea.

In the wake of Portman’s protest, the Israeli government rushed to assure such Jews that they were wrong.

Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Portman’s actions bordered on anti-Semitism; security minister Gilad Erdan argued that she had “turned to the Dark Side” (just like Anakin Skywalker before her); and an ally of Netanyahu in the Israeli parliament called for stripping the Jerusalem-born actress of her citizenship. The overriding implication of all these statements was the same: One cannot claim to be “pro-Israel” and publicly criticize its “atrocities.”

This response was indicative of the Netanyahu government’s broader disinterest in keeping up the pretenses that sustain liberal Zionism. No longer content with maintaining de facto apartheid rule in the occupied West Bank, Israeli lawmakers are moving to establish the de jure variety. As Israeli civil rights lawyer Michael Sfard recently explained in The New York Review of Books:

Temporariness is one of the qualities that distinguishes the regretful, yet legal, reality of occupation from the illegal act of annexation by force. The policies that evolved over decades—a creeping process of de facto annexation—stopped short of a wholesale application of Israel’s sovereignty over the Occupied Territories; the legal and political distinctions between the West Bank and Israel were preserved.

Now, this crucial legal-political status is being dismantled.

… [T]he ruling parliamentary coalition has put its lawyers to work drafting numerous annexationist bills. Their latest accomplishments include a law, enacted last year, which instructs the army to confiscate private Palestinian land and assign it to the intruding Israelis who have put up settlements there. This law is not only a naked sanction of land theft; it is also an unprecedented imposition of Knesset legislation on Palestinians who have no parliamentary representation.

… Justices in the Supreme Court, housed in a hilltop building that faces the Knesset, have set precedents of their own: last November, three judges ruled that the settlers constitute a “local population” in the West Bank, and that therefore, under certain conditions, private Palestinian land can be “temporarily” allocated to serve their needs. Their judgment overturned a principle, upheld for over forty years, that barred the use of private Palestinian land for settlement expansion. Within days of the ruling, the attorney general authorized the army to consider the expropriation of private land owned by Palestinian farmers to pave a settlement road.

Liberal Zionists have long argued that failure to make peace with the Palestinians would eventually force Israel to choose between its Jewish and democratic character. But the Netanyahu regime is perfectly comfortable dispensing with the latter. Israel’s deputy defense minister, MK Rabbi Eli Ben-Dahan, recently called for the formal annexation of the West Bank “as soon as possible.”

“They want to scare us, that maybe soon we will not be a majority and therefore we have to abandon Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]. This is a grave mistake,” Ben-Dahan told the far-right Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva. “Even if we apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, full civil rights are not just given, and certainly not on the first day. We will have to wait several years as is customary in every country.”

Natalie Portman is a no radical anti-Zionist. Just a few years ago, she served as a research assistant on a book defending the Jewish state against its left-wing critics. But like most American Jews, she does subscribe to the concept of universal human rights. Her decision to decline the Genesis Award — and the vituperative reaction to that act of dissent — reflects the reality that the Israeli government is no longer interested in indulging the diaspora’s effete concern for the Palestinians’ welfare. And all signs suggest this will remain the case for the foreseeable future. The Israeli left is in tatters, while the steady growth of Israel’s settler and ultra-Orthodox populations appear destined to fortify the state’s commitment to annexationist policies in the years to come.

Thus, to remain conventionally “pro-Israel,” American Jews are going to need to evermore tightly quarantine their liberalism to domestic politics — even as developments in domestic politics exacerbate the difficulty of that task.

There have always been tensions between liberal universalism and Jewish nationalism. But the rise of the Trumpist right has heightened such contradictions. To remain true to both AIPAC and progressivism, a liberal Zionist must now lament border walls in Texas but defend them in the West Bank; condemn Republicans who suggest that nonwhite babies pose a threat to American civilization as proto-Nazis and endorse Israel’s right to defend itself against the “demographic threat” that is Palestinian children; decry Donald Trump’s ban on Syrian refugees and apologize for Israel’s imprisonment of African ones; abhor the president’s indifference to civilian casualties and ignore that Israel’s defense minister believes every man, woman, and child in the Gaza Strip is an enemy combatant.

And they must do all this while Netanyahu and his allies all but encourage American Jews to draw analogies between Trumpism and (actually existing) Zionism, by publicly aligning themselves against Barack Obama and with Donald Trump.

Even before Israel’s rightward shift accelerated over the past year, younger American Jews were growing more estranged from the Jewish state. Pew data from 2013 found that only a third of Jews under 49 believed that Israel’s government was making a sincere attempt at peace with the Palestinians, while a quarter of those between 18 and 29 felt that the U.S. government was “too supportive of Israel” — among Jews between the ages of 30 and 49, that figure was only 12 percent; among those above 65, it was just 5. In all likelihood, the political developments of the last five years have further dampened enthusiasm for Israel among the rising generation of American Jews.

The prospect that young American Jews would lose interest in Zionism had long been a source of anxiety for Israeli policymakers. And many interpreted the Israeli government’s hysterical response to Portman as a testament to that fear. But the opposite interpretation seems just as plausible — that the Israeli Establishment is no longer afraid of losing the affections of the Natalie Portmans of the world.

And why should they be? Between America’s Christian right and growing population of deeply conservative Orthodox Jews, there is a strong base of support in the United States for an unapologetically illiberal and undemocratic Greater Israel. And for now, the vast majority of liberal Jews remain reflexively supportive of the Jewish state, while most who aren’t decline to translate their qualms into political action. Thus, while senior officials in the Israeli government were explicitly endorsing the annexation of the West Bank over the past year, the leadership of the Democratic Party didn’t merely keep silent — they pushed legislation that would make boycotting Israeli goods in protest of annexation (or anything else) a federal crime.

Meanwhile, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates have ostensibly decided that it is better to have Israel as an ally in the fight against Iran, than to have the Palestinian cause as a domestic political distraction. And as an authoritarian China rises, and right-wing populism spreads through the West, it seems plausible that Israel’s occupation might outlive the liberal order that was supposed to (eventually) render it illegitimate.

Liberal Zionists have traditionally leavened their moral objections to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank (and blockade of Gaza) with an appeal to pragmatism: Making painful concessions for peace wasn’t just the right thing for Israel to do, but one necessary for ensuring its long-term survival. For the moment, the Israeli right has reason to view that sentiment as a bluff it wisely called.

It is still possible that liberal Zionists’ warning will prove prescient, that Israel will eventually be forced to either abandon its illiberalism or forfeit its existence. But it’s hard to see how that will happen, unless American Jews are willing to put their liberalism above their Zionism — and to work to force that choice.",Natalie Portman and the Crisis of Liberal Zionism,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/natalie-portman-and-the-crisis-of-liberal-zionism.html

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was re-elected as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) Executive Committee on Friday, as the veteran leader sought to renew his legitimacy while installing loyalists who he hopes will eventually continue his legacy.

To really understand the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz

The expected reappointment came at the end of a four-day meeting by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. The PNC chose a new Executive Committee, the most senior body of the PLO.

""Members of the PLO Executive Committee consulted among themselves and decided to elect brother Abu Mazen (Abbas) as the chairman of the Executive Committee,"" said Azzam Al-Ahmad, a staunch ally of Abbas who was among nine new people elected to the 15-member committee.

The PNC was convened by Abbas in part to forge a strategy in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decisions to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and to move the U.S. embassy to the city.

The first PNC meeting in 22 years was overshadowed by criticism of Abbas's opening speech on Monday, which drew accusations of anti-Semitism.

>> What Abbas really said about the Jews | Analysis

The new Executive Committee was not elected but were chosen by consultation with the PLO factions who took part.

Abbas, 82, is thought to have achieved most of his goals at the meeting, including the removal from the committee of some of his rivals, including Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Palestinian Authority prime minister and negotiator Ahmed Qurei.

Abbas left the door open for other factions who boycotted the session, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, to win one of three seats that have yet to be filled.

He also said that a rival Islamist group such as Hamas was welcome to come on board ""if it accepted the national unity and if it accepted the PLO.""

Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycotted the meeting, along with some PLO factions.

Some did not want to attend an event held in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and others wanted the meeting postponed to allow for greater consultation and more time for reconciliation between the two main rival factions, Hamas and Fatah.

The leader of Abbas's most powerful rival, Hamas, dismissed the four-day session as a ""clapping party"" for Abbas.","In Shadow of anti-Semitism Crisis, Abbas Reelected to Top Spot on Palestinian Liberation Organization",https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/abbas-reelected-to-top-spot-on-palestinian-liberation-organization-1.6054302

• During the first quarter of 2018, the deteriorating socio-economic situation in the Gaza Strip, characterized by shortages in the electricity and fuel supply, uncertainty in the funding of key services and renewed clashes has deepened the severe humanitarian situation for Palestinian children and their families.

• Ongoing demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have so far resulted in the death of 33 Palestinians, including three children (source: UN).

• In addition to 3,193 children reached with child protection and MHPSS services, psychosocial support was provided to 40 children directly affected.

• Two stocks of prepositioned essential drugs and medical consumables were released to cover emergency medical care for 111,532 children and their families.

• UNICEF supported the rehabilitation of water systems to improve access to safe drinking water in the most vulnerable communities of the Gaza Strip and of the West Bank. More than 24,640 people benefited from improved access to water as a result of UNICEF’s interventions in Gaza.

• UNICEF is currently supporting the training 180 pre-schools and 600 school teachers on positive discipline, in view of activating 60 school mediation teams as part of its non-violence programming.

• UNICEF and its partners provided protective accompaniment and presence to 5,400 children and 144 teachers crossing military checkpoints to and from schools in the West Bank.

• The current deterioration of the situation in Gaza and rising tensions in the West Bank require urgent funding for child protection, health and education interventions to address the growing humanitarian needs and funding gap of 72 percent.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tensions have been running high in the State of Palestine following the announcement of the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem at the end of December 2017, planned for 14 May 2018. This comes at a time when Gaza’s economy continues to deteriorate as the intra-Palestinian reconciliation process appears stalled, having brought no real improvement in the lives of children so far. On 13 March, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority’s convoy was hit by a roadside Improvised Explosive Device as he visited Gaza to inaugurate the new Northern Gaza Emergency Sanitation Treatment Plant.

In Gaza, families have access to less than five hours of electricity a day and continue to face difficulties to access safe drinking water. Added to a reduction in the salaries of civil servants, further cuts in services and strict movement restrictions, the situation has negatively affected the entire population of two million, half of them children, and deepened the humanitarian needs in terms of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and child protection services.

Every Friday since March 30, over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza have participated in demonstrations along the fence with Israel to protest the ten-year-old blockade and support the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees. While the protests were overall peaceful and most demonstrators did not approach the fence, 33 Palestinians have been killed, including three children (source: UN). According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 2,835 Palestinian have been injured, of which 277 are children. This is the highest number of casualties since the 2014 hostilities. In the West Bank, tensions have been running high since December, with clashes sporadically erupting in various parts of the territory. UNICEF has appealed to all actors to put the protection of children first.

The total number of people in need in 2018 is 2. 5 million, of which 90 per cent live in the Gaza Strip. 1.8 million people are in need of WASH services suffer from poor water quality due to poor infrastructure, restrictions on fuel supplies and acute power cuts. With the escalation in violence, injuries and deaths, more children are in need of mental health and psychosocial support.","State of Palestine: Humanitarian Situation Report, January – March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/state-palestine-humanitarian-situation-report-january-march-0
4,palestine,"UK Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, attended the Palestinian National Council summit in Ramallah this week, where she slammed the policies of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump.

Thornberry wrote a lengthy Facebook post expressing her dismay with the two leaders and listed three solemn guarantees that the Labour party will take as soon as they are in office again.

“First, as we rightly mark this month the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the State of Israel, I said it is also right — and long overdue — for the United Kingdom to formally recognise the State of Palestine, and urge other countries to do the same, not in due course, not when the time is right, but now and without delay,” the Facebook post read.

Calling Donald Trump’s cut of aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) “cruel and spiteful”, Thornberry vowed that a “Labour government would host an international funding conference to address the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.”

“And third, I said a Labour government in Britain would immediately review the sale of arms by the United Kingdom to Israel to ensure that none of the weapons sold by our country are being used by the Netanyahu government to attack innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza or anywhere else,” she said.

The Shadow Foreign Secretary slammed the Netanyahu-led government’s actions, including “the expansion of illegal settlements, the crippling blockade against Gaza, the brutal and lethal suppression of protests on the Gaza border, and the unlawful detention and ill-treatment of Palestinian children.”

“And from the Trump administration, it includes the reckless and irresponsible decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem, and the cruel cuts in funding for the UN agencies providing healthcare, education and humanitarian relief to Palestinian refugees,” Thornberry wrote.

A future Labour government would also use its influence in the UN to improve the situation for the Palestinians, such as being a “constant voice on the Security Council urging action when Israel breaks international law, and exposing the hypocrisy of the United States and others who demand tough action and independent investigations when other countries break those laws, but turn a blind eye when it comes to the Netanyahu government.”

Addressing Israel’s detention of Palestinian children, Thornberry said “we would also demand a new independent investigation into the Netanyahu government’s breaches of international law when it comes to the detention, ill-treatment and unfair prosecution of Palestinian children, an issue on which we have already led the way in demanding action in the UK Parliament.”

Thornberry did not comment on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ speech at the Palestinian National Council summit in Ramallah, which was condemned by the EU, UN, and the US.

Abbas, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism before, suggested in a rambling address to a rare meeting of the Palestinian National Council on Monday night that the Holocaust was a result of Jews’ “social behavior, [charging interest], and financial matters.”

""From the 11th century until the Holocaust that took place in Germany, those Jews -- who moved to Western and Eastern Europe -- were subjected to a massacre every 10 to 15 years. But why did this happen? They say 'it is because we are Jews',"" he told the hundreds of delegates.

""The speech Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered on 30 April contained unacceptable remarks concerning the origins of the Holocaust and Israel's legitimacy,"" a spokesman for the EU's diplomatic service said in a statement.

In April, Israel's Labor Party leader Avi Gabbay suspended relations with UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his office in a letter amid burgeoning accusations of antisemitism thrown at the controversial British politician.

While there are many areas where our respective parties can and will cooperate, we cannot retain relations with you, Leader of Labour Party UK, while you fail to adequately address the anti-Semitism within Labour Party UK,"" the letter addressed to the ""Rt Hon Jeremy Corbyn MP"" read. ""I write to inform you of the temporary suspension of all formal relations.""

""It is my responsibility to acknowledge the hostility that you have shown to the Jewish community and the anti-Semitic statements and actions you have allowed as Leader of the Labour Party UK,"" Gabby added.

5,palestine,"Stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties, the youth in Gaza are rising up.

Seventy years ago, more than 170,000 Palestinian from historic Palestine were forced to leave their homes, villages, cities and lands, as refugees to the Gaza Strip. They were part of the 710,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave, seeking refuge in Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere.

The images of elderly people and kids fleeing the killings of the Zionists gangs and militias in 1948, still occupy the vivid memories of Palestinians as well as comprising the visual identity of the Nakba (Catastrophe). Today, after seven decades, the grandsons and granddaughtersof those refugees are making their way back to their villages. They have never seen their villages, homes or land, but they kept the memories of their grandparents, linking their identity to their villages, vowing to return to their homes, relying on the international recognition of their right to return, and the moral responsibilities of their right.

The Great Return March is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza

The Great Return March (GRM) is not solely a protest against the ongoing siege of Gaza, and the increasingly severe humanitarian crisis, but rather it is a protest against the Nakba, that has been ongoing since 1948. The young generation of Palestinians know that the current humanitarian crisis and the disintegration on the Palestinian system is a result of the Nakba, as well as thedehumanization and the apartheid that is institutionalized against the indigenous people of Palestine. Therefore, any discussion on the GRM should consider the protests as an action and a reaction. Action against the ongoing imprisonment of 1.8 million Palestinians in the Gaza strip for more than ten years, and a reaction to the apathy of the international community.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, forty Palestinian civilians were killed and 5511 were wounded since March 30. Two journalists were assassinated deliberately by the Israeli forces, despite each bearing a clear sign that they are journalists. In addition to this, hundreds of the wounded were children and minors. Each of the forty people who scarified themselves had a story to tell, and a mission to accomplish. They were humans, who loved, and were beloved bytheir families, friends and relatives.

One of those killed was Mohammed Ayoub, 15 years old from Jabbaliya, who was shot in the head in front of cameras, without threatening or causing any harm to the Israeli Army. In his photos there is one where he drew aheartbetween his initials and those of another person. He did not think that he would be a target ofan Israeli sniper who might have even cheered after shooting a civilian, as one video showed soldiers cheering as they were shooting at civilians. Mohamed died and left a story to remember.

Another person killed was the beloved journalist, Yasser Mourtaja, who was well- known in Gaza for his kindness tochildren and his professionalism as a photojournalist. Weeks before he was killed by the Israeli snipers despite wearing a vest marked by “PRESS”, he was awarded a USAID fund for his media organisation.

A third person lost was the artist Mohamed Abu Amro, who was shot in the head while participating in a nonviolent protest on the eastern borders of Gaza.

19 year old Abdulfatah Abdulnabi was running away from the fence between the besieged Gaza Strip and Israel, when an Israeli sniper shot him dead.

A video published by the Israeli media shows how the Israeli soldiers and army view the Palestinians. The video shows an Israeli Armyofficer asking one soldier to “shoot the guy in blue”, but the soldier tells him that he will take the one in red. This interaction shows how the Palestinians have been dehumanized by the Israelis, with the removal of their names, history, families, and humanity. The video illustrates the approach of the Israeli Army which sees millions of Palestinians as objects rather thanhumans. It is evidence that the conflict is not only about freedom, but also aboutlife.

This killing doctrine and the dehumanisation of the Palestinians can be seen clearly in the words of Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who said after nine Palestinians were killed that there were “no Innocent people in Gaza”.

The population of the Gaza Strip that has been under intense siege since January 2006 and has been suffering enormously. Since the early 1990s, Israel imposed movement restrictions on the Gaza Strip, where 1.8 million people live, making itone of the biggest open air prisons in the world.

It is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable

In 2015, a UN report warned that, under the current conditions, the Gaza Strip will be “uninhabitable” by 2020. However, it is 2018, and the Gaza Strip is already uninhabitable.

The ongoing Israeli blockage, and the sanctions imposed by the Palestinian authority against the Gaza Strip, was the result of failed reconciliation efforts with Hamas. Since then the economy and life in Gaza has been crippled, with suffering growing rapidly. In 2015, the GDP in the Gaza Strip was 971 USD, while it was 5754 USD for the same period in the West Bank.

Comparatively in Israel it is at 44,019 USD. The unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip and West Bank reached 26.9% in 2016, with Gaza hardest hit at 41.7% unemployment compared to 18.2% in the West Bank. Yet, the real numbers of youth unemployment in Gaza have reached more than 75%. This shows the inequality that the Palestinians suffer compared to Israel, and also how the Gaza Strip is suffering from huge inequality compared to the West Bank.

The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are walking through a dark tunnel, with no end in sight. They are stuck between the hammer of the Israeli apartheid and the anvil of Palestinian political parties. This reality pushes them to take the lead and organize nonviolent protests, shifting attention to the real cause of the problem, which started in 1948.

The youth of the Gaza Strip are rising up in the face of Israeli colonialism, and the status-quo, as well as an act of rejection ofthe political parties in the Gaza strip, including Hamas and Fatah. The youth in Gaza struggle for their dignity, and prefer to fight for life and die in dignity, rather than die slowly from the blockade.","The Palestinians in Gaza: fighting for life, struggling for rights",https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/abdalhadi-alijla/palestinians-in-gaza-fighting-for-life-struggling-for-rights
6,palestine,"A paralysed and indecisive Palestinian leadership, faced with mounting pressure from the Americans and Israelis, is undermining key national goals, analysts say.

They say the decisions taken by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) during its meeting in Ramallah last week show that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lacks the will to respond to American and Israeli efforts to thwart Palestinian statehood.

While in session, the PNC took several decisions including the redefinition of relations with Israel as one of ""conflict"".

It dismissed the PLO-Israel interim agreements signed in Washington and Cairo in the 1990s as ""expired"", and rejected the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

In the past, Abbas, 82, has repeatedly insisted that the path to achieving statehood for the Palestinians lies only through peace negotiations with Israel, not armed struggle.

'Strategic mistake'

On the face of it, the PNC decisions indicate a departure from the negotiations path, the analysts say.

However, in reality, the Palestinian leadership is too weak and fragmented to either withdraw from existing agreements with Israel or end the policy of treating peace negotiations as a strategic choice.

Mohamad Dalbah, a Washington-based Palestinian analyst, says the crisis confronting Palestinians today is rooted in the ""catastrophic"" Oslo agreement that Abbas and the late Yasser Arafat signed with Israel.

Oslo was a ""strategic mistake"" for the Palestinians, he told Al Jazeera, because it never stipulated the establishment of a Palestinian state and left open-ended the core issues of the status of Jerusalem and the right Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel in 1948.

In 1993 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo agreement with Israel and established an interim Palestinian Authority.

The Oslo Accords stipulated that within five years of the signing of the agreement - that is, in 1999 - both parties should enter into negotiations for the final-settlement status, including the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

Twenty-five years later, Palestinians and Israelis have yet to start any final settlement negotiations.

'Legally solid'

Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset, told Al Jazeera the decisions of the PNC are ""meaningless"" as long as the PA continues security coordination with Israel, which is the most important objective for Israel.

Zahalka said the current Palestinian condition, defined by a weak local government, is in the best interest of Israel but not the Palestinians because it is conducive to neither peace nor resistance.

By maintaining internal security in Palestinian areas on behalf of Israel, the PA reduces Israel's military burden of maintaining its military occupation.

However, Abdallah Abueid, a Palestinian legal expert, says the international position of the Palestinians in light of the PNC decisions is ""legally solid"".

This is because Israel has repeatedly violated the agreements, refuses to withdraw from the occupied territories and is unwilling to conclude final-status negotiations with the Palestinians, says Abueid, who teaches International law at Bethlehem University.

That being said, ""Palestinians are in a very precarious position today and are unable to move forward or even go backward if they wanted to"".

Zahalka, the Knesset member, says Palestinian leaders should now take a strategic decision to reinvigorate popular and peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation.

""Only then would Israel find itself compelled to end its illegal occupation,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Issue of successor

During its session in Ramallah, the PNC also re-elected Abbas president of the State of Palestine and chairman of the PLO.

It further elected 15 members of the executive committee out of 18 representing different Palestinian factions most of whom are Abbas loyalists.

Neither the PNC nor any governing body formally discussed the issue of a successor for the octogenarian Abbas, who is reportedly suffering from multiple ailments.

According to sources familiar with internal deliberations on the succession issue, Abbas supports the separation of the powers of the PLO, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, and the chairman of Fatah.

Abbas is in favour of having a different person to lead each body, the sources told Al Jazeera.

“One of the painful issues of the Islamic world is the plight of Rohingya Muslims, which remains one of the biggest refugee crises in the world. In 2017 Azerbaijan was one of the first countries to allocate 100 tons of humanitarian aid to Rohingya Muslims who are suffering as the result of mass violence and ethnic cleansing and we will continue our assistance to those who need it”.

This was stated by Elmar Mammadyarov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the 45th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC member states.

Addressing the session, Mammadyarov said: “Azerbaijan is deeply concerned over wars and armed conflicts in a number of the OIC Member States, which have led to greater security challenges, political instability in some regions, large-scale displacement and unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Azerbaijan will continue to work intensively with the other OIC Member States through different OIC Contact Groups to which Azerbaijan is a member, namely Contact Groups on Palestine, Jammu and Kashmir and Muslim minorities in Europe.

The bloody clashes taking places on the Israel-Palestine border causes our deep concern. We, Member States and OIC, have to put as much effort as possible to stop this bloodshed. Just as before, Azerbaijan declares its readiness to contribute to this matter and we reaffirm our full solidarity and our persistent support for the just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. Azerbaijan stands for the two-state solution of the Palestinian conflict with East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine.

On 20-21 July 2017, Azerbaijan hosted the International Conference on the Question of Jerusalem in Baku under the auspices of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and with the support of the OIC, which has been concluded with the introduction of a communique on behalf of its organizers condemning the closure of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and restrictions on worshippers therein.

On 3-6 April 2018, in the capacity of Non Alignment Movement (NAM) Troika, Azerbaijan hosted the 18th Mid-term Ministerial Meeting of the NAM, titled “Promotion International Peace and Security for Sustainable Development”. Within the framework of this event the meeting of NAM Ministerial Committee on Palestine was organized. In the Final Baku Declaration were reiterated urgent calls for serious, collective efforts to bring a complete end to the violations.

We are also planning to organize the Annual Ambassadorial Meeting of the State of Palestine accredited in Asia countries by the end of 2018 in Baku and I think it will be the next opportunity for discussing current challenges of the People and State of Palestine”.

Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister further said: “Our future development depends on study and health of the Youth, on their employment. On 17-19 April 2018, The Delegates of the OIC Member States attended the 4th Session of the Islamic Conference of Youth and Sports Ministers in Baku which reiterated Islam as a religion of peace and underlined the importance of youth development, capacity building and increasing the role of the youth in promoting development, peace and safety in general among the Muslim communities, inspired by prioritization by “OIC 2025 Program of Action” of youth and sports issues for the global development agenda, particularly in OIC Member States.

Touching upon the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Elmar Mammadyarov underlined: “It is a confirmed fact, that as the result of military aggression by Armenia, 20 percent of internationally recognized territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, including Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent regions have been occupied as well as almost one millions of people have become refugees and internally displaced persons. Numerous historical, cultural and religious monuments in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan have been brutally destroyed and humiliated. The UN, including its Security Council and OIC resolutions, which clearly recognize Armenia as an aggressor, must be the main message to all Muslim countries that want to develop relations with the invader because Armenia’s policy of occupation is an attack not only on Azerbaijan’s religious and cultural assets, but on historic and cultural legacy of Islam in general.

I would like to note with thanks the strong and just position of the OIC member-states with regard to the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Nagorno Karabakh conflict, reflected in the OIC Ministerial resolutions.

Azerbaijan is working consistently to promote Islamic values around the world and actively contributed to the organization of the Department of Islamic Arts in famous Louvre museum in France, and was the first Muslim country to demonstrate its exhibition in the Vatican. In 2009, Baku was declared the capital of Islamic culture. In 2018, Nakhchivan, another ancient Azerbaijan city, was awarded this honorary title. The opening ceremony of “Nakhchivan, the Capital of Islamic Culture-2018” event will be held on 20th June 2018 in the city of Nakhchivan with the participation of the Culture Ministers of OIC Member States.

In the end of my address, taking the opportunity, I would like to thank the OIC for the close cooperation to make a presentation on December 21, 2017 at its headquarters on Baku’s bid to host “World Expo-2025” and wish peace, stability, sustainable development and strong solidarity for our Ummah.","‘Azerbaijan is deeply concerned over wars and armed conflicts in OIC Member States’, Mammadyarov",https://azertag.az/en/xeber/1160262

A&E EDITOR

Palestine is the hottest foreign policy issue upon which no politician will act.

What needs to be absolutely clear is that the Palestinian humanitarian crisis is not a partisan issue. Both U.S. parties have made their stance crystal clear—neither are willing to confront the Israeli government on an ongoing apartheid taking place in occupied territory.

It would be a futile effort to explain the long, conflict-ridden history surrounding the region in a short newspaper article. However, readers should understand that this is a humanitarian issue above all else. Treating this as a geopolitical conflict with equally powerful sides is simply incorrect.

A common misconception about the Palestinian crisis is that the issue is too complex for the outside world to act. While the issue is highly complicated, that hardly justifies the global community’s inaction.

One of the most recent incidents of Israeli oppression occurred toward the end of March. According to Al Jazeera coverage, 17 Palestinians were killed and 1,400 were injured when the Israeli army engaged protestors. The march was calling for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homelands.

This military engagement with protestors is not uncommon. While this latest incident yielded more staggering casualties, the Israeli army frequently engages peaceful protests (or children throwing rocks) with rubber bullets, tear gas and occasionally live ammunition.

According to BBC’s Israel/Palestine event timeline, in December, President Donald Trump ordered that the U.S. government recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Additionally, the order called for the U.S. embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv—the city most countries recognize as Israel’s capital—to Jerusalem. The move hasn’t happened yet, but it’s scheduled to occur in the near future.

Jerusalem is one of the most culturally significant cities for several religions that have spread across the globe. Israel seized the city from Palestinian control in 1967, in a brutal military conflict known commonly as the Six Day War. Since assuming control of the city, countries have been reluctant to recognize it as Israel’s capital.

The president’s decision to recognize Jerusalem was met with immediate backlash on the world stage—and very little action outside of Palestine.

A comprehensive Reuters article published on Dec. 29, 2017 detailed Palestinian protests against the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem. No Israelis were hurt. Many Palestinian protesters were injured by Israeli soldiers. These incidents, after filtering through American media, are seen as clashes between equally-powerful opposing forces.

The fact that the president’s decision to move an embassy—essentially to prove a point—has caused serious injury should alarm Americans. United States leadership cannot continue to make irrational decisions that cause this harm.

It doesn’t matter how many other countries denounce Israel’s decimating of Palestine. Until the United States takes a stand, very little is going to change. This is a decision that is, unfortunately, in the American people’s hands. Plagued by misinformation and overwhelming complication, many Americans appear to be content with letting a U.S. sanctioned apartheid unravel across the sea.

This isn’t a matter of expanding U.S. influence in the Middle East, gaining the favor of Arab nations or endorsing a religious group. Taking action to resolve this conflict is about protecting innocent civilian lives.

There is no simple solution to century-old conflict that has plagued the region, but Americans have to take that first step. Raising awareness for the situation and pressuring government representation is the only way citizens can push for change overseas.",The U.S. must do more to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,https://unothegateway.com/u-s-must-resolve-israeli-palestinian-conflict/
9,palestine,"Speaking at the International Mount of Olives Peace Awards at the Cemal Resit Rey Concert Hall in Istanbul, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said:

Palestinians are the symbol of all oppressed people in the world because of the persecution, massacres, and injustices they have been subjected to.

Erdogan said the Palestine cause was not an exclusive issue of a nation or a city, adding that the future of humanity would be determined according to its stance against the Palestine and Jerusalem cause, reports Anadolu Agency.

“If the reverse happens, a dark future will be awaiting us, one in which all rights, freedoms, and moral and conscientious measures are absent or eliminated and in which tyranny prevails.”

Erdogan said what was happening in Palestine was the legitimization of tyranny, highlighting Israel’s mounting persecution against Palestinians whose sole guilt was trying to defend their own land.

The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people during these [Israeli] attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society and individual will be safe.

Erdogan accused the international institutions responsible for ensuring peace and security in Palestine, calling them “hypocrites”.

He also stressed that when it came to delivering aid, great economic powers fiercely competing with each other whenever an economic, political or military interest was at stake had fallen behind Turkey.

10,palestine,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian eyes are on the Yarmouk refugee camp just south of Damascus, where the Syrian regime and its supporting Palestinian factions, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are fighting Islamic State (IS) militants. On May 2, the Syrian army was able to deploy troops around the area, which was previously controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra.

In April 2015, IS had control of 90% of the camp after fighting with Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis and gunmen from various factions.

The Palestinians hope for a quick end to the military operations in the camp, with IS’ defeat and the liberation of the camp. This will allow the reconstruction process to begin and the displaced to return. To that end, Palestinians seem to be betting on good relations between the PLO and the Syrian government.

On April 25, the director of the political department of the PLO in Syria, Anwar Abdel Hadi, revealed to the Voice of Palestine that he met with Syrian Minister of State for National Reconciliation Affairs Ali Haidar and UN Resident Coordinator in Syria Ali al-Zaatari and discussed the need to provide assistance and support for refugees and to begin reconstruction in refugee camps in Syria to ensure the refugees’ safe return once the militants are eradicated.

Haidar had stressed in several meetings with Palestinian delegations — most recently on June 7 and Sept. 25, 2017 — that the Syrian army was working on a plan to rid the camp of militants and allow people back, noting that Syria is keen to preserve refugee camps as a focal point of the Palestinian cause.

Ahmad Majdalani, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' envoy to Syria and a member of the PLO’s Executive Committee, told Al-Monitor, “There was a decision to establish a PLO committee to manage the reconstruction of the camp,” adding, “The committee will raise funds for reconstruction and the return of the camp’s residents, coordinating with the Syrian authorities.”

Majdalani explained that the committee is waiting for the end of the military operations between the Syrian army and the militants and the clearing of the rubble to begin its operations.

After getting a clearer idea of the magnitude of the damage, the PLO will coordinate with the Syrian authorities on the details of the reconstruction process and with international parties to bring in support and funding for reconstruction. It may also run a fundraising campaign among Palestinians.

The Yarmouk camp is one of the largest Palestinian camps in Syria and some consider it the capital of the diaspora. It was established in the 1950s and hosted 200,000 refugees before violence erupted at the beginning of the Syrian crisis that left IS in control.

Meanwhile, Abdel Hadi told Al-Monitor on the sidelines of the PLO National Council session in Ramallah held April 30-May 3, “The national committee will work on the reconstruction of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria under the auspices of the PLO.”

He added, “We have contacted relief agencies such as the UNRWA and some donor countries such as Norway, and they are ready to help finance the reconstruction. Coordination with the Syrian authorities is ongoing and they have agreed to start reconstruction after clearing the camp of terrorists.” Abdel Hadi noted, “The committee will meet with the Palestinian factions and the rest of the parties to determine details of the reconstruction process after the camp is fully liberated.”

In addition to Yarmouk, several other camps are in need of reconstruction, such as Daraa and Sabinah in southern Rif Dimashq governorate as well as Handarat in Aleppo.

The Palestinians are counting on starting reconstruction in the camp immediately after the clashes end, taking advantage of international eagerness to make donations for reconstruction in Syria. Most recently, the UN Brussels Conference on April 25 allocated $4.4 billion to all Syria. On May 31, 2017, Norway pledged to assist in the reconstruction of the camp’s infrastructure in cooperation with UNRWA after calm is re-established in the area.

The Palestinians are betting the camp's reconstruction will become a top priority for the Syrian government for various reasons. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's central information officer, Anwar Raja, told Al-Monitor, “Reconstruction is inevitable as the Syrian state removes rubble and starts working on infrastructure and reconstruction immediately upon the liberation of any area recaptured from militants,” as it did in Raqqa, for example.

He added, “The Yarmouk camp is more important than other areas, for Syrians or for Palestinians alike, for several reasons, such as its strategic location and proximity to Damascus. It is also an important commercial and economic market, not only for the Palestinians but also for low- and middle-income Syrians. Reconstruction and allowing residents back in the camp will alleviate social and economic problems and contribute to resolving the Syrian and Palestinian humanitarian crisis.”

He continued, “Palestinian factions discussed Yarmouk's reconstruction with the Syrian state. They were promised that rehabilitation works would kick off after the camp is liberated and all the wreckage of the war is cleaned out. This process only takes a few weeks and infrastructure will be first on the to-do list.”

Raja is not holding his breath for the PLO or international relief agencies to play an active role in the reconstruction process. “We do not expect the PLO to make significant contributions to Yarmouk's reconstruction because it is simply unable to do so. International bodies are providing support to Palestinians little by little, and are blackmailing them in return, not to mention UNRWA’s financial deficit,” adding, “The Syrian government has, however, promised to do its best to rebuild the camp as soon as possible.”

For his part, the secretary of the Alliance of Palestinian Resistance factions in Syria, Khaled Abdul Majid, said the destruction in Yarmouk is not as severe as some opposition parties might like to claim, asserting that reconstruction will proceed based on the Syrian government’s arrangements.

“There are understandings with Syria on opening offices for the Palestinian factions in the camp and on expediting the reconstruction pace in Yarmouk compared to other [Syrian] areas,” he told Al-Monitor. “International bodies such as Arab, Islamic and international relief organizations, in addition to businesses, will be funding the reconstruction process.”

Abdul Majid called on the PLO to assume a prominent role in reconstruction and mobilize Arab and international groups.

Despite the optimism, the reconstruction of the camp and the return of the displaced Palestinian refugees remain dependent on field developments in the camp and its surroundings, as well as the outcomes of the Syrian army’s battles against IS fighters and its capacity to liberate the camp and clear it of mines. Only after all this happens can the reconstruction process begin.",Palestinians to partner with Damascus on refugee camp reconstruction,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/palestinian-refugees-yarmouk-camp-liberation-reconstruction.html
11,palestine,"Around 80% of the 32 Palestinians killed by the IDF during the ongoing Gaza border crisis were terrorist operatives or identified with terrorist organizations, an intelligence report asserts.



The report by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center said that 26 of the 32 Palestinians fit into those categories.





Nine of the dead Palestinians were part of military terrorist cells and four were part of Gazan security services, according to the report. The other 17 identified as connected with terrorist groups were so identified based on public statements made by various terrorist groups taking credit for the loyalties or activities of those individuals, the report said.The remaining six slain Palestinians were not mentioned by any terrorist groups and are presumed to have been civilians.The Meir Amit Center, located near Glilot, north of Tel Aviv, is viewed as unusually credible because it has ongoing connections to current military intelligence and is filled with top former Israeli intelligence officials.According to the report, five of the dead were part of Hamas’s Izzadin Kassam military wing, while four were part of security services controlled by Hamas. Hamas took credit for the loyalties and actions of another seven of the dead and their bodies were wrapped in Hamas flags.One of the dead was identified as being connected to Islamic Jihad’s military wing. Two of the dead were identified as operatives of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine – one as a military operative and one as a leader of the group in the Nuseirat refugee camp. One of the dead was identified with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.Six of the dead were both members of Fatah and involved in violent or provocative activities as part of the border standoff, according to the report and Meir Amit center director Reuven Ehrlich. Two were identified as operatives of the Aqsa Brigades, Fatah’s military wing. Four more were identified as members of Fatah when Fatah took credit for the connection and wrapped their bodies in Fatah flags.THE HIGH PROPORTION of persons identified with terrorist groups at the front showed that the protests and clashes are being orchestrated mostly by those groups and not by civilian leaders, the report said.According to the center, many of the dead were not merely celebrated by terrorist groups, but the terrorist groups published photos of them armed and in military clothing.Some of those killed were identified as being shot while trying to breach the border fence, during IDF attacks on Hamas lookout positions, and one, who was armed with a Kalashnikov and explosives, was shot by an IDF aerial vehicle.Slain photo journalist Yasir Murtaja was listed among those affiliated with terrorists, with the report repeating allegations about his holding the equivalent rank of captain, his past uses of drones to collect intelligence about IDF positions, and ongoing involvement with Hamas security services.All 32 of the dead except for two were men between the ages of 19 and 45 and none of them was among the original civilian protest organizers who were pushed aside by Hamas, Ehrlich told The Jerusalem Post.Ehrlich emphasized that this disproved accusations that Israel is targeting women and children and civilians generally.Two of the dead were minors with estimated ages of 14-16. While one of them was said to be part of Hamas’s student group, it was unclear under what circumstances they were killed and what justifications might be put forth.The report did acknowledge that regarding one of the dead, the family has disputed the IDF’s characterization of him as being connected to a terrorist group.Regarding a few of the dead, the report had more uncertain language, saying “it appears” that the individual was connected to a particular terrorist group. Some of these more borderline cases may account for the report identifying 80% of the dead as being connected with Hamas when an earlier report by the center said the percentage was at least as high as 60% (though that report said more research needed to be done). There have been situations in the past were terrorist groups have tried to claim “martyrs” as their operatives where that connection was debatable.The report added that there might be two additional dead Palestinians, but that details about those cases were still vague.",Report: 80% of Palestinians killed in Gaza border crisis were 'terrorists',https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-80-percent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Gaza-border-crisis-were-terrorists-549511

ISTANBUL

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on May 7 that the Palestinians were the “symbol of all oppressed people” in the world and Israeli attacks on them showed that “tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day.”

“What is happening in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, is nothing other than the efforts of tyranny to justify its oppressions, even to institutionalize them. The violence that the Israeli administration has recently inflicted on the Palestinians … shows that tyranny’s boldness is increasing every day,” Erdoğan said in a speech at the International Mount of Olives Peace Awards in Istanbul.

“The Palestinians are the symbol of all oppressed people in the world because of the persecution, massacres and injustices they have been subjected to,” he added.

The Turkish president said Palestinian women and children were most “exposed to the oppression of the Israeli administration,” paying the price “for wars and crises whose decisions are mostly not taken by them.”

“A significant number of Palestinian children are continuing their lives outside their homeland, in refugee camps or in other countries. Those who are able to stay in their homeland, meanwhile, are exposed to psychological and physical discrimination everywhere, from the moment they leave their house on the way to their schools, at checkpoints, in public transport, in educational institutions,” Erdoğan said.

He also slammed the international community’s “indifference over the sufferings of Palestinians.”

“The indifference of the international community towards the Palestinians, who have had tens of martyrs and thousands of injured people in these [Israeli] attacks, is the sign of a future in which no society or individual will be safe,” Erdoğan said, accusing international institutions responsible for ensuring peace and security in Palestine of “hypocrisy.”

He also praised Turkey for its humanitarian aid work, contrasting the country with “great economic powers” motivated only by “economic, political or military interests.”

“Humanitarian aid, entirely an issue of conscience and morality, does not rely on money, oil, gold, or political power,” Erdoğan said, noting that Turkey has so far spent $31 billion on Syrian refugees living in Turkey.

“Whatever anyone else does, as Turkey we will continue to use the facilities and opportunities we have in our hands for the benefit of humanity, especially our Palestinian, Syrian and African brothers. In a way appropriate to the orders of God and the inheritance left by our ancestors, wherever there is a victim we’ll worker harder to stand by them,” he said.

The Palestine cause is not an issue exclusive to any nation or city, Erdoğan said, suggesting that “the future of humanity will be determined according to the stance taken regarding the cause of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

“If the opposite happens a dark future awaits us in which all rights, freedoms, moral and conscientious measures are absent or eliminated and in which tyranny prevails,” he added.",Erdoğan slams Israeli ‘tyranny’ over Palestinians,http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-slams-israeli-tyranny-over-palestinians-131468

If impact investors are worth their salt, they’ll soon –– if not soon enough –– come up with a whole raft of investible solutions to the crushing burden of opioid addiction. The problem may have snuck up over the past decade, but there’s no escaping the costs of the crisis now. Action has been slow to mobilize on the front of positive impact to reverse the epidemic. “Why hasn’t the impact community embraced this issue more aggressively, given that it ticks so many boxes of things they care about and things they are good at?” Imogen Rose-Smith wonders in the latest episode of ImpactAlpha’s Returns on Investment podcast. “I’m surprised the voice of the impact community hasn’t been louder.”

Climate-change, for example, is at least as multi-faceted and huge, but there now exists a coordinated set of activities for combating it. AIDS presented novel scientific and social challenges, but the health crisis came under control after decades of dedicated efforts.

14,palestine,"In a remarks Sunday in Tel Aviv while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Pompeo mentioned that the boundaries of Jerusalem should still be the subject of negotiations between the parties. “We remain committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future for both Israel and the Palestinians,” he said.

But the escalating protests along the border between Gaza and Israel — which have led to hundreds of injuries and 46 deaths and have generated global sympathy for the Palestinian cause — went unmentioned.

“No meeting in Ramallah on his first visit sets an ominous tone about prospects for any progress, or even dialogue, with the Palestinians,” said Daniel B. Shapiro, an American ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration.

Aaron David Miller, a former negotiator for the United States in the Middle East, said Mr. Pompeo’s seeming indifference toward the Palestinians “at the very least suggests a casual disregard of the Israeli-Palestinian explosion that may be building and the U.S.’s inability or unwillingness to influence the course of events.”

Instead of discussing the Palestinian issue, Mr. Pompeo’s focused message on his sweep through the region has been a denunciation of Iran. He met with Saudi leaders on Saturday and Sunday morning, and they all agreed that Iran is a destabilizing force. He met on Sunday afternoon with Mr. Netanyahu, who blistered Iran alongside Mr. Pompeo.

And on Monday, he is scheduled to meet King Abdullah of Jordan in Amman, when Iran is again likely to be the most important subject of conversation.

In two weeks, Mr. Trump is expected to walk away from the Iran nuclear accord, which he has denounced as “the worst ever.” Countering Iran has become one of the few unambiguous policy themes of the administration.

Mr. Trump and his advisers disagree on how to confront Moscow. A potential trade war with China has caused deep unease across the Midwest. The administration’s policy on Syria is in flux. And North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is suddenly looking like a statesman.

But there is consensus that Iran needs to be opposed, and Mr. Pompeo hammered away at them Sunday.

“We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region, and Iran’s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains,” Mr. Pompeo said beside a delighted Mr. Netanyahu. “The United States is with Israel in this fight. And we strongly support Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself.”

As for the nuclear accord, “President Trump made it pretty clear: This deal is very flawed,” Mr. Pompeo said.

“He’s directed the administration to try to fix it,” he said. “And if we can’t fix it, he’s going to withdraw from the deal. It’s pretty straightforward.”

Mr. Netanyahu agreed. “Mr. Secretary,” he said, “I think the greatest threat to the world and to our two countries — and to all countries — is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons, and specifically the attempt of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.”

United States officials and international inspectors agree that Iran is abiding by the nuclear deal, which has substantially degraded the country’s ability to pursue nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have said the country may restart its nuclear program if the United States withdraws from the nuclear accord.

On May 14, the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, the United States will formally open its embassy in Jerusalem, and a host of American dignitaries are expected. Mr. Trump has suggested he may come.

But that opening also coincides with the time that Palestinian protests are expected to crest, coming on the eve of the Palestinian commemoration of the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes and became refugees during the hostilities surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948.

The first senior American official to feel the Palestinians’ furor over the Jerusalem decision was Vice President Mike Pence, who postponed what was expected to be an emotional visit over the Christmas holidays after several Christian leaders in the region refused to meet him. When he finally made it in January, the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, boycotted him.

Since nothing has been done to assuage the Palestinians in the meantime, Mr. Pompeo could have expected the same treatment.

“We refused to see Mr. Pence twice,” said Nabil Shaath, an Abbas adviser on international relations. He added: “We have declared our position and we don’t accept an American role in unilaterally controlling the peace process. To us, Trump is irrelevant, whether he announces the deal of the century or not.”

On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O.’s legislative body, is scheduled to hold its first formal meeting in nine years. If Mr. Pompeo had a strategy to bridge the divide, he could hardly have picked a better moment to address the movement’s leadership.

Instead, he will fly home Monday after seeing King Abdullah.",Pompeo and Palestinians Have ‘Nothing to Discuss’ Amid Gaza Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-israel-palestinians.html

By Merve Aydogan

ANKARA

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has expressed ""deep concern"" over the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, adding that the violence ""reached the level of ethnic cleansing"".

In a declaration on Sunday from the 45th Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the OIC also condemned “the illegal policies and practices of Israel, the occupying power against the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.""

The OIC called ""for the complete cessation of all Israeli violations of international law, including an immediate end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, all colonial settlement activities, demolition of Palestinian homes, [and the] killing, injuring, and detention of Palestinian civilians including children."" It further urged Israeli officials to release all Palestinian prisoners and detainees.

The declaration condemned the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as an ""illegal move,"" saying: ""We invite all members of the international community to remain committed to the status of Al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] and all related UN Resolutions, in line with the relevant decisions of the Final Communique of the OIC Extraordinary Summit in Istanbul [last December] and Istanbul Declaration on ‘Freedom for Al-Quds’.""

Last December, U.S. President Donald Trump sparked international outrage when he unilaterally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and vowed to relocate Washington's embassy to the city -- an event now expected as early as next week.

Jerusalem remains at the heart of the Palestine-Israel conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem -- occupied by Israel since 1967 -- might eventually serve as the capital of an independent Palestinian state.

On violence against Rohingya Muslims, the OIC said: ""We express deep concern over the recent systematic brutal acts perpetrated by security forces against the Rohingya Muslim Community in Myanmar that have reached the level of ethnic cleansing, which constitute a serious and blatant violation of international law.""

The bloc reaffirmed solidarity and expressed appreciation to Bangladesh on dealing with the Rohingya refugee influx.

""We underline the importance of OIC member states continuing to remain engaged in the UN system including in the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council as well as with other relevant international organizations to address the massive human rights violations of the Rohingya Muslims, taking into account recent developments,"" the statement added.

Since Aug. 25, 2017, some 750,000 Rohingya, mostly children and women, fled Myanmar when Myanmar forces launched a crackdown on the minority Muslim community, according to Amnesty International.

At least 9,000 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state from Aug. 25 to Sept. 24, according to Doctors Without Borders.

In a report published on Dec. 12, the global humanitarian organization said the deaths of 71.7 percent or 6,700 Rohingya were caused by violence. They include 730 children below the age of 5.","OIC expresses concern over Rohingya, Palestine issue",https://www.aa.com.tr/en/todays-headlines/oic-expresses-concern-over-rohingya-palestine-issue/1137801
