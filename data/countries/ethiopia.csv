3.7 million people in the Somali Region are being assisted through WFP’s emergency relief assistance

US$6 m distributed through cash based transfers

US$154 m six months net funding requirement (Apr - Sept 2018)

5.4 million people assisted in March 2018

Operational Updates

• According to the Humanitarian Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP), 7.88 million people in Ethiopia will require food assistance in 2018.

• In March 2018, WFP reached 3.7 million people with emergency relief assistance in the Somali Region (including 1.6 million people registered under the Government’s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) and 300,000 people displaced due to conflict). WFP’s emergency relief assistance in the Somali Region consists of a combination of food and cash based modalities, depending on needs and where markets function.

• The four-month Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP) in the Somali region was concluded in March. From April, acutely malnourished children under five and pregnant and nursing women in all 83 “priority-one” woredas (prioritized districts) in the Somali Region will receive treatment under the Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme.

• An estimated 9,850 farmers in Amhara and Tigray regions, registered under the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative received insurance pay-outs (worth US$ 92,000) in March. This was the first time the payout was made in the Amhara Region.

• Ethiopia remains the second largest refugee hosting state in Africa with 901,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers. In March, WFP distributed food commodities to 669,500 refugees; of which an estimated 144,200 (in 13 refugee camps) also received cash assistance.","WFP Ethiopia Country Brief, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/wfp-ethiopia-country-brief-march-2018
1,ethiopia,"""This new guy - he's a good guy. Very good brain. Now everything in Ethiopia is going to be OK"".

My taxi driver Daniel offers up this unprompted insight as we zip through the streets of Addis Ababa, letting me in on the sentiment around the unprecedented year Ethiopia had.

The ""new guy"" is Dr Abiy Ahmed, the recently selected chair of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPDRF), the coalition that has been ruling Africa's second-most populous country for 27 years. At 42 years old, Dr Ahmed is not just the youngest Ethiopian prime minster ever, but also the first from the Oromo community, the largest ethnic group in the country. For Daniel and others who offered their unprompted opinions, Dr Ahmed not only offers respite from nearly two years of political and social upheaval that threatened to undo Ethiopia altogether, but the hope of a more inclusive and democratic Ethiopia.

Earlier in the week, Dr Ahmed offered the keynote address at the Tana High Level Forum on Peace and Security in Africa, an annual event held in the resort city of Bahir Dar, the State Capital of the Amhara region. Similar to the Davos World Economic Forum, the event brings together current and former political and academic leaders on the continent for an informal dialogue on enhancing peace and security on the continent. At the margins of the summit, hundreds of bilateral meetings between regional politicians, Addis Ababa's vast diplomatic corps and numerous international organisations make this one of the more significant networking events at the continent.

Bahir Dar was a stopover for Dr Ahmed in the midst of a whirlwind tour of Ethiopia, uneasily calm after years of intensifying unrest that implicated three of the country's largest regions - Amhara, Oromia and the Somali region. The prime minister arrived at the forum after visiting Gondar, a historical town known for its 15th and 16th century churches and distinct orthodox Christian crosses that was the epicentre of many protests in the previous two years. By the time Ahmed arrived in Bahir Dar, internet access in the town had only just been restored after a nearly two year shut down.

The air in Bahir Dar was electric with anticipation of Ahmed's arrival, with everyone waiting to hear what he has to say. ""He's very young,"" said one driver, ""but he's very clever. He is [a] doctor, you know?""

At the summit and beyond, expectations on Ahmed's shoulders are high. Both Amhara where the forum is held and Oromia where Dr Ahmed is from have seen intense political upheaval that analysts argue may have broken Ethiopia altogether. It began with an ambitious plan to relocate poor residents of Oromia to facilitate the expansion of the capital Addis Ababa. As there would be no compensation for those displaced, a cycle of protests and state oppression began in Oromia, culminating in the alleged massacre of over 500 people at the Ireecha or Oromo New Year celebrations in 2016. Similar protests in the Amhara and Somali region soon began as a cry for greater political representation for groups, triggering unprecedented changes in the country's leadership. Final numbers are unclear, but the Addis Standard alleges that hundreds have died and at least one million Ethiopians have been displaced in the chaos.

In contrast to earlier speeches in parliament and at various stops on his tour, at the summit Dr Ahmed's speech did not touch on Ethiopia's political flux, but the symbolism of his visit is unmissable for Ethiopian watchers.

Outside Ethiopia, Bahir Dar's most famous son is Eskinder Nega, a journalist who had, until March, been in prison for seven years because of his criticism of the EPRDF regime. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Nega was at one point the longest held journalist in the world and the recipient of numerous awards recognising him as a prisoner of conscience.

{articleGUID}

Nega's treatment over the last three months is symbolic of the uncertainty within the EPRDF as to how Ethiopia will be moving forward: that the country seems eager to embrace the new possibilities of freedom but apparently unsure of how to do things differently. In February 2018, Dr Ahmed's predecessor, former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn unexpectedly announced the release of Nega and hundreds of other political prisoners. The announcement was at first met with scepticism and then unbridled joy as it seemed that years of advocacy was finally bearing fruit. Since he assumed power in 2012, Desalegn, a deeply religious engineer, was expected to merely continue the EPRDF's history of suppression and state violence, not to carve out a political path for himself as an individual. In fact, in news media outside Ethiopia, the announcement was perhaps the first time Desalegn was discussed as an individual and not as the head of an amorphous, bloody political machine.

Ethiopian news outlets quickly backtracked on the announcement, insisting that Desalegn had been misquoted and that only some political prisoners would be released. But the announcement seemed to prompt a leadership crisis in Ethiopia, particularly as it was soon followed with the announcement of his resignation. Then, silence, as the internal machinery of the party retreated and regrouped. From an analytical perspective, we expected a small blip - it would soon be business as usual in Ethiopia - only for Desalegn to once again order the prisoner's release and then actually resign.

For Ethiopians, Ahmed's identity and intelligence, as well as the unprecedented changes he has overseen since taking office on April 2, suggest that change is imminent.

Barely a month after his release, Nega and other journalists attending an informal gathering at a private residence were arrested and sent to the infamous Maelekawi prison. Even while footage of Ahmed giving a stirring speech in parliament promising a new Ethiopia remained fresh, distressing images of the detainees in cramped cells quickly made the rounds on social media. The opprobrium and disappointment was quick - was everything that Ahmed promised a lie?

In fact, it was yet another symptom that after 27 years in power, the EPRDF had developed an internal modus operandi that didn't necessarily require the participation of the sitting leader to keep moving. Although no effort was made to disguise the fact of their arrest, after another two weeks, Nega and other journalists were released and according to local media, Maelekawi was closed for good. Yet two days before the Forum, Nega was scheduled to fly to New York to receive an award from Amnesty International and Ethiopian activists allege that his passport was confiscated and he was denied travel, only to have it permitted less than 48 hours later.

None of this is discussed in the public discussions at the forum, even though it is held while a state of emergency is still in place and in the context of a policy of absolute candour. In fact, the public winner in the race for diplomatic access to Ethiopia's new leader is Omar el-Bashir, the president of Sudan indicted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, who jetted in for the summit but barely attended. There were quiet meetings between the two men, perhaps to establish diplomatic channels in the face of an increasingly complex relationship. Ethiopia's relationship with joint neighbour Eritrea remains hostile - they share the most militarised border on the continent, even while Eritrea and Sudan have warm relations. Yet the recent upswing in base building by foreign countries like China, France and the US, particularly in neighbouring Djibouti and Somalia has created an unexpected common cause between the two countries. Also, tensions between Egypt and Sudan over a shared border and the use of the waters of the Nile - which rises in both Ethiopia and Sudan - increase the need for diplomatic coordination between Ethiopia and Sudan. Bashir is the only other sitting African leader at the forum, signalling an urgency to connect with Ahmed at the seat of the African Union, a partner of the Forum.

Some of these issues do make it onto the discussion, in an unexpected way. Desalegn is an unmissable figure, not least because of his staggering height and distinct moustache. When he speaks, he offers some of the most unambiguous defence of human rights on the continent and suggests that the militarisation of the Red Sea should be a security priority for the African Union at a session that periodically drifted into empty, bureaucratic jargon. Despite Ethiopia's reputation for suppression of the public sphere, he eloquently makes the case for a robust response from the AU to ongoing crises in the region. At the end of the forum, young staffers from the hotel scramble for selfies and handshakes and although he still has security, Desalegn allows them to approach and smiles broadly for all the cameras.

Where has this guy been since 2015?

Desalegn declined to comment for this piece but his affable, congenial presence at the Forum suggests that he may be positioning himself for an elder-statesman role, similar to that played by the Forum's outgoing chair, former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo. In a region beset by leaders increasingly reluctant to peacefully concede power, his decision to resign allows him to easily leap over the admittedly low bar of what constitutes good governance in East Africa. He has already received the Ethiopian Medal of Honour - the highest civilian honour in the country. However, of Ethiopia's well documented economic growth, Daniel the taxi driver told me ""buildings, buildings everywhere in Addis Ababa but we cannot eat buildings!"" Apparently, Desalegn resigned just as Ethiopians had finally had enough of economic growth without meaningful progress.

Meanwhile his successor carries the weight of knitting together a country that, despite breakneck economic growth and pride of place on the continent's political hierarchy, was careening towards revolution. For Ethiopians, Ahmed's identity and intelligence, as well as the unprecedented changes he has overseen since taking office on April 2, suggest that change is imminent.

In one plenary session at the Forum, Nigaria's 80-year old former President Olesegun Obasanjo chastised a pair of young men who had been offered a chance to address the forum as a prize for winning an essay competition. ""You cannot speak for your country,"" he insisted, ""you can only speak for your colleagues. Wait your turn!"" Ironically, a 42-year-old former soldier with a PhD in Peace Studies who refused to wait his turn is now responsible for fundamentally reforming the country where he was speaking.

2,ethiopia,"Ultimately, the only route to its successful end is regulation through institutional mechanisms, which means elections, whether early or within the normal electoral cycle.

According to the dominant assessment, the crisis in Ethiopia reflects the absolute antagonism between two well-defined blocks. A fight between “Ethiopia’s political and business elites (that) have decided to make their last stand to protect their wealth and power by using a military” apparatus, and “a revolution from below based on the political activism of millions of people who are determined to deploy nonviolent methods to overthrow a tyrannical totalitarian regime.”

In this view, the first block is clinging to the status quo. “Take their power away, they will become nobody overnight.” Its centre of gravity is “the” Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), perceived as a homogeneous and unified force. While Tigrayans account for only 6% of the population, the Front maintains its pre-eminence in the leadership of the military and security forces answerable to federal authority. It is a very big player in the “modern” – i.e. non-agricultural – economy, through its control over public and para-public companies. It has long been the dominant component of the four ethnic parties in the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

This ascendancy was clear with respect to the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM), but in decline for the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM) and even more so for the Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organisation (OPDO). It also attracts apparatchiks from all over, including ANDM and OPDO. Without saying it overtly, they too have an interest in the maintenance of the status quo, even when this runs counter to some of their party’s positions. Nevertheless, this block has made – or at least offered – gestures of opening up that were unthinkable a few months ago, and promises more.

Nevertheless, this block has made – or at least offered – gestures of opening up that were unthinkable a few months ago, and promises more. It has released more than 6000 political prisoners, including key leaders of the legal opposition. OPDO has “invited opposition party members based in Ethiopia and overseas to work together with the goal of realizing a democratic system,” i.e. even the most radical fringe of the diaspora. ANDM has made a similar gesture. Never before have the official news channels of Oromia and of the Amhara region, as well as the private media, enjoyed such a degree of freedom of expression.

For its detractors, however, the proclamation of a second state of emergency, on February 16, is evidence that this block still favours force as the tool of getting its way. In response to mass protest, they say, it has simply yielded some tactical ground, which it will subsequently recover, while ultimately keeping hold of the essential.

How the opposing camp is seen

The opposing camp is seen as the proponent of radical change. Its strike force is the street and the sequence of demonstrations that have been under way for almost four years, even more in Oromia than in the Amhara region, headed by the “Qeerroo”, a term that means “unmarried young male” in the Oromo language. Parts of OPDO and of ANDM have joined forces with this current, under pressure from the unprecedented movement of mass protest. One of the rising stars, the President of Oromia, Lemma Megersa, has gone so far as to declare that “if we failed to deliver using existing legal and institutional mechanisms, I and all of us here will join you in the protests.” Another player, of course, is the legal opposition, but its leaders are ageing and worn out by decades of futile struggle. It is also weakened by its fragmentation, disorganization, woolliness, and disunity over objectives.

This camp is unanimous in its pursuit of one primary, specific and concrete goal: to put an end to “Tigrayan hegemony”, summed up in its battle cry of: “down Woyane!”, in reference to the Tigrayan elite. However, it is much less explicit and clear about what to put in their place. In fact, like the ruling power itself, this opposition is enamoured of catchall slogans: “reforms”, “opening up”, “democratisation”, “transparency”, “accountability”, to which everyone can attach their own content. Like the ruling power itself, this opposition is enamoured of catchall slogans: “reforms”, “opening up”, “democratisation”, “transparency”, “accountability”, to which everyone can attach their own content.

This assessment is too simplistic to reflect the complexity and indeterminacy of the situation. In fact, there are two crises, not just one. Obviously interconnected, their origins, the players involved, and the objectives sought, are different: one crisis intrinsic to the ruling power, illustrated by the storm whirling around the apex of the leading coalition; and one crisis arising from external opposition to the broader system of power by some of those excluded from it, spearheaded by the Qeerroo.

Elitist conceptions of power

Underpinning everything is the elitist conception and practice of power. It is encoded in the genes of Ethiopian policy and Ethiopian culture alike, at least in the country’s Abyssinian cradle.

Under the influence of the radical student movement, the revolution of 1974 that led to the fall of the Emperor simply modified its expression, but not its essence. Social organization, in which imperial absolutism and its successive hierarchized variants, right down to the individual level, ultimately derived from divine will, gave way to an organization dominated by a new elite whose legitimacy was rooted in knowledge.

Theocracy, the landed aristocracy and the clergy were succeeded by a sort of “aristocracy of the knowledgeable”, which could be described as an “intellocracy”. Hence “the normative union of knowledge with power”, whose role it is “to rescue the society from barbarism and ignorance”: “power must become tutorship.”[1]

In this fundamentally undemocratic conception, “the people” is reified. Because of its “backwardness”, it is destined to be an object rather than a subject of history. “Due to poor education and illiteracy the Ethiopian public is too underdeveloped to make a well reasoned, informed decision, and so Revolutionary Democracy[2] is the political bridge by which the ‘enlightened leaders’” can lead the people to democracy,” explained the recently resigned Prime Minister, Hailemariam Dessalegn. A fundamental postulate is that the absolute nature of power at its apex is immanent and intangible.

But well beyond the circles of government, the vast majority of Ethiopian elites, be they political, economic, social, or cultural, subscribe to the same vision. Even a new opposition figurehead, the recently amnestied Oromo Bekele Gerba, whose democratic refinement and convictions are recognized by all, seems to subscribe to this conception when he promises that the future lies in the hands of the Qeerroo but, he specifies, “the good Qeerroo, the educated one.”

Membership of this intellocracy confers a social legitimacy so great that anyone aspiring to the highest positions must get their hands on a PhD, however dubious its source, and celebrate the accomplishment with much pomp and circumstance. How many countries are there where the name of a political figure is generally preceded or followed in the press with the abbreviation (Dr.) or (PhD), where applicable? Or where, just after the appointment of the new Oromo Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, the press and national media began by highlighting his myriad qualifications, and the extent to which “he is devoted and committed to education”? Conversely, to point out a political figure’s lack of qualifications, to describe them as a “drop out” from education, is the ultimate denigration.

At the other end of the social scale, this segregation is widely internalized. For the vast majority of the population, 80% small farmers, society can only work if it is governed by an unshakeable hierarchy. So a fundamental postulate is that the absolute nature of power at its apex is immanent and intangible. This is the only way that it can play its fundamental role: to maintain the peace of the realm and law and order, the primary condition of peasant survival.

Oligarchy ‘deep renewal’

The current ruling system continues to operate within this elitist mould, headed by what elsewhere would be called a “caste” or “the establishment”. It was totalitarian in the etymological sense, in that it extended well beyond the political sphere alone. In particular, there was no boundary between institutional position, family position, and business position: the ruling class also became an oligarchic class.

Meles Zenawi pushed this to the extreme, becoming an unchallenged embodiment of personal power. With his sudden death, the elitist structure he had established has collapsed. If it has been done chaotically, that structure nevertheless had no choice but to seek to rebuild itself. Otherwise the group of leaders/oligarchs knew that it would entirely lose its position and, in consequence, its assets.

In recent months, this attempt at reconstruction has entered a phase of acute crisis. The leadership tried to respond to its failure of legitimacy by launching a “deep renewal”. A succession of meetings was held by the four ethnic components of the governing coalition with the official aim of examining the progress and results of this process. The meetings were longer lasting – more than a year – and more bitter than ever before, so were expected to yield a roadmap out of the crisis. They churned out the same leitmotif: each of these meetings brought greater “consensus”, but its content hasn’t been disclosed.

However, nothing in the official releases suggested a meaningful inflection in the main components of the political line. They churned out the same leitmotif: each of these meetings brought greater “consensus”, but its content hasn’t been disclosed. In particular, there is nothing to suggest that “revolutionary democracy”, “democratic centralism” and the “developmental state”, the three pillars of the elitist – hence authoritarian – exercise of power, have even been questioned. And recently, the old line that the cause of the crisis is foreign conspiracy has been wheeled out, both “Arab”, hatched by Egypt with Eritrea as its proxy, and Western, led by “neoliberal” forces seeking to force Ethiopia to de-nationalize its economy.

Power struggle

Ultimately, therefore, all the available information points to the fact that the main cause of the breakdown in the governing coalition is a power struggle. The leaderships have been heavily criticized, have performed their acts of contrition and undergone purges and promotions, culminating in a big first: the election of a new EPRDF Chairman and Prime Minister, the young and ambitious Abiy Ahmed. The major feature of this event, stressed by all observers and greeted in some places with popular jubilation, is that he is Oromo.

What is mainly at stake in the crisis at the top is a new redistribution of powers and resources within the coalition and along ethnic lines: the ethnic elites that see themselves as disadvantaged in relation to the Tigrayan elite have fought to establish a more equitable sharing of the political and economic cake. Does the election of Abiy Ahmed mark the beginning of the end of this leadership crisis, the start of a return to working order?

Does the election of Abiy Ahmed mark the beginning of the end of this leadership crisis, the start of a return to working order? The battle has been interminable, long in the balance, riddled with byzantine manoeuvres. It would seem that the TPLF fought to the bitter end to stop Abiy winning. One reliable observer of the political scene, close to TPLF, sums up the process in three stark words: “it was chaos.”

All the pundits were predicting that TPLF would once again be the “kingmaker” in this election, which opposed four parties of equal size. The TPLF put forward no candidate, so would hold the casting vote for one of the three candidates, each of whom was assumed to have the support of his respective party. In a clear sign of its political decline, the TPLF failed. This election confirms a fundamental turning point in the regime. The pattern in the EPRDF leadership has changed dramatically, with an alliance between OPDO and ANDM gaining the upper hand over the TPLF, though no one can predict the strength of this alliance or how long it is likely to last.

In addition, the TPLF is facing increased defiance in Tigray itself, on the part of the population in general, intellectuals, and even its own officials. They accuse their leadership of being unable to push through the kind of development in Tigray that has been enjoyed by other regions like Oromia or Amhara, and at the same time of being riddled with corruption.

The other parties come out of it no better. The SEPDM vote was split between its own chairman and OPDO’s. Some ANDM votes probably went to the SEPDM candidate. The inner divisions inside these parties have become deeper. More and more ordinary members, but also mid-level officials, turned a blind eye to or even supported the popular protests, even within the administration and the regional security forces.

Second state of emergency

The circumstances of the proclamation of the second state of emergency are symptomatic of these dissensions. Even though the conditions under which it has been decided remain obscure and disputed, it would seem to have been approved by the EPRDF Executive Committee, then by the Council of Ministers, where ANDM and OPDO are strongly represented.

If Defense Minister Siraj Fegessa is to be believed, “the (ruling EPRDF coalition’s) committee were unanimous in their decision.” ANDM then remained silent. Kassahun Gofi, head of publicity for OPDO, declared that “as a party, we support the State of Emergency.”[3] Attempting to keep everyone happy, Abiy Ahmed abstained in Parliament. Dozens of OPDO and ANDM parliamentarians simply refrained from voting, while 88 – essentially from OPDO – voted against.

The leaderships of these two parties have an ambivalent and divided attitude to the popular protest movement. Nobody controls it, certainly not they. Its target is the positions and advantages unfairly acquired by the establishment, and OPDO has certainly not been a back marker in this race for illicit privileges. To take just two recent examples, the “home strike” at the end of February led to “hundreds of arrests” in Gondar, where the mayor declared that the state of emergency demanded “zero tolerance”.[4] Following the demonstrations in Nekemte, in Oromia, Addisu Arega, head of the Oromia communication bureau, “urged the youth to refrain from violence and listen to elders to keep the peace in the city.”[5] Moreover, there is always the risk that demonstrations might degenerate into ethnic clashes.

In addition to the divisions between the four components of the governing coalition, there are varying degrees of dissension within each of them. And finally, nothing is known about the remote periphery’s involvement in these crises, the lowlands of Afar, Somali, Beni Shangul, Gambella, although they account for around 10% of the population.

Abiy Ahmed

As well as the explosions of joy in Oromia in particular, congratulations and promises of support have come from all quarters, including websites close to the TPLF. “The Ethiopian people are largely happy with the results as the major changes they expect from their leaders could finally come true through Dr. Abiy Ahmed.”

Regardless of the sincerity of Abiy’s reformist statements, however, he primarily owes his mandate to the leadership of the EPRDF, and is therefore in a sense its representative. Some therefore say that he is obliged to keep faith with the Front’s political line. “Abiy Ahmed wants to continue on the successful development this government has embarked upon” and only “to address the shortfalls we have faced all along.” “The new Prime Minister will execute the agenda of the Party… He is an embodiment of the principles” of the Party, recalled Getachew Reda, a member of the TPLF politburo.

But there is nothing to say that this agenda has been settled on, let alone that it would be “reformist” in the sense understood by the opposition and the protesters.

The EPRDF’s endless communiqué about the last parliamentary session remains verbose and vague, with no specific information on the key points around which opposition has crystallized, such as the state of emergency, the abolition of the most repressive laws, the release of all political prisoners, the return of the military to their barracks. Yet OPDO supported the communiqué.

Similarly, while Abiy’s coronation speech was well-received, while it was more personal and emotional than usual, while the opposition figure Merera Gudina judged it “much more civilized” than those of his predecessors, while it placed greater emphasis on the “unity” of Ethiopia, it remained fundamentally rhetorical and in continuity with the existing political line. To sum up, “we have laid the foundations for a durable and all-inclusive constitutional order” or built “a new democratic order”, and the goal is now to “speed up the work we have begun” in order to make this order “mature”, by “filling the gaps” and “tackling the deficiencies” and “shortcomings”.

On the points that have attracted the most interest, Abiy Ahmed simply reaffirms more vigorously positions that have already been presented. Towards the diaspora, in general very hostile to the regime: “we will welcome with open arms… those who want to bring your knowledge and experiences”. Towards the opposition: “to allow opposition parties to operate freely and create a conducive and fair and level playing field”. Finally, “the government needs to respect the law. It is also its obligation to ensure that the law is respected.” An allusion – the only one – to the burning question of the state of emergency?

All these ambiguities obviously affect how much room for manoeuver Abiy has. Rather than enjoying a clear mandate that would give him a strong political footing, he is likely to have to play things by ear, handicapped by the recurrent conflicts between the different factions that could continue to divide the leadership, including determined opponents who have no intention of burying the hatchet.

Rather than possessing a roadmap corresponding to the intentions that he affirms – or are expected from him – there are significant forces which would rather see continuity take precedence over profound changes, let alone those the legal opposition is clamouring for, and in particular the Qeerroo.

The Qeerroo

So who are the Qeerroo? In the absence of field research, the answers are hypothetical and contradictory. According to some, they are a new social group, of a kind never seen before, the product of downward social mobility associated with urbanisation. The emerging middle class… seems to be holding back … It is probably afraid that major disorder may deprive it of the small gains it has achieved.

Essentially, inhabitants of cities and towns (the urban population has quadrupled in 30 years), who have broken from the peasant economy and the traditional values of the previous generation, largely undereducated (though secondary school enrolment has also quadrupled over the same period, the quality of education has not kept pace) and therefore underemployed and frustrated, and, by contrast with the parochialism of the previous generation, open to ideas and images of the world thanks to their mobile phones and increasingly the web.

They are the ones igniting the street, whereas the emerging middle class – usually at the forefront in democratisation movements – seems to be holding back, especially in Addis Ababa, where it is the most concentrated. It is probably afraid that major disorder may deprive it of the small gains it has achieved and result in confrontations as bloody as under the Derg dictatorship. According to others, the Qeerroo’s social base is much broader. They represent the whole of the younger generation, urban and rural, educated and uneducated, working and unemployed. In this view, their cohesion and motivation are also explained by the persistence of the traditional Oromo system of governance, the Gadaa, which assigns a fundamental role to consensus and free and open debate in decision-making, in other words the opposite of the country’s dominant mode of governance.

Whichever is the case, the authoritarianism and condescension of the regime, and their own professional exclusion, have left the Qeerroo angry and with a sense of being harassed, despised and ignored. In any case, their target is the very core of the age-old system of power: its elitism, its tutorship, its hierarchical structure.

In the view of some well-informed observers, without being explicitly stated, the real novelty of their movement is that “their goal is not simply political. […] They want to create a new social, economic and moral universe.”[6] For others, they are pragmatic in their demands, which can be summed up in a simple slogan: full respect for the constitution.[7] In any case, their target is the very core of the age-old system of power: its elitism, its tutorship, its hierarchical structure.

Yet a large proportion of the legal opposition’s leaders and mid-level officials believe that these latter characteristics are essential to the effectiveness of the ruling system Ethiopia needs. Their aim is more to force the gates of a previously closed elite, than to promote the real equality between citizens laid down in the constitution. For the Qeerroo, therefore, this part of the legal opposition belongs to the rival camp.

For them, entire sections of OPDO fall within this category, especially as they are seen as equally authoritarian and equally mired in corruption.

Qeerroo demands

The Qeerroo thus responded cautiously to Abiy Ahmed’s election. They are prepared to give him a chance for the moment, basically because he has the backing of Lemma Megerssa, the only leader they fully trust.

The goal of the popular protests that led to the 1974 revolution, similar in scale to those of today, was to demolish the “feudal regime” and to replace it with a very vague “socialism”. However, they were motivated by two flagship measures: “land to the tillers!” and the settlement of the “question of nationalities”.

The Qeerroo are first of all demanding authentic self-rule for their region, i.e. a more equitable federalism. Because of this, they influence the power struggles within the governing elite and therefore interact with the crisis it is experiencing. Beyond this, however, they are not known to have a developed political program, in particular with regard to the “democratic” form that they would like to see this self-rule take.

Moreover, while it is credible that their movement has been able to develop some kind of network structure of local nodes, as an underground force its organization and cohesion are necessarily limited.

Finally, no one today is able to measure the level of support it receives from older generations, which in any case undoubtedly varies from one region to another, and according to age, social status, etc. Is it an avant-garde very much ahead of the curve of the broad movement of popular demands, or it is a faithful expression of that movement? Is it an avant-garde very much ahead of the curve of the broad movement of popular demands, or it is a faithful expression of that movement?

Even overwrought, embryonic, sketchy, unstructured, this mass movement provides the legal opposition with a providential opportunity to break out of its marginal role. It is making every effort to channel and structure it. If it succeeded, the political landscape would be totally changed.

However, for the whole establishment, both majority and opposition, the Qeerroo also represent an unpredictable threat, because no one knows where and how far it could lead.

No one knows

We do not know whether, in their most recent meetings, the leadership structures of the EPRDF were able to set a political course out of the crisis. Apart from its numerical weakness and its disorganization, the legal opposition is divided on the two key issues: greater or less federalism; economic liberalization, including land privatization, or the maintenance, even reinforcement, of statist development. No one knows the precise goals or the level of organization of the Qeerroo and therefore whether they would be able to form a representative entity with clear objectives.

The most radical opposition forces argue that, although Abiy’s election is a step in the right direction, the way out of the crisis demands rapid fundamental change. An “all-inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders” would trigger, structure and usher in a “democratic transition”. In particular, it would end the state of emergency, abolish the main repressive laws and send the military back to their barracks.[8]

These demands seem unrealistic given the current balance of power relations. Firstly, nothing in the EPRDF’s official positions, including those of OPDO and ANDM, suggested that it would sign up to these demands. Secondly, the general context is too fluid and chaotic, the respective strengths and objectives of the different political forces too uncertain, to construct a reform process on solid and consensual foundations.

In particular, like it or not, there is no force currently able to replace the EPRDF at the heart of the political process. The restoration of order within the EPRDF is therefore a prerequisite for any significant movement. There is no quick, black-and-white way out of the crisis, but only different shades of grey and step-by-step tweaks and adjustments.

Shades of grey

Although the legal opposition has adopted radical postures, in the short term it probably expects no more of Abiy Ahmed than a series of gestures that indicate that he is moving in the direction it would like.

The closure of the notorious Maekelawi prison, the restoration of the Internet, the re-release of notorious activists after their recent release and then re-arrest, are symptomatic of this approach.

It will maintain the popular hope that his election has aroused. However, the disregard of the institutions as defined in the constitution is at the heart of the crisis. Ultimately, the only route to its successful end is regulation through institutional mechanisms, which means that the only real possibility is elections, whether early or within the normal electoral cycle.[9] However, the disregard of the institutions as defined in the constitution is at the heart of the crisis.

Their first effect would be to structure the political space by forcing all the players to clearly define their goals for change in three key domains: federalism, economic development strategy, establishment of the rule of law. It would then be down to the electorate to decide on the respective strength of the different actors.

The outcome would be unchallengeable, because measured and legitimized by the ballot box. It would be reflected in pluralism within a new parliament, which would cease to be a rubberstamp for decisions reached by a quasi-single party executive, and would finally take on the primary role assigned to it in the constitution. Together, Oromia and the Amhara Region would have a majority of MPs. The changes for which the voters cast their ballots could be democratically decided here.

This scenario can only bear fruit if the elections take place on a political playing field that is at least more level, even if full “free and fair” elections are as yet too much to hope for. This will require an overhaul of the National Election Board to guarantee its independence and its authority to ensure equal opportunities for all the competitors, as well as the introduction of a good dose of proportional representation.

Letting time do its work

It is because an “all inclusive dialogue” would be limited to this handful of measures that it could be successful. After all, the electoral campaign of 2005 was actually “free and fair” until a few weeks before the vote. Yet the regime was already significantly authoritarian and had not undertaken the slightest legislative reform or an overhaul of the security services. The rules were not changed, but applied strictly or, if necessary, tacitly suspended.

The repressive laws subsequently adopted (anti-terrorism, press, civil society) would lose their arbitrary character if they ceased to be employed against all forms of opposition by a legal system under government control. Ditto for the state of emergency: the new government could order the security forces to turn a blind eye to its most outrageous provisions, and to use force proportionately only if the “constitutional order” were genuinely under threat.

However, this scenario can only succeed provided that the main actors of the twofold crisis, beginning with EPRDF and the Qeerroo, agree that it should be decided through the ballot box. Institutional rules would take precedence over the rule of force, whether originating in the street or in the “deep state”.

The question remains whether the upholders of the status quo would ultimately be willing to allow this card to be played and whether the Qeerroo would agree to let time do its work.

The famous blogger and founder of the Oromia Media Network, Jawar Mohammed, believed to be very influential among the Qeerroo, wrote on March 28: “we congratulate Dr. Abiy for his appointment... The opportunity offers him a unique scenario to charter peaceful transition to democracy in Ethiopia.” Less than a fortnight later, he urged: “Qeerroo, time to fire up and get rid of this rotten mass killer regime!” Will they listen to him?

3,ethiopia,"Central Somalia has experienced heavy rains which have flooded parts of the country. The resultant effect has been the displacement of thousands. The United Nations estimates that almost half a million people are affected.

Whiles the Federal Government and other allies continue to work around containing the situation, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is contributing its fair share to alleviating the humanitarian situation.

According to AMISOM’s Sector 4 Commander Colonel Mohamed Barkhad Aden, troops from Ethiopia and Djibouti had evacuated some 10,000 people from flooded areas in Beledweyne located in Central Somalia.

An influential journalist who extensively covers the country, Harun Maruf, reported as at Tuesday evening that thousands of people displaced by the floods in Beledweyne were stranded. He added that aid groups were doing an assessment of the situation which started days ago.

He, however, stressed that the need on the ground was way beyond the capacity of his troops. He was speaking to the Voice of America’s Somali service.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the current floods are some of the worst the region has ever seen, and the current water level exceeds a 50-year return period in most locations.

“Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,” Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General said, briefing reporters in New York on Monday.

“Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, [health,] shelter and food response in their interventions,” he added.

The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over six million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.","Somalia floods displace thousands: Ethiopia, Djibouti troops help in evacuation",http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/01/somalia-floods-thousands-displaced-as-ethiopia-djibouti-troops-help-in/

When Ethi­o­pia’s prime minister for the past six years resigned in February, there was little reason to think his successor would be an improvement.

The country was under a state of emergency that followed a years-long state crackdown on opposition political activity. Thousands of activists and dissident journalists had been detained, and hundreds had died in demonstrations crushed by government forces.

Then came Abiy Ahmed, who at 42 is one of the youngest leaders on the continent. In his first month as Ethi­o­pia’s premier, he has ushered in an unlikely wave of hope and even optimism in this close U.S. ally that serves as something of a linchpin to the stability of East Africa.

While ostensibly a democracy, Ethiopia is a highly centralized state with only the ruling party and its allies in Parliament. In recent years, however, unrest has grown, and on April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the government to increase its respect for human rights and the rule of law.

During his April 2 inauguration, Abiy acknowledged some of Ethiopia’s enduring problems in a riveting speech. He apologized for the deaths of protesters during demonstrations, welcomed differences of opinion and promised to heal the wounds between Ethiopia’s ethnic groups.

The accession of Abiy, who hails from the Oromo community, brought a sharp drop in tension. Since he came to office, Internet service has been restored to the countryside, charges against dozens of activists have been dropped, and Abiy has embarked on meetings around the country, listening to grievances and promising reform, including term limits for his position.

“As someone who grew up in Addis Ababa, one thing that is very foreign was seeing a prime minister come and organize town hall meetings and just sit down with people and discuss things,” said Zecharias Zelalem, a journalist and frequent commentator on Ethiopian affairs. “That has never happened, and it’s been going on for the past three weeks.”

Activists, many of whom were released in the days following Abiy’s inauguration, pronounced themselves “cautiously optimistic” that, at long last, Ethiopia may be changing.

“Our release means something. It is a signal for change, that he wants change,” said Eskinder Nega, a journalist who spent his childhood in Washington and had just spent six years in an Ethio­pian prison for his writings.

He was released in February but detained again during the state of emergency a month later for meeting with friends — ironically in celebration of their earlier release. Ten of his colleagues were also arrested.

“But, ultimately, this is not what the nation wants,” Nega said. “The nation wants two things: the lifting of the state of emergency in the next 100 days and a call for an all-inclusive dialogue. This will set things right.”

“Right” is not where Ethi­o­pia has been for the past three years, and its partners abroad have been worried. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Ethiopia to the stability of East Africa. It has the largest army in the region and the fastest-growing economy in Africa, and it is surrounded by disintegrating states such as Somalia and South Sudan.

This regional rock of stability has looked shaky in recent years, with persistent anti-government protests by the country’s largest ethnic group, the Oromos, as well as unrest among the second-largest community, the Amharas. At the same time, clashes between Oromos and the Somali ethnic group elsewhere in the country have left hundreds dead and displaced more than a million.

All this has been compounded by the return of devastating droughts that have put millions in need of food aid.

In the midst of this crisis, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned, and a state of emergency was declared as strikes erupted around the capital.

As soon as he took office, Abiy started visiting the centers of dissatisfaction. He went to the Oromo town of Ambo and complimented the young men at the forefront of the demonstrations for protecting democracy. He visited the Somali region to discuss the ongoing clashes that have displaced so many, and he journeyed north to the Tigray region, seen by many government critics as unfairly dominating the military and economy, to put the population at ease about having an Oromo in charge of the government.

He also met with opposition politicians and said he welcomed their views, seeing them as legitimate competition rather than enemies of the state.

In a speech before 20,000 people in Addis Ababa on April 15, he acknowledged that the bureaucracy and justice system have not been serving the people and promised reform, including in the security services.

“We will work closely to make the security and intelligence institutions free from political partiality,” he told the crowd. “They would [have to] act in accordance with the law and be accountable to the law upon transgressing the law.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Abiy has strong popular support which could give him leverage against elements of the establishment that might oppose reforms.

A reorganization of the security services, which critics maintain are dominated by the Tigrayans, who formed the backbone of the military after they overthrew the communist regime in 1991, has yet to take place, however. They were left untouched in a recent cabinet reshuffle.

[Under a new state of emergency, Ethiopia is on the brink of crisis, again]

The international reaction to Abiy’s first few weeks has been remarkably positive. A statement from the U.S. Embassy struck a note of hope as the State Department announced its 2017 human rights report, which describes the occurrence in Ethiopia of “arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces.”

“2018 has seen positive steps as well, including the release of thousands of prisoners. We are also encouraged by strong and clear statements by Prime Minister Abiy regarding the need for reforms,” the statement said.

Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, who has clashed in the past with the government, was invited back to the country and allowed to visit areas and talk with people he had been previously prevented from seeing.

“I was impressed by his commitment to openness and impressed by his apology for the irrevocable damage suffered by so many people during the repression of the recent protests,” Hussein told students at Addis Ababa University on April 25, referring to the new prime minister.

In fact, some are saying Abiy may have saved the country — not to mention the reputation of the ruling party.

In an editorial last year, the English language weekly Addis Standard issued a stark warning about the future of Ethiopia, saying that government infighting, ethnic tensions and popular anger had pushed the country toward collapse.

Editor Tsedale Lemma, who now lives in Germany, said the peaceful transition of power to Abiy may have halted that slide.

“They recognized that unless they do something, they were going down, and we came that close,” she said, lauding the outreach to the opposition and the release of prisoners. “What they are doing has given breathing space.”

Like the recently released detainees, she said she was cautiously optimistic but worried that not enough new faces have come into the government with the cabinet reshuffle. She noted also that the security forces remain untouched and that the state of emergency remains in place.

“It was a good beginning,” she said, “but . . . he could have done more.”

• Food Cluster: 8.5 million emergency beneficiaries and 4.5 m ex-public work clients received emergency food commodities.

During the last quarter of 2017, IDPs were also targeted for emergency food distribution. There were delays in food distribution especially in Somali region. One round was dropped and two rounds were carried over to the first quarter of 2018. As a result, out of nine only six rounds of food distribution were completed within 2017.

• Agriculture Cluster: 4.2 million animals (0.59 m HHs) received emergency feed provision, animal health and destocking services to save livelihoods of pastoralists in the south and southeastern parts of the country. The cluster was 43 per cent funded.

• Education Cluster: 1.4 million (71 per cent) school children benefited from school feeding and 1.8 million with learning stationary provision during 2016/17 academic year. 15,352 IDP school-children (only 16 per cent) benefited from school temporary learning centers. More than 70 per cent of targeted beneficiaries were reached with significant contribution from the Government.

• ESNFI Cluster: distributed 85,316 full ES/NFI kits and 12,986 cash grants and vouchers. During the last quarter of the year, the needs increased due to conflict along the Oromia-Somali borders that resulted in displacement of more than 800,000 people. This will significantly increase the needs in the first half of 2018.The cluster reached 53 per cent of its targeted beneficiaries.

• Health Cluster: partners supported the primary health care (including emergency vaccinations) and disease outbreak surveillance & treatment notably AWD. 48,716 people were treated in Case Treatment Center (CTCs) and Case Treatment Unit (CTUs).

• Nutrition Cluster: 344, 666 children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and 2.4 million with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) were treated.

• Protection Cluster: 1,558 IDPs were reached through protection monitoring activities and 679 unaccompanied and separated children were reunited with their families. The cluster was 43 per cent funded.

• WASH Cluster: 9.9 million people, including IDPs, were reached through water trucking, distribution of household water treatment chemicals and rehabilitation of water schemes. The cluster reached 94 per cent of its targeted people with higher coverage in SNNPR, Somali and Tigray regions. During the last quarter of the year, increase in number of conflict IDPs resulted in increased demand for water trucking, pipeline extension and construction of sanitation facilities.

6,ethiopia,"This report has been prepared under the auspices of the Federal Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group, co-chaired by the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) and OCHA with participation of cluster co-chairs (Government Line Ministries and Cluster Coordinators). It covers the period from 1 March to 31 March 2018.

Highlights

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to address food needs for 7.88 million people and non-food needs in 2018.

The Government and partners prepared a list of prioritized, time-bound requirements ahead of the HDRP launch to facilitate informed and timely donor decision to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages.

As of 14 March 2018, the 2018 HDRP was 31 per cent funded, including $182 million Government allocation and $111 million committed by international donors. Taking into account the $215 million carry-over resources from 2017, this leaves a gap of $1 billion.

Situation Overview

Government and partners launch the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan for 2018

On 13 March, the Government and humanitarian partners launched the Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. Based on findings of the November/December 2017 national multi-agency and multi-sector meher needs assessment, the document outlines prioritized plans in relief food, nutrition, water and sanitation (WaSH), health, education, protection, agriculture and shelter and non-food items in the affected areas, as well as mitigating and preparedness opportunities.

Most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities and the still dire condition of vulnerable communities due to the impact of successive drought, mainly in the south and south eastern Ethiopia, compounded by recent spikes in conflict-induced displacements.

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash. In addition, 3.4 million households are in need of livestock support; 3.5 million moderately malnourished children and pregnant and breastfeeding women and 350,000 severely malnourished children are expected to require emergency nutrition support; 6.9 million people are without safe drinking water; 1.5 million internally displaced people require shelter and non-food item support; 6.5 million people require emergency health interventions; 2.2 million children need support to continue their education; and some 300,000 vulnerable people need protection assistance, mainly in displacement settings. The use of cash transfer programming (CTP) is expected to be explored and further expanded based on market analysis in 2018, particularly to address the humanitarian needs of the conflict-induced IDPs. The use of multipurpose cash (MPC) has proven to be an effective response mechanism in meeting the needs of displaced population, particularly for those displaced from and to urban areas.

Immediate, time-bound priorities: Released on 23 February, ahead of the HDRP launch, the Immediate Funding Priorities Document1 outlined priority funding gaps for the first six months of 2018. With this document, the Government and humanitarian partners had called on urgent donor funding to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages. Without urgent additional funding, humanitarian partners risk pulling out from critical hotspot areas discontinuing lifesaving activities.

The pipeline for specialized nutritious foods to treat moderate malnutrition in all Priority one districts through targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP) will rupture from the end of May. WFP has secured $5.4 million (of $39.1 million total requirement) leaving a gap of $33.7 million as an urgent priority to manage 2 rounds (6 months) of TSFP, targeting 1.2 million moderately malnourished children under-5 and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers (PLW) and up to 150,000 moderately malnourished IDP children under-5 and PLWs. Meanwhile, UNICEF immediately requires $14.7 million to secure therapeutic foods (RUTF, therapeutic milks, essential drugs) to support Government treat and manage severe malnutrition (SAM) as well as for technical support for service quality assurance, monitoring and coordination. The current pipeline for SAM management will be exhausted from the end of June. However, a lead time of 4 months is required to secure commodities in-country.

Meanwhile, $50 million (or written pledge to this effect – facilitating the possibility of an internal loan) are immediately required to cover the cost of two rounds of WFP food assistance for 1.8 million people in Somali region.

The prioritized, urgent requirements from overall sector requirements are listed in the box above (NB: some of the sector requirements were adjusted since the release of the prioritization document).",Ethiopia: Humanitarian Response Situation Report No.18 (March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-response-situation-report-no18-march-2018

Desalegn added that it was increasingly becoming clear that peace agreements between the government and rebel groups were not going to be respected.

“Immediately after my resignation, I asked them, please would you resign because you failed to resolve the problem in South Sudan?” Desalegn disclosed during a governance summit held in Rwanda over the weekend.

“Leaders have to come to their senses … and they should somehow leave so they give power to new blood (leadership) that can lead the country to the next level,” he said.

Desalegn was chairman of the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which brokered the 2015 peace deal between Salva Kiir and opposition chief Riek Machar. Machar is currently in exile in South Africa.

“Agreements are signed and never implemented and I see further more agreements can be signed but I don’t think they will be implemented as the history shows,” he added.

Desalegn resigned his position as premier in mid-February 2018 in an effort to allow political reforms to be carried out by the ruling EPRDF coalition. He was replaced by Abiy Ahmed – the first ethnic Oromo to occupy the post.

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

The Government of Ethiopia is appealing for US$1.66 billion to provide support in agriculture and livestock, education, emergency shelter and non-food items (NFI), food, health, nutrition, protection and water, and sanitation and hygiene for 7.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Just under half of the target population are children. The Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) was released on 13 March 2018. While the document focuses on the immediate response requirements for 2018, it also lays out the basis for a three-pillared model that will allow for further planning and development investments, in line with a disaster risk management approach.

On 10 March 2018, a security incident between the Ethiopian Defence Forces in Moyale led to the death of 10 civilians and the injury of several others. The incident led to the displacement of over 10,000 people across the border to Kenya. In Kenya, the Kenyan Red Cross has reported that 80 per cent of the displaced are women and children and that there are about 600 pregnant women among the 10,557 refugees, who are being provided with basic supplies including food and water. These figures are currently being validated by the Kenyan Refugee Affairs Secretariat and UNHCR. On 21 March, the Secretariat of the State of Emergency Command Post stated that the displaced residents of Moyale who fled to Kenya are returning home. The Government of Ethiopia also announced that the State of Emergency inquiry board will investigate the deaths of civilians. A joint mission to assess the humanitarian situation in Moyale town took place from 23 to 26 March. The team, led by UNOCHA, included WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and UNDSS. The team was advised that essential services were disrupted immediately after the security incident; however, essential services are now operational. The team recommended to pre-position humanitarian supplies in order to immediately respond to any future needs.

Ethiopia continues to receive refugees and, as of 28 February 2018, 909,301 refugees were reported in Ethiopia. In the first two months of 2018, 15,097 refugees arrived in Ethiopia, including 7,202 in February.

In April 2018, flood incidences were reported in Arsi zone (Golelcha and Sude woredas), Bale zone (Agarfa woreda), Borena zone (Arero, Dire, Elwaye, Gomle Miyo, Yabello and Wachelle woredas), East Hararge zone (Golo Odo and Kumbi woredas), East Showa zone (Bora woreda), Guji zone (Adola and Agewaye woredas) and West Hararge zone (Doba and Gelemso woredas) of Oromia region; Afder zone (Hargelle, Charati, Raaso, West Imey and Dolobay woredas), Dawa zone (Khadaduma, Hudet, and Mubarak woredas), Doolo zone (LehelYacub woreda), Fafan zone (Jijiga town and Gursum woreda), Liben zone (Dolo Ado woreda), Nogob zone (Garbo and Duhun woredas), Shabelle zone (East Imey, Mustahil, Kelafo, Ferfer, Adadle, Bercano and Abakaorow woredas), and Sitti zone (Shinile woreda) of Somali region; and Gamo Gofa zone (Bonke and Daramalo woreda) and Sidama zone (Loka Abaya woreda) of SNNP region.

The National Flood Task Force was activated on 19 April to coordinate flood mitigation, preparedness and response efforts. Led by the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC), the Task Force comprises members from relevant Government entities and key humanitarian partners. Based on the National Meteorology Agency (NMA) mid-season forecast for the Spring- belg/gu/ganna season (April to May 2018), the Task Force released a Flood Alert on 27 April to provide information on the probable weather condition for the season and to identify areas likely to be affected by flooding for early action. The Alert will be updated based on updated NMA weather forecasts and the situation on the ground.

Needs, on-going response and gaps

A multi-sector joint rapid flood assessment conducted in Shabelle zone of Somali region from 19 to 24 April identified some 165,000 people affected by flooding in the zone, of which 98,016 people are displaced. Most of the displaced population are congregated in evacuation centers, while several thousands are stranded, surrounded by flood waters in various locations. Overall, some 5,000 houses were damaged by the flood in two woredas (Mustahil and Kelafo) of Shabelle zone; 72 schools/ABEs (43 in Kelafo, 14 Mustahil, 2 Ferfer 9 Ber’ano, and 4 Adadle woredas) and 36 health facilities (3 Health Centers and 33 Health Posts) were affected, while shortage of all types of medical supplies, including medical equipment, RUTF, mosquito nets, AWD drugs and malaria drugs were reported. Some 6,623 latrines were also destroyed in two woredas (Kelafo 2,175, Mustahil 4,448) of the zone. The lack of safe drinking water and the practice of open defecation is posing a serious health threat in the evacuation centers in Kelafo (Deka) and Mustahil (Kalabeydh) woredas, and the potential for the outbreak of water borne diseases such as AWD is real. Approximately 13,992 people in Kelafo and Mustahil are cut-off from the other parts of the woredas and require urgent humanitarian response to be rescued and provided with assistance.

Similarly, some 26,000 people in Dollo Ado town of Liben zone in Somali region were found displaced as a result of flooding. The flood was also reported to have damaged some 1,150 latrines in Dollo Ado Town. In Kabridahar Town, 2,600 people in six kabeles were affected and 43 latrines damaged. In Kabridahar Woreda, 1,500 people were affected, while 300 people displaced and food stocks washed away. In an effort to provide immediate support, Regional DPPB initially supplied more than 2,700 people in Jijiga, Fafan Zone, with partial NFI kits.

Flooding has affected ongoing humanitarian operations, limiting access to displaced populations (i.e. conflict and drought IDPs displaced prior to floods). Access has also limited the ability of humanitarian organizations to conduct full and comprehensive needs assessments in flood-affected areas.

Some 37 locations remain inaccessible due to the flood waters, requiring boat and/or air transport facilities. About 30 trucks (carrying relief commodities) were stranded on the way to Hudet, Dawa zone. The Government, through the Ministry of Defense (MoD), was able to deploy one helicopter to airdrop relief supplies in Mustahil woreda, whilst continuing efforts to secure more helicopters. The Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) has provided two boats that require maintenance. One of the two UNICEF boats providing assistance in Shabelle zone also requires maintenance. More flash floods are expected given the rain forecast, and humanitarian agencies are urged to pre-positioning emergency response materials before more roads are cut-off.

Government and partners are dispatching emergency response with limited available resources. So far, the Government provided some 2,447 partial NFI kits to the affected community in Liban, Fafan and Shabelle zone, while the procurement of additional kits is in progress. WFP dispatched 786 Mt of food for 46,374 people affected by flood in Somali region. The INGOs NRC and Save the Children have requested to re-allocate 2,000 ES/NFI kits funded by the Ethiopian Humanitarian Fund (EHF) to support the flooddisplaced people in Somali region. IOM is planning on disbursing cash-for-NFI to 9,000 people in Dollo Ado. WASH supplies have been dispatched to Shabelle and Afder Zones for a total of 120,000 floodaffected people in both zones. Five emergency water treatment systems have been installed in Beercaano Woreda (Shabelle Zone), Raaso and West Imay Woredas (Afdheer Zone).

A key constraint is the lack of adequate resources, mainly for the ES/NFI, Food, Health and WaSH clusters to respond to the identified needs of the flood affected population. Based on the Shabelle zone flood assessment report, 16,336 ES/NFI kits are immediately required. US$5 million is urgently required to cover the need. Urgent interventions in the areas of safe drinking water and hygiene and sanitation are crucial to prevent the outbreak of water borne/water related diseases and the re-emergence of AWD in Kelafo, Mustahil, and Ferfer woredas, which have been the epicenter of the recurrent AWD outbreaks in the last couple of months.

As of 2 May, the ES/NFI and WaSH clusters had a funding gap of $83 million and $78 million respectively to address all identified needs in the 2018 HDRP, not including the needs of the recent flood-affected communities.","Ethiopia – Floods Flash Update #1, 4 May 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-floods-flash-update-1-4-may-2018
11,ethiopia,"Ethiopia and Djibouti agreed to swap stakes in strategic public enterprises including airlines, ports and telecommunications companies, as the Horn of Africa neighbors pursue deeper economic integration.

The deal would include exchanges of shares in Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise, Africa’s biggest carrier by revenue, Djiboutian Finance Minister Ilyas Dawaleh said in an interview. Shareholdings in companies such as the Doraleh Container Terminal and in a new oil terminal, Ethiopian Telecommunications Corp. and Djibouti Telecom SA will also be swapped, he said.

While the deal has been politically “endorsed,” the two countries will form a committee to work out the details, Dawaleh said by phone April 30. Ethiopian Information Minister Ahmed Shide confirmed the agreement in a text message.

The pact came as Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, made his first foreign visit at the weekend to Djibouti, the tiny state located where the Indian Ocean meets the Red Sea and that’s become a strategic hub for the U.S. and China. Landlocked Ethiopia -- which the International Monetary Fund ranks as the fastest-growing economy on the continent -- is trying to boost its export-oriented manufacturing, making it reliant on neighboring nations with ports.

Dawaleh said Abiy told Djiboutian officials that both countries should start referring to their state-owned enterprises as belonging to all, rather than one nation.

Abiy said in a statement on his Facebook page that officials from both countries “underlined the importance of working towards the realization of complete economic integration of the two economies.” He didn’t elaborate.","Ethiopia, Djibouti May Swap Stakes in Airlines, Ports",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/ethiopia-djibouti-may-swap-stakes-in-airlines-ports-telecoms

13,ethiopia,"Farmer Mohamed Abdelkhaleq speaks during an interview with Reuters in a field in the Beheira Governorate, north of Cairo, Egypt April 4, 2018.

Rice farmers in Kafr Ziada village in the Nile River Delta have ignored planting restrictions aimed at conserving water for years, continuing to grow a medium-grain variety of the crop that is prized around the Arab world.

A decision thousands of kilometers to the south is about to change that, however, in another example of how concern about water, one of the world’s most valuable commodities, is forcing change in farming, laws and even international diplomacy.

Far upstream, close to one of the sources of the Nile, Ethiopia is preparing to fill the reservoir behind its new $4 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, possibly as soon as this year.

How fast it does so could have devastating consequences for farmers who have depended on the Nile for millennia to irrigate strategic crops for Egypt’s 96 million people, expected to grow to 128 million by 2030.

Safeguarding Egypt’s share of the Nile, on which the country relies for industry and drinking water as well as farming, is now at the top of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s agenda as he begins a second term.

At the same time, authorities are finally tackling widespread illegal growing of the water-intensive rice crop, showing a sense of urgency that even climate change and rapid population growth has failed to foster.

The crackdown means Egypt will likely be a rice importer in 2019 after decades of being a major exporter, rice traders say.

Cairo has decreed that 724,000 feddans (750,000 acres) of rice can be planted this year, which grain traders estimate is less than half of the 1.8 million feddans actually cultivated in 2017 – far in excess of the officially allotted 1.1 million feddans.

Police have started raiding farmers’ homes and jailing them until they pay outstanding fines from years back.

“The police came to my house at three in the morning and took me to the station to pay the fine,” said Mohamed Abdelkhaleq, head of the farming association in Kafr Ziada, some 125 km (80 miles) north of Cairo in Beheira governorate.

“Even if the fine is 1 Egyptian pound (5 U.S. cents), they’ll come to your house.”

Three other farmers reported similar experiences and said this year they would not plant rice.

Reda Abdelaziz, 50, said some people have become afraid to leave the village.

“If you’re traveling and they take your ID card and see you have a fine on you, they’ll put you in jail,” he said.

Abdelkhaleq took to the local mosque’s loudspeaker last month to say the government was doubling the fine for unauthorized rice cultivation to 7,600 pounds per feddan.

Mostafa al-Naggari, who heads the rice committee of Egypt’s agricultural export council, says if the government sticks to the new approach Egypt will likely have to import as much as 1 million tonnes of rice next year.

“The dam has opened the door for there to be more of an awareness of water scarcity issues, but Egypt has for a long time needed to review its water allocation policy,” he said.

No agreement

Egypt has long considered the Nile its own, even though the river and its tributaries flow through 10 countries. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat famously said in 1979 that he was prepared to go to war over the Nile if its flow was ever threatened.

But any threat from Ethiopia in the past was empty – until now. The new dam, cutting through the Blue Nile tributary just before its descent into southeastern Sudan, will offer Addis Ababa immense political leverage over its downstream neighbors.

Sudan and Egypt are the biggest users of the river for irrigation and dams. Egypt wants to be assured that the dam will not affect the river’s flow, estimated at about 84 billion cubic meters on average per year.

Ethiopia aims to use the dam to become Africa’s biggest power generator and exporter, linking tens of millions to electricity for the first time.

The two countries have not been able to agree on a comprehensive water-sharing arrangement despite years of negotiations.

Ethiopia was not party to and does not recognize a 1959 agreement between Egypt and Sudan that gave Cairo the rights to the lion’s share of the river. For its part, Egypt refuses to sign on to a 2010 regional water-sharing initiative that takes away its power to veto projects that would alter allocations.

Ethiopia says that its dam won’t affect the Nile’s flow once its 79 billion cubic meter reservoir is filled. The issue is over how fast that happens. Ethiopia wants to do it in as little as three years; Egypt is aiming for seven to ten, sources close to the matter said.

There’s no doubt the flow of the Nile will be affected during those years. What’s not known is how dramatically, and there is little data available to answer that question.

Sources at Egypt’s irrigation ministry have estimated the loss of 1 billion cubic meters of water would affect 1 million people and lead to the loss of 200,000 acres of farmland.

On that basis, “if (the dam is) filled in 3 years it might destroy 51 percent of Egypt’s farmland, if in 6 years it will destroy 17 percent,” said Ashraf el Attal, CEO of Dubai-based commodities trader Fortuna and an expert on Egypt’s grain trade.

Be ready to adapt

The U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organisation has said Egypt requires an “urgent and massive” response to maintain food security in coming years for a number of reasons, including water scarcity, urbanization and the effects of climate change.

Talks among Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia on the dam in early April stalled over what Sudan’s foreign minister called “technical issues”. No date has been set for the next round.

“The filling of the GERD is just the most critical issue for the three countries to decide upon, and now, ahead of the first filling,” said Ana Cascão, an independent researcher on Nile hydropolitics.

“A fair and equitable filling strategy must take into account different scenarios on climate and rainfall variability – if it will be one of drought, then the three countries are ready to agree on a slower filling,” said Cascão.

Rice farmers, who typically begin planting at the end of April, said they may now leave their lands fallow given the difficulty of quickly switching to other summer crops like cotton and corn that require different machinery and techniques.

Irrigation Minister Mohamed Abdel Aty told Reuters the situation posed a big threat to crops, livelihoods and even political stability if efforts to coordinate fail.

“Imagine to what extent these people will become vulnerable,” he said.",Egypt's Rice Farmers Brace for Crisis as Ethiopia Prepares Nile Mega-dam,https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/asia-and-australia/egypt-s-rice-farmers-brace-for-crisis-as-ethiopia-prepares-mega-dam-1.6026667
14,ethiopia,"Demonstrators have taken to the streets in at least a dozen southern Ethiopian towns this week to protest the federal government's renewal of a license for a mining company that they say jeopardizes local residents' health.

The protests, in the restive Oromia region, criticize a 10-year license for Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Cos., or MIDROC, to continue mining gold at a site near the town of Shakiso and the Lega Dembi river.

The demonstrations followed the April 27 report of the license renewal for MIDROC, which has operated the mine since the late 1990s. The company is owned by one of Africa's richest men, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi, detained since November in what Saudi Arabia alleges was an anti-corrupt sweep.

""Demonstrators are very angry. They are blocking roads and demanding change,"" Dulacha Lafe, administrator for the local Goro Dolaa district, told VOA in a phone interview on Monday, when the protests began. He said local authorities ""understand and agree with their concern. However, we don't have the power to solve the problem. [The] Oromia regional government and the federal government should help us out. The license should not have been renewed at all.""

Some high school students skipped classes this week to join in the anti-mining protests, which have erupted periodically over the years. A Shakiso resident, who asked VOA to withhold his name out of fear of retaliation, said Friday that some students ""were beaten because of protesting and asking for their constitutional rights.""

Abdu Kadir, an inspector for the local Guji district government, told VOA: ""Some schools have been closed for a few days, and today students are back in class. Nobody is arrested or anything.""

Chemicals blamed for ailments

Protesters contend that chemicals used at the mine contaminate the water and air, sickening humans and animals with everything from respiratory illnesses to miscarriages, birth defects and disabilities.

Also in that report, MIDROC's environmental protection expert, Ahmed Mohammed, said the company used chemicals including hydrogen cyanide. ""[E]ven a small amount"" of hydrogen cyanide ""can contaminate water and can cause serious consequences,"" he said. He did not specify the amounts used in MIDROC's operations, nor what safety precautions, if any, the company had taken.

MIDROC did not respond to VOA's attempts to reach it by phone and via its website.

The website MiningFacts.org explains that cyanide, ""in the form of a very dilute sodium cyanide solution, is used to dissolve and separate gold from ore. … Cyanide is toxic in large doses and is strictly regulated in most jurisdictions worldwide to protect people, animals and the aquatic environment.""

Local residents are concerned not only about health but also economics, said Galchu Halake, a traditional leader and one of the protesters in Arkalo town.

""They want the license to be revoked since the company has been mining gold for export without contributing to the local economy or the society's well-being,"" Galchu said.

Bacha Faji, a spokesman for Ethiopia's Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas, said the renewed contract's terms direct a share of the company's earnings to local communities.

""Two percent of the income the company generates will go to locals,"" Bacha said in an interview with the BBC this week. He said that followed a government investigation ""into what the company was doing for the past 20 years"" and factored in local grievances.

Those include concerns about mining-related environmental degradation, health risks, displacement of housing and ""the failure to hire local labor,"" the international organization Human Rights Watch noted in a 2016 report.That report focused on Ethiopian security forces' crackdowns, including ""the killings and mass arrest of protesters"" over gold mining and other issues.

In April 2016, Badada Gelchu was shot and killed at his home in Shakiso after participating in demonstrations against the gold mine. His family told VOA then that security agents ""went to his house and killed him, accusing him of organizing the protests in our area.""

Skeptical of deal

Addisu Bulala, a leader of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress party, expressed skepticism about MIDROC's renewed license. Speaking with VOA by phone, he mentioned televised reports showing children with deformities allegedly linked to contaminants from mining.

""Until today, there's been no compensation, no change. ... No one is charged for crimes committed"" involving environmental pollution, Addisu said. ""This is basically selling the community for dollars. Our party is concerned deeply, and no responsible government would allow this.""

Oromia regional officials are ""not accepting"" the federal mining ministry's licensing decision, said Negeri Lencho, spokesman for the regional government. ""Even if the [ministry] says it conducted an investigation, we have no idea of the findings. They did not share the results. It is disrespectful to us and our people. ... They admitted the lack of transparency and agreed to figure this out together.""

Negeri said the regional government was conducting its own investigation into MIDROC's mining practices and environmental impact.

""We want our people to understand that, as a regional government, their concerns and questions are ours, too,"" he added.

Ethiopia still is under a state of emergency imposed in February after the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. His successor, Abiy Ahmed, confirmed in April, is the country's first prime minister from the Oromo ethnic group, which has long sought equal representation in government.

“We are grateful to the Government of Sweden for this contribution, which confirms Sweden’s continued commitment to supporting populations affected by humanitarian emergencies,” said UNICEF Representative Gillian Mellsop. “This is the first such significant contribution to our funding appeal in 2018. It will enable us to alleviate the hardships currently faced by populations living in IDP sites where access to basic services remains low and where conditions, especially for children, are simply unbearable.”

Current estimates place the number of persons internally displaced by climatic and conflict factors at around 1.7 million. The displaced are settled in 916 sites across the country.

The contribution from Sweden will enable UNICEF to provide critical and much-needed water and sanitation, nutrition, and health services to displaced populations in the two regions. Other services will include education and child protection.

Specifically, Sweden’s support will go towards:

· Trucking of water to IDP sites and construction or expansion of water supply systems;

· Diarrhoea treatment, vaccination of children against measles, and distribution of mosquito nets;

· Treatment of children with acute malnutrition and provision of high protein biscuits to prevent malnutrition in children and pregnant and lactating women;

· Provision of emergency education, including early childhood development;

· Reunification of separated and unaccompanied children with their families and preventing and mitigating risks faced by children, especially girls.

While the Government continues to prioritize the return and resettlement of the IDPs, thousands of displaced people are still in need of urgent life-saving assistance. UNICEF’s US$ 112 million humanitarian appeal for children targets 3.1 million people with support, out of which 1.5 million are children. Presently, the appeal has a shortfall of US$ 86 million, with nutrition, health, and education having the most significant gaps.

Ethiopian foreign exchange shortage will last years: new premier

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) – Ethiopia’s new prime minister said on Monday that a foreign exchange shortage will last for years and more cooperation with the private sector is essential to solve it, state television reported.

Abiy Ahmed, who was sworn in on April 2, addressed the local business community at a session of more than two hours in a hotel in the Ethiopian capital. His paraphrased remarks were later broadcast by state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation.

“The crisis with hard currency will not be solved today, nor will it in the next 15 or 20 years. There is an urgent need for more cooperation with the private sector to find a solution,” Abiy was reported as saying, adding that remittances from Ethiopia’s diaspora communities had also fallen for political reasons.

Ethiopia has recorded average annual economic growth of about 10 percent for the past decade, the fastest in Africa. But foreign investors and local businesses complain that the severe hard currency shortages are stifling the private sector.

The International Monetary Fund said in January that Ethiopia’s foreign reserves at the end of the 2016/17 fiscal year stood at $3.2 billion, less than what it spends on imports in two months. The government does not regularly release foreign reserves figures.

The IMF flagged inadequate reserves as a downside risk to economic growth for 2017/18, which it forecast at 8.5 percent.

Despite high economic growth, the landlocked country of 100 million people is heavily dependent on imports. The IMF said export revenues last year were largely unchanged despite volume growth as global agricultural commodity prices remained low and exports from manufacturing, following the start of an industrialization push, are just beginning.

The views of Sophia Tesfamlariam were contained in an article titled: “Impotence of the United Nations and Ethiopia’s Impunity” and published on the website of Eritrea’s Ministry of Information.

The writer, an Eritrean-American analyst and writer with the U.S. Foundation for the Horn of Africa stressed that if the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was brave enough to hold Ethiopia to account for flouting a known international agreement reached sixteen years ago, the crisis will have been solved.

By refusing to take any punitive actions, the UN Security Council, long considered to be the vanguard of international peace and security, has emboldened ... Ethiopia to flout international law and continue to violate the rights of the Eritrean people.

“By refusing to take any punitive actions, the UN Security Council, long considered to be the vanguard of international peace and security, has emboldened the minority regime in Ethiopia to flout international law and continue to violate the rights of the Eritrean people to live in peace and security within their own internationally recognized borders.

“It is the responsibility of the UN Security Council to enforce the EEBC’s final and binding delimitation and demarcation decisions,” the article read in parts.

EHF allocates US$16.2 million to support most critical funding gaps

The Ethiopian Humanitarian Fund (EHF), OCHA-managed pooled fund, in the First Round Standard Allocation, allotted $16.2 million to support the most critical funding gaps in the first half of 2018. The allocation is triggered following the launch of the joint Government and Partners Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) and its subsequent prioritization exercise that identifies acute relief needs and major gaps that require urgent response in the context of the HDRP. Immediate requirements identified in the Prioritization Statement, including averting pipeline breaks, contributing to mitigation of climate-driven drought-induced needs, and ensuring continuity of presence of partners already implementing in priority woredas are prioritize for funding. The allocation targets immediate and life-saving activities in Nutrition ($5.5m), Health ($3.7m), WaSH ($3.5m), Agriculture/Livestock ($2m), Education ($1m) and Protection ($0.5m) sectors.

Last year, the EHF provided more than $94.2m in support of 124 multi-sector projects and covering nearly 18 per cent of the total non-food needs identified in the 2017 HRD with contributions from eight donors namely Germany, Ireland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.

So far Ethiopia’s humanitarian response is 32 per cent funded. From the total requirement of $1.658 billion, $525 has been contributed so far ($182 million from the Government of Ethiopia, $127 million from international donors and $215 million carried over from 2017).

Conflict leaves large scale displacement in West Gujji and Gedeo zones

Conflict between ethnic Oromos from West Gujji and Gedeos from SNNP region resulted in large scale displacement from both sides, leaving people in dire need of food and non-food assistance. The National Disaster Risk Management Commission has dispatched 1,250 metric ton of rice, 115 metric ton of CSB, 33 metric ton of oil and 500 cartons of biscuit to Gedeb (SNNP) and Kercha (Oromia) sites and distribution is ongoing. Humanitarian partners are also moving supplies and commodities to both regions. Currently, Government and partners are assessing the actual number of needs and will continue to provide coordinated support accordingly.

Drought caused mainly by underperformance of rains in parts of the country coupled with displacements due to ethnic conflicts has put Ethiopia at a humanitarian hotspot for three years in a row. While shortage of rains has been the driver for drought, flash floods following heavy rains, mostly from highland areas, continue to affect numerous people. Reported flash flood incidences since the second week of April have left hundreds of thousands of people in need of immediate humanitarian support in Afar (Awsi), Oromia (Arsi, East Shewa, East and West Hararge zones) and Somali (7 zones) regions. Areas affected by recurring floods have been advocating for enhanced flood early warning, mitigation and preparedness mechanisms.

Somali region the worst affected by floods

In Somali region, more than 27,000 flood-affected households (165,000 persons) need urgent food, water, health services and NFIs support. Overflow of Genale and W abi Shebelle rivers and related tributaries due recent heavy rains in the Somali region and the highlands of Oromia has affected more than 83 kebeles in 19 woredas (districts) of Afder, Fafan, Liben, Nogob, Siti, Shebele and warder Zones. Several Kebeles are submerged and farmlands are either flooded or washed away at flowering stage. Many people’s houses/shelters and livestock have reportedly been washed away, leaving people displaced and homeless.

The regional Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Bureau and partners operational in the region have prepared an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for flood victims.

NDRMC and partners dispatching food and non-food items amid road access challenges

Following the request for immediate support by Somali region, the National Disaster Risk Management Commission has allocated food and non-food items and is working with WFP on logistics for transportation. The commission is also working with shelter and NFI cluster for additional non-food response. According to WFP, heavy rains received in previous weeks have contributed to delays in food deliveries to some of the woredas in Somali and Oromia regions. Road inaccessibility due to the current belg rain is delaying dispatches to Bale, Arsi and West Arsi zones of Oromia region.

April- May Meteorological forecast

According to the National meteorological Agency (NMA), the mid-season rain predicted for much of the country for the two months (April & May) will be at most-close to normal with a possibility of above normal rainfall anomalies in some places. Better rainfall activity is anticipated to favor both belg-growing and benefiting areas of the country, and with the expected enhanced rain-giving meteorological systems, heavy falls are likely to prevail over different places. the expected heavy fall over some areas would have a negative impact on crop fields particularly over low-lying areas. Thus, proper attention should be undertaken to minimize the risk in low lying areas, and areas with less vegetation coverage.

National Flood Taskforce activated

The national flood taskforce was activated on 19 April 2018 following reports of flash floods from different parts of the country. The taskforce is preparing a national contingency plan for flood-affected and flood at-risk communities across the country.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 51 | 09-22 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-51-09-22-april-2018
21,ethiopia,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Throughout 2017, the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners responded to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian context mainly due to drought and conflict. The year began with 5.6 million people requiring relief food assistance as a result of the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in southern and south-eastern Ethiopia. The 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD)1 requested nearly $1 billion for multi-sector response to save lives and livelihoods. At mid-year, the number of people requiring relief food spiked to 8.5 million raising the funding requirements to $1.26 billion. An additional 4.1 million public works clients of the Productive Safety Net Programme, who are not included in the HRD estimates, continued to require relief assistance during the year.

The under-performance of the 2017 spring (February - May) rains - making it the third consecutive poor/failed rains in the southern and south-eastern lowlands - contributed to the deteriorated humanitarian situation. Areas needing urgent nutrition support (priority one woredas/districts) increased slightly mid-year from 454 to 461, nearly half of which were classified as ‘priority one’ (very severe) while targeted supplementary feeding needs increased by 76,000 under five children to 376,000 cases. Pastoral communities entirely dependent on their livestock bore the brunt of the drought crisis. Risk factors such as chronic water scarcity continued to drive livestock deaths (including drought resistant varieties), displacement and disease outbreaks, particularly Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD).

Adding another layer of complexity to an already dire humanitarian situation was the upsurge in violence along the Oromia and Somali regional borders in early September 2017. According to NDRMC estimates, some 857,000 conflict-displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing violence or fear of violence were settled in close to 400 sites, across Oromia, Somali, Harar regions often in areas experiencing ongoing drought-related humanitarian need – as well as the cities of Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa. The conflict and subsequent population displacements – while generating major humanitarian needs and protection concerns – disrupted delivery of humanitarian assistance.

Flash floods caused by the overflow of Awash, Wabe Shebelle, Baro rivers and backflow of Lake Tana affected 300,000 people in Afar, Amhara, Gambella, Oromia and Somali regions, of whom at least 100,000 displaced.

The drastic escalation in the number of IDPs and associated multi-sector needs, the dire nutrition situation in Somali region, harvest losses due to failed or delayed rains and the impact of Fall Armyworm infestation necessitated a further upward revision of the HRD requirement to $1.42 billion by mid-October.

Adding to these in-country challenges was the continued crossing of refugees into Ethiopia from war torn and drought affected neighboring countries. Influx of South Sudanese refugees fleeing renewed conflict in Maiwut, Mathiang and Pagak areas led to the establishment of new reception centres and expansion of existing camps in Gambella and Beneshangul Gumuz regions.

The 2017 HRD requirement was 81 per cent funded, with some 8.5 million people assisted with relief food and cash, more than 1.6 million moderately malnourished children under-5 were supported with supplementary feeding and 256,000 severely malnourished children were enrolled in therapeutic feeding programs. At least 73,000 full ES/NFI kits were distributed to displaced households, including 9,500 households assisted with cash grants. Some 4.8 million people also benefited from health services, while several thousand were supported in the WaSH, Education, Protection and Agriculture sectors.

With predictions that the current scenario will likely deteriorate further due to the potential impact of a La Niña on the 2018 spring rains, chronic water and fodder shortages in the current drought belt, and the potential for a new larger scale AWD outbreak after February 2018, Government and partners are calling for continuation of current levels of support going into 2018.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
22,ethiopia,"The Ethiopian-Eritrean War of 1998-2000 erupted 20 years ago today, when the two countries went to war over the scrubby and desolate plains of Badime that are hardly useful for anything. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, former comrades-in-arms who fought side by side and defeated one of Africa's largest and best-trained army, morphed into absolutists. Belligerent narratives swiftly became dominant, causing a structural breakdown of communications between the two countries.

The result was a bloody and senseless WWI-style trench warfare in which tens of thousands of soldiers run into machine guns, tanks and artillery fire in waves. The war left an estimated 100,000 dead and more than a million displaced.

The war also had a devastating effect on the social fabric and the economy of the two countries. Both countries resorted to nationalist framings of identity, territory, and shared history, precipitating conflicting narratives. Both countries diverted scarce resources from vital public services and developmental endeavours into weapons procurement.

At the height of the war, Ethiopia increased the total size of its army from 60,000 to 350,000 and increased its defence expenditure from $95m in 1997/98 to $777m in 1999/2000. Overall, the cost of the war for Ethiopia was nearly $3bn.

In the meantime, the size of Eritrea's army increased to 300,000 (almost 10 percent of the population) through National Service Conscription following the outbreak of the war, and the government has been using the intractable stalemate between the two countries as a justification not to demobilise the unsustainably high number of troops for a small nation like Eritrea.

Conflicting interests, hegemonic aspirations

The outbreak of the war between the two countries was universally described as astonishing and bewildering. Scholars and commentators across the world, exasperated by the senselessness of the conflict over an imaginary line that runs through the craggy piece of land, offered various explanations ranging from Eritrea's economic woes to the divergent ideologies between the leadership of the two countries and Ethiopia's desire to regain access to the sea.

What is clear, however, is that the border dispute that was presented as the official reason behind the outbreak of the war was simply a mask for other much deeper and complex problems and hegemonic aspirations.

Although officially an armed conflict between two sovereign nations, the Ethiopian-Eritrean War was largely viewed as a conflict between the ruling elites belonging to Peoples' Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF), the two political movements which dominated the politics of the two countries at the time. At most, it is a conflict between the Tigrinya speaking people of the Eritrean highlands, and the Tigrayans of Ethiopia. As Gerbru Asrat, former Politburo member of the TPLF observed, ""only Tigray, not the whole of Ethiopia, is Eritrea's target.""

Though the underlying political and economic differences were far from being insurmountable, the animosity, rage, scorn and bitterness between these two movements and their leadership made a political resolution impossible.

The Algiers Agreement

After the fall of Badme to Ethiopia, the series of international mediation efforts within the Organization of African Unity and other multilateral organisations culminated in the adoption by the two countries of the Algiers Peace Agreement. In June of 2000, the two countries agreed to ""permanently terminate military hostilities"" and establish a ""neutral Boundary Commission"" that will have full authority to delimit and demarcate the boundaries. The peace treaty, which was also signed by the United States, the European Union, the African Union, and the United Nations, as guarantors, authorised the Commission to issue a ""final and binding"" decision. In April 2002, the Boundary Commission rendered its decision, ruling that the flashpoint town of Badme is part of Eritrea. Ethiopia refused to comply with the decision, setting the stage for a stalemate that still reverberates across the Horn of Africa.

Intractable predicament

The political stalemate that ensued from the war and stubbornly persisted for two decades proved to be exclusivist and alienating. The conflict shattered family lives of millions of people on both sides of the border. It deprived landlocked Ethiopia of access to Eritrean ports. It cut off Eritrea from access to the largest market in the region. Both countries diverted massive resources from their already meagre budgets for military activity and still have thousands of troops manning their borders. In pursuit of their respective interests, the two countries engaged in hostile activities against one another, making a rapprochement even more difficult.

The dispute between the two countries has also been a vital factor of intractability for the Horn of Africa region. In 2006, Ethiopia sent troops to Somalia to fight the Islamic Courts Union. Although Ethiopia's targets were Eritrean advisors in Mogadishu and Ethiopia's concern about the long-term consequences of Eritrean influence in Somali politics, Ethiopia announced the war as part of the ""global war on terror"" to garner US financial and diplomatic support. The US fell for the ruse and became a key sponsor of Ethiopia's mission.

Despite the intensity of the hostilities, the political landscaping is shifting, and there is a growing recognition by all the parties that the status quo is unsustainable.

Driven by both domestic and regional considerations, Ethiopia sought to build a reputation as a critical partner in the ""global war on terror"", becoming a key ally of the West and one of the top recipients of the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and the Department of State's East Africa Regional Strategic Initiative. Ethiopian leaders used this alliance with the West to isolate and contain Eritrea, playing a key role in the 2009 US-sponsored UN arms sanction against Eritrea imposed for its alleged support of ""terrorist"" movements. Although a UN panel of experts found no evidence of Eritrean support and recommended the lifting of the sanctions, the Security Council extended the sanctions in November 2017.

In 2016, Eritrea reportedly leased the Port of Asab to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who set up a military base there. Although Eritrea denied the report, there are credible claims that UAE is developing the base and using it for the war effort in Yemen.

Despite the intensity of the hostilities, the political landscaping is shifting, and there is a growing recognition by all the parties that the status quo is unsustainable.

Unique opportunities

In a gesture of reconciliation, Ethiopia's brand-new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, expressed his readiness to resolve the differences between the two countries through dialogue. ""With the government of Eritrea,"" he said, ""we want from the bottom of our hearts that the disagreement that has reigned for years to come to an end."" Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, from the Oromo ethnic group, has a unique chance of ending the stalemate and opening a new chapter towards a peaceful coexistence by highlighting the transformative economic and social opportunities peace would bring both sides. He does not have the baggage that Meles Zenawi had and has a much better room for manoeuvre than his predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn.

However, the real test he faces is going beyond reconciliatory gestures or diplomatic pleasantries attempted by his predecessors. Most importantly, Abiy must commit Ethiopia to full compliance with the Commission's decision and reverse Ethiopia's legally and politically unsustainable position on Badme. He must send a clear signal to the Eritreans and the international community that Ethiopia will honour its end of the deal. Eritrea has the weight of an internationally binding judgement on its side and is right to demand Ethiopia's compliance with that decision.

This would serve as a critical confidence-building measure between the two countries, and would pave the way towards the complex and gruelling task of working through the political and economic conditions that led to the war that ripped the fabric of the two societies apart.

There is also a change in attitude in Washington and Brussels. On April 22, Undersecretary of State for African Affairs Donald Yamamoto visited Eritrea and there are reports that the current administration is open to talks. Europeans have already begun engaging with the Eritrean government. Under pressure to address the refugee crisis, they have been engaging the government and they would not hesitate to end the sanctions and support a peace initiative between the countries.

The peaceful resolution of the Ethiopian and Eritrean conflict would strengthen regional stability and restore confidence and resilience to the economy of both countries. It is imperative for all those who care about the long-term stability and economic viability of the region to do everything they can to help the two countries move beyond the senseless war that wrought so much suffering on both people.

Blockchain pioneer Charles Hoskinson’s latest project involves putting the birthplace of coffee on the blockchain. Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum and is at the helm at smart-contract fueled decentralized blockchain startup Cardano, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Science and Technology for ag-tech development on the public ledger.

The arrangement tasks Cardano with exploring ways that the African nation can apply the startup’s blockchain technology to its agri-tech sector. Traders didn’t celebrate Cardano’s ADA coin, which is ranked No. 6 on Coin Market Cap and which was trading lower by 6% at the time of publication.

According to the MOU, the participants will study ways that the blockchain could be used to track coffee along the supply chain or for land registry purposes to cut down on fraud, for instance. The partnership stands to have a long-term impact, as education is at the core of the arrangement. Hoskinson plans not only to share his ideas but also teach developers how to use Cardano’s blockchain technology on their own.

Hoskinson used Twitter to document his trip to Ethiopia, including a glimpse into an Addis community and the new agreement –

Cardano Tech’s Impact

Cardano’s vision for the developing world is much bigger than Ethiopia, but Ethiopia is where it all begins. John O’Connor, director of African Operations at IOHK who joined from the Cardano Foundation, detailed in a blog post how education will be paramount to the company’s mission in Africa, saying:

“This year we will offer our first course in Africa, probably in Ethiopia, and expect the first cohort of Ethiopian developers to be contributing to Cardano code by the end of the year.”

Meanwhile, Hoskinson at the London School of Economics earlier this year spoke about Cardano’s goals for the developing world more broadly. He spoke about the problems surrounding land registry where landowners are being kicked off their own property for a lack of adequate record keeping. Countries like Rwanda, Kenya and Ghana are currently making strides with land registry on the blockchain — a key focus of Cardano and IOHK.

Hoskinson went on to explain that one of the reasons he entered the cryptocurrency space was to “explore what capabilities are required for him to give this tool to people across the world so they can solve their own problems.”

Before heading to Africa, Hoskinson was in Tel Aviv, according to his Twitter feed, where developers from Cardano’s partner company IOHK presented to cryptographers at EuroCrypto 2018.
