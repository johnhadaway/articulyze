0,ethiopia,"A group of Ethiopian treasures, now on special display at the Victoria and Albert Museum, have rekindled an old debate about whether such artefacts should be returned to their country of origin. Ethiopia would like them back. The V&A’s director, Tristram Hunt, has suggested a long-term loan. The Ethiopian government has welcomed Hunt’s offer. And there, for now, the matter rests.

The treasures, which include an 18th-century gold crown and a royal wedding dress, are part of a fascinating and beautiful collection with a tragic and little-known history. They were seized by the British in 1868 and have been in the V&A ever since. But the circumstances of their seizure, and the consequences, deserve to be much better known.

Looted Ethiopian treasures in UK could be returned on loan Read more

Even most of those who know something of British imperial history are unlikely to know much about the 1868 invasion of Abyssinia which lies at the root of the current debate about the future of these treasures. That’s because the Abyssinia campaign barely features in the dominant historical narratives about British imperial power. The discredited heroic narrative of imperial Britain had prominent places for the conquest of north America, India and even South Africa. The critical big post-colonial narrative that replaced it concentrated on India, the Middle East, the Atlantic slave trade and even Ireland. But the Abyssinia campaign has remained on the margins of both.

The 1868 war gets a passing ironic mention as one of the “justifiable wars” of the 19th century in 1066 and All That. The tragic and poignant fate of the Abyssinian Prince Alemayehu, who was brought to Britain with the treasure in 1868, is possibly marginally better known than the events that gave rise to it. Alemayehu met Queen Victoria and was sent to Rugby school. He died in Headingley, Leeds, at the age of 18 while staying under the care of his former tutor Cyril Ransome, father of the children’s author (and Guardian journalist) Arthur Ransome, and is buried in Windsor Castle. Alemayehu’s exile has recently been the subject of a film and a radio programme. But the wider truth is that this is a forgotten story – except in Ethiopia.

Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, was on the wrong side of Africa to be caught up in the Atlantic slave trade, though always vulnerable to the Arab slave trade. It was too mountainous and isolated to be routinely involved in the struggles between Britain, France and Turkey to control the Red Sea and the route to India. And when the European colonial “rush for Africa” began in earnest in the mid-19th century, it offered too few easy pickings in terms of minerals, cash crops and settlement.

Nineteenth-century Abyssinia, with its ancient culture and its dominant Coptic Christian religion, was both a place apart for the European powers and a place with real, if uneasy, connections to the neighbouring Ottoman Turkish world that dominated north-east Africa and the Middle East. When, in 1855, a remarkable local ruler called Kassa unified Abyssinia’s many provinces and crowned himself the Emperor Tewodros, the outside world began to be aware of one of the great African leaders of the 19th century.

Tewodros was a man of enormous energy and ambition. His aim, never fulfilled, was to create a modern nation state. Though he always struggled to maintain control, he abolished feudal dues, paid salaries to judges and local governors, outlawed bribery, confiscated firearms, forbade the slave trade and abolished polygamy. His growing power attracted foreign governments. A British diplomat visited him in 1855. And in 1862, after receiving a present of two pistols from Britain, Tewodros wrote to Queen Victoria with an audacious proposal. As the great Christian emperor of the south, he proposed an alliance with the great Christian empress of the north. Together, their armies would unite – and drive the Muslim Ottomans from the holy places in Jerusalem.

It was a fateful letter. Lord Palmerston’s government in London had no intention of getting involved. The letter was ignored. Tewodros responded by taking hostage the handful of Europeans in the country, including a British emissary. For years, efforts were made to negotiate the hostages’ release. But Britain’s refusal to send aid workers or to join in the Jerusalem adventure made that impossible. The situation festered and Tewodros’s power began to decline. In 1868, in an operation costing £9m – the equivalent of more than £1bn today – Britain sent an army of 13,000 troops. In April of that year, the British overwhelmed Tewodros’s army at the fortress of Maqdala. In a scene worthy of the climax of a Verdi opera, Tewodros committed suicide with one of the pistols from Queen Victoria.

Tewodros was unquestionably a tragic victim of British imperial might

With Tewodros dead, the British withdrew. The troops went back to India. The freed hostages went home. The railways that had been built to carry military equipment up from the Red Sea coast was pulled up. The Maqdala treasures, along with Tewodros’s son, were taken to Britain. The prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, told MPs that “We are about to vacate the country in a manner which will prove to the world the purity of our purpose.”

The Abyssinia war is an unusual episode in the British imperial story. It was not a war of plunder, of imperial rivalry or annexation. Politicians at the time thought it was a war about prestige. The British did it because they could. They had the wealth and the weapons; the Ethiopians had neither. Though Tewodros never ruled a stable Abyssinia, his overthrow weakened the fragile state at great human cost. Tewodros was unquestionably a tragic victim of British imperial might.

Abyssinia would be invaded twice more, defeating the Italians in their historic victory at Adowa in 1896, and then being brutally attacked by Mussolini in 1935. Today, Disraeli’s claims of moral purity are not words that anyone would use. And nor should they rule out the return of the Maqdala treasures.

1,ethiopia,"UN Migration Agency Appeals for USD 88.5 million for Response to Ethiopian Crisis

IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has launched an appeal for USD 88,550,000 to help people in need of humanitarian assistance in Ethiopia. The appeal covers IOM’s activities under the humanitarian community and Government’s Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP), IOM’s assistance to Ethiopian migrant returnees from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and humanitarian support to refugees from neighbouring countries.

IOM’s appeal aims to support some of the 1.7 million Ethiopians displaced throughout the country, identified by IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Approximately 1.1 million people are displaced due to conflict, 857,000 of whom were displaced near the borders of the Oromia and Somalia Regions over the past year, and over 500,000 people due to climatic shocks. In addition, 47,600 Ethiopian migrant returnees and 87,000 South Sudanese and Somali refugees are planned to be reached with support detailed in the appeal. Under this appeal, IOM will also support empowerment of young people and the strengthening of institutions in Ethiopia working on counter trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.

“We need to rethink the way we work in countries like Ethiopia,” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM Director of Operations and Emergencies at the Organization’s headquarters in Geneva. “We want this appeal to mark the end of the “Band-Aid approach” and the start of longer term thinking. Millions of people are in dire need of our urgent support in Ethiopia, but we hope that the life-saving sustainable measures we put in place this year will mean that by next year more communities will be resilient to climate stresses like drought,” said Abdiker.

Ethiopia has had a fast-growing non-oil-related economy with double digit growth sustained over a decade. It has experienced massive investment in infrastructure and industry. However, in 2016, the worst El Niño induced drought in 50 years forced more than 10 million people to become depend on relief food assistance, while also eroding household and community resilience and increasing vulnerability nationwide. Last year, rains failed again, and, in south and south-eastern Ethiopia, 8.5 million Ethiopians were left in need of relief food assistance.

The 2018 Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan released by the Government of Ethiopia National Disaster Risk Management Commission and the UN Humanitarian Coordinator shows that this year 16.4 million people will need humanitarian assistance throughout the country.

Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians leave home to seek employment in the Gulf countries, most often KSA. On 29 March 2017, KSA issued a Note Verbal declaring that all irregular migrants should voluntarily leave the country, among them an estimated 500,000 Ethiopians. To date more than 140,000 Ethiopians have returned. Many returnees come back to little and the push factors that encouraged them to leave in the first place are still present. IOM’s appeal covers reintegration support, which is vital for returnees to sustain their livelihood.

Ethiopia remains the second largest refugee-hosting country in Africa hosting over 909,000 refugees. Of these registered refugees, more than 428,928 are South Sudanese and 254,274 are Somali.

Transportation of newly arrived refugees from border entry points to the refugee camps remains a critical to ensure that they can access aid. Shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and livelihood support in the context of the Comprehensive Refuge Response Framework (CRRF) remains critically under-funded and are included in IOM’s current appeal.

“Ethiopia has bravely endured these difficult situations but to sustain its growing economy, it needs urgent support from the global community,” said Maureen Achieng, IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission and Representative to the African Union (AU), United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

2,ethiopia,"Democracy, Human Rights and Diaspora Groups Urge Congress to Pass H. Res. 128 on Ethiopia



Ethiopia is at a crossroads. On Monday, April 2, a new Prime Minister, selected from within the ruling coalition, delivered a speech about planned reforms while the country was under another State of Emergency. At such a juncture, amid mounting pressures, the role of the US, Ethiopia’s longstanding international ally to encourage critically-needed reforms and human rights protections, should not be underestimated in urging the country toward a new era of stability.

The undersigned human rights and diaspora groups fully support the passage of House Resolution 128 for the positive contribution it can make toward respecting basic human rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia. The resolution has strong bipartisan support and more than 100 co-sponsors. In addition, H. Res. 128 has significant grassroots support among constituents across the US who have ties to Ethiopia. It calls on the government of Ethiopia to open up civic space, ensure accountability for human rights abuses and promote inclusive governance.

For the past three years, Ethiopia has faced largely peaceful and sustained protests in the Oromia and Amhara regions of the country. These protests were led by youth seeking opportunity, political reform and more participatory development strategies. The government responded with excessive force. More than a thousand protesters have been killed by Ethiopian security forces, a greater number injured, tens of thousands imprisoned and many tortured for expressing grievances. Over a million, mostly from Oromia, were uprooted due to government-instigated conflict in the Eastern part of the country.

However, a combination of forces has accumulated in support of the protesters – diaspora groups and international human rights organizations helped publicize the protest movement in Ethiopia and the government’s violent response; the US Congress rallied behind H. Res. 128; international news outlets gave frequent coverage of the protests. At the dawn of this new year, the EPRDF coalition announced reforms and some changes began to occur. Close to 7000 political prisoners were released in January and February of 2018, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped down within days, and Dr. Abiy Ahmed, a man with ties to the region most impacted by the protests, was put forward by the coalition as Ethiopia’s newest prime minister.

In light of these beginnings, now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States Congress take a stand that reiterates the need for Ethiopia to take further steps in a democratic direction by passing H. Res. 128. Ethiopia’s previous transfers of power indicate that leadership change is often followed by unfulfilled promises, a culling of opponents and power consolidation. If Prime Minister Abiy is truly committed to breaking that pattern, this resolution will encourage Ethiopia to lift the State of Emergency, ensuring freedoms of expression and assembly and opening up democratic space, all prerequisites for political and economic reform.

1) H. Res. 128 is a signal of support for the youth in the country who have organized to peacefully demand justice and democracy and have paid a terrible price in terms of loss of life, injury and arbitrary detention. Accountability for the human rights violations that have occurred over the last 3 years will be an essential step towards genuine reconciliation and is a key demand from the protesters.

2) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that could strengthen the hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis less responsive segments within the EPRDF party coalition structure, requiring negotiation with the forces that control the country’s security apparatus, intelligence and the economic sectors.

3) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the State Department and USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy to support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia.

4) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury to apply appropriate sanctions on individuals and organizations responsible for gross human rights.

We support passage of H. Res. 128 as a means to send a strong, unambiguous signal that the United States Congress requires concrete reforms. Such reforms are needed to create a path toward improved respect and protection of human and civil rights, political stability and sustainable regional security.

We urge members of the House to pass the resolution.

3,ethiopia,"The United States Congress will finally vote on a human rights resolution against the Ethiopian government today as announced by a Congressman deeply involved in the process.

Rep. Mike Coffman who represents Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District tweeted last week that the House Resolution 128 will be on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 10.

He had in March tweeted about how passing the resolution will mean: “The fight for respect of human rights & inclusive governance in Ethiopia continues.”

What is the H. Res. 128 about?

H. Res. 128 is a human rights centered move with strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, it has as many as 71 cosponsors.

The resolution passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously in late July 2017 and was scheduled for a vote by the full House on October 2. That vote was, however, postponed ostensibly after a protest and threat by Addis Ababa to withdraw counter-terrorism cooperation.

One of its authors, Republican Congressman Chris Smith said during the committee mark-up, the resolution is like a mirror held up to the government of Ethiopia, and it is intended to encourage them to recognize how others see them and move forward with reforms.

HRW and advocacy groups back H. Res. 128

Human Rights Watch (HRW) and a network of advocacy groups based in the U.S. have tasked the Congress to vote for the resolution to send a signal to the government that respect for and opening the political space was non-negotiable. Some of the reasons they advanced included:

1) H. Res. 128 is a signal of support for the youth in the country who have organized to peacefully demand justice and democracy and have paid a terrible price in terms of loss of life, injury and arbitrary detention. Accountability for the human rights violations that have occurred over the last 3 years will be an essential step towards genuine reconciliation and is a key demand from the protesters.

2) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that could strengthen the hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis less responsive segments within the EPRDF party coalition structure, requiring negotiation with the forces that control the country’s security apparatus, intelligence and the economic sectors.

3) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the State Department and USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy to support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia.

4) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury to apply appropriate sanctions on individuals and organizations responsible for gross human rights.

In October 2017, a pro-democracy group, Freedom House, accused Ethiopia of literally blackmailing the U.S. Congress with a threat to withhold counter-terrorism cooperation if the vote went ahead.

Freedom House quoted Congressman Mike Coffman as confirming that Ethiopia’s ambassador in Washington has said the country will “stop counter-terrorism cooperation with the United States if Congress went ahead with a planned vote on a resolution calling for human rights protections and inclusive governance in the country (H. Res. 128).”

But the turn of events, with the vote scheduled to go ahead means that the Congress had ‘thrown out’ the threat from Addis Ababa.

Freedom House’s statement dated October 16, 2017 was titled “U.S. Congress Should Call Ethiopia’s Bluff,” with its Senior Program Officer for Africa, Joseph Badwaza, egging Congress to proceed with its efforts and discard the Ethiopian government’s “bullying tactics.”

“Passing H. Res. 128 would send a powerful message to Addis Ababa to get serious about undertaking reforms, and the Ethiopian government’s bullying tactics should not derail it. Members of Congress should call the bluff, place the resolution back on the House agenda, and approve it.

“Experience shows that Ethiopia would never follow through on the threat to halt security cooperation. The government fully understands who would be the ultimate loser if it did,” Freedom House said.",Ethiopia govt faces hard-hitting U.S. Congress resolution 128 vote,http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/10/ethiopia-govt-faces-hard-hitting-us-congress-resolution-128-vote/
4,ethiopia,"International rights group, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says as a matter of urgency, the Kenyan government must speak on the political and security ongoings in neighbouring Ethiopia.

According to HRW, Kenya especially and the entire East Africa region needed to encourage Ethiopia to undertake needed reforms and to halt its continued descent into chaos.

A March 24, 2018 statement ‘Why is Kenya’s Government Silent on Ethiopia Crackdown’ released by the group’s Senior Researcher for the Horn of Africa, Felix Horne read in part: “… Kenyan leaders should publicly voice their concern over the increased military aggression that causes Ethiopians to flee into Kenya. Kenya, and East Africa more broadly, need a stable and prosperous Ethiopia.

“Adding the voice of a trusted ally like Kenya to the many tens of millions of Ethiopians demanding change will be an important contribution toward stability in the region.”

HRW also stressed that on the humanitarian scale, Kenya stands to suffer if the situation in Ethiopia degenerates any further. With family ties connecting people on both sides of their common border, Ethiopians are likely to continue fleeing into Kenya.

“Over eight million Ethiopians are in need of food aid. Many of them live in southern Ethiopia, close to the Kenyan border. If conflict in Ethiopia increases, many of its most vulnerable citizens will be looking for safety.

“Kinship connections, established trafficking routes, and relatively stable security all make Kenya an attractive destination,” the statement added.

Over the last weeks, thousands of Ethiopians living in the border town of Moyale fled their homes into Kenya’s Marsabit County after a failed military operation by the army led to the deaths of nine people and injuries to others.

Confirming the incident, the Minister of Defense, admitted that the army had acted on failed intelligence as it sought to intercept members of a banned group – the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) – who were reportedly trying to enter the country.

HRW also reiterated how Ethiopian forces have in the past entered Kenya and perpetuated rights abuses in the name of counter-terrorism operations. They also accused the Kenyan authorities in part of complicity in helping Ethiopia arrest Ethiopians who had fled in Kenya.

“Ethiopia’s intolerance of dissent has also been exported across the border in the past. For years, Ethiopian intelligence officials, sometimes in cooperation with Kenyan police, have harassed, threatened, and on occasion kidnapped Ethiopian asylum seekers in Nairobi and elsewhere in Kenya,” the statement added.

The country is currently under martial law, after a state of emergency was declared in February 16 – a day after the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. The ruling coalition is meeting to elect his successor.",Ethiopia crisis: Kenya must abandon indifference and speak up - HRW,http://www.africanews.com/2018/03/24/kenya-must-not-be-indifferent-over-ethiopia-crackdown-hrw-warns/
5,ethiopia,"Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali was sworn-in as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia on April 2, 2018. He will succeed Hailemariam Desalegn who resigned in the midst of a heightened political crisis in Feb. 2018 after five and a half years at the helm.

The seemingly peaceful power transfer in Addis Ababa is a welcome gesture, but it betrays the ongoing struggle the country has had to endure for the last three years, including the current six-month state of emergency. A highly coordinated media censorship has ensured that only a fraction of what is happening in Africa’s second most populous country is visible. As Abiy Ahmed takes over Ethiopia’s most powerful constitutional office, he has the responsibility of lifting the lid on media censorship, if the opportunity for reforms is to take root outside Addis Ababa.

To be sure, the new prime minister has an overflowing to-do list. Lifting the state of emergency is widely seen by a broad range of Ethiopians and human rights groups as a top priority and signal of progress. However, recent trends by the Command Post, the bureau responsible for managing the state of emergency, may be eroding the high hopes the population has in this rare political opportunity. After the much-publicized release of political prisoners in mid-February, the Command Post re-arrested 29 journalists and lecturers, among them Eskinder Nega, the celebrated winner of 2012 PEN award.

In the Southern Oromia region, thousands of Ethiopians have been displaced, with some crossing over to Kenya’s northern region, to escape the military violence unleashed by the Command Post. The economy, the one sector the government has harped on to cover up for closed political space, has suffered heavy losses, thanks in large part to an unpredictable business environment and cost of doing business. The political questions of uniting the country, jump-starting the economy, and responding to the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia are all competing priorities deserving immediate attention.

However, a yarn connecting all the above is the media blockage. Only the capital city has had access to the Internet since mid-December after the government imposed a blanket shutdown for regional states. Independent media is almost non-existent after the Meles Zenawi-led government closed them down during and after the controversial 2005 election. The subsequent arrest of journalists and opposition leaders saw a mass exodus of public intellectuals to safer grounds. There is currently no independent newspaper compared to more than ten in 2005, less than ten radio stations and only one internet service provider fully owned by the government. The media vacuum created by the events of 2005 onwards limited civil and political space considerably.

Only Addis Ababa, the green spot, has had reliable Internet conection since mid-December 2017, with some areas having no connection whatsoever.

The diaspora community attempted to fill the media vacuum in Ethiopia using satellite radio, television and internet platforms. Successful examples include Ethiopia Satellite TV and Oromia Media Network, which attract millions of followers. No keen observer of Ethiopian politics can doubt the central role Oromia Media played in broadcasting the popular protests and civil disobedience happening in isolated towns, effectively shaping the political narrative both inside Ethiopia and in the diaspora.

As Internet penetration grew, so did the salience of these platforms, a reality never lost on the government. Internet shutdowns, website censorship, and targeted surveillance were meant to limit their audience. For example, OMN and ESAT websites are permanently blocked in Ethiopia, and accessing them is prohibited by law while their satellite TV signals are occasionally jammed.

Communication patterns can proxy for underlying political developments, as this Ethiopian web-search traffic report illustrates. (Google Traffic Transparency Report)

The trend above illustrates the turbulent state of internet connectivity in Ethiopia. Point (a) shows two short-lived deeps which were the shutdowns during 2016 national exams, (b) is a longer and wider deep which starts off during the state of emergency in Oct. 2016, (c) is the 2017 national exams when the government ordered a total national blackout, (d) illustrates a return to active protests and online activity after the state of emergency was lifted, and (e) points to the shutdown that started mid-Dec. 2017 targeting all regions in the country except the capital, Addis Ababa. A second state of emergency was declared in Feb. 2018, and as the chart illustrates, the country is still under an internet shutdown. In summary, Ethiopia’s internet connectivity has never recovered since Nov. 2015 when the protests started in earnest.

Yet, it is because of the relentless efforts by Ethiopians to innovate and adapt the internet to local offline resistance networks that political power is shifting from the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front to Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organization.

Three things, I propose, make the opening, not closing, of the internet across the country central to Abiy’s political success. One, it will act as a litmus test on where he is located principally as a political reformer. Any indecision on an issue as unjustifiable as a blanket internet shut down for 90% of the country will portray him as an opportunist who rode to the high office on the blood, jail terms, and ingenuity of internet warriors only to lock them out while in power. Addis Ababa alone cannot sustain the popular narrative of change.

Two, the economic costs of media censorship have been demonstrated to cripple economies, especially when this happens for an extended period of time. An internet blackout costs an economy like Ethiopia’s an estimated $1 million a day. An open internet is a necessity to jump-start the limping economy after three years of uncertainty.

Three, an open independent media allows for fair coverage of the country, setting realistic expectations, as opposed to the ‘development’ rhetoric churned out as propaganda and regurgitated by uncritical international media. This ‘public relations’ type of media coverage sets impossible standards that sees the government harshly covering up the human rights costs of the ‘fastest growing economy’ narrative, only for the suppression to boil over, as happened with the protests. It makes governance easier when attention is on fixing what is broken rather than maintaining expensive PR firms in global metropolises for the myopic focus on ‘foreign’ investors.

Prime minister Abiy Ahmed, himself a computer engineer, knows that switching the internet back on in the country is not only expected of any modern nation but is a direct boost to his economic plans. Abiy is a benefactor of the human rights space created by the internet, ironically having set up and directed the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), an agency notorious for cyber surveillance and website censorship.

Any delay may be interpreted as a continuation of the old ways and may foment the next wave of resistance. Should this opportunity be squandered, the benefit of the doubt the protestors gave to the political class in 2018 may no longer be an option.

6,ethiopia,"An Ethiopian lawyer and lecturer with the Keele University in the United Kingdom says the re-arrest of journalists and politicians back home is a sign that the government was clueless about how to exit the current political crisis.

RFI

Awol Allo in an interview with Radio France International () held that the development which took place over the weekend was, however, not a surprise to most watchers of Ethiopian politics over the past few years.

He said for the government to order the fresh detention of these people was a sign that it lacked the ideas to steer the country away from the current crisis. Ethiopia is without a substantive Prime Minister and is currently under a six-month state of emergency imposed on February 16.

“… the fact that this is happening at a time that we have a state of emergency and these are highly popular individuals, very high profile politicians re-arrested again says very clearly (I think) to everyone that is watching that the government has no clear vision, clear policy to get out of the current crisis,” he said.

And they are taking such a long long time to appoint a new Prime Minister shows very clearly that the former Prime Minister wasn't really in control at the time and that there were other people who call the shots behind the scene.

About a dozen politicians and journalists were arrested during a gathering in the town of Bahir Dar in the Amhara regional state. A lawyer associated with some of them said they were held for displaying a banned national flag and meeting without permit contrary to state of emergency rules.

According to Allo, the conflicting and contradictory signals sent by the regime all but lacked logic given the basis for the release of the re-arrested group and the incidents that followed their release.

Commenting on the lack of a Prime Minsiter, he said it was indicative of the fact that outgoing Hailemariam Desalegn was not in control over the last five years. “The fact that the ruling establishment didn’t care much about the resignation of the Prime Minister, he added.

7,ethiopia,"Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed travelled on Saturday to a region where clashes have displaced nearly a million people, his first trip since being sworn in as premier five days ago.

Violence along the border of the Horn of Africa country’s Somali and Oromia provinces first erupted in September last year, with both regions blaming the other for the unrest.

The area has been plagued by sporadic clashes for decades. A referendum held in 2004 to determine the status of disputed settlements failed to ease tensions.

This has been a tragedy that should never have taken place.

Since September, officials in Oromia have repeatedly blamed raids by a paramilitary force from the Somali region as causes of the violence. The Somali region denies those claims and says its residents have been unjustly targeted in attacks.

On Saturday, Abiy arrived in Jijiga – the capital of the Somali region – in a bid to tackle the problems.

“This has been a tragedy that should never have taken place,” the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted him as saying in a speech. The report said he pledged “to find sustainable solutions within a very short time” and provide support to those displaced.

The ruling EPRDF coalition picked Abiy last month to replace Hailemariam Desalegn, who quit to clear the way for reforms in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous nation which has been racked by violence for the last three years.

Hundreds have been killed by security forces in Oromia, the violence triggered by land rights but largely fuelled by a sense of political and economic marginalisation among the young.

After taking the oath of office, the former army lieutenant colonel struck a conciliatory tone and addressed the need for ethnic unity. Since January Addis Ababa has released thousands of prisoners that included dissidents and journalists in a bid to calm discontent.

On Friday, it also shut down a detention facility known as “Makelawi”, where rights groups have alleged that torture has taken place. The government plans to turn it into a museum.

The government has often been accused by rights groups of regularly using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms.

Protests in Ethiopia are the culmination of a long-simmering series of grievances and demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity.

After 3 years of relentless protests, Ethiopia started 2018 with rare good news. On January 3, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and his party pledged to release political prisoners and shut down the notorious Maekelawi detention center in Addis Ababa. In a 3-hour-long press conference, leaders of the ruling Ethiopian People‘s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) also took responsibility for the myriad of political challenges facing the country. The aim, EPRDF leaders said, was to foster national reconciliation and to widen democratic space. The announcement was roundly welcomed, including by a leery opposition, as a crucial step in the right direction.

A series of mixed signals followed. More than 6,000 political prisoners, including key opposition figures, journalists, and leaders of the country’s Muslim community, were released from prison. Not long after, on February 15, Hailemariam resigned saying he wanted to pave the way for reforms. It appeared that Africa’s second most populous nation was truly poised to turn a page on its repressive past. Not a day later, however, on February 16, authorities imposed a sweeping 6-month-long state of emergency. The decree was ratified by the EPRDF-controlled Parliament in a disputed vote on March 2.

More than 60 casualties have been reported since the state of emergency came into effect. In southern Ethiopia, thousands have fled violence and sought shelter and urgent humanitarian assistance in Kenya. The latest displacement is in addition to the more than 1.2 million people internally displaced, most of them in 2017, by a tit-for-tat border conflict between Oromia and Somali States, two of the largest of Ethiopia‘s nine linguistically based regional states. The humanitarian, security, and political crises are the most serious facing Ethiopia since 1991, when the communist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown.

To tackle these and other challenges, the 36-member executive leadership of the EPRDF held a series of high-stakes meetings. While they agree there is a problem, they are divided over how to respond to growing public pressure and ethnic discord. As a result, once a unified vanguard party, the EPRDF is now riven by a bitter power struggle. The heightened jostling for control of the party’s policy direction has brought to the fore long-suppressed questions of inequity in the EPRDF.

How Did Ethiopia Get to This Point?

To understand the current state of flux in Ethiopia, consider the EPRDF’s history. Founded in 1989, the EPRDF is, in theory, a coalition of four ethnically based political organizations: the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM).

At the time of the EPRDF’s founding, Mengistu Haile Mariam’s communist regime was on its last leg. The Cold War was coming to an end. Having set its sights on political power in Addis Ababa, the TPLF, which had led the armed insurgency against Mengistu, needed partners to cross into the vast region south of its base in northern Ethiopia. So it orchestrated the creation of the ANDM, the OPDO, and later the SEPDM.

Once the EPRDF came to power, a multinational federation, which promised self-determination for every nation, nationality, and people in Ethiopia, was forged as a compromise between ethnonationalists and unionists who favored a centralized Ethiopian polity. This approach, explicitly organizing the Ethiopian state along ethnic lines, was a stark departure from the emphasis on a single Ethiopian national identity promoted by the Mengistu regime and Emperor Haile Selassie before it. The 1995 Constitution called for decentralization and a significant degree of self-rule for states, promises that remained largely on paper.

From the beginning, the EPRDF proved to be a coalition of unequal partners. For example, each member party has 45 representatives in the powerful 180-member EPRDF Council, even though ethnic Tigrayans constitute just 6 percent of the country’s population. Moreover, the TPLF enjoys absolute control of the military and the security establishment as well as key economic sectors. The TPLF also controlled the office of Prime Minister until 2012, and the Foreign Ministry until 2015.

The power imbalance gave rise to charges of undue Tigrayan influence over the country’s political life. TPLF leaders vacillated between acknowledgement and entitlement, given the party’s outsized role in liberating Ethiopia from the tyranny of the Mengistu regime. The ascendancy of the minority Tigrayans displaced from power the more populous Amhara, who had played the dominant role in Ethiopian political life for most of the previous century.

This Tigrayan dominance was further fortified through strict party discipline known as democratic centralism, which encouraged constituent parties to engage in vigorous internal deliberations but mandated all to adhere to the ruling party’s policy direction once a vote was taken. Moreover, as EPRDF leaders have acknowledged, the TPLF maintained covert influence inside the EPRDF by propping up and empowering loyalists. These grievances gradually gave way to growing resentment against the TPLF and, more recently, ethnic Tigrayans.

The Context of Ongoing Protests

The Ethiopian protests are the culmination of a long-building series of grievances. After the disputed 2005 elections in which the EPRDF resorted to brutal violence to maintain power, the party embarked on a developmental state model, characterized by active state intervention in the economy as a way to boost its political legitimacy. But this effort was accompanied by a heightened muzzling of critics and the media as well as controlling access to information. It also meant the institutionalization of the instruments of repression.

While the EPRDF faced some level of opposition at every turn in its 25-year rule, the floodgates opened in 2014 when the Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, began protesting against the government’s land policy. The protests coalesced around a single Oromo axiom: “The matter of land is the matter of life.” The specific trigger was an urban master plan, which sought to expand Addis Ababa’s physical boundaries deep into the surrounding Oromia State. Surprisingly, the first sign of resistance came from within the OPDO, a one-time docile party seen among the Oromo as the TPLF’s puppet.

The EPRDF seemed to be caught off guard by the scale of the protests. Security forces responded to largely peaceful protests using disproportionate force. This engendered more outrage and protests. Many dozens of people were killed and thousands arrested.

Protests briefly subsided ahead of the May 2015 national elections, in which the EPRDF and its partners claimed 100 percent of the seats in Parliament. However, Oromo protests returned when authorities attempted to forge ahead with the Addis Ababa expansion plan. A massive security dragnet ensued, leading to the deaths of even more people and the arrest of tens of thousands. By then, the initial opposition to the “land grab” and concerns over the dispossession of Oromo farmers from Addis Ababa had grown to include protesting historic Oromo marginalization, the lack of freedom and economic opportunities, and demanding the release of political prisoners.

Under pressure, authorities shelved the urban master plan and made other cosmetic changes, including a cabinet reshuffle, which saw Tigrayans ceding control of the Foreign Ministry. But EPRDF leaders left popular demands for greater democratic rights, equal economic opportunities, and state autonomy virtually untouched.

In October 2016, the protests were curbed with the declaration of a state of emergency. When martial law was lifted 10 months later, the protests returned evermore vigorously. Crucially, the protests had by then spread to other regions, particularly Amhara State and a number of localities in the southern region.

Some of the grievances were localized but the overarching theme was the same: the gap between constitutional guarantees for democracy versus the existing centralized state and authoritarian party that controlled all aspects of life. For example, in Wolkait, an administrative district in Tigray State, ethnic Amharas wanted to be part of the Amhara State and send their children to school in Amharic. A two-decade effort to settle the matter through legal and political means was repeatedly frustrated. Those frustrations fed into wider resentment over Tigrayan hegemony.

In Oromia, the epicenter of the opposition, the OPDO faced a legitimacy crisis. It was buckling under the weight of protests and accusations of corruption and incompetence from other EPRDF partners. This pressure helped bring to power a new generation of OPDO party cadres who were not wedded to the legacy of armed struggle. They made bold overtures to Oromo nationalism and embraced most of the protesters’ grievances, vowing to reform their party and the EPRDF to address the Oromo question or to join the protesters if their reform efforts failed.

As the OPDO positioned itself as a quasi-opposition party, the TPLF was also trying to clean its own house. Facing inevitable decline and waning influence, the TPLF held a 35-day-long evaluation session in October 2017 that culminated in demotions of top party officials and a rare public display of self-criticism.

It is against this backdrop that EPRDF leaders, in large part to meet the OPDO’s demands, agreed to free political prisoners in January 2018. The freed prisoners were welcomed by a groundswell of public support and homecoming celebrations.

It is also important to recognize the leading role that youth, having come of age under the EPRDF’s one-party rule, have played in the protests. This underscores the major demographic transformations that have accompanied the calls for change. Ethiopia had an estimated total population of 52 million in 1990. It is now projected to be over 105 million with more than 70 percent of the population under the age of 30. Simultaneous to this was a rural-to-urban migration of young people. However, the pace of local job creation has not matched the number of college graduates. The influx in mobile phone usage and improved access to communications technology, meanwhile, means that this generation is far more connected to one another and to the outside world than any before it. These factors have all contributed to the resiliency of the protests.

The Way Forward

The EPRDF and, indeed, Ethiopia are at a crossroads. Resilient demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity indicate that the status quo is untenable. Reliance on military and security measures to quell opposition have proven futile. The EPRDF’s diagnosis of the problem in January was largely correct: the answer to Ethiopia’s malaise is greater democratic space and national reconciliation. This will require vacating the emergency decree, which has proven counterproductive to the party’s stated reform plans. It will also be necessary to address the root problems: the inequity within the governing coalition and the need for legitimacy.

A priority for reestablishing stability, therefore, should be to engage opposition parties in good faith negotiations setting forth a path for genuine popular dialogue and reconciliation. This process would entail freeing all political prisoners and setting in motion legal and political reforms to undo some of the most coercive measures that have brought the party and country to the precipice of collapse. These reforms would include the repeal of the Freedom of the Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation, the Charities and Societies Proclamation, and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. These sweeping pieces of legislation have been used to curtail opposition activities, muzzle independent journalists, and silence government critics.

Through heavy state involvement in the economy, Ethiopia has registered modest growth over the last decade. Events of the last several years illustrate that this authoritarian developmental model has backfired and is coming to a dead end. Continued efforts to subdue an increasingly restive population through repressive measures now risk unraveling the economy and the country‘s fragile federation.

It is remarkable that despite the mounting grievances, the protests have largely remained peaceful. This suggests the crisis can be resolved without widespread instability. However, the continued tug-of-war between protesters and the security sector is testing public patience. It will also embolden those who insist on armed rebellion as the only way to bring about change—a quintessential story for Ethiopia, which in its long history has never had a peaceful transfer of power.

All parties committed to Ethiopia’s stability should emphasize that only genuine dialogue and reform can avert a further deterioration.

• The Government of Ethiopia and the UN presented the 2018 humanitarian and disaster resilience plan (HDRP) to member states.

• The HDRP seeks at least $1.6 billion to provide emergency and long-term assistance for 7.88 million people affected by drought, floods and conflict.

Gov’t and UN brief Member States on Ethiopia humanitarian situation

On 21 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and the UN presented the 2018 humanitarian and disaster resilience plan (HDRP) to member states in Geneva. The HDRP seeks US$1.6 billion to provide emergency and long-term assistance for 7.88 million people affected by drought, floods and conflict with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with non-food assistance. According to the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Ethiopia Mrs. Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, all the needs to be addressed through the HDRP are immediate, and acute and massive.

Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator. Ms. Ursula Mueller who chaired the briefing reaffirmed the Secretary-General’s remarks at the High-Level event held in Addis Ababa in January 2017 that ‘Solidarity is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of justice and self-interest.’ The ASG reminded member states of the need for early action as the alarm bells are ringing by the end of March. “Today, the World Food Program’s ability to cover the emergency food needs of 1.8 million people in the Somali Region is in peril. Some $50 million is required to cover the costs of two rounds of emergency food assistance for those affected by drought – and, increasingly – conflict along the Oromia-Somali regional border. Supplies to treat moderate acute malnutrition are also at risk should timely and adequate funding not be secured.” The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

Government and partners re-activate DRM Gender working Group

Following the decision by the National Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group (DRMTWG) to re-activate the DRM Gender Working Group (DRMGWG), the DRMGWG held its first meeting on 20 March 2018. The group discussed and agreed on producing a draft action plan by 28 March 2018 that will help to facilitate, coordinate and advocate for gender mainstreaming throughout the entire humanitarian program cycle. The working group will support humanitarian actors to develop tools and systems for implementing gender dimensions while addressing the humanitarian needs of some 7.88 million people, including 1.2 million conflict-induced IDPs and close to 500,000 climate induced IDPs- most of whom are women and children. The group will work to ensure that the concerns of women and children are considered as an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs in the humanitarian sector.

According to Hassan Khannenje, the current state of affairs was just a matter of time after decades of iron fist rule by the Ethiopia Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

Speaking on a political talk show hosted by NTV Kenya channel he stressed that Ethiopia was nearing the end of authoritarian rule. “I don’t see the current Ethiopian crisis as the beginning of democracy (actually) I see it as the beginning of the end of autocracy.

Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state.

“Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state,” he stressed.

He averred that in the absence of a substantive head of government, i.e. a Prime Minister, the country was confused, adding that the state of emergency did not help matters because it is often used to repress opposition groups.

“And this is a culmination of many years of autocracy and authoritarianism. Now, in the absence of the Prime Minister at the moment or at least the state control of power in certain places, a lot of time the opposition tends to suffer, it gets scapegoated, it gets repressed.

“… the Oromo being the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and having been resistant to the status quo for many years, of course they are going kto get the first flak. Now, Kenya had seen this coming and we cannot pretend we were unaware of the goings on in Ethiopia.

Kenya until recently had not actively waded into the Ethiopian situation. The recent influx of thousands of refugees following a botched military operation in the border town of Moyale has forced the media to discuss Ethiopia.

“This was bound to happen sooner or later and what I am hoping is our Minister of Foreign Affairs or Interior have a moral bust approach both diplomatically with Ethiopia to make sure that thing does not overflow.

“But also to use its influence on the current rulers within at least on the Ethiopian circles, at least, to try and calm things down. Today Ethiopia needs help.

11,ethiopia,"Country Overview

Background

Ethiopia has a long standing history of hosting refugees.

The country maintains an open door policy for refugee inflows into the country and allows humanitarian access and protection to those seeking asylum on its territory. In 2004, a national Refugee Proclamation was enacted based on the international and regional refugee conventions to which Ethiopia is a party (1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and its 1967 Protocol and the 1969 OAU Convention). Refugee protection in the country is provided within the framework of these international and national refugee laws as well as the core international human rights treaties that have been ratified by the country.

Continued insecurity within neighbouring states has resulted in sustained refugee movements, either directly as a result of internal conflict and human rights abuses or as a result of conflict related to completion for scare natural resources and drought related food insecurity.

Eritreans, South Sudanese, Sudanese, Yemenis and Somalis originating from South and Central Somalia are recognized as prima facie refugees. Nationals from other countries undergo individual refugee status determination. The refugee flow to Ethiopia continued during 2017, with 109, 851 persons seeking safety and protection within the country’s borders. At the start of 2018, the nation hosted 892,555 thousand refugees who were forced to flee their homes as a result of insecurity, political instability, military conscription, conflict, famine and other problems in their countries of origin. Ethiopia is one of the largest refugee asylum countries world-wide, and the second largest in Africa, reflecting the ongoing fragility and conflict in the region.

Ethiopia provides protection to refugees from some 19 countries. Among the principal factors leading to this situation are predominantly the conflict in South Sudan, ongoing political instability in Eritrea, together with conflict and draught in Somalia.

The majority of refugees in Ethiopia are located in Tigray Regional State and the four Emerging Regions of Ethiopia: Afar Regional State; Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State; Gambella Regional State; and the Somali Regional State. The Emerging Regions are the least developed regions in the country, characterized by harsh weather conditions, poor infrastructure, low administrative capacity, a high level of poverty and poor development indicators. The arid environment in Afar and Somali regions and the small and scattered nomadic populations make it more challenging to provide services. Many parts of the four regions are inaccessible with poor or no roads.

The South Sudanese are the largest refugee population in Ethiopia, totalling 421,867 persons at the close of 2017. Renewed violence in Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity States; that increasingly impacted border areas, has resulted in 75,447 new arrivals seeking asylum in 2017.

The majority were accommodated through the expansion of Nguenyyiel Camp in the Gambella Region, and in Gure Shembola Camp established in May 2017 in the Beneshangul Gumuz Region. Somalis constitute 28.3 percent of registered refugees, with 6,696 new arrivals during 2017, contributing to a total population of 253,889 individuals. Fleeing generalized instability and a third failed harvest, families were subsequently accommodated across five camps within the Somali region. The Eritrean caseload comprised 164,668 individuals at the end of the year, with 25,265 new arrivals received within the Shire and Afar Regions. Ethiopia also hosts an additional caseload of 52,131 individuals drawn from across the wider region; including from Sudan (44,386), Yemen (1,771), and other countries.

While continuing to respond to three concurrent emergencies, and mindful of the fluid socio-political context within the country, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has advocated for stable humanitarian financing, while promoting wider investments in refugees’ selfreliance through an improved and sustainable response that goes beyond mere care and maintenance that combines wider support to host communities, furthering peaceful coexistence and the greater inclusion of refugees as part of broad national development plans. In November 2017, the Government formally launched the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) in Ethiopia, effectively paving the way for the implementation of the nine pledges it made at the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees in September 2016 in New York.

Through the pledges, which serve as a vehicle for implementing the CRRF in the country, Ethiopia seeks to: expand its out-of-camp policy; provide work permits to refugees; increase enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education; provide access to irrigable land for crop cultivation; facilitate local integration in instances of protracted displacement; earmark a percentage of jobs within industrial parks to refugees; and provide access to vital events documentation to facilitate increased access to basic and essential social services. The planned amendment to the 2004 Refugee Proclamation, will enable refugees to become more independent, better protected and have greater access to local solutions.

Through the enabling environment created by the CRRF, the Ethiopia Country Refugee Response Plan (ECRRP) envisages improved coordination mechanisms to ensure timely and effective protection and solutions. The collective engagement of the Government and development actors will help to ensure that the needs of refugees are actively considered in the development agenda, and that complementary services are provided to refugees and their host communities. Fulfilling these considerable and measurable government commitments to further its duty of care to refugees, relative to its existing national resource constraints, will inevitably be based on the scale-up of equitable responsibility-sharing between UN Member States.

With continued refugee arrivals, and in light of ongoing verification taking place as part of Level 3 registration throughout the year, it is anticipated that Ethiopia will host 919,134 refugees by the end of 2018, mainly from South Sudan (485,000), Eritrea (131,343) and Somali (231,348). Within a climate of decreasing humanitarian and development financing; that has led to critical shortfalls in food assistance, limited opportunities for third-country resettlement, together with only modest support to youth and a growing population of unaccompanied and separated children, bold financial commitments - for essential humanitarian services and a sustainable solutions-based response - will be needed to harness the CRRF’s transformational agenda.","Ethiopia Country Refugee Response Plan 2018 : The integrated response plan for refugees from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia (January - December 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-country-refugee-response-plan-2018-integrated-response-plan-refugees

Ethiopia is currently under a state of emergency imposed on February 16 this year, a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned his position to allow for political reforms.

The ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) is set to meet to elect his successor. The country is currently under a Command Post administering the state of emergency.

The latest accusation against Eritrea was by the federal police chief who whiles giving a briefing on the state of emergency late last week, reportedly cited Eritrean involvement in the crisis. The Eritrean Information minister dismissed the claims in an email exchange with Bloomberg.

“The regime is desperately trying to deflect attention from its intractable domestic crisis — of its own making — and find external scapegoats,” Yemane Ghebre Meskel said describing the claims as false and one that did not merit a serious response.

The ex-ambassador has been a regular commentator on African politics and has previously spoken about the Ethiopian situation.

“In Ethiopia, instead of an all-parties reconciliation conference, I fear a Middle East type military dictatorship takeover and a zero sum game bloody outcome. USG, do not let it happen,” he said hours after a state of emergency was imposed on February 16.

“While in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Secretary Tillerson should have talks with Ethiopian government about their internal political crisis, and should encourage the regime in power not to fear an opening to transparent democracy,” he tweeted on March 3, 2018.

“Ethiopia regime should withdraw SOE declaration prior to naming OPDO leader Abiy Ahmed as new Prime Minister, thereby avoiding tense vote in Parliament, and setting stage for political reforms,” he tweeted two days earlier.","Ethiopia security crisis self-inflicted, Eritrea innocent – Ex-US Diplomat",http://www.africanews.com/2018/03/20/ethiopia-security-crisis-self-inflicted-eritrea-innocent-ex-us-diplomat/
13,ethiopia,"The grazing regions of Oromia and Somali in southern and eastern Ethiopia have witnessed an escalation in inter-ethnic violence in recent months. Since last September, more than one million people have fled their villages and been displaced to hundreds of reception areas. HI is working to protect the most vulnerable individuals, primarily women and children. Fabrice Vandeputte, HI’s head of mission in Ethiopia, explains the causes of the crisis and how our team is responding.

How did the crisis begin?

For years, ethnic groups have been fighting over natural resources, especially water and pasture land in the regions of Somali and Oromia in southern and eastern Ethiopia. But the conflict has intensified due to long periods of drought and the famines that have followed them. A disagreement over where the border lies between the two regions also recently turned violent, when hundreds of thousands of people from Oromia living in Somali and even in neighboring Somaliland were forcibly removed to Oromia. The Oromia authorities expelled the Somali population in reprisal.

Where are the displaced people living?

More than one million displaced people, mostly women and children, are currently living in 400 reception areas, such as schools and public buildings, but also with families and the like, on a north-south line from the towns of Jigaga to Moyale, on the border between the Somali and Oromia regions. These population movements are putting a lot of pressure on host communities. For example, one woman we met recently has taken in 50 or so members of her close or extended family. You can imagine the day-to-day problems that causes in terms of sanitary facilities, food, and so on.

What are conditions like for displaced people?

They’re exhausted. Think about it: you’re walking down the street, minding your own business, when you’re suddenly surrounded by police who load you onto a vehicle, and transport you hundreds of miles away from your home region. That’s what’s happened to most displaced people. They’ve lost everything they own. A lot of children even get separated from their parents. Many suffer serious psychological distress.

What are NGOs doing?

Unfortunately, very few humanitarian actors are supported by funding bodies or are able to implement emergency programs. NGOs in the field are finding it hard to launch a response because displaced people are spread across lots of different sites, and you have to find them. Organizing aid for people scattered over a large area is not easy.

What is HI doing?

We’ve set up a program to protect women and children. When people are suddenly displaced in large numbers, and forced together in very poor conditions, it leads to tension and violence, and women and children are usually worst affected. There’s also a heightened risk of rape and child trafficking. In Babile and Kersaa, where we work, we’ve formed mobile teams whose job is to spot risky situations and vulnerable individuals and to refer them to the right services, such as health centers, social services, NGOs, and the like. We’re also opening areas for women and children where they can play or get psychosocial support.

How do you think the crisis will develop over the coming months?

Some observers estimate the number of people who could need humanitarian assistance, displaced people and host communities included, at five to seven million. Very few people are paying attention to this crisis and not enough money has been allocated to it. The basic need for water, food, hygiene and facilities are only just being met. The support provided by funding bodies falls short of what’s needed.

That is despite a government decision to bring all 9,000 remaining Falashmura from Ethiopia to Israel — a decision that is dependent on state funds being made available.

Last month, the Knesset passed the 2019 state budget with no allocation for Ethiopian immigration. The immigration and its funding are reportedly slated to be discussed at a future inter-ministerial meeting.

Avi Yalou, an Israeli Ethiopian community activist, said Shafrao wanted to immigrate like the rest of the community still in Ethiopia. He described Shafrao’s treatment as “classic racism” and linked it to the government’s determination to deport asylum-seekers and the lack of visible moves to free Averu Mengistu — a mentally ill Israeli of Ethiopian descent — who has been held by the Gaza terror group Hamas since September 2014.

Posting a photograph on his Facebook page of Shafrao meeting with Shaked, Yalou wrote that the young Ethiopian youth was “apparently Jewish enough for the justice minister to be photographed with him but not Jewish enough to be allowed to immigrate with another 9,000 Jews who are waiting in Addis Ababa to come to Israel.”

He added, “Leave the photos and let our brothers and sisters immigrate to Israel.”

The Falashmura claim links to descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity generations ago and now seek to return to Judaism. The Interior Ministry accepts them as immigrants under the Law of Return, which is less restrictive than religious Jewish law.

In August, the government reiterated that it would bring 9,000 Falashmura to Israel by the end of 2020.

The Knesset in November 2015 had unanimously approved a plan to bring them over following a public campaign launched by the nation’s Ethiopian community and volunteer organizations. At the same time, it announced that it would be the last round of Ethiopian immigration. Many of those waiting to immigrate have family already in Israel. Some have been waiting for 20 years to come to Israel. The live in Gondar and in Addis Ababa.

About 135,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel today. Some 22,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel during Operation Moses in 1984 and Operation Solomon in 1991.

Ethiopia installed new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed this week as Africa’s second most populous nation tries to recover from months of the most serious anti-government protests in a quarter-century. The protests demanding more freedoms began in the Oromia and Amhara regions in late 2015 and spread elsewhere, bringing many businesses and transport networks to a standstill and leading to a state of emergency.

Also on Friday, residents across the restive Oromia region told The Associated Press that internet service had returned after several weeks. Observers have said the government shut down service to control the spread of protest images on social media.

The new prime minister is from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia’s largest, and has vowed to solve “lots of problems.”

On Thursday, 11 journalists, politicians and bloggers who were detained last month for allegedly displaying an outlawed flag and gathering in violation of the latest state of emergency were released.

The closure of the prison “could signal the end of an era of bloody repression in Ethiopia,” Amnesty International researcher Fisseha Tekle said when the plan was first announced. “For years, Maekelawi has essentially functioned as a torture chamber, used by the Ethiopian authorities to brutally interrogate anybody who dares to dissent.”

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

The Government of Ethiopia is appealing for US$1.66 billion to provide support in agriculture and livestock, education, emergency shelter and non-food items (NFI), food, health, nutrition, protection and water, and sanitation and hygiene for 7.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Just under half of the target population are children. The Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) was released on 13 March 2018. While the document focuses on the immediate response requirements for 2018, it also lays out the basis for a three-pillared model that will allow for further planning and development investments, in line with a disaster risk management approach.

On 10 March 2018, a security incident between the Ethiopian Defence Forces in Moyale led to the death of 10 civilians and the injury of several others. The incident led to the displacement of over 10,000 people across the border to Kenya. In Kenya, the Kenyan Red Cross has reported that 80 per cent of the displaced are women and children and that there are about 600 pregnant women among the 10,557 refugees, who are being provided with basic supplies including food and water. These figures are currently being validated by the Kenyan Refugee Affairs Secretariat and UNHCR. On 21 March, the Secretariat of the State of Emergency Command Post stated that the displaced residents of Moyale who fled to Kenya are returning home. The Government of Ethiopia also announced that the State of Emergency inquiry board will investigate the deaths of civilians. A joint mission to assess the humanitarian situation in Moyale town took place from 23 to 26 March. The team, led by UNOCHA, included WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and UNDSS. The team was advised that essential services were disrupted immediately after the security incident; however, essential services are now operational. The team recommended to pre-position humanitarian supplies in order to immediately respond to any future needs.

Ethiopia continues to receive refugees and, as of 28 February 2018, 909,301 refugees were reported in Ethiopia. In the first two months of 2018, 15,097 refugees arrived in Ethiopia, including 7,202 in February. They include more than 10,700 from South Sudan and more than 3,700 from Eritrea.",UNICEF Ethiopia Humanitarian Situation Report #3 – Reporting Period March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/unicef-ethiopia-humanitarian-situation-report-3-reporting-period-march-2018
17,ethiopia,"A pregnant woman has been killed in Ethiopia’s Oromia regional state, the Addis Standard news portal and a leading activist based in the United States reported on Monday. The incident took place in the town of Qobo in Oromia’s East Hararghe Zone.

The Addis Standard cited neighbours of Ayantu Mohammed Sa’idoo, as confirming her death. She was reportedly ‘abducted’ on Sunday evening, killed for unknown reasons and her body dumped this morning.

The deceased, a mother of one, was said to be a trader in ‘khat’ – a narcotic leaf widely used in the area. A military officer believed to be behind the incident, one Chala Ibrahim Bakaree, has since been placed under police custody, the report added.

Another anonymous source told Addis Standard that there is heightened security in the town ahead of Ayantu’s burial on Tuesday. Residents are afraid that possible protests during the funeral could lead to violence.

The portal’s report came hours after a known pro-democracy activists and Chief Executive Officer of U.S.-based Oromia Media Network, Jawar Mohammed, tweeted about the incident.

According to his version of the incident, soldiers had attempted to rape her but shot her after she screamed for help.

Ayantu Mohammed who was killed in Qobo last night eas pregnant. Soldiers attempted to rape her and when screamed for help they shot her in the head and killed her. — Jawar Mohammed (@Jawar_Mohammed) April 9, 2018

Jawar also reported protests over the incident sharing a video on Facebook. It however showed scores of people in what seemed like a peaceful gathering.

The activist has been keeping count of casualties since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was sworn into office a little over a week ago. As at Monday afternoon, his count indicated that five people had been killed under Abiy Ahmed, the first ethnic Oromo to become premier under the ruling EPRDF.

Abiy inherited a country under a six-month state of emergency. The measure was imposed after the resignation of his predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn. Desalegn said his resignation was to pave way for reforms announced in January 2018.

In early moves of the Abiy tenure, internet has been restored across the country and a group of rearrested journalists and detainees have been released. He has also started peace efforts between the Oromia region and Ethiopia-Somali region where clashes claimed hundreds of lives displacing close to a million in 2017.","Ethiopian soldier kills pregnant woman in Oromia, tensions up",http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/09/ethiopian-soldier-kills-pregnant-woman-in-oromia-tensions-up/

Climatic shocks, conflict, insecurity and political instability continue to drive humanitarian need in the Horn of Africa. While food insecurity increased by nearly 24 per cent in 2017, it decreased in the first month of 2018. In Somalia, famine risk declined, but needs remain high, with some 2.7 million severely food insecure people in need of assistance. In Kenya, the number of severely food insecure decreased from 2.6 million in December 2017 to 2.35 million by January 2018. Following the meher assessment in Ethiopia, 7.9 million people are severely food insecure and in need of assistance.

People continued to be displaced by drought and conict. Some 106,000 people were newly displaced in Somalia between 1 January and 28 February due to water shortages and some areas of the country are experiencing stress-induced migration of pastoralist communities in search of water and pasture. In Ethiopia, 47,441 people were displaced between 1 January and 28 February. The number of refugees hosted in the region increased by 11,397 between 1 January and 28 February.

Several disease outbreaks are ongoing in the Horn of Africa. Although the number of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/cholera cases tapered towards the end of 2017 outbreaks of AWD were ongoing in Dire Dawa and Somali regions in Ethiopia, and outbreaks of cholera were ongoing in Tana River, Garissa, Mombasa, Turkana, Siaya, Tharaka Nithi, Meru, Busia and West Pokot counties in Kenya and Banadir, Hiraan and Lower Jubba in Somalia, as at the end of February 2018. In Kenya, 1,476 cholera cases and 29 deaths were reported since January 2018, compared to 4,079 cases in 2017. Measles cases reported in 2018 are on the rise in Ethiopia (552), Kenya (24), and Somalia (2,853).",Horn of Africa Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/horn-africa-region-humanitarian-snapshot-january-february-2018

• The 2018 Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) identifies 7.88 million people in need of food assistance, and 8.49 million people in need of non-food assistance at a cost of $1.658 billion

• Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

• About 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semiurban sites across Oromia region

• 18,000 IDPs receiving vocational training

• In 2017 Fall armyworm infested some 692,963 hectares of land (22.16 per cent of the total maize area in the country) in 417 maize growing woredas/districts causing up to 73 per cent crop losses.

US$1.66 billion required for 7.88 million people in need of humanitarian aid in 2018

On 13 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners launched the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. The HDRP seeks US$1.66 billion to help 7.88 million people with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with nonfood assistance. Out of the $1.66 billion sought for the 2018 response, $1.036 billion is targeted for relief food, $198.3 million for nutrition, $99 million for WaSH needs, 94.9 million for shelter and non-food items, and $74 million for health response. The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

The HDRP is structured around three pillars: (i) Prevention and mitigation, (ii) Preparedness and response, and (iii) National systems strengthening and recovery. The plan represents a first step towards the development of a multi-year planning framework for the response in Ethiopia – with the aim of moving away from short-term response in a context of mainly predictable humanitarian needs. Prior to the launch of HDRP, Government and partners released an ‘Alert’ indicative of target and requirements for 2018 in December 2017.

$242.2 urgently required for top priority needs in the first half of 2018

Prior to the launch to the HRDP launch, and to ensure gaps in funding were being addressed while the HDRP was being finalized, a Humanitarian Prioritization Document for 2018 was released in February. This document indicated that $242.2 million is urgently required to address critical gaps for the coming six months.

The largest share of the immediate priority funding gap is with the nutrition sector, followed by the food and health sectors. The Nutrition Cluster requires $73.4 million by early March to ensure continued quality emergency nutrition response. The Food Cluster requires an immediate $50 million to prevent a food pipeline break for 1.8 million people in the Somali region at the end of March. The Health Cluster requires $9.7 million for urgent re-stocking of primary health care kits for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoae (AWD), severe malnutrition (SAM) management commodities, emergency reproductive health and GBV management kits and the expansion of Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams in IDP-hosting areas.

Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

The IDP Response and Rehabilitation Committee of the Oromia region have mobilized ETB1.7 billion (close to $62 million) from the federal government, private business and the community in the last 6 months to address critical life-saving, resettlement and rehabilitation needs of displaced Oromos. However, critical gaps including access to water in pastoralist areas, schools and health facilities remain high.

During the first phase of the regional resettlement plan, some 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semi-urban sites across Oromia region including in the vicinity of Addis Ababa where construction is nearing completion. As part of the rehabilitation programme, the region is providing vocational training to some 18,000 IDPs. The Federal Government will continue to provide food and non-food items and partners have been encouraged to step in and support the relocated people as they start new life.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 48 | 26 Feb. – 11 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-48-26-feb-11-march-2018
20,ethiopia,"After almost two months of deliberations, the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has finally chosen a new prime minister to replace the much-criticised Hailemariam Desalegn, who had served since taking over in 2012 from the late Meles Zenawi, the EPRDF's long-serving strongman and architect of a federal Ethiopia. Abiy Ahmed, who was inaugurated as prime minister on April 2, inherits a country that has been mired in crisis for almost three years: incessant public protests, escalating ethnic tensions and growing numbers of displaced Ethiopians.

Despite the breathtaking economic growth, the enrolment of millions of youngsters in hundreds of new schools and universities and an increase of more than eight years in life expectancy for an ordinary Ethiopian citizen just in the last decade, the 100 million plus population feels frustrated. For many Africans outside the country, these setbacks have come as a shock: over the past 10 years, Ethiopia has undertaken the continent's most resolute effort at industrialisation and infrastructure expansion, generating hope that other African states may one day do so as well. Restoring order, trust in government and the sense of optimism about Ethiopia's domestic transformation and regional ascendancy is surely Abiy's most pressing challenge.

{articleGUID}

To do so, Ethiopia's new leader must urgently address his biggest problem: the internal fractures in the EPRDF, still widely considered one of Africa's most formidable party machines, but riven with contradictions and personal rivalries that have deepened in recent months.

The protests that undermined the federal state's authority and contributed to Hailemariam's resignation as prime minister were never a simple story of ""the government versus the people"". Instead, both Abiy and his comrades-cum-adversaries know that different factions of the EPRDF have mobilised popular anger in different regions of the country to increase their bargaining strength at the centre in Addis Ababa.

In fact, Abiy's own Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), an ethno-regional party that is one of the four pillars of EPRDF hegemony, has reinvented itself by surfing the waves of long-standing grievances held by the Oromo population about their socioeconomic and political marginalisation. It has instrumentalised legitimate anger flowing from rising inequality amidst the boom in Ethiopia to demand a greater share of power for itself. While Tigrayan security hawks and Amhara politicians gnawed their teeth at so much OPDO audacity and pushed for a state of emergency to crack down on the streets, Abiy's tacit alliance with hardline diaspora activists and sympathisers of the outlawed Oromo Liberation Front has paid dividends. Foreign diplomats have for months been pushing EPRDF officials to quell the surge in demonstrations after widespread strikes in the Oromia region brought economic life to a standstill. Abiy's election as party leader by the EPRDF Council is a recognition that, for now, the political pendulum has shifted in the OPDO's direction.

Although the rise of an Oromo to the pinnacle of governmental authority is a genuinely historic achievement -modern Ethiopia has historically sought to assimilate, including through violence, its more than 80 nations and nationalities into one Orthodox Christian Amhara identity - Abiy's victory might well prove Pyrrhic. On the one hand, sensing the shifting of the political tide, the hitherto dominant Tigrayan party elite and army generals quietly resigned themselves to an Oromo PM months ago and have been preparing a staunch defence of their informal influence and privileges; their public endorsement of Abiy as EPRDF supremo carries a considerable price tag, which the new party chief will ignore at his own peril. On the other hand, the years of unrest and party infighting have exposed structural flaws in the design of both the EPRDF itself and Ethiopia's ethnic federalism, which encourages the kind of risky ethnopolitical entrepreneurialism that catapulted Abiy to the top. Originally intended to decentralise power and to finally explicitly acknowledge Ethiopia's socio-cultural diversity, building party and state structures around ethno-regional identities incentivises violent strategies that could pull the country apart.

Nowhere are these problems more in evidence than in eastern Ethiopia, which encompasses four regional states: The city-states of Dire Dawa and Harar and Ethiopia's two biggest territorial entities, Oromia and the Somali Region, whose Muslim majority has long distrusted the government in Addis. In the past nine months, violence has displaced perhaps more than one million Ethiopians and killed hundreds. The region's two most prominent universities, in Haramaya and Jigjiga, have seen thousands of students, faculty and staff fleeing their campuses following ethnic targeting of minorities. And the commercial centre of Awaday is a pale reflection of its former bustling self after the gruesome assassination of scores of traders in their homes.

{articleGUID}

Eastern Ethiopia is not one of the country's peripheral corners, which, although regularly characterised by violent instability, are ultimately of little consequence to the wielding of power at the centre. Quite the contrary: not only is eastern Ethiopia a demographic microcosm of the state as a whole - Somalis, Oromos, Amharas, Gurages, Tigrayans, Hararis and other groups living side by side - it is also the beating commercial heart of the country.

Eastern Ethiopia dominates the lucrative trade in khat - supplying markets with the narcotic as far away as Canada and the US - and brings in hundreds of millions of dollars annually in foreign exchange. It is the Horn of Africa's hub for contraband commerce in electronics, textiles, building materials and much more. Many of these licit and illicit flows are at least partially taxed and managed by Ethiopia's myriad security forces, including the army's famous Eastern Command, headquartered in Harar. Moreover, landlocked Ethiopia's main import and export routes - the railway and road to the port of Djibouti - run through the east, meaning that political, economic and security developments there are decisive in determining the fate of the country more broadly.

The spectacular upsurge of violence in eastern Ethiopia has many causes - some of them local, related to migration corridors, grazing rights and kebele (ward) level taxation - but the most important one is about the party and national politics. Over the past few months, the security forces of the Somali and Oromo regional states have incited ethnic cleansing and confronted each other in battle, triggering a huge exodus and a worsening humanitarian crisis. It is hard to overstate the irony of open fighting between different branches of the same government in a notoriously centralised state like Ethiopia, but the timing of this turn of events is not coincidental. The OPDO-led Oromia executive has been emboldened by the whiff of growing power in Addis and has challenged what it sees as Somali aggression on its territory. The Somali elite, for its part, has been eager to coercively create facts on the ground before an Oromo prime minister tilts the political scales in favour of their neighbours and destabilises the lucrative partnership the regional government of Abdi Iley has enjoyed over the past decade with the federal security forces.

The problem is not just that ethnic federalism has incentivised both regional states to seek domination at each other's expense; it is also that these ethno-regional stratagems and divisions within the EPRDF party-state are proving extremely hard to resolve because of the two-tiered nature of the federal system. Whereas Oromia is an integral part of Ethiopia and the OPDO a crucial member of the EPRDF coalition, the Somali region remains outside the policy framework of most federal institutions and is governed through an approach perhaps best characterized as indirect rule at the hands of Abdi Iley's Liyu Police and Addis Ababa's Ministry of Federal Affairs. The Oromo vs Somali violence has terrified the long list of minorities that live across the east, highlighting the lack of formal and informal protection mechanisms for those not resident in their government-designated ethnic homelands. Diverging political interests and ideological rigidity regarding ethnic federalism paralysed the cabinet of the outgoing prime minister, who did not even visit the one million displaced in eastern Ethiopia, nor vow to protect them against marauding goons.

The central question facing Abiy Ahmed is therefore how to ensure sufficient unity in both the ruling party and the state while simultaneously overseeing their reform so the focus can shift back to poverty reduction, regional stability and democratisation. At his disposal to do so is Africa's biggest civil service, the EPRDF's impressive developmental track record since 2001 and the formidable repressive apparatus controlled by the party. Stacked against him are the doubts and bitterness of his own comrades, the weariness of a population divided by rising expectations and the ghosts of Ethiopia's bloody past. Breaking the impasse in the east will be a test of his ability to build coalitions and of his courage to lead the OPDO and the Oromo nation into exercising national leadership with confidence as well as political concessions. Ethiopians - and Africans - are watching.

If approved by parliament, Abiy Ahmed, who also currently heads the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) – an EPRDF member party - will replace Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who announced his resignation in February “in an effort to facilitate reforms.”

“Abiy’s election could herald a new dawn in Ethiopia if it is followed by concrete steps to implement far-reaching reforms towards respect for human rights in the country,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

“If approved as prime minister, Abiy and his government must take urgent measures to address the human rights crisis in Ethiopia, through concrete and genuine reforms.”

Abiy’s elevation to the helm of the ruling coalition comes at a time when the country has declared a state of emergency, the second of its kind in less than two years, imposing severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights and freedoms at a time when Ethiopians are demanding greater freedom and respect for human rights in their country.

In one of the most shocking incidents since the announcement of the state of emergency on 16 February, security forces killed at least 12 civilians and wounded many more in the southern town of Moyale. The Command Post for the state of emergency admitted wrongful killings of civilians in Moyale, alleging it was caused by “mistaken intelligence report”.

Over the weekend, 12 recently released political prisoners, including Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience Eskinder Nega, were re-arrested in Addis Ababa, barely a month after release. Another 19 people, including academics, were also arrested in Bahir Dar, in the Amhara region.

“The killings of civilians, re-arrest of recently released political prisoners and the new wave of arrests bodes ill for the long-promised reform agenda in Ethiopia,” said Salil Shetty.

“If endorsed by parliament, Abiy’s new government must start by releasing all prisoners of conscience and reforming or repealing all repressive laws, including the draconian Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and the Ethiopian Charities and Societies Proclamation, which have played a significant role in rolling back the human rights gains in the country.”",Incoming Ethiopian prime minister must address deep-rooted human rights crisis,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/incoming-ethiopia-prime-minister-must-address-deep-rooted-human-rights-crisis/
