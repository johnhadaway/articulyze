0,ethiopia,"Central Somalia has experienced heavy rains which have flooded parts of the country. The resultant effect has been the displacement of thousands. The United Nations estimates that almost half a million people are affected.

Whiles the Federal Government and other allies continue to work around containing the situation, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is contributing its fair share to alleviating the humanitarian situation.

According to AMISOM’s Sector 4 Commander Colonel Mohamed Barkhad Aden, troops from Ethiopia and Djibouti had evacuated some 10,000 people from flooded areas in Beledweyne located in Central Somalia.

An influential journalist who extensively covers the country, Harun Maruf, reported as at Tuesday evening that thousands of people displaced by the floods in Beledweyne were stranded. He added that aid groups were doing an assessment of the situation which started days ago.

He, however, stressed that the need on the ground was way beyond the capacity of his troops. He was speaking to the Voice of America’s Somali service.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the current floods are some of the worst the region has ever seen, and the current water level exceeds a 50-year return period in most locations.

“Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,” Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General said, briefing reporters in New York on Monday.

“Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, [health,] shelter and food response in their interventions,” he added.

The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over six million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.","Somalia floods displace thousands: Ethiopia, Djibouti troops help in evacuation",http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/01/somalia-floods-thousands-displaced-as-ethiopia-djibouti-troops-help-in/

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Throughout 2017, the Government of Ethiopia and humani-tarian partners responded to the rapidly deteriorating hu-manitarian context mainly due to drought and conflict. The year began with 5.6 million people requiring relief food assis-tance as a result of the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole-in-duced drought in southern and south-eastern Ethiopia. The 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD)1 re-quested nearly $1 billion for multi-sector response to save lives and livelihoods. At mid-year, the number of people re-quiring relief food spiked to 8.5 million raising the funding re-quirements to $1.26 billion. An additional 4.1 million public works clients of the Productive Safety Net Programme, who are not included in the HRD estimates, continued to require relief assistance during the year.

The under-performance of the 2017 spring (February - May) rains - making it the third consecutive poor/failed rains in the southern and south-eastern lowlands - contributed to the deteriorated humanitarian situation. Areas needing ur-gent nutrition support (priority one woredas/districts) in-creased slightly mid-year from 454 to 461, nearly half of which were classified as ‘priority one’ (very severe) while tar-geted supplementary feeding needs increased by 76,000 un-der five children to 376,000 cases. Pastoral communities en-tirely dependent on their livestock bore the brunt of the drought crisis. Risk factors such as chronic water scarcity continued to drive livestock deaths (including drought re-sistant varieties), displacement and disease outbreaks, par-ticularly Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD).

Adding another layer of complexity to an already dire hu-manitarian situation was the upsurge in violence along the Oromia and Somali regional borders in early September 2017. According to NDRMC estimates, some 857,000 con-flict-displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing violence or fear of vio-lence were settled in close to 400 sites, across Oromia, So-mali, Harar regions often in areas experiencing ongoing drought-related humanitarian need – as well as the cities of Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa. The conflict and subsequent population displacements – while generating major humani-tarian needs and protection concerns – disrupted delivery of humanitarian assistance.

Flash floods caused by the overflow of Awash, Wabe She-belle, Baro rivers and backflow of Lake Tana affected 300,000 people in Afar, Amhara, Gambella, Oromia and So-mali regions, of whom at least 100,000 displaced.

The drastic escalation in the number of IDPs and associated multi-sector needs, the dire nutrition situation in Somali re-gion, harvest losses due to failed or delayed rains and the impact of Fall Armyworm infestation necessitated a further upward revision of the HRD requirement to $1.42 billion by mid-October.

Adding to these in-country challenges was the continued crossing of refugees into Ethiopia from war torn and drought affected neighboring countries. Influx of South Sudanese refugees fleeing renewed conflict in Maiwut, Mathiang and Pagak areas led to the establishment of new reception centres and expansion of existing camps in Gambella and Bene-shangul Gumuz regions.

The 2017 HRD requirement was 81 per cent funded, with some 8.5 million people assisted with relief food and cash, more than 1.6 million moderately malnourished children un-der-5 were supported with supplementary feeding and 256,000 severely malnourished children were enrolled in therapeutic feeding programs. At least 73,000 full ES/NFI kits were distributed to displaced households, including 9,500 households assisted with cash grants. Some 4.8 mil-lion people also benefited from health services, while several thousand were supported in the WaSH, Education, Protec-tion and Agriculture sectors.

With predictions that the current scenario will likely deterio-rate further due to the potential impact of a La Niña on the 2018 spring rains, chronic water and fodder shortages in the current drought belt, and the potential for a new larger scale AWD outbreak after February 2018, Government and partners are calling for continuation of current levels of support going into 2018.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
2,ethiopia,"KHARTOUM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Wednesday expressed regret over Egypt's official statement blaming Sudan and Ethiopia for failure of the recent tripartite talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

""The Sudanese Ministry of Water Resources, Irrigation and Electricity expresses regret over statements made by Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, which contradict the positive spirit between the two countries,"" said the Sudanese ministry in a statement.

On Monday, Shoukry reportedly blamed Sudan and Ethiopia for the failure of the recent round of the tripartite dam talks held in Ethiopia, accusing Sudan of narrowing the view points of the meeting.

The talk ended on May 5 without reaching an agreement on the technical report prepared by French firms on the potential impact of the dam.

""Sudan has provided a comprehensive consensus proposal that the three countries agreed to look into and respond within a week and consider possibility of using it as a course to get out of the current technical crisis,"" the statement said.

It further stressed Sudan's firm position on the necessity of making an effort to complete the studies, and continue the talks and meetings.

""Questioning and destroying the bridges of trust will only bring divergence and dispute to the peoples of the three countries,"" it noted.

The three countries are expected to meet again in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia on May 15 on the same issue.

In December 2017, Egypt proposed to have the World Bank as a neutral party on the tripartite technical committee, but Ethiopia rejected the request.

The GERD project, which costs 4.7 billion U.S. dollars, is now 64 percent completed. Ethiopia hopes it will provide a constant supply of clean and affordable power and accelerate its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial powerhouse.

Ethiopia and Sudan eye massive benefits from the GERD construction, while Egypt is concerned that it might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the Nile River water.",Sudan regrets Egypt's accusation of contributing to Nile dam talks failure - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/09/c_137167319.htm

Funding received: $6.26 B

Funding percentage: 24.8%

People in need: 130.6 M

People to receive aid: 95.3 M

Countries affected: 40

As of April 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require US$25.27 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 95.3 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.

Three significant humanitarian resource mobilization events took place in April: the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, 3 April, Geneva, co-hosted by the UN, Sweden and Switzerland, where US$2.01 billion in contributions for 2018 were announced by 40 entities and a further $20.2 million were announced in multi-year funding; the Humanitarian Conference on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 13 April, co-hosted in Geneva by the UN, the Netherlands and the EU, where $528.1 million were pledged by 22 donors for 2018 and a further $38.7 million for 2019-2020; and the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region Brussels II Conference, 24-25 April, co-hosted by the UN and the EU. This drew 36 announcements of humanitarian funding totalling $4.4 billion for 2018 and an additional $3.4 billion for 2019-2020.

The humanitarian funding outlook for the protracted, entrenched humanitarian crisis in DPRK is particularly concerning, with a persistent risk that geo-political tension – even with the recent positive developments – could dampen funding. 10.3 million people in DPRK are estimated to be undernourished. More than one-quarter of children are stunted and 4% wasted, while about 30% of women of reproductive age are anaemic. The lack of safe water and the poor sanitation contribute to high levels of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, which are the most common causes of death among young children. The 2018 Needs and Priorities Plan released in April calls for $111 million to provide food assistance, health and nutrition services and improved access to safe water and sanitation for 6 million highly vulnerable people.

On 20 April, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine briefed Member States in New York on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people after four years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Disrupted access to critical facilities and diminished livelihoods mean that 3.4 million people are without basic supplies and services and need protection and life-saving assistance. Ukraine has the highest proportion of elderly people affected by humanitarian crisis in the world. Some 1.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced across the country, and some 200,000 live in daily fear of shelling. Funding for the HRP is urgently needed.

In 2018, as many as 7 million people in South Sudan need humanitarian assistance to cope with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and grave protection violations including conflict-related sexual violence. This is the world’s third largest refugee crisis: more than 4.2 million people have been displaced, including 1.8 million IDPs and more than 2.4 million refugees.

Severe food insecurity continues to rise as people are unable to plant or harvest and have limited access to humanitarian assistance. With the lean season beginning in May, urgent funding is required to save lives and resources. On 27 April, the DSRSG/RC/HC for South Sudan formally invited the USG to support him in delivering three key messages when he visits the country in mid-May. Namely, calling for a sustainable political solution to the conflict to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis, with IGAD-led peace talks expected to resume in May; urging parties to the conflict, including the numerous splinter groups, to address the insecurity that affects civilians and aid workers; and advocating for resources towards the HRP which is currently funded at 21%.

Humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic have increased from 2.2 million people in need in early 2017 to 2.5 million this year, with a multiplication of hotspots. The spike in tensions and armed violence that erupted in April is also affecting the capital, Bangui. Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70% over the first quarter of 2017, and the number of refugees increased by 30%; effectively, 25% of Central Africans are currently displaced either as IDPs or refugees. Underfunding remains one of the biggest impediments to stepping up the humanitarian response. By end April 2018 the HRP had received less than 10 per cent of its $515.6 million requirements.

By 30 April, 21 donors had contributed a combined $278 million (including pledges) to 17 country-based pooled funds (CBPFs), which translated into financial support for 308 humanitarian projects implemented by 229 partners. These included international NGOs which received $55.3 million (42% of total budget allocations) while UN agencies received $42.6 million (32% of allocations). Support to national NGOs included $33.6 million (25% of allocations) and to the Red Cross / Crescent movement $0.6 million (0.5% of total allocations). The largest amounts were channelled to Yemen ($77.9 million), the whole of Syria response ($41.7 million), Sudan ($28.2 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($26.5 million). New reserve allocations were launched by the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (HF) for $16.2 million and by the occupied Palestinian territories HF for $2.2 million, on top of its first standard allocation of the year for $3.9 million, to respond to immediate health and protection needs in the Gaza Strip. The Turkey HF launched a second reserve allocation for $4 million to cover urgent life-saving needs of people displaced inside besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria.",2018 Humanitarian Funding Update (as of April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2018-humanitarian-funding-update-april-2018

Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat

Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi expressed his country’s keenness to resolve pending issues with Ethiopia regarding to Renaissance Dam crisis.



He made this stance during a joint news conference with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni who is visiting Egypt.



Sisi said that he discussed with Museveni the Nile dam issue and the importance of reinforcing cooperation among Nile Basin countries for the sake of achieving sustainable development goals. He also stressed the implementation of the agreements of the Nile Basin Summit in 2017 regarding sustainable use of water resources.



He added: “I clarified the Egyptian position from Renaissance Dam file and I expressed Egypt’s keenness to tackle unresolved matters.”



Sisi noted that he discussed with the Ugandan president opportunities of economic cooperation between the two countries and increasing Egyptian investment in Ugandan market.



For his part, Museveni said that his discussions with Sisi tackled ways to boost cooperation between the private sectors of Egypt and Uganda, noting that wasting raw materials leads to losing more capital and job opportunities.



“There used to be a cheap transportation route through Sudan via the River Nile, but during my flight here I was looking at my computer and saw that the distance is only 2,000 miles,” Museveni said. “But God created this highway (the Nile) for us, which we should also use for transport.”

Protest in Adola town on May 08/2018

Liyat Fekade / AS

Addis Abeba, May 09/2018 – Ethiopia’s Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoMPNG) said it cancelled recently renewed controversial license of MIDROC Gold, the largest gold mine in Ethiopia after protesters took to the streets for the last ten days. Today’s decision by the ministry followed the killing of two protesters yesterday by the Oromia regional state’s security forces in the town of Shakiso in Guji zone of the Oromia regional state in southern Ethiopia. A third, businessman named Shakiso Guta was also killed by security forces while driving to the city of Adola, according to activists.

The ministry renewed the license for Ethiopia’s largest gold mine owned by MEDROC Gold and is located in Lege Dembi, Shakiso Weredas of Guji zone in Oromia regional state, around two weeks ago. The protests erupted last week in Shakiso and Adola towns and their environs following news of the renewal of the gold mine’s license for another ten years by the Ministry .The license has been suspended last year after similar protests erupted.

Several subsequent media reports, including one by the Oromia Broadcasting Network, and the BBCAmharic service revealed grave health crisis among the community including birth defects, respiratory problems and miscarriages, which the locals blame were caused by the gold mine’s two decades discharges of toxic substances including, cyanide.

The ministry said the license will remain suspended until after an independent study involving several stakeholders is conducted in to the allegations of the health crisis. Over the weekend, Motuma Mekassa, who was the minister of MoMPNG when the license was renewed and who is currently the minister of defense, went to the area to discuss with the locals about their concerns. But the meeting ended without results.

Last week, Dr. Negeri Lencho, communication head of the Oromia regional state, said that “any investment should be there to help the people, not hurt them.” He also said the regional government will not work against the demands of the people.

Good AM #Ethiopia!

MIDROC Gold was established in the late 1990s by Sheik Mohammed Al-Amoudi, the Ethiopian born Saudi billionaire currently imprisoned in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. MIDROC contributed 98% of the share while the government owned the remaining two percent share through Ministry of Finance & Economic Development (MoFED). MIDROC then took a 20-year concession under registered license name of ‘Midroc Lege Dembi Gold Mining’ for a US$172 million and started production and export in 1998. According to information obtained from its website in the first ten years of its registration the company has extracted 34,000kg of gold from the site and earned about US$500 billion.

When Ethi­o­pia’s prime minister resigned in February after more than five years in office, there was little reason to think his successor would be an improvement.

The East African country was under a state of emergency that followed a years-long crackdown on opposition political activity. Thousands of activists and dissident journalists had been detained, and hundreds had died in demonstrations crushed by government forces.

Then came Abiy Ahmed, who at 42 is one of the youngest leaders on the continent. In his first month as Ethi­o­pia’s premier, he has ushered in an unlikely wave of hope and even optimism in this close U.S. ally that serves as something of a linchpin to the stability of East Africa.

While ostensibly a democracy, Ethiopia is a highly centralized state with only the ruling party and its allies in Parliament. In recent years, however, unrest has grown, and on April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the government to increase its respect for human rights and the rule of law.

In a riveting speech at his April 2 inauguration, Abiy acknowledged some of Ethiopia’s enduring problems. He apologized for the deaths of protesters at demonstrations, welcomed differences of opinion and promised to heal the wounds between Ethiopia’s ethnic groups.

[Ethiopia chooses new leader from protest-hit region in break from past]

The accession of Abiy, who hails from the Oromo community, brought a sharp drop in tension. Since he took office, Internet service has been restored to the countryside, charges against dozens of activists have been dropped, and he has embarked on meetings around the country, listening to grievances and promising reform, including term limits for his position.

“As someone who grew up in Addis Ababa, one thing that is very foreign was seeing a prime minister come and organize town hall meetings and just sit down with people and discuss things,” said Zecharias Zelalem, a journalist and frequent commentator on Ethiopian affairs. “That has never happened, and it’s been going on for the past three weeks.”

Activists, many of whom were released in the days following Abiy’s inauguration, pronounced themselves “cautiously optimistic” that, at long last, Ethiopia may be changing.

“Our release means something. It is a signal for change, that he wants change,” said Eskinder Nega, a journalist who spent part of his youth in Washington, D.C, and had just spent six years in an Ethio­pian prison for his writings.

He was released in February but detained again during the state of emergency a month later for meeting with friends — ironically in celebration of their release. Ten of his colleagues were also arrested.

“But, ultimately, this is not what the nation wants,” Nega said. “The nation wants two things: the lifting of the state of emergency in the next 100 days and a call for an all-inclusive dialogue. This will set things right.”

“Right” is not where Ethi­o­pia has been for the past three years, and its partners abroad have been worried. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Ethiopia to the stability of East Africa. It has the largest army in the region and the continent’s fastest-growing economy, and it is surrounded by disintegrating states such as Somalia and South Sudan.

This regional rock of stability has looked shaky in recent years, with persistent anti-government protests by the country’s largest ethnic group, the Oromos, as well as unrest among the second-largest community, the Amharas. At the same time, clashes between Oromos and ethnic Somalis elsewhere in the country have left hundreds dead and displaced more than a million.

All that has been compounded by the return of devastating droughts that have put millions in need of food aid.

In the midst of the crisis, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned, and a state of emergency was declared as strikes erupted around the capital.

As soon as he took office last month, Abiy started visiting the centers of dissatisfaction. He went to the Oromo town of Ambo and complimented the young men at the forefront of the demonstrations for protecting democracy. He visited the Somali region to discuss the ongoing clashes that have displaced so many, and he journeyed north to the Tigray region, seen by many government critics as unfairly dominating the military and economy, to put the population at ease about having an Oromo in charge of the government.

He also met with opposition politicians and said that he welcomed their views and saw them as legitimate competition rather than as enemies of the state.

In a speech before 20,000 people in Addis Ababa on April 15, he acknowledged that the bureaucracy and justice system have not been serving the people and promised reforms, including in the security services.

“We will work closely to make the security and intelligence institutions free from political partiality,” he told the crowd. “They would [have to] act in accordance with the law and be accountable to the law upon transgressing the law.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Abiy has strong popular support, which could give him leverage against elements of the establishment that might oppose changes.

A reorganization of the security services, which critics maintain are dominated by the Tigrayans — who formed the backbone of the military after they overthrew the communist regime in 1991 — has yet to take place, however. They were left untouched in a recent cabinet reshuffle.

[Under a new state of emergency, Ethiopia is on the brink of crisis, again]

The international reaction to Abiy’s first few weeks has been remarkably positive. A statement from the U.S. Embassy struck a note of hope as the State Department announced its 2017 human rights report, which describes the occurrence in Ethiopia of conditions such as “arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces.”

“2018 has seen positive steps as well, including the release of thousands of prisoners. We are also encouraged by strong and clear statements by Prime Minister Abiy regarding the need for reforms,” the statement said.

Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, who has clashed in the past with the government, was invited back to the country and allowed to visit areas and talk with people he had previously been prevented from seeing.

“I was impressed by his commitment to openness and impressed by his apology for the irrevocable damage suffered by so many people during the repression of the recent protests,” Hussein told students at Addis Ababa University on April 25, referring to the new prime minister.

In fact, some are saying Abiy may have saved the country — not to mention the reputation of the ruling party.

In an editorial last year, the English language weekly Addis Standard issued a stark warning about the future of Ethiopia, saying that government infighting, ethnic tensions and popular anger had pushed the country toward collapse.

Editor Tsedale Lemma, who now lives in Germany, said the peaceful transition of power to Abiy may have halted that slide.

“They recognized that unless they do something, they were going down, and we came that close,” she said, lauding the outreach to the opposition and the release of prisoners. “What they are doing has given breathing space.”

Like the recently released detainees, she said she was cautiously optimistic but worried that not enough new faces have come into the government with the cabinet reshuffle. She noted also that the security forces remain untouched and that the state of emergency remains in place.

“It was a good beginning,” she said, “but . . . he could have done more.”

7,ethiopia,"Ethiopian Red Cross Society announced that it has been mobilizing resources to support drought victim areas.

The society has been supporting those who are suffering from El-Nino induced drought providing food and non-food assistance, Society Resource Development and Mobilization Sector Deputy Secretary General Wendawek Abeze told The Ethiopian Herald.

As to him, the society has been supplying nutrition mainly to under-five year children and pregnant mothers. It is also working on providing pure water and water purifying chemicals to the people at large.

This year, the society has planned to support more than one million victims collecting 9 million USD, he noted.

""We have already collected some 3.3 million USD from our partners including Red Cross Societies of Canada, Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Denmark, and the International Red Cross and Red Moon (Crescent?) Federation.""

The society would strongly mobilize resources to gain the rest six million USD, he expressed.

Almost 40 percent of the fund would be spent on nutrition supply, said Wendawek adding, the remaining finance would serve to provide water, sanitary and other materials support.

National Disaster Risk Management Commission Commissioner Mitiku Kassa for his part said that the national risk management program has been executing its tasks based on the schedule.

The government has been supplying assistance spending 500 million Birr and 400,000 metric tons nutrition has been distributing to drought victim areas, he said

The commission in collaboration with stakeholders is striving to reduce the impact of climate change through mobilizing the public for agricultural productivity, health care and environmental protection activities, he noted.

Currently, about 7.8 million citizens need food and non-food assistance and the number may vary after this June as per the climate condition of the drought hit areas, he stated.",Ethiopia: Society Mobilizing Humanitarian Aid to Drought Victims,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805080352.html

The views of Sophia Tesfamlariam were contained in an article titled: “Impotence of the United Nations and Ethiopia’s Impunity” and published on the website of Eritrea’s Ministry of Information.

The writer, an Eritrean-American analyst and writer with the U.S. Foundation for the Horn of Africa stressed that if the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was brave enough to hold Ethiopia to account for flouting a known international agreement reached sixteen years ago, the crisis will have been solved.

By refusing to take any punitive actions, the UN Security Council, long considered to be the vanguard of international peace and security, has emboldened ... Ethiopia to flout international law and continue to violate the rights of the Eritrean people.

“By refusing to take any punitive actions, the UN Security Council, long considered to be the vanguard of international peace and security, has emboldened the minority regime in Ethiopia to flout international law and continue to violate the rights of the Eritrean people to live in peace and security within their own internationally recognized borders.

“It is the responsibility of the UN Security Council to enforce the EEBC’s final and binding delimitation and demarcation decisions,” the article read in parts.

Friday April 13 2018 marks sixteen years since the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) gave its final ruling on the border between the two neighbours pursuant to the Algiers Agreement of December 2000.

Eritrea has repeatedly held that Ethiopia continued to flout the EEBC’s final and binding declarations by illegally occupying its territories. Ethiopia has also repeatedly blamed Eritrea for having a hand in anti-government sentiments back home.

The last time Addis Ababa spoke about relations was in early April when new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated that he wanted to normalize relations with Asmara. On their part, Eritrea said the ball was in Ethiopia’s court, that it should vacate Eritrean territories and all will be well.",Eritrea-Ethiopia border crisis: UN's impotence to blame - Analyst,http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/12/eritrea-ethiopia-border-crisis-un-s-impotence-to-blame-analyst/
9,ethiopia,"More than 165,000 people in Ethiopia are dealing with extensive flash flooding, which was exacerbated when two dams broke. At least two people died and approximately 1,600 families had to be evacuated.

Rising waters washed away homes, livestock and crops and cut off many districts and left main roads impassable. The risk of disease, such as diarrhea and even cholera, have increased as residents have little to no access to safe drinking water.

Thanks to the Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund, the Humanitarian Coalition, through its member Islamic Relief Canada, will help survivors recover and prevent the spread of disease.

Islamic Relief will use $390,000 from the Fund to help 15,000 people with life-saving aid, the equivalent of $26 per person). Staff will distribute water treatment tablets and soap to help reduce the risk of disease while also repairing and building new water points and latrines. Some of the latrines will be gender specific with lighting and locks to ensure women and girls have safe places to use.

In addition, Islamic Relief will provide $60 CAD a month for three months to 500 of the most vulnerable households who lost their crops, livestock or homes during the flood. This will help them meet their immediate basic needs, allowing them to purchase food or replace lost or damaged household goods.

The Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund is a joint mechanism financed by Global Affairs Canada, the Humanitarian Coalition and its member agencies.

• Food Cluster: 8.5 million emergency beneficiaries and 4.5 m ex-public work clients received emergency food commodities.

During the last quarter of 2017, IDPs were also targeted for emergency food distribution. There were delays in food distribution especially in Somali region. One round was dropped and two rounds were carried over to the first quarter of 2018. As a result, out of nine only six rounds of food distribution were completed within 2017.

• Agriculture Cluster: 4.2 million animals (0.59 m HHs) received emergency feed provision, animal health and destocking services to save livelihoods of pastoralists in the south and southeastern parts of the country. The cluster was 43 per cent funded.

• Education Cluster: 1.4 million (71 per cent) school children benefited from school feeding and 1.8 million with learning stationary provision during 2016/17 academic year. 15,352 IDP school-children (only 16 per cent) benefited from school temporary learning centers. More than 70 per cent of targeted beneficiaries were reached with significant contribution from the Government.

• ESNFI Cluster: distributed 85,316 full ES/NFI kits and 12,986 cash grants and vouchers. During the last quarter of the year, the needs increased due to conflict along the Oromia-Somali borders that resulted in displacement of more than 800,000 people. This will significantly increase the needs in the first half of 2018.The cluster reached 53 per cent of its targeted beneficiaries.

• Health Cluster: partners supported the primary health care (including emergency vaccinations) and disease outbreak surveillance & treatment notably AWD. 48,716 people were treated in Case Treatment Center (CTCs) and Case Treatment Unit (CTUs).

• Nutrition Cluster: 344, 666 children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and 2.4 million with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) were treated.

• Protection Cluster: 1,558 IDPs were reached through protection monitoring activities and 679 unaccompanied and separated children were reunited with their families. The cluster was 43 per cent funded.

• WASH Cluster: 9.9 million people, including IDPs, were reached through water trucking, distribution of household water treatment chemicals and rehabilitation of water schemes. The cluster reached 94 per cent of its targeted people with higher coverage in SNNPR, Somali and Tigray regions. During the last quarter of the year, increase in number of conflict IDPs resulted in increased demand for water trucking, pipeline extension and construction of sanitation facilities. Due to resources constraints provision of water for IDPs especially in Oromia region remained a gap.",Ethiopia: Periodic Monitoring Report 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document (Covering 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2017),https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-periodic-monitoring-report-2017-humanitarian-requirements-document-1

A supermarket employee who received three kilogrammes of cannabis at his workplace has been denied bail after pleading not guilty to charges against him.

Ethiopian-born Towfik Shikur Hussein, 26, residing at Msida and currently working at a local supermarket after being granted humanitarian status, was arraigned on Wednesday after police discovered the cannabis hidden inside a package said to contain souvenirs from Ethiopia.

Police were alerted to the suspicious package following a tip-off from postal authorities.

Appearing in court on Wednesday, Mr Hussein pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking conspiracy, importation and possession of cannabis grass.

In view of his client’s not guilty plea, lawyer Joseph Ellis filed a request for bail, pointing out that not only did the man have a stable job in Malta, but his humanitarian status also restricted his movement, making it very difficult for him to leave the island.

However, prosecuting Inspector Jonathan Cassar objected to this request, citing the amount of drugs involved and the fact that Mr Hussein had a wife in Canada.

Moreover, there were still civilian witnesses to testify, which meant that the tampering of evidence was a real risk.

In the light of all circumstances, duty magistrate Francesco Depasquale turned down the request for bail, deeming it premature at this stage of the proceedings especially in view of the gravity of the charges and the fact that evidence was still to be gathered.",Souvenirs from Ethiopia turn out to be 3kg of cannabis,https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180509/local/souvenirs-from-ethiopia-turn-out-to-be-3kg-of-cannabis.678673

EHF allocates US$16.2 million to support most critical funding gaps

The Ethiopian Humanitarian Fund (EHF), OCHA-managed pooled fund, in the First Round Standard Allocation, allotted $16.2 million to support the most critical funding gaps in the first half of 2018. The allocation is triggered following the launch of the joint Government and Partners Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) and its subsequent prioritization exercise that identifies acute relief needs and major gaps that require urgent response in the context of the HDRP. Immediate requirements identified in the Prioritization Statement, including averting pipeline breaks, contributing to mitigation of climate-driven drought-induced needs, and ensuring continuity of presence of partners already implementing in priority woredas are prioritize for funding. The allocation targets immediate and life-saving activities in Nutrition ($5.5m), Health ($3.7m), WaSH ($3.5m), Agriculture/Livestock ($2m), Education ($1m) and Protection ($0.5m) sectors.

Last year, the EHF provided more than $94.2m in support of 124 multi-sector projects and covering nearly 18 per cent of the total non-food needs identified in the 2017 HRD with contributions from eight donors namely Germany, Ireland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.

So far Ethiopia’s humanitarian response is 32 per cent funded. From the total requirement of $1.658 billion, $525 has been contributed so far ($182 million from the Government of Ethiopia, $127 million from international donors and $215 million carried over from 2017).

Conflict leaves large scale displacement in West Gujji and Gedeo zones

Conflict between ethnic Oromos from West Gujji and Gedeos from SNNP region resulted in large scale displacement from both sides, leaving people in dire need of food and non-food assistance. The National Disaster Risk Management Commission has dispatched 1,250 metric ton of rice, 115 metric ton of CSB, 33 metric ton of oil and 500 cartons of biscuit to Gedeb (SNNP) and Kercha (Oromia) sites and distribution is ongoing. Humanitarian partners are also moving supplies and commodities to both regions. Currently, Government and partners are assessing the actual number of needs and will continue to provide coordinated support accordingly. Meanwhile the regional Governments of Oromia and SNNP are working jointly to return the displaced to their places of origin and restore peace and security in the area.

Flash floods leave more than 27,000 households in urgent need of assistance in Somali region

Drought caused mainly by underperformance of rains in parts of the country coupled with displacements due to ethnic conflicts has put Ethiopia at a humanitarian hotspot for three years in a row. While shortage of rains has been the driver for drought, flash floods following heavy rains, mostly from highland areas, continue to affect numerous people. Reported flash flood incidences since the second week of April have left hundreds of thousands of people in need of immediate humanitarian support in Afar (Awsi), Oromia (Arsi, East Shewa, East and West Hararge zones) and Somali (7 zones) regions. Areas affected by recurring floods have been advocating for enhanced flood early warning, mitigation and preparedness mechanisms.

Somali region the worst affected by floods

In Somali region, more than 27,000 flood-affected households (165,000 persons) need urgent food, water, health services and NFIs support. Overflow of Genale and W abi Shebelle rivers and related tributaries due recent heavy rains in the Somali region and the highlands of Oromia has affected more than 83 kebeles in 19 woredas (districts) of Afder, Fafan, Liben, Nogob, Siti, Shebele and warder Zones. Several Kebeles are submerged and farmlands are either flooded or washed away at flowering stage. Many people’s houses/shelters and livestock have reportedly been washed away, leaving people displaced and homeless.

The regional Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Bureau and partners operational in the region have prepared an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for flood victims.

NDRMC and partners dispatching food and non-food items amid road access challenges

Following the request for immediate support by Somali region, the National Disaster Risk Management Commission has allocated food and non-food items and is working with WFP on logistics for transportation. The commission is also working with shelter and NFI cluster for additional non-food response. According to WFP, heavy rains received in previous weeks have contributed to delays in food deliveries to some of the woredas in Somali and Oromia regions. Road inaccessibility due to the current belg rain is delaying dispatches to Bale, Arsi and West Arsi zones of Oromia region.

April- May Meteorological forecast

According to the National meteorological Agency (NMA), the mid-season rain predicted for much of the country for the two months (April & May) will be at most-close to normal with a possibility of above normal rainfall anomalies in some places. Better rainfall activity is anticipated to favor both belg-growing and benefiting areas of the country, and with the expected enhanced rain-giving meteorological systems, heavy falls are likely to prevail over different places. the expected heavy fall over some areas would have a negative impact on crop fields particularly over low-lying areas. Thus, proper attention should be undertaken to minimize the risk in low lying areas, and areas with less vegetation coverage.

National Flood Taskforce activated

The national flood taskforce was activated on 19 April 2018 following reports of flash floods from different parts of the country. The taskforce is preparing a national contingency plan for flood-affected and flood at-risk communities across the country.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 51 | 09-22 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-51-09-22-april-2018

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

Following reports of flooding in Afar, Oromia and Somali regions, the National Flood Task Force has been activated. A Flood Alert has been released indicating the areas currently affected and most likely to be affected in the coming months based on predicted rainfall patterns. The Somali region has been the worst affected so far with an estimated 163,500 people (more than 27,000 households) affected in Adaddle, Berano, East Imey, Ferfer, Kalafo and Mustahil woredas1 of Shebelle zone, intensifying existing humanitarian needs. The rapid joint humanitarian assessment conducted during 19-24 April indicated that out of the 27,000 families affected, more than 16,000 are displaced. Houses, schools, health facilities and sanitation systems are either affected or destroyed. Weather conditions in the coming months will be critical in determining whether the rains bring welcome relief from drought conditions or large scale flooding, which will further impact on agricultural livelihoods and increase the risk of AWD and other disease outbreaks. The Somali Regional Government is actively responding to the situation and UNICEF and humanitarian partners are scaling up support to meet health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs to avert potential disease outbreaks. People displaced by conflict, drought and now flooding are the most severely affected, particularly those living in makeshift shelters. Ongoing humanitarian assistance to many communities has been interrupted by the heavy rains which have made roads impassable, cut off key supply routes, and complicated communication and situation monitoring.

In Gedeo Zone, SNNPR, and West Guji, Oromia, conflict between ethnic Gedeo and Guji (Oromos) has displaced people on both sides of the regional borders. It is not yet clear what triggered the conflict but disagreements over border demarcation could be a factor. Based on requests, UNICEF has provided WASH supplies in both Gedeo and West Guji through the Regional Water Bureaus, reached out to the Regional Bureau of Women and Children Affairs (BoWCA) in Oromia and SNNPR to try and verify the numbers of children separated or unaccompanied, and is supporting coordination efforts in the respective regions through the Field Offices. The Regional Governments of Oromia and SNNP have agreed to return the displaced to their areas of origin and support them with relief and rehabilitation assistance. However, it is not yet clear if places of origin are safe, as reports of on-going communal violence have been reported, raising significant protection concerns.

As of 31 March 2018, the number of refugees and asylum seekers in Ethiopia has reached 916,678. Most are from South Sudan (48%), Somalia (27.9%), Eritrea (18.3%) and Sudan (4.9%). 22,093 of these refugees and asylum seekers arrived in 2018.",UNICEF Ethiopia Humanitarian Situation Report #4 – Reporting Period April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/unicef-ethiopia-humanitarian-situation-report-4-reporting-period-april-2018
14,ethiopia,"Ultimately, the only route to its successful end is regulation through institutional mechanisms, which means elections, whether early or within the normal electoral cycle.

According to the dominant assessment, the crisis in Ethiopia reflects the absolute antagonism between two well-defined blocks. A fight between “Ethiopia’s political and business elites (that) have decided to make their last stand to protect their wealth and power by using a military” apparatus, and “a revolution from below based on the political activism of millions of people who are determined to deploy nonviolent methods to overthrow a tyrannical totalitarian regime.”

In this view, the first block is clinging to the status quo. “Take their power away, they will become nobody overnight.” Its centre of gravity is “the” Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), perceived as a homogeneous and unified force. While Tigrayans account for only 6% of the population, the Front maintains its pre-eminence in the leadership of the military and security forces answerable to federal authority. It is a very big player in the “modern” – i.e. non-agricultural – economy, through its control over public and para-public companies. It has long been the dominant component of the four ethnic parties in the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

This ascendancy was clear with respect to the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM), but in decline for the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM) and even more so for the Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organisation (OPDO). It also attracts apparatchiks from all over, including ANDM and OPDO. Without saying it overtly, they too have an interest in the maintenance of the status quo, even when this runs counter to some of their party’s positions. Nevertheless, this block has made – or at least offered – gestures of opening up that were unthinkable a few months ago, and promises more.

Nevertheless, this block has made – or at least offered – gestures of opening up that were unthinkable a few months ago, and promises more. It has released more than 6000 political prisoners, including key leaders of the legal opposition. OPDO has “invited opposition party members based in Ethiopia and overseas to work together with the goal of realizing a democratic system,” i.e. even the most radical fringe of the diaspora. ANDM has made a similar gesture. Never before have the official news channels of Oromia and of the Amhara region, as well as the private media, enjoyed such a degree of freedom of expression.

For its detractors, however, the proclamation of a second state of emergency, on February 16, is evidence that this block still favours force as the tool of getting its way. In response to mass protest, they say, it has simply yielded some tactical ground, which it will subsequently recover, while ultimately keeping hold of the essential.

How the opposing camp is seen

The opposing camp is seen as the proponent of radical change. Its strike force is the street and the sequence of demonstrations that have been under way for almost four years, even more in Oromia than in the Amhara region, headed by the “Qeerroo”, a term that means “unmarried young male” in the Oromo language. Parts of OPDO and of ANDM have joined forces with this current, under pressure from the unprecedented movement of mass protest. One of the rising stars, the President of Oromia, Lemma Megersa, has gone so far as to declare that “if we failed to deliver using existing legal and institutional mechanisms, I and all of us here will join you in the protests.” Another player, of course, is the legal opposition, but its leaders are ageing and worn out by decades of futile struggle. It is also weakened by its fragmentation, disorganization, woolliness, and disunity over objectives.

This camp is unanimous in its pursuit of one primary, specific and concrete goal: to put an end to “Tigrayan hegemony”, summed up in its battle cry of: “down Woyane!”, in reference to the Tigrayan elite. However, it is much less explicit and clear about what to put in their place. In fact, like the ruling power itself, this opposition is enamoured of catchall slogans: “reforms”, “opening up”, “democratisation”, “transparency”, “accountability”, to which everyone can attach their own content. Like the ruling power itself, this opposition is enamoured of catchall slogans: “reforms”, “opening up”, “democratisation”, “transparency”, “accountability”, to which everyone can attach their own content.

This assessment is too simplistic to reflect the complexity and indeterminacy of the situation. In fact, there are two crises, not just one. Obviously interconnected, their origins, the players involved, and the objectives sought, are different: one crisis intrinsic to the ruling power, illustrated by the storm whirling around the apex of the leading coalition; and one crisis arising from external opposition to the broader system of power by some of those excluded from it, spearheaded by the Qeerroo.

Elitist conceptions of power

Underpinning everything is the elitist conception and practice of power. It is encoded in the genes of Ethiopian policy and Ethiopian culture alike, at least in the country’s Abyssinian cradle.

Under the influence of the radical student movement, the revolution of 1974 that led to the fall of the Emperor simply modified its expression, but not its essence. Social organization, in which imperial absolutism and its successive hierarchized variants, right down to the individual level, ultimately derived from divine will, gave way to an organization dominated by a new elite whose legitimacy was rooted in knowledge.

Theocracy, the landed aristocracy and the clergy were succeeded by a sort of “aristocracy of the knowledgeable”, which could be described as an “intellocracy”. Hence “the normative union of knowledge with power”, whose role it is “to rescue the society from barbarism and ignorance”: “power must become tutorship.”[1]

In this fundamentally undemocratic conception, “the people” is reified. Because of its “backwardness”, it is destined to be an object rather than a subject of history. “Due to poor education and illiteracy the Ethiopian public is too underdeveloped to make a well reasoned, informed decision, and so Revolutionary Democracy[2] is the political bridge by which the ‘enlightened leaders’” can lead the people to democracy,” explained the recently resigned Prime Minister, Hailemariam Dessalegn. A fundamental postulate is that the absolute nature of power at its apex is immanent and intangible.

But well beyond the circles of government, the vast majority of Ethiopian elites, be they political, economic, social, or cultural, subscribe to the same vision. Even a new opposition figurehead, the recently amnestied Oromo Bekele Gerba, whose democratic refinement and convictions are recognized by all, seems to subscribe to this conception when he promises that the future lies in the hands of the Qeerroo but, he specifies, “the good Qeerroo, the educated one.”

Membership of this intellocracy confers a social legitimacy so great that anyone aspiring to the highest positions must get their hands on a PhD, however dubious its source, and celebrate the accomplishment with much pomp and circumstance. How many countries are there where the name of a political figure is generally preceded or followed in the press with the abbreviation (Dr.) or (PhD), where applicable? Or where, just after the appointment of the new Oromo Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, the press and national media began by highlighting his myriad qualifications, and the extent to which “he is devoted and committed to education”? Conversely, to point out a political figure’s lack of qualifications, to describe them as a “drop out” from education, is the ultimate denigration.

At the other end of the social scale, this segregation is widely internalized. For the vast majority of the population, 80% small farmers, society can only work if it is governed by an unshakeable hierarchy. So a fundamental postulate is that the absolute nature of power at its apex is immanent and intangible. This is the only way that it can play its fundamental role: to maintain the peace of the realm and law and order, the primary condition of peasant survival.

Oligarchy ‘deep renewal’

The current ruling system continues to operate within this elitist mould, headed by what elsewhere would be called a “caste” or “the establishment”. It was totalitarian in the etymological sense, in that it extended well beyond the political sphere alone. In particular, there was no boundary between institutional position, family position, and business position: the ruling class also became an oligarchic class.

Meles Zenawi pushed this to the extreme, becoming an unchallenged embodiment of personal power. With his sudden death, the elitist structure he had established has collapsed. If it has been done chaotically, that structure nevertheless had no choice but to seek to rebuild itself. Otherwise the group of leaders/oligarchs knew that it would entirely lose its position and, in consequence, its assets.

In recent months, this attempt at reconstruction has entered a phase of acute crisis. The leadership tried to respond to its failure of legitimacy by launching a “deep renewal”. A succession of meetings was held by the four ethnic components of the governing coalition with the official aim of examining the progress and results of this process. The meetings were longer lasting – more than a year – and more bitter than ever before, so were expected to yield a roadmap out of the crisis. They churned out the same leitmotif: each of these meetings brought greater “consensus”, but its content hasn’t been disclosed.

However, nothing in the official releases suggested a meaningful inflection in the main components of the political line. They churned out the same leitmotif: each of these meetings brought greater “consensus”, but its content hasn’t been disclosed. In particular, there is nothing to suggest that “revolutionary democracy”, “democratic centralism” and the “developmental state”, the three pillars of the elitist – hence authoritarian – exercise of power, have even been questioned. And recently, the old line that the cause of the crisis is foreign conspiracy has been wheeled out, both “Arab”, hatched by Egypt with Eritrea as its proxy, and Western, led by “neoliberal” forces seeking to force Ethiopia to de-nationalize its economy.

Power struggle

Ultimately, therefore, all the available information points to the fact that the main cause of the breakdown in the governing coalition is a power struggle. The leaderships have been heavily criticized, have performed their acts of contrition and undergone purges and promotions, culminating in a big first: the election of a new EPRDF Chairman and Prime Minister, the young and ambitious Abiy Ahmed. The major feature of this event, stressed by all observers and greeted in some places with popular jubilation, is that he is Oromo.

What is mainly at stake in the crisis at the top is a new redistribution of powers and resources within the coalition and along ethnic lines: the ethnic elites that see themselves as disadvantaged in relation to the Tigrayan elite have fought to establish a more equitable sharing of the political and economic cake. Does the election of Abiy Ahmed mark the beginning of the end of this leadership crisis, the start of a return to working order?

Does the election of Abiy Ahmed mark the beginning of the end of this leadership crisis, the start of a return to working order? The battle has been interminable, long in the balance, riddled with byzantine manoeuvres. It would seem that the TPLF fought to the bitter end to stop Abiy winning. One reliable observer of the political scene, close to TPLF, sums up the process in three stark words: “it was chaos.”

All the pundits were predicting that TPLF would once again be the “kingmaker” in this election, which opposed four parties of equal size. The TPLF put forward no candidate, so would hold the casting vote for one of the three candidates, each of whom was assumed to have the support of his respective party. In a clear sign of its political decline, the TPLF failed. This election confirms a fundamental turning point in the regime. The pattern in the EPRDF leadership has changed dramatically, with an alliance between OPDO and ANDM gaining the upper hand over the TPLF, though no one can predict the strength of this alliance or how long it is likely to last.

In addition, the TPLF is facing increased defiance in Tigray itself, on the part of the population in general, intellectuals, and even its own officials. They accuse their leadership of being unable to push through the kind of development in Tigray that has been enjoyed by other regions like Oromia or Amhara, and at the same time of being riddled with corruption.

The other parties come out of it no better. The SEPDM vote was split between its own chairman and OPDO’s. Some ANDM votes probably went to the SEPDM candidate. The inner divisions inside these parties have become deeper. More and more ordinary members, but also mid-level officials, turned a blind eye to or even supported the popular protests, even within the administration and the regional security forces.

Second state of emergency

The circumstances of the proclamation of the second state of emergency are symptomatic of these dissensions. Even though the conditions under which it has been decided remain obscure and disputed, it would seem to have been approved by the EPRDF Executive Committee, then by the Council of Ministers, where ANDM and OPDO are strongly represented.

If Defense Minister Siraj Fegessa is to be believed, “the (ruling EPRDF coalition’s) committee were unanimous in their decision.” ANDM then remained silent. Kassahun Gofi, head of publicity for OPDO, declared that “as a party, we support the State of Emergency.”[3] Attempting to keep everyone happy, Abiy Ahmed abstained in Parliament. Dozens of OPDO and ANDM parliamentarians simply refrained from voting, while 88 – essentially from OPDO – voted against.

The leaderships of these two parties have an ambivalent and divided attitude to the popular protest movement. Nobody controls it, certainly not they. Its target is the positions and advantages unfairly acquired by the establishment, and OPDO has certainly not been a back marker in this race for illicit privileges. To take just two recent examples, the “home strike” at the end of February led to “hundreds of arrests” in Gondar, where the mayor declared that the state of emergency demanded “zero tolerance”.[4] Following the demonstrations in Nekemte, in Oromia, Addisu Arega, head of the Oromia communication bureau, “urged the youth to refrain from violence and listen to elders to keep the peace in the city.”[5] Moreover, there is always the risk that demonstrations might degenerate into ethnic clashes.

In addition to the divisions between the four components of the governing coalition, there are varying degrees of dissension within each of them. And finally, nothing is known about the remote periphery’s involvement in these crises, the lowlands of Afar, Somali, Beni Shangul, Gambella, although they account for around 10% of the population.

Abiy Ahmed

As well as the explosions of joy in Oromia in particular, congratulations and promises of support have come from all quarters, including websites close to the TPLF. “The Ethiopian people are largely happy with the results as the major changes they expect from their leaders could finally come true through Dr. Abiy Ahmed.”

Regardless of the sincerity of Abiy’s reformist statements, however, he primarily owes his mandate to the leadership of the EPRDF, and is therefore in a sense its representative. Some therefore say that he is obliged to keep faith with the Front’s political line. “Abiy Ahmed wants to continue on the successful development this government has embarked upon” and only “to address the shortfalls we have faced all along.” “The new Prime Minister will execute the agenda of the Party… He is an embodiment of the principles” of the Party, recalled Getachew Reda, a member of the TPLF politburo.

But there is nothing to say that this agenda has been settled on, let alone that it would be “reformist” in the sense understood by the opposition and the protesters.

The EPRDF’s endless communiqué about the last parliamentary session remains verbose and vague, with no specific information on the key points around which opposition has crystallized, such as the state of emergency, the abolition of the most repressive laws, the release of all political prisoners, the return of the military to their barracks. Yet OPDO supported the communiqué.

Similarly, while Abiy’s coronation speech was well-received, while it was more personal and emotional than usual, while the opposition figure Merera Gudina judged it “much more civilized” than those of his predecessors, while it placed greater emphasis on the “unity” of Ethiopia, it remained fundamentally rhetorical and in continuity with the existing political line. To sum up, “we have laid the foundations for a durable and all-inclusive constitutional order” or built “a new democratic order”, and the goal is now to “speed up the work we have begun” in order to make this order “mature”, by “filling the gaps” and “tackling the deficiencies” and “shortcomings”.

On the points that have attracted the most interest, Abiy Ahmed simply reaffirms more vigorously positions that have already been presented. Towards the diaspora, in general very hostile to the regime: “we will welcome with open arms… those who want to bring your knowledge and experiences”. Towards the opposition: “to allow opposition parties to operate freely and create a conducive and fair and level playing field”. Finally, “the government needs to respect the law. It is also its obligation to ensure that the law is respected.” An allusion – the only one – to the burning question of the state of emergency?

All these ambiguities obviously affect how much room for manoeuver Abiy has. Rather than enjoying a clear mandate that would give him a strong political footing, he is likely to have to play things by ear, handicapped by the recurrent conflicts between the different factions that could continue to divide the leadership, including determined opponents who have no intention of burying the hatchet.

Rather than possessing a roadmap corresponding to the intentions that he affirms – or are expected from him – there are significant forces which would rather see continuity take precedence over profound changes, let alone those the legal opposition is clamouring for, and in particular the Qeerroo.

The Qeerroo

So who are the Qeerroo? In the absence of field research, the answers are hypothetical and contradictory. According to some, they are a new social group, of a kind never seen before, the product of downward social mobility associated with urbanisation. The emerging middle class… seems to be holding back … It is probably afraid that major disorder may deprive it of the small gains it has achieved.

Essentially, inhabitants of cities and towns (the urban population has quadrupled in 30 years), who have broken from the peasant economy and the traditional values of the previous generation, largely undereducated (though secondary school enrolment has also quadrupled over the same period, the quality of education has not kept pace) and therefore underemployed and frustrated, and, by contrast with the parochialism of the previous generation, open to ideas and images of the world thanks to their mobile phones and increasingly the web.

They are the ones igniting the street, whereas the emerging middle class – usually at the forefront in democratisation movements – seems to be holding back, especially in Addis Ababa, where it is the most concentrated. It is probably afraid that major disorder may deprive it of the small gains it has achieved and result in confrontations as bloody as under the Derg dictatorship. According to others, the Qeerroo’s social base is much broader. They represent the whole of the younger generation, urban and rural, educated and uneducated, working and unemployed. In this view, their cohesion and motivation are also explained by the persistence of the traditional Oromo system of governance, the Gadaa, which assigns a fundamental role to consensus and free and open debate in decision-making, in other words the opposite of the country’s dominant mode of governance.

Whichever is the case, the authoritarianism and condescension of the regime, and their own professional exclusion, have left the Qeerroo angry and with a sense of being harassed, despised and ignored. In any case, their target is the very core of the age-old system of power: its elitism, its tutorship, its hierarchical structure.

In the view of some well-informed observers, without being explicitly stated, the real novelty of their movement is that “their goal is not simply political. […] They want to create a new social, economic and moral universe.”[6] For others, they are pragmatic in their demands, which can be summed up in a simple slogan: full respect for the constitution.[7] In any case, their target is the very core of the age-old system of power: its elitism, its tutorship, its hierarchical structure.

Yet a large proportion of the legal opposition’s leaders and mid-level officials believe that these latter characteristics are essential to the effectiveness of the ruling system Ethiopia needs. Their aim is more to force the gates of a previously closed elite, than to promote the real equality between citizens laid down in the constitution. For the Qeerroo, therefore, this part of the legal opposition belongs to the rival camp.

For them, entire sections of OPDO fall within this category, especially as they are seen as equally authoritarian and equally mired in corruption.

Qeerroo demands

The Qeerroo thus responded cautiously to Abiy Ahmed’s election. They are prepared to give him a chance for the moment, basically because he has the backing of Lemma Megerssa, the only leader they fully trust.

The goal of the popular protests that led to the 1974 revolution, similar in scale to those of today, was to demolish the “feudal regime” and to replace it with a very vague “socialism”. However, they were motivated by two flagship measures: “land to the tillers!” and the settlement of the “question of nationalities”.

The Qeerroo are first of all demanding authentic self-rule for their region, i.e. a more equitable federalism. Because of this, they influence the power struggles within the governing elite and therefore interact with the crisis it is experiencing. Beyond this, however, they are not known to have a developed political program, in particular with regard to the “democratic” form that they would like to see this self-rule take.

Moreover, while it is credible that their movement has been able to develop some kind of network structure of local nodes, as an underground force its organization and cohesion are necessarily limited.

Finally, no one today is able to measure the level of support it receives from older generations, which in any case undoubtedly varies from one region to another, and according to age, social status, etc. Is it an avant-garde very much ahead of the curve of the broad movement of popular demands, or it is a faithful expression of that movement? Is it an avant-garde very much ahead of the curve of the broad movement of popular demands, or it is a faithful expression of that movement?

Even overwrought, embryonic, sketchy, unstructured, this mass movement provides the legal opposition with a providential opportunity to break out of its marginal role. It is making every effort to channel and structure it. If it succeeded, the political landscape would be totally changed.

However, for the whole establishment, both majority and opposition, the Qeerroo also represent an unpredictable threat, because no one knows where and how far it could lead.

No one knows

We do not know whether, in their most recent meetings, the leadership structures of the EPRDF were able to set a political course out of the crisis. Apart from its numerical weakness and its disorganization, the legal opposition is divided on the two key issues: greater or less federalism; economic liberalization, including land privatization, or the maintenance, even reinforcement, of statist development. No one knows the precise goals or the level of organization of the Qeerroo and therefore whether they would be able to form a representative entity with clear objectives.

The most radical opposition forces argue that, although Abiy’s election is a step in the right direction, the way out of the crisis demands rapid fundamental change. An “all-inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders” would trigger, structure and usher in a “democratic transition”. In particular, it would end the state of emergency, abolish the main repressive laws and send the military back to their barracks.[8]

These demands seem unrealistic given the current balance of power relations. Firstly, nothing in the EPRDF’s official positions, including those of OPDO and ANDM, suggested that it would sign up to these demands. Secondly, the general context is too fluid and chaotic, the respective strengths and objectives of the different political forces too uncertain, to construct a reform process on solid and consensual foundations.

In particular, like it or not, there is no force currently able to replace the EPRDF at the heart of the political process. The restoration of order within the EPRDF is therefore a prerequisite for any significant movement. There is no quick, black-and-white way out of the crisis, but only different shades of grey and step-by-step tweaks and adjustments.

Shades of grey

Although the legal opposition has adopted radical postures, in the short term it probably expects no more of Abiy Ahmed than a series of gestures that indicate that he is moving in the direction it would like.

The closure of the notorious Maekelawi prison, the restoration of the Internet, the re-release of notorious activists after their recent release and then re-arrest, are symptomatic of this approach.

It will maintain the popular hope that his election has aroused. However, the disregard of the institutions as defined in the constitution is at the heart of the crisis. Ultimately, the only route to its successful end is regulation through institutional mechanisms, which means that the only real possibility is elections, whether early or within the normal electoral cycle.[9] However, the disregard of the institutions as defined in the constitution is at the heart of the crisis.

Their first effect would be to structure the political space by forcing all the players to clearly define their goals for change in three key domains: federalism, economic development strategy, establishment of the rule of law. It would then be down to the electorate to decide on the respective strength of the different actors.

The outcome would be unchallengeable, because measured and legitimized by the ballot box. It would be reflected in pluralism within a new parliament, which would cease to be a rubberstamp for decisions reached by a quasi-single party executive, and would finally take on the primary role assigned to it in the constitution. Together, Oromia and the Amhara Region would have a majority of MPs. The changes for which the voters cast their ballots could be democratically decided here.

This scenario can only bear fruit if the elections take place on a political playing field that is at least more level, even if full “free and fair” elections are as yet too much to hope for. This will require an overhaul of the National Election Board to guarantee its independence and its authority to ensure equal opportunities for all the competitors, as well as the introduction of a good dose of proportional representation.

Letting time do its work

It is because an “all inclusive dialogue” would be limited to this handful of measures that it could be successful. After all, the electoral campaign of 2005 was actually “free and fair” until a few weeks before the vote. Yet the regime was already significantly authoritarian and had not undertaken the slightest legislative reform or an overhaul of the security services. The rules were not changed, but applied strictly or, if necessary, tacitly suspended.

The repressive laws subsequently adopted (anti-terrorism, press, civil society) would lose their arbitrary character if they ceased to be employed against all forms of opposition by a legal system under government control. Ditto for the state of emergency: the new government could order the security forces to turn a blind eye to its most outrageous provisions, and to use force proportionately only if the “constitutional order” were genuinely under threat.

However, this scenario can only succeed provided that the main actors of the twofold crisis, beginning with EPRDF and the Qeerroo, agree that it should be decided through the ballot box. Institutional rules would take precedence over the rule of force, whether originating in the street or in the “deep state”.

The question remains whether the upholders of the status quo would ultimately be willing to allow this card to be played and whether the Qeerroo would agree to let time do its work.

The famous blogger and founder of the Oromia Media Network, Jawar Mohammed, believed to be very influential among the Qeerroo, wrote on March 28: “we congratulate Dr. Abiy for his appointment... The opportunity offers him a unique scenario to charter peaceful transition to democracy in Ethiopia.” Less than a fortnight later, he urged: “Qeerroo, time to fire up and get rid of this rotten mass killer regime!” Will they listen to him?

15,ethiopia,"This report has been prepared under the auspices of the Federal Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group, co-chaired by the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) and OCHA with participation of cluster co-chairs (Government Line Ministries and Cluster Coordinators). It covers the period from 1 March to 31 March 2018.

Highlights

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to address food needs for 7.88 million people and non-food needs in 2018.

The Government and partners prepared a list of prioritized, time-bound requirements ahead of the HDRP launch to facilitate informed and timely donor decision to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages.

As of 14 March 2018, the 2018 HDRP was 31 per cent funded, including $182 million Government allocation and $111 million committed by international donors. Taking into account the $215 million carry-over resources from 2017, this leaves a gap of $1 billion.

Situation Overview

Government and partners launch the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan for 2018

On 13 March, the Government and humanitarian partners launched the Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. Based on findings of the November/December 2017 national multi-agency and multi-sector meher needs assessment, the document outlines prioritized plans in relief food, nutrition, water and sanitation (WaSH), health, education, protection, agriculture and shelter and non-food items in the affected areas, as well as mitigating and preparedness opportunities.

Most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities and the still dire condition of vulnerable communities due to the impact of successive drought, mainly in the south and south eastern Ethiopia, compounded by recent spikes in conflict-induced displacements.

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash. In addition, 3.4 million households are in need of livestock support; 3.5 million moderately malnourished children and pregnant and breastfeeding women and 350,000 severely malnourished children are expected to require emergency nutrition support; 6.9 million people are without safe drinking water; 1.5 million internally displaced people require shelter and non-food item support; 6.5 million people require emergency health interventions; 2.2 million children need support to continue their education; and some 300,000 vulnerable people need protection assistance, mainly in displacement settings. The use of cash transfer programming (CTP) is expected to be explored and further expanded based on market analysis in 2018, particularly to address the humanitarian needs of the conflict-induced IDPs. The use of multipurpose cash (MPC) has proven to be an effective response mechanism in meeting the needs of displaced population, particularly for those displaced from and to urban areas.

Immediate, time-bound priorities: Released on 23 February, ahead of the HDRP launch, the Immediate Funding Priorities Document1 outlined priority funding gaps for the first six months of 2018. With this document, the Government and humanitarian partners had called on urgent donor funding to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages. Without urgent additional funding, humanitarian partners risk pulling out from critical hotspot areas discontinuing lifesaving activities.

The pipeline for specialized nutritious foods to treat moderate malnutrition in all Priority one districts through targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP) will rupture from the end of May. WFP has secured $5.4 million (of $39.1 million total requirement) leaving a gap of $33.7 million as an urgent priority to manage 2 rounds (6 months) of TSFP, targeting 1.2 million moderately malnourished children under-5 and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers (PLW) and up to 150,000 moderately malnourished IDP children under-5 and PLWs. Meanwhile, UNICEF immediately requires $14.7 million to secure therapeutic foods (RUTF, therapeutic milks, essential drugs) to support Government treat and manage severe malnutrition (SAM) as well as for technical support for service quality assurance, monitoring and coordination. The current pipeline for SAM management will be exhausted from the end of June. However, a lead time of 4 months is required to secure commodities in-country.

Meanwhile, $50 million (or written pledge to this effect – facilitating the possibility of an internal loan) are immediately required to cover the cost of two rounds of WFP food assistance for 1.8 million people in Somali region.

16,ethiopia,"Farmer Mohamed Abdelkhaleq speaks during an interview with Reuters in a field in the Beheira Governorate, north of Cairo, Egypt April 4, 2018.

Rice farmers in Kafr Ziada village in the Nile River Delta have ignored planting restrictions aimed at conserving water for years, continuing to grow a medium-grain variety of the crop that is prized around the Arab world.

A decision thousands of kilometers to the south is about to change that, however, in another example of how concern about water, one of the world’s most valuable commodities, is forcing change in farming, laws and even international diplomacy.

Far upstream, close to one of the sources of the Nile, Ethiopia is preparing to fill the reservoir behind its new $4 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, possibly as soon as this year.

How fast it does so could have devastating consequences for farmers who have depended on the Nile for millennia to irrigate strategic crops for Egypt’s 96 million people, expected to grow to 128 million by 2030.

Safeguarding Egypt’s share of the Nile, on which the country relies for industry and drinking water as well as farming, is now at the top of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s agenda as he begins a second term.

At the same time, authorities are finally tackling widespread illegal growing of the water-intensive rice crop, showing a sense of urgency that even climate change and rapid population growth has failed to foster.

The crackdown means Egypt will likely be a rice importer in 2019 after decades of being a major exporter, rice traders say.

Cairo has decreed that 724,000 feddans (750,000 acres) of rice can be planted this year, which grain traders estimate is less than half of the 1.8 million feddans actually cultivated in 2017 – far in excess of the officially allotted 1.1 million feddans.

Police have started raiding farmers’ homes and jailing them until they pay outstanding fines from years back.

“The police came to my house at three in the morning and took me to the station to pay the fine,” said Mohamed Abdelkhaleq, head of the farming association in Kafr Ziada, some 125 km (80 miles) north of Cairo in Beheira governorate.

“Even if the fine is 1 Egyptian pound (5 U.S. cents), they’ll come to your house.”

Three other farmers reported similar experiences and said this year they would not plant rice.

Reda Abdelaziz, 50, said some people have become afraid to leave the village.

“If you’re traveling and they take your ID card and see you have a fine on you, they’ll put you in jail,” he said.

Abdelkhaleq took to the local mosque’s loudspeaker last month to say the government was doubling the fine for unauthorized rice cultivation to 7,600 pounds per feddan.

Mostafa al-Naggari, who heads the rice committee of Egypt’s agricultural export council, says if the government sticks to the new approach Egypt will likely have to import as much as 1 million tonnes of rice next year.

“The dam has opened the door for there to be more of an awareness of water scarcity issues, but Egypt has for a long time needed to review its water allocation policy,” he said.

No agreement

Egypt has long considered the Nile its own, even though the river and its tributaries flow through 10 countries. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat famously said in 1979 that he was prepared to go to war over the Nile if its flow was ever threatened.

But any threat from Ethiopia in the past was empty – until now. The new dam, cutting through the Blue Nile tributary just before its descent into southeastern Sudan, will offer Addis Ababa immense political leverage over its downstream neighbors.

Sudan and Egypt are the biggest users of the river for irrigation and dams. Egypt wants to be assured that the dam will not affect the river’s flow, estimated at about 84 billion cubic meters on average per year.

Ethiopia aims to use the dam to become Africa’s biggest power generator and exporter, linking tens of millions to electricity for the first time.

The two countries have not been able to agree on a comprehensive water-sharing arrangement despite years of negotiations.

Ethiopia was not party to and does not recognize a 1959 agreement between Egypt and Sudan that gave Cairo the rights to the lion’s share of the river. For its part, Egypt refuses to sign on to a 2010 regional water-sharing initiative that takes away its power to veto projects that would alter allocations.

Ethiopia says that its dam won’t affect the Nile’s flow once its 79 billion cubic meter reservoir is filled. The issue is over how fast that happens. Ethiopia wants to do it in as little as three years; Egypt is aiming for seven to ten, sources close to the matter said.

There’s no doubt the flow of the Nile will be affected during those years. What’s not known is how dramatically, and there is little data available to answer that question.

Sources at Egypt’s irrigation ministry have estimated the loss of 1 billion cubic meters of water would affect 1 million people and lead to the loss of 200,000 acres of farmland.

On that basis, “if (the dam is) filled in 3 years it might destroy 51 percent of Egypt’s farmland, if in 6 years it will destroy 17 percent,” said Ashraf el Attal, CEO of Dubai-based commodities trader Fortuna and an expert on Egypt’s grain trade.

Be ready to adapt

The U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organisation has said Egypt requires an “urgent and massive” response to maintain food security in coming years for a number of reasons, including water scarcity, urbanization and the effects of climate change.

Talks among Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia on the dam in early April stalled over what Sudan’s foreign minister called “technical issues”. No date has been set for the next round.

“The filling of the GERD is just the most critical issue for the three countries to decide upon, and now, ahead of the first filling,” said Ana Cascão, an independent researcher on Nile hydropolitics.

“A fair and equitable filling strategy must take into account different scenarios on climate and rainfall variability – if it will be one of drought, then the three countries are ready to agree on a slower filling,” said Cascão.

Rice farmers, who typically begin planting at the end of April, said they may now leave their lands fallow given the difficulty of quickly switching to other summer crops like cotton and corn that require different machinery and techniques.

Irrigation Minister Mohamed Abdel Aty told Reuters the situation posed a big threat to crops, livelihoods and even political stability if efforts to coordinate fail.

“Imagine to what extent these people will become vulnerable,” he said.",Egypt's Rice Farmers Brace for Crisis as Ethiopia Prepares Nile Mega-dam,https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/asia-and-australia/egypt-s-rice-farmers-brace-for-crisis-as-ethiopia-prepares-mega-dam-1.6026667

Ethiopian foreign exchange shortage will last years: new premier

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) – Ethiopia’s new prime minister said on Monday that a foreign exchange shortage will last for years and more cooperation with the private sector is essential to solve it, state television reported.

Abiy Ahmed, who was sworn in on April 2, addressed the local business community at a session of more than two hours in a hotel in the Ethiopian capital. His paraphrased remarks were later broadcast by state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation.

“The crisis with hard currency will not be solved today, nor will it in the next 15 or 20 years. There is an urgent need for more cooperation with the private sector to find a solution,” Abiy was reported as saying, adding that remittances from Ethiopia’s diaspora communities had also fallen for political reasons.

Ethiopia has recorded average annual economic growth of about 10 percent for the past decade, the fastest in Africa. But foreign investors and local businesses complain that the severe hard currency shortages are stifling the private sector.

The International Monetary Fund said in January that Ethiopia’s foreign reserves at the end of the 2016/17 fiscal year stood at $3.2 billion, less than what it spends on imports in two months. The government does not regularly release foreign reserves figures.

The IMF flagged inadequate reserves as a downside risk to economic growth for 2017/18, which it forecast at 8.5 percent.

Despite high economic growth, the landlocked country of 100 million people is heavily dependent on imports. The IMF said export revenues last year were largely unchanged despite volume growth as global agricultural commodity prices remained low and exports from manufacturing, following the start of an industrialization push, are just beginning.
