Give Ethiopia a chance to change; House should reject strongly worded resolution

Today, the House of Representatives will consider a resolution that condemns human rights and governance conditions in Ethiopia. Now is the wrong time to consider this, and it should be rejected.

Since being elected to the Senate, I have made 156 country visits to Africa. Eighteen of those have been to Ethiopia, where I have watched first-hand the economic transformation that’s occurred. Their middle class is growing, and they have become a regional superpower, who is a friend of the United States. Their military is professional and capable, and they are punching above their weight in the war against terrorism that continues to plague the continent. They promote regional peace and security by being one of the top troop contributors to UN peacekeeping missions around the world.

The last few years have been tough domestically for Ethiopia on a number of fronts, but that’s not surprising for a country that’s continuing to transition from a communist to a democratic nation.

The good news is that the Ethiopian government understands that human rights and governance conditions need to improve. That’s why the timing and negative, condescending tone of this resolution could not be worse and would work against the authors’ intent. It would undercut the new prime minister at just the time he needs to be encouraged.

Just one week ago, Dr. Abiy Ahmed was sworn in as Ethiopia’s new prime minister on a mandate to improve these exact issues. He is a personal friend of mine; in fact, I was with him on my last visit in October, and we prayed together for Ethiopia’s disunity to be healed.

During his inauguration, Prime Minister Abiy stated his commitment to accountability, justice, freedom, and the rule of law. He expressed his commitment to allowing true democracy (and by extension, political parties of all persuasions) to flourish, underscoring why he is the one who has what it takes to bring real change to Ethiopia.

We should give Prime Minister Abiy the opportunity to prove himself as a national leader before having the full weight of the United States House of Representatives tossed against him. A heavy-handed, strongly-worded resolution condemning his government, so soon after being sworn in, will severely curtail Abiy’s ability to enact needed reforms. In fact, they could backfire by fueling opposition groups in Ethiopia to undermine his entire administration.

Now is not the time to move a resolution with a tone like this. Ethiopia is a key friend, and Prime Minister Abiy deserves a chance at a strong start. The House can give him that by rejecting H. Res. 128.

Herman Cohen on Monday waded into renewed claims by Ethiopia that neighbouring Eritrea was backing groups aimed at destabilizing the country.

Cohen described the Ethiopian claims as false and averred that the current security crisis in the country was “self-inflicted by a minority kleptocratic regime,” in apparent reference to the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF).

#Ethiopia‘s claim that #Eritrea is contributing to violent instability in Ethiopia is false. All instability in Ethiopia is self-inflicted by a minority kleptocratic régime. — Herman J. Cohen (@CohenOnAfrica) March 19, 2018

Ethiopia is currently under a state of emergency imposed on February 16 this year, a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned his position to allow for political reforms.

The ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) is set to meet to elect his successor. The country is currently under a Command Post administering the state of emergency.

The latest accusation against Eritrea was by the federal police chief who whiles giving a briefing on the state of emergency late last week, reportedly cited Eritrean involvement in the crisis. The Eritrean Information minister dismissed the claims in an email exchange with Bloomberg.

“The regime is desperately trying to deflect attention from its intractable domestic crisis — of its own making — and find external scapegoats,” Yemane Ghebre Meskel said describing the claims as false and one that did not merit a serious response.

The ex-ambassador has been a regular commentator on African politics and has previously spoken about the Ethiopian situation.

“In Ethiopia, instead of an all-parties reconciliation conference, I fear a Middle East type military dictatorship takeover and a zero sum game bloody outcome. USG, do not let it happen,” he said hours after a state of emergency was imposed on February 16.

“While in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Secretary Tillerson should have talks with Ethiopian government about their internal political crisis, and should encourage the regime in power not to fear an opening to transparent democracy,” he tweeted on March 3, 2018.

“Ethiopia regime should withdraw SOE declaration prior to naming OPDO leader Abiy Ahmed as new Prime Minister, thereby avoiding tense vote in Parliament, and setting stage for political reforms,” he tweeted two days earlier.","Ethiopia security crisis self-inflicted, Eritrea innocent – Ex-US Diplomat",http://www.africanews.com/2018/03/20/ethiopia-security-crisis-self-inflicted-eritrea-innocent-ex-us-diplomat/

• The 2018 Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) identifies 7.88 million people in need of food assistance, and 8.49 million people in need of non-food assistance at a cost of $1.658 billion

• Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

• About 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semiurban sites across Oromia region

• 18,000 IDPs receiving vocational training

• In 2017 Fall armyworm infested some 692,963 hectares of land (22.16 per cent of the total maize area in the country) in 417 maize growing woredas/districts causing up to 73 per cent crop losses.

US$1.66 billion required for 7.88 million people in need of humanitarian aid in 2018

On 13 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners launched the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. The HDRP seeks US$1.66 billion to help 7.88 million people with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with nonfood assistance. Out of the $1.66 billion sought for the 2018 response, $1.036 billion is targeted for relief food, $198.3 million for nutrition, $99 million for WaSH needs, 94.9 million for shelter and non-food items, and $74 million for health response. The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

The HDRP is structured around three pillars: (i) Prevention and mitigation, (ii) Preparedness and response, and (iii) National systems strengthening and recovery. The plan represents a first step towards the development of a multi-year planning framework for the response in Ethiopia – with the aim of moving away from short-term response in a context of mainly predictable humanitarian needs. Prior to the launch of HDRP, Government and partners released an ‘Alert’ indicative of target and requirements for 2018 in December 2017.

$242.2 urgently required for top priority needs in the first half of 2018

Prior to the launch to the HRDP launch, and to ensure gaps in funding were being addressed while the HDRP was being finalized, a Humanitarian Prioritization Document for 2018 was released in February. This document indicated that $242.2 million is urgently required to address critical gaps for the coming six months.

The largest share of the immediate priority funding gap is with the nutrition sector, followed by the food and health sectors. The Nutrition Cluster requires $73.4 million by early March to ensure continued quality emergency nutrition response. The Food Cluster requires an immediate $50 million to prevent a food pipeline break for 1.8 million people in the Somali region at the end of March. The Health Cluster requires $9.7 million for urgent re-stocking of primary health care kits for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoae (AWD), severe malnutrition (SAM) management commodities, emergency reproductive health and GBV management kits and the expansion of Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams in IDP-hosting areas.

Some $62 million mobilized for IDP response and rehabilitation programme

The IDP Response and Rehabilitation Committee of the Oromia region have mobilized ETB1.7 billion (close to $62 million) from the federal government, private business and the community in the last 6 months to address critical life-saving, resettlement and rehabilitation needs of displaced Oromos. However, critical gaps including access to water in pastoralist areas, schools and health facilities remain high.

During the first phase of the regional resettlement plan, some 86, 000 IDPs will be relocated to 11 urban/semi-urban sites across Oromia region including in the vicinity of Addis Ababa where construction is nearing completion. As part of the rehabilitation programme, the region is providing vocational training to some 18,000 IDPs. The Federal Government will continue to provide food and non-food items and partners have been encouraged to step in and support the relocated people as they start new life.",Ethiopia Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 48 | 26 Feb. – 11 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-48-26-feb-11-march-2018
3,ethiopia,"This report has been prepared under the auspices of the Federal Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group, co-chaired by the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) and OCHA with participation of cluster co-chairs (Government Line Ministries and Cluster Coordinators). It covers the period from 1 March to 31 March 2018.

Highlights

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to address food needs for 7.88 million people and non-food needs in 2018.

The Government and partners prepared a list of prioritized, time-bound requirements ahead of the HDRP launch to facilitate informed and timely donor decision to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages.

As of 14 March 2018, the 2018 HDRP was 31 per cent funded, including $182 million Government allocation and $111 million committed by international donors. Taking into account the $215 million carry-over resources from 2017, this leaves a gap of $1 billion.

Situation Overview

Government and partners launch the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan for 2018

On 13 March, the Government and humanitarian partners launched the Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018. Based on findings of the November/December 2017 national multi-agency and multi-sector meher needs assessment, the document outlines prioritized plans in relief food, nutrition, water and sanitation (WaSH), health, education, protection, agriculture and shelter and non-food items in the affected areas, as well as mitigating and preparedness opportunities.

Most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities and the still dire condition of vulnerable communities due to the impact of successive drought, mainly in the south and south eastern Ethiopia, compounded by recent spikes in conflict-induced displacements.

The HDRP seeks US$1.658 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash. In addition, 3.4 million households are in need of livestock support; 3.5 million moderately malnourished children and pregnant and breastfeeding women and 350,000 severely malnourished children are expected to require emergency nutrition support; 6.9 million people are without safe drinking water; 1.5 million internally displaced people require shelter and non-food item support; 6.5 million people require emergency health interventions; 2.2 million children need support to continue their education; and some 300,000 vulnerable people need protection assistance, mainly in displacement settings. The use of cash transfer programming (CTP) is expected to be explored and further expanded based on market analysis in 2018, particularly to address the humanitarian needs of the conflict-induced IDPs. The use of multipurpose cash (MPC) has proven to be an effective response mechanism in meeting the needs of displaced population, particularly for those displaced from and to urban areas.

Immediate, time-bound priorities: Released on 23 February, ahead of the HDRP launch, the Immediate Funding Priorities Document1 outlined priority funding gaps for the first six months of 2018. With this document, the Government and humanitarian partners had called on urgent donor funding to avert operational breaks in emergency response due to financial shortages. Without urgent additional funding, humanitarian partners risk pulling out from critical hotspot areas discontinuing lifesaving activities.

The pipeline for specialized nutritious foods to treat moderate malnutrition in all Priority one districts through targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP) will rupture from the end of May. WFP has secured $5.4 million (of $39.1 million total requirement) leaving a gap of $33.7 million as an urgent priority to manage 2 rounds (6 months) of TSFP, targeting 1.2 million moderately malnourished children under-5 and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers (PLW) and up to 150,000 moderately malnourished IDP children under-5 and PLWs. Meanwhile, UNICEF immediately requires $14.7 million to secure therapeutic foods (RUTF, therapeutic milks, essential drugs) to support Government treat and manage severe malnutrition (SAM) as well as for technical support for service quality assurance, monitoring and coordination. The current pipeline for SAM management will be exhausted from the end of June. However, a lead time of 4 months is required to secure commodities in-country.

Meanwhile, $50 million (or written pledge to this effect – facilitating the possibility of an internal loan) are immediately required to cover the cost of two rounds of WFP food assistance for 1.8 million people in Somali region.

The prioritized, urgent requirements from overall sector requirements are listed in the box above (NB: some of the sector requirements were adjusted since the release of the prioritization document).",Ethiopia: Humanitarian Response Situation Report No.18 (March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-response-situation-report-no18-march-2018

Background

Ethiopia has a long standing history of hosting refugees.

The country maintains an open door policy for refugee inflows into the country and allows humanitarian access and protection to those seeking asylum on its territory. In 2004, a national Refugee Proclamation was enacted based on the international and regional refugee conventions to which Ethiopia is a party (1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and its 1967 Protocol and the 1969 OAU Convention). Refugee protection in the country is provided within the framework of these international and national refugee laws as well as the core international human rights treaties that have been ratified by the country.

Continued insecurity within neighbouring states has resulted in sustained refugee movements, either directly as a result of internal conflict and human rights abuses or as a result of conflict related to completion for scare natural resources and drought related food insecurity.

Eritreans, South Sudanese, Sudanese, Yemenis and Somalis originating from South and Central Somalia are recognized as prima facie refugees. Nationals from other countries undergo individual refugee status determination. The refugee flow to Ethiopia continued during 2017, with 109, 851 persons seeking safety and protection within the country’s borders. At the start of 2018, the nation hosted 892,555 thousand refugees who were forced to flee their homes as a result of insecurity, political instability, military conscription, conflict, famine and other problems in their countries of origin. Ethiopia is one of the largest refugee asylum countries world-wide, and the second largest in Africa, reflecting the ongoing fragility and conflict in the region.

Ethiopia provides protection to refugees from some 19 countries. Among the principal factors leading to this situation are predominantly the conflict in South Sudan, ongoing political instability in Eritrea, together with conflict and draught in Somalia.

The majority of refugees in Ethiopia are located in Tigray Regional State and the four Emerging Regions of Ethiopia: Afar Regional State; Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State; Gambella Regional State; and the Somali Regional State. The Emerging Regions are the least developed regions in the country, characterized by harsh weather conditions, poor infrastructure, low administrative capacity, a high level of poverty and poor development indicators. The arid environment in Afar and Somali regions and the small and scattered nomadic populations make it more challenging to provide services. Many parts of the four regions are inaccessible with poor or no roads.

The South Sudanese are the largest refugee population in Ethiopia, totalling 421,867 persons at the close of 2017. Renewed violence in Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity States; that increasingly impacted border areas, has resulted in 75,447 new arrivals seeking asylum in 2017.

The majority were accommodated through the expansion of Nguenyyiel Camp in the Gambella Region, and in Gure Shembola Camp established in May 2017 in the Beneshangul Gumuz Region. Somalis constitute 28.3 percent of registered refugees, with 6,696 new arrivals during 2017, contributing to a total population of 253,889 individuals. Fleeing generalized instability and a third failed harvest, families were subsequently accommodated across five camps within the Somali region. The Eritrean caseload comprised 164,668 individuals at the end of the year, with 25,265 new arrivals received within the Shire and Afar Regions. Ethiopia also hosts an additional caseload of 52,131 individuals drawn from across the wider region; including from Sudan (44,386), Yemen (1,771), and other countries.

While continuing to respond to three concurrent emergencies, and mindful of the fluid socio-political context within the country, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has advocated for stable humanitarian financing, while promoting wider investments in refugees’ selfreliance through an improved and sustainable response that goes beyond mere care and maintenance that combines wider support to host communities, furthering peaceful coexistence and the greater inclusion of refugees as part of broad national development plans. In November 2017, the Government formally launched the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) in Ethiopia, effectively paving the way for the implementation of the nine pledges it made at the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees in September 2016 in New York.

Through the pledges, which serve as a vehicle for implementing the CRRF in the country, Ethiopia seeks to: expand its out-of-camp policy; provide work permits to refugees; increase enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education; provide access to irrigable land for crop cultivation; facilitate local integration in instances of protracted displacement; earmark a percentage of jobs within industrial parks to refugees; and provide access to vital events documentation to facilitate increased access to basic and essential social services. The planned amendment to the 2004 Refugee Proclamation, will enable refugees to become more independent, better protected and have greater access to local solutions.

Through the enabling environment created by the CRRF, the Ethiopia Country Refugee Response Plan (ECRRP) envisages improved coordination mechanisms to ensure timely and effective protection and solutions. The collective engagement of the Government and development actors will help to ensure that the needs of refugees are actively considered in the development agenda, and that complementary services are provided to refugees and their host communities. Fulfilling these considerable and measurable government commitments to further its duty of care to refugees, relative to its existing national resource constraints, will inevitably be based on the scale-up of equitable responsibility-sharing between UN Member States.

With continued refugee arrivals, and in light of ongoing verification taking place as part of Level 3 registration throughout the year, it is anticipated that Ethiopia will host 919,134 refugees by the end of 2018, mainly from South Sudan (485,000), Eritrea (131,343) and Somali (231,348). Within a climate of decreasing humanitarian and development financing; that has led to critical shortfalls in food assistance, limited opportunities for third-country resettlement, together with only modest support to youth and a growing population of unaccompanied and separated children, bold financial commitments - for essential humanitarian services and a sustainable solutions-based response - will be needed to harness the CRRF’s transformational agenda.","Ethiopia Country Refugee Response Plan 2018 : The integrated response plan for refugees from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia (January - December 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-country-refugee-response-plan-2018-integrated-response-plan-refugees
5,ethiopia,"After almost two months of deliberations, the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has finally chosen a new prime minister to replace the much-criticised Hailemariam Desalegn, who had served since taking over in 2012 from the late Meles Zenawi, the EPRDF's long-serving strongman and architect of a federal Ethiopia. Abiy Ahmed, who was inaugurated as prime minister on April 2, inherits a country that has been mired in crisis for almost three years: incessant public protests, escalating ethnic tensions and growing numbers of displaced Ethiopians.

Despite the breathtaking economic growth, the enrolment of millions of youngsters in hundreds of new schools and universities and an increase of more than eight years in life expectancy for an ordinary Ethiopian citizen just in the last decade, the 100 million plus population feels frustrated. For many Africans outside the country, these setbacks have come as a shock: over the past 10 years, Ethiopia has undertaken the continent's most resolute effort at industrialisation and infrastructure expansion, generating hope that other African states may one day do so as well. Restoring order, trust in government and the sense of optimism about Ethiopia's domestic transformation and regional ascendancy is surely Abiy's most pressing challenge.

{articleGUID}

To do so, Ethiopia's new leader must urgently address his biggest problem: the internal fractures in the EPRDF, still widely considered one of Africa's most formidable party machines, but riven with contradictions and personal rivalries that have deepened in recent months.

The protests that undermined the federal state's authority and contributed to Hailemariam's resignation as prime minister were never a simple story of ""the government versus the people"". Instead, both Abiy and his comrades-cum-adversaries know that different factions of the EPRDF have mobilised popular anger in different regions of the country to increase their bargaining strength at the centre in Addis Ababa.

In fact, Abiy's own Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), an ethno-regional party that is one of the four pillars of EPRDF hegemony, has reinvented itself by surfing the waves of long-standing grievances held by the Oromo population about their socioeconomic and political marginalisation. It has instrumentalised legitimate anger flowing from rising inequality amidst the boom in Ethiopia to demand a greater share of power for itself. While Tigrayan security hawks and Amhara politicians gnawed their teeth at so much OPDO audacity and pushed for a state of emergency to crack down on the streets, Abiy's tacit alliance with hardline diaspora activists and sympathisers of the outlawed Oromo Liberation Front has paid dividends. Foreign diplomats have for months been pushing EPRDF officials to quell the surge in demonstrations after widespread strikes in the Oromia region brought economic life to a standstill. Abiy's election as party leader by the EPRDF Council is a recognition that, for now, the political pendulum has shifted in the OPDO's direction.

Although the rise of an Oromo to the pinnacle of governmental authority is a genuinely historic achievement -modern Ethiopia has historically sought to assimilate, including through violence, its more than 80 nations and nationalities into one Orthodox Christian Amhara identity - Abiy's victory might well prove Pyrrhic. On the one hand, sensing the shifting of the political tide, the hitherto dominant Tigrayan party elite and army generals quietly resigned themselves to an Oromo PM months ago and have been preparing a staunch defence of their informal influence and privileges; their public endorsement of Abiy as EPRDF supremo carries a considerable price tag, which the new party chief will ignore at his own peril. On the other hand, the years of unrest and party infighting have exposed structural flaws in the design of both the EPRDF itself and Ethiopia's ethnic federalism, which encourages the kind of risky ethnopolitical entrepreneurialism that catapulted Abiy to the top. Originally intended to decentralise power and to finally explicitly acknowledge Ethiopia's socio-cultural diversity, building party and state structures around ethno-regional identities incentivises violent strategies that could pull the country apart.

Nowhere are these problems more in evidence than in eastern Ethiopia, which encompasses four regional states: The city-states of Dire Dawa and Harar and Ethiopia's two biggest territorial entities, Oromia and the Somali Region, whose Muslim majority has long distrusted the government in Addis. In the past nine months, violence has displaced perhaps more than one million Ethiopians and killed hundreds. The region's two most prominent universities, in Haramaya and Jigjiga, have seen thousands of students, faculty and staff fleeing their campuses following ethnic targeting of minorities. And the commercial centre of Awaday is a pale reflection of its former bustling self after the gruesome assassination of scores of traders in their homes.

{articleGUID}

Eastern Ethiopia is not one of the country's peripheral corners, which, although regularly characterised by violent instability, are ultimately of little consequence to the wielding of power at the centre. Quite the contrary: not only is eastern Ethiopia a demographic microcosm of the state as a whole - Somalis, Oromos, Amharas, Gurages, Tigrayans, Hararis and other groups living side by side - it is also the beating commercial heart of the country.

Eastern Ethiopia dominates the lucrative trade in khat - supplying markets with the narcotic as far away as Canada and the US - and brings in hundreds of millions of dollars annually in foreign exchange. It is the Horn of Africa's hub for contraband commerce in electronics, textiles, building materials and much more. Many of these licit and illicit flows are at least partially taxed and managed by Ethiopia's myriad security forces, including the army's famous Eastern Command, headquartered in Harar. Moreover, landlocked Ethiopia's main import and export routes - the railway and road to the port of Djibouti - run through the east, meaning that political, economic and security developments there are decisive in determining the fate of the country more broadly.

The spectacular upsurge of violence in eastern Ethiopia has many causes - some of them local, related to migration corridors, grazing rights and kebele (ward) level taxation - but the most important one is about the party and national politics. Over the past few months, the security forces of the Somali and Oromo regional states have incited ethnic cleansing and confronted each other in battle, triggering a huge exodus and a worsening humanitarian crisis. It is hard to overstate the irony of open fighting between different branches of the same government in a notoriously centralised state like Ethiopia, but the timing of this turn of events is not coincidental. The OPDO-led Oromia executive has been emboldened by the whiff of growing power in Addis and has challenged what it sees as Somali aggression on its territory. The Somali elite, for its part, has been eager to coercively create facts on the ground before an Oromo prime minister tilts the political scales in favour of their neighbours and destabilises the lucrative partnership the regional government of Abdi Iley has enjoyed over the past decade with the federal security forces.

The problem is not just that ethnic federalism has incentivised both regional states to seek domination at each other's expense; it is also that these ethno-regional stratagems and divisions within the EPRDF party-state are proving extremely hard to resolve because of the two-tiered nature of the federal system. Whereas Oromia is an integral part of Ethiopia and the OPDO a crucial member of the EPRDF coalition, the Somali region remains outside the policy framework of most federal institutions and is governed through an approach perhaps best characterized as indirect rule at the hands of Abdi Iley's Liyu Police and Addis Ababa's Ministry of Federal Affairs. The Oromo vs Somali violence has terrified the long list of minorities that live across the east, highlighting the lack of formal and informal protection mechanisms for those not resident in their government-designated ethnic homelands. Diverging political interests and ideological rigidity regarding ethnic federalism paralysed the cabinet of the outgoing prime minister, who did not even visit the one million displaced in eastern Ethiopia, nor vow to protect them against marauding goons.

The central question facing Abiy Ahmed is therefore how to ensure sufficient unity in both the ruling party and the state while simultaneously overseeing their reform so the focus can shift back to poverty reduction, regional stability and democratisation. At his disposal to do so is Africa's biggest civil service, the EPRDF's impressive developmental track record since 2001 and the formidable repressive apparatus controlled by the party. Stacked against him are the doubts and bitterness of his own comrades, the weariness of a population divided by rising expectations and the ghosts of Ethiopia's bloody past. Breaking the impasse in the east will be a test of his ability to build coalitions and of his courage to lead the OPDO and the Oromo nation into exercising national leadership with confidence as well as political concessions. Ethiopians - and Africans - are watching.

U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia

at the installation of cargo screening machines at Ethiopian Airlines

U.S. Embassy, Addis Ababa

April 9, 2018

(As prepared for delivery)

It's a great pleasure for me to be here today, as we celebrate the latest in a long line of important milestones in the relationship between the United States and Ethiopia's aviation industry.

Having spent many years in Africa, I've had lots of opportunities to admire Ethiopian Airlines' remarkable growth and success in strengthening the connections between Ethiopia and the United States, in connecting Ethiopians with each other, and in connecting Africa to the world.

I'm humbled by the rich aviation history that Ethiopia and the United States share, dating back to Colonel John Robinson's pioneering commitment to Ethiopian aviation and the role TWA played decades ago in supporting the establishment of a national airline in Ethiopia.

But while TWA is no longer flying, Ethiopian Airlines is thriving, and it's clear that the world can learn a lot from Ethiopia - and particularly from Ato Tewolde and the entire Ethiopian Airlines team - about how to run an airline right.

The United States' role as a partner in Ethiopia's aviation success is something we're very proud of, and committed to building upon.

Today we're celebrating the installation of state-of-the-art equipment that will enhance the safety of millions of travelers who either visit Ethiopia or transit this important hub every year.

Ethiopian Airlines' rapid growth comes with enormous benefits in terms of trade, commerce, tourism, and investment opportunities - not just in Ethiopia, but in the United States and beyond.

This growing connectivity opens the doors for prosperity, but we all know that we can't have sustainable prosperity without security.

Security in the aviation industry isn't a cost, it's an asset, and is something that both the United States and Ethiopia take very seriously.

We've cooperated in the past to support passenger screening in line with global security standards, and today we're welcoming new equipment that will do the same for Ethiopia's baggage operations.

These new screening devices, provided by the U.S. Government, employ a new technology called computer tomography that represents the latest in imaging for baggage scanning.

This technology will enhance Ethiopia's ability to detect not only potentially hazardous items, but contraband items such as drugs and illicit wildlife products as well.

In keeping with Ethiopian Airline's long tradition of ""firsts"" as Africa's aviation pioneer, this is the first deployment of this technology to Africa.

We see it as a significant step forward in keeping passengers safe, protecting the world's wildlife resources, and fighting transnational crime.

I'm very happy that we're able to celebrate this milestone with a delegation from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, the agency responsible for the safety of the United States' transportation systems.

Their presence here reflects our recognition that none of us can ensure our own security without strengthening the security of our partners, and demonstrates our commitment to working with Ethiopia as a key partner to ensure our mutual protection and success.

Because when you get right down to it, the United States is in Ethiopia because we're committed to Ethiopia's success.

Our partnerships with Ethiopia are built around the idea that when Ethiopia succeeds, when it's prosperous and stable, and when it taps the fullest potential of all its people, not only Ethiopia but the region, the United States, and the world at large also benefit.

In this context, the success of Ethiopia's aviation sector isn't just about the success of an airline; it's about the growth and success of Ethiopia itself.

The role Ethiopian Airlines plays in connecting people and promoting Ethiopia's prosperity is invaluable, and these are goals the U.S. Embassy will continue to support as well through our own development, economic growth, governance, humanitarian, public outreach, and commercial programs.

In the end, I see Ethiopian Airlines as more than an incredibly successful airline: I see it as a shining symbol of our shared goals for Ethiopia's growth, stability, and prosperity.

7,ethiopia,"A Kenyan conflict analysis resolution expert says Kenya must employ diplomatic channels to help Ethiopia out of the current political crisis it finds itself in.

According to Hassan Khannenje, the current state of affairs was just a matter of time after decades of iron fist rule by the Ethiopia Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

Speaking on a political talk show hosted by NTV Kenya channel he stressed that Ethiopia was nearing the end of authoritarian rule. “I don’t see the current Ethiopian crisis as the beginning of democracy (actually) I see it as the beginning of the end of autocracy.

Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state.

“Ever since the days of Hailesellasie to Mengistu Hailemariam and then after he was overthrown (really), there has never been a debate in Ethiopia or political space, essentially it has been a police state,” he stressed.

He averred that in the absence of a substantive head of government, i.e. a Prime Minister, the country was confused, adding that the state of emergency did not help matters because it is often used to repress opposition groups.

“And this is a culmination of many years of autocracy and authoritarianism. Now, in the absence of the Prime Minister at the moment or at least the state control of power in certain places, a lot of time the opposition tends to suffer, it gets scapegoated, it gets repressed.

“… the Oromo being the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and having been resistant to the status quo for many years, of course they are going kto get the first flak. Now, Kenya had seen this coming and we cannot pretend we were unaware of the goings on in Ethiopia.

Kenya until recently had not actively waded into the Ethiopian situation. The recent influx of thousands of refugees following a botched military operation in the border town of Moyale has forced the media to discuss Ethiopia.

“This was bound to happen sooner or later and what I am hoping is our Minister of Foreign Affairs or Interior have a moral bust approach both diplomatically with Ethiopia to make sure that thing does not overflow.

“But also to use its influence on the current rulers within at least on the Ethiopian circles, at least, to try and calm things down. Today Ethiopia needs help. They are still trying to figure out a direction where to go from here, they are confused,” he said.",Ethiopia crisis is 'the beginning of the end of autocracy' - Kenyan security expert,http://www.africanews.com/2018/03/16/ethiopia-crisis-is-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-autocracy-kenyan-security-expert/
8,ethiopia,"Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali was sworn-in as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia on April 2, 2018. He will succeed Hailemariam Desalegn who resigned in the midst of a heightened political crisis in Feb. 2018 after five and a half years at the helm.

The seemingly peaceful power transfer in Addis Ababa is a welcome gesture, but it betrays the ongoing struggle the country has had to endure for the last three years, including the current six-month state of emergency. A highly coordinated media censorship has ensured that only a fraction of what is happening in Africa’s second most populous country is visible. As Abiy Ahmed takes over Ethiopia’s most powerful constitutional office, he has the responsibility of lifting the lid on media censorship, if the opportunity for reforms is to take root outside Addis Ababa.

To be sure, the new prime minister has an overflowing to-do list. Lifting the state of emergency is widely seen by a broad range of Ethiopians and human rights groups as a top priority and signal of progress. However, recent trends by the Command Post, the bureau responsible for managing the state of emergency, may be eroding the high hopes the population has in this rare political opportunity. After the much-publicized release of political prisoners in mid-February, the Command Post re-arrested 29 journalists and lecturers, among them Eskinder Nega, the celebrated winner of 2012 PEN award.

In the Southern Oromia region, thousands of Ethiopians have been displaced, with some crossing over to Kenya’s northern region, to escape the military violence unleashed by the Command Post. The economy, the one sector the government has harped on to cover up for closed political space, has suffered heavy losses, thanks in large part to an unpredictable business environment and cost of doing business. The political questions of uniting the country, jump-starting the economy, and responding to the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia are all competing priorities deserving immediate attention.

However, a yarn connecting all the above is the media blockage. Only the capital city has had access to the Internet since mid-December after the government imposed a blanket shutdown for regional states. Independent media is almost non-existent after the Meles Zenawi-led government closed them down during and after the controversial 2005 election. The subsequent arrest of journalists and opposition leaders saw a mass exodus of public intellectuals to safer grounds. There is currently no independent newspaper compared to more than ten in 2005, less than ten radio stations and only one internet service provider fully owned by the government. The media vacuum created by the events of 2005 onwards limited civil and political space considerably.

Only Addis Ababa, the green spot, has had reliable Internet conection since mid-December 2017, with some areas having no connection whatsoever.

The diaspora community attempted to fill the media vacuum in Ethiopia using satellite radio, television and internet platforms. Successful examples include Ethiopia Satellite TV and Oromia Media Network, which attract millions of followers. No keen observer of Ethiopian politics can doubt the central role Oromia Media played in broadcasting the popular protests and civil disobedience happening in isolated towns, effectively shaping the political narrative both inside Ethiopia and in the diaspora.

As Internet penetration grew, so did the salience of these platforms, a reality never lost on the government. Internet shutdowns, website censorship, and targeted surveillance were meant to limit their audience. For example, OMN and ESAT websites are permanently blocked in Ethiopia, and accessing them is prohibited by law while their satellite TV signals are occasionally jammed.

Communication patterns can proxy for underlying political developments, as this Ethiopian web-search traffic report illustrates. (Google Traffic Transparency Report)

The trend above illustrates the turbulent state of internet connectivity in Ethiopia. Point (a) shows two short-lived deeps which were the shutdowns during 2016 national exams, (b) is a longer and wider deep which starts off during the state of emergency in Oct. 2016, (c) is the 2017 national exams when the government ordered a total national blackout, (d) illustrates a return to active protests and online activity after the state of emergency was lifted, and (e) points to the shutdown that started mid-Dec. 2017 targeting all regions in the country except the capital, Addis Ababa. A second state of emergency was declared in Feb. 2018, and as the chart illustrates, the country is still under an internet shutdown. In summary, Ethiopia’s internet connectivity has never recovered since Nov. 2015 when the protests started in earnest.

Yet, it is because of the relentless efforts by Ethiopians to innovate and adapt the internet to local offline resistance networks that political power is shifting from the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front to Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organization.

Three things, I propose, make the opening, not closing, of the internet across the country central to Abiy’s political success. One, it will act as a litmus test on where he is located principally as a political reformer. Any indecision on an issue as unjustifiable as a blanket internet shut down for 90% of the country will portray him as an opportunist who rode to the high office on the blood, jail terms, and ingenuity of internet warriors only to lock them out while in power. Addis Ababa alone cannot sustain the popular narrative of change.

Two, the economic costs of media censorship have been demonstrated to cripple economies, especially when this happens for an extended period of time. An internet blackout costs an economy like Ethiopia’s an estimated $1 million a day. An open internet is a necessity to jump-start the limping economy after three years of uncertainty.

Three, an open independent media allows for fair coverage of the country, setting realistic expectations, as opposed to the ‘development’ rhetoric churned out as propaganda and regurgitated by uncritical international media. This ‘public relations’ type of media coverage sets impossible standards that sees the government harshly covering up the human rights costs of the ‘fastest growing economy’ narrative, only for the suppression to boil over, as happened with the protests. It makes governance easier when attention is on fixing what is broken rather than maintaining expensive PR firms in global metropolises for the myopic focus on ‘foreign’ investors.

Prime minister Abiy Ahmed, himself a computer engineer, knows that switching the internet back on in the country is not only expected of any modern nation but is a direct boost to his economic plans. Abiy is a benefactor of the human rights space created by the internet, ironically having set up and directed the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), an agency notorious for cyber surveillance and website censorship.

Any delay may be interpreted as a continuation of the old ways and may foment the next wave of resistance. Should this opportunity be squandered, the benefit of the doubt the protestors gave to the political class in 2018 may no longer be an option.

9,ethiopia,"International rights group, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says as a matter of urgency, the Kenyan government must speak on the political and security ongoings in neighbouring Ethiopia.

According to HRW, Kenya especially and the entire East Africa region needed to encourage Ethiopia to undertake needed reforms and to halt its continued descent into chaos.

A March 24, 2018 statement ‘Why is Kenya’s Government Silent on Ethiopia Crackdown’ released by the group’s Senior Researcher for the Horn of Africa, Felix Horne read in part: “… Kenyan leaders should publicly voice their concern over the increased military aggression that causes Ethiopians to flee into Kenya. Kenya, and East Africa more broadly, need a stable and prosperous Ethiopia.

“Adding the voice of a trusted ally like Kenya to the many tens of millions of Ethiopians demanding change will be an important contribution toward stability in the region.”

HRW also stressed that on the humanitarian scale, Kenya stands to suffer if the situation in Ethiopia degenerates any further. With family ties connecting people on both sides of their common border, Ethiopians are likely to continue fleeing into Kenya.

“Over eight million Ethiopians are in need of food aid. Many of them live in southern Ethiopia, close to the Kenyan border. If conflict in Ethiopia increases, many of its most vulnerable citizens will be looking for safety.

“Kinship connections, established trafficking routes, and relatively stable security all make Kenya an attractive destination,” the statement added.

Over the last weeks, thousands of Ethiopians living in the border town of Moyale fled their homes into Kenya’s Marsabit County after a failed military operation by the army led to the deaths of nine people and injuries to others.

Confirming the incident, the Minister of Defense, admitted that the army had acted on failed intelligence as it sought to intercept members of a banned group – the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) – who were reportedly trying to enter the country.

HRW also reiterated how Ethiopian forces have in the past entered Kenya and perpetuated rights abuses in the name of counter-terrorism operations. They also accused the Kenyan authorities in part of complicity in helping Ethiopia arrest Ethiopians who had fled in Kenya.

“Ethiopia’s intolerance of dissent has also been exported across the border in the past. For years, Ethiopian intelligence officials, sometimes in cooperation with Kenyan police, have harassed, threatened, and on occasion kidnapped Ethiopian asylum seekers in Nairobi and elsewhere in Kenya,” the statement added.

The country is currently under martial law, after a state of emergency was declared in February 16 – a day after the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.

10,ethiopia,"The United States Congress will finally vote on a human rights resolution against the Ethiopian government today as announced by a Congressman deeply involved in the process.

Rep. Mike Coffman who represents Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District tweeted last week that the House Resolution 128 will be on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 10.

He had in March tweeted about how passing the resolution will mean: “The fight for respect of human rights & inclusive governance in Ethiopia continues.”

What is the H. Res. 128 about?

H. Res. 128 is a human rights centered move with strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, it has as many as 71 cosponsors.

The resolution passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously in late July 2017 and was scheduled for a vote by the full House on October 2. That vote was, however, postponed ostensibly after a protest and threat by Addis Ababa to withdraw counter-terrorism cooperation.

One of its authors, Republican Congressman Chris Smith said during the committee mark-up, the resolution is like a mirror held up to the government of Ethiopia, and it is intended to encourage them to recognize how others see them and move forward with reforms.

HRW and advocacy groups back H. Res. 128

Human Rights Watch (HRW) and a network of advocacy groups based in the U.S. have tasked the Congress to vote for the resolution to send a signal to the government that respect for and opening the political space was non-negotiable. Some of the reasons they advanced included:

1) H. Res. 128 is a signal of support for the youth in the country who have organized to peacefully demand justice and democracy and have paid a terrible price in terms of loss of life, injury and arbitrary detention. Accountability for the human rights violations that have occurred over the last 3 years will be an essential step towards genuine reconciliation and is a key demand from the protesters.

2) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that could strengthen the hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis less responsive segments within the EPRDF party coalition structure, requiring negotiation with the forces that control the country’s security apparatus, intelligence and the economic sectors.

3) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the State Department and USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy to support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia.

4) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury to apply appropriate sanctions on individuals and organizations responsible for gross human rights.

In October 2017, a pro-democracy group, Freedom House, accused Ethiopia of literally blackmailing the U.S. Congress with a threat to withhold counter-terrorism cooperation if the vote went ahead.

Freedom House quoted Congressman Mike Coffman as confirming that Ethiopia’s ambassador in Washington has said the country will “stop counter-terrorism cooperation with the United States if Congress went ahead with a planned vote on a resolution calling for human rights protections and inclusive governance in the country (H. Res. 128).”

But the turn of events, with the vote scheduled to go ahead means that the Congress had ‘thrown out’ the threat from Addis Ababa.

Freedom House’s statement dated October 16, 2017 was titled “U.S. Congress Should Call Ethiopia’s Bluff,” with its Senior Program Officer for Africa, Joseph Badwaza, egging Congress to proceed with its efforts and discard the Ethiopian government’s “bullying tactics.”

“Passing H. Res. 128 would send a powerful message to Addis Ababa to get serious about undertaking reforms, and the Ethiopian government’s bullying tactics should not derail it. Members of Congress should call the bluff, place the resolution back on the House agenda, and approve it.

“Experience shows that Ethiopia would never follow through on the threat to halt security cooperation. The government fully understands who would be the ultimate loser if it did,” Freedom House said.",Ethiopia govt faces hard-hitting U.S. Congress resolution 128 vote,http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/10/ethiopia-govt-faces-hard-hitting-us-congress-resolution-128-vote/

12,ethiopia,"Political turmoil and ethnic tension have continued to engulf Ethiopia. Begun in 2015, the protest has swept the nation and is getting stronger, pushing the country to the brink of ethnic conflict.

BY BETRE Y. GETAHUN

Ethiopia has been under a state of emergency for much of the past two years. The first state of emergency was imposed in October 2016 following a year of protests and was lifted at the end of 2017. The second one came on February 17, this year after the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.

According to HRW, in 2015 alone thousands were killed and tens of thousands of protesters were detained in Oromia and the Amhara regions in connection to the protest. “Many of those who were released reported that they were tortured in detention, a long-standing problem in Ethiopia,” said the Human Rights Watch.

Since Ethiopia’s government declared the new state of emergency this year, the security forces have killed dozens of people and have been criticized for failing to investigate the killings. The number of those killed since January are estimated to be more than 20 and most of them are members of the Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups, according to media reports. This has raised a concern that the situation may turn into an ethnic conflict which may end up leading the nation into a blood bath.

Although the protest is spreading throughout the nation and is shaking the foundation of the regime, authorities are not showing willingness to institute political reform. This has alarmed the international community and is forcing it to take action against the regime. Concerned, the United Nations has recently called on the authorities to refrain from using force while the US congress has drafted a new bill which targets the regime.

However, in spite of all this, the regime has intensified its violation of human rights, targeting Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups and their descendants, according to Minority Rights Group International.

“Human rights violations against the Amhara and Oromo people are happening against a backdrop of a highly restrictive environment. Civil society activists find difficulties to reach the worst hit places to access information, and risk arrest and persecution. Equally, journalists, bloggers and other social media users have faced harassment and intimidation. Such a restricted space is a hindrance for effective dialogue, reinforces persisting human rights violations and delays justice for victims. Yet the Ethiopia government remains adamant on what is happening, and has ignored calls from the international community to constitute an independent inquiry into the use of excessive force by the security agents to quell protests.” the institution said.

This nationwide protests first began in 2015 and were sparked by the government’s “city expansion plan,” which allegedly threatened the livelihoods of ethnic Oromo framers in the area. Although the government claimed that the plan benefits Oromo farmers, experts and residents opposed the plan, saying that it was part of the land-grabbing scheme of the Tigryan people. Despite the fact that the plan was an immediate cause, at the heart of the issue is a resentment of those ethnic groups who feel that they have been marginalized.

What is behind the turmoil? To understand Ethiopia’s present-day turmoil, it’s key to look at two factors which are at the center of the resentment and are fueling the country’s implosion.

Political Oppression and Marginalization of Minority Groups

Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa next to Nigeria and is home for more than 80 ethnic groups. There are also important linguistic differences among the population. Ethiopia’s constitution reorganizes the importance of the political participation of all ethnic groups in the country and guarantees their rights, which extend to self-determination. Yet the practice is completely different and contradicts the constitution and violates the rights of these ethnic groups.

The country’s politics is dominated by Tigrayans, who are approximately 6 percent of the population, and others are marginalized. Although the country follows an ethnically-based federal government system, the individual states are powerless and the parties which represent each state and ethnic group in the ruling coalition, Ethiopian People Democratic From (EPRDF), are no more than puppets.

The dominant party, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which represents the people of Tigray, came to power in 1991. The party’s first goal was to build “the greatest Tigray” while it was fighting with the communist regime known as Dereg, which ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987.

However, after the downfall of Dere, TPLF changed its program and orchestrated the creation of these political parties which represent their respective ethnic groups, and it then formed the coalition, EPRDF, now a tool used by the TPLF to legitimize its power and to exercise absolute control over most aspects of people’s lives: society, the government, and the military.

The federal system in Ethiopia came into effect in 1994 and was said to have been designed to protect and empower ethnic minorities. However, it has practically provided nothing for minorities and so has failed to change their situation.

The regime in Ethiopia explicitly interferes with the rights of disadvantaged ethnic groups and has been a source of contention for decades. The country started to feel the tension since TPLF came to power in 1991. And this tension has got intensity over time, and caused the ongoing political turmoil.

Monopolization of the Economic and Exploitation

The TPLF exercises absolute control not only over the politics but also the economy. The party controls significant portions of the economy through its own companies and affiliate business institutions. It has exploited the country’s resources and built a business empire which makes billions of dollars of profit by further marginalizing other minority groups. According to Rene Lefort, a well-known observer, the public and para-public companies that are affiliated with TPLF control two-thirds of the country’s economy.

On top of that, land-grabbing has become a fashion in recent times and has disappointed many ethnic groups whose livelihood relies heavily on their land. The regime not only steals land from these marginalized groups and gives it to its own affiliates and supporters, but also sells it to foreign companies.

Authorities say these large scale land transfers are part of the development plan of the country. However, human right groups that oppose the practice argue that this not only violates the rights of minority groups but also destroys their livelihood. The Human Right Watch stated in its report that this large scale land transfer and subsequent displacement results only in poverty and hunger.

The Oakland institute has reported that a land equivalent of an area nearly the size of France was forcefully taken from farmers and indigenous people and given to foreign investors for agricultural purposes in the past few years. According to these reports, thousands were displaced in the past few years to make way for the illegal transactions, and those who resisted the authorities were intimidated, arrested, tortured and killed.

Many observers argue that the people of Ethiopia were left with no other option, but protest. They believe that unless the regime makes real and complete political reform which meet the need of Ethiopians who are currently so oppressed and marginalized, the protest wouldn’t stop.",Ethiopia’s Crisis: What is Causing the Political Turmoil and Ethnic Tension?,https://www.africa.com/ethiopias-crisis-causing-political-turmoil-ethnic-tension/

If approved by parliament, Abiy Ahmed, who also currently heads the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) – an EPRDF member party - will replace Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who announced his resignation in February “in an effort to facilitate reforms.”

“Abiy’s election could herald a new dawn in Ethiopia if it is followed by concrete steps to implement far-reaching reforms towards respect for human rights in the country,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

“If approved as prime minister, Abiy and his government must take urgent measures to address the human rights crisis in Ethiopia, through concrete and genuine reforms.”

Abiy’s elevation to the helm of the ruling coalition comes at a time when the country has declared a state of emergency, the second of its kind in less than two years, imposing severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights and freedoms at a time when Ethiopians are demanding greater freedom and respect for human rights in their country.

In one of the most shocking incidents since the announcement of the state of emergency on 16 February, security forces killed at least 12 civilians and wounded many more in the southern town of Moyale. The Command Post for the state of emergency admitted wrongful killings of civilians in Moyale, alleging it was caused by “mistaken intelligence report”.

Over the weekend, 12 recently released political prisoners, including Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience Eskinder Nega, were re-arrested in Addis Ababa, barely a month after release. Another 19 people, including academics, were also arrested in Bahir Dar, in the Amhara region.

“The killings of civilians, re-arrest of recently released political prisoners and the new wave of arrests bodes ill for the long-promised reform agenda in Ethiopia,” said Salil Shetty.

“If endorsed by parliament, Abiy’s new government must start by releasing all prisoners of conscience and reforming or repealing all repressive laws, including the draconian Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and the Ethiopian Charities and Societies Proclamation, which have played a significant role in rolling back the human rights gains in the country.”",Incoming Ethiopian prime minister must address deep-rooted human rights crisis,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/incoming-ethiopia-prime-minister-must-address-deep-rooted-human-rights-crisis/
14,ethiopia,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia - ""Did you know that Ethiopia gets its name from the Greek word Aethiopia, first used by Homer?"" Greek Ambassador to Ethiopia Nikolaos Patakias says proudly.

Sitting in his office in the capital Addis Ababa, Patakias shows an ancient Greek romantic novel, The Aethiopica. It's a love story about the relationship between the daughter of the queen of Ethiopia and a Greek descendant of Achilles.

Also in his possession are photographs of relics from the ancient Ethiopian Kingdom of Axum. These include the famous Ezana Stone and some gold coins, both of which have ancient Greek scripture written on them.

""Tradition counts for a lot in Ethiopia and Greece, we follow it by the book,"" says businessman Odysseas Parris, 57, sitting in a Greek restaurant close to the ambassador's residence.

""We're very lucky because we get to enjoy festivities from both cultures.""

As he sips his frappe - Greek iced coffee - and his wife Anastasia Mitsopoulou smokes and talks expressively with friends, they are unmistakably Mediterranean.





Yet Parris and Mitsopoulou are two of Addis Ababa's second generation Ethio-Greeks. Both of Parris' grandfathers were Greek and grandmothers Ethiopian. He, and his parents before him, were born in Ethiopia.

Mitsopoulou's story is similar, though she is also part Italian. But being part of what are arguably two of the world's proudest and most ancient cultures isn't always easy, says Mitsopoulou, a teacher at the Greek Community School.

""Neither country really accepts us as one of them. In Greece we are Ethiopians, and in Ethiopia we are Greeks,"" she says with a sigh.

Greek sailors and merchants began emigrating to Ethiopia in significant numbers in the late 1800s. It is likely some were refugees of the Greek Genocide, Greek Civil War, and later the military dictatorship.

In its heyday, the embassy here estimates the Greek community numbered between 5,000 and 6,000 people.

Influential members of society

Eleni Tsimas, 80, is at the Greek Orthodox Church in Piazza, Addis' old Italian quarter. Although an ethnic Greek, Tsimas was born in Ethiopia to parents who ran a small business. Asked if she feels more Ethiopian or more Greek, she quickly replies, ""I am Ethiopian. In Greece I am a foreigner. What to do?""

From age 18, she worked at Bambis, a pharmacy, grocery and eventually supermarket owned by a rich Greek family who moved to Addis in 1890. In the subsequent decades, Greeks became influential members of Ethiopian society and were among the closest advisers to Haile Selassie, the Ethiopian emperor and Rastafarian messiah famous for resisting Italian dictator Mussolini's invasion.

""I met him many times, we'd go to the palace. He was something special. He would stop the car and give us golden coins,"" remembers Tsimas, who ended up marrying into the Bambis family.

But like thousands of other Greeks, the Bambis fled Ethiopia in the '70s following a revolution that overthrew the royal family, installing the Derg communist dictatorship that ruled the country from 1974 to 1987. With this came the nationalisation of all property and hostility towards foreigners, so most of the Ethio-Greek community left.

This included Tsimas and her husband. ""They came with guns to take over the shop, claiming it as public property,"" she recalls.

Always yearning to return to Ethiopia during their 20 years in Greece, after the Derg regime fell Tsimas' husband saw Bambis was up for auction and won the bid. Today, they run the supermarket together.

""I started at age 18 and at age 80 I am back again. Yesterday I worked from eight in the morning until eight in the evening. I always work. I even delivered my children in the grocery,"" Tsimas says with a chuckle.

Greek community today

On the eve of Greek Independence Day there is a buzz in the Santorini Greek Restaurant as members and friends of the community drop in and out, frenetically discussing celebration plans. As everyone sits at one big table chatting, popcorn - made traditionally as part of Ethiopian coffee ceremonies - is brought as a snack to have with drinks. Greek salads, souvlaki and tzatziki soon follow.

Around the table are second generation Ethio-Greeks, half-Ethiopian Greeks who have recently moved to Addis, and Ethiopians who are in some way connected to Greece through study, work or marriage.

Later in the evening, Ambassador Patakias and his family swing by for dinner and to show off posters they have made for the celebration, set to be even bigger than usual this year. As well as a special ceremony at the Greek Orthodox Church, and a showcase of Greek dancing and poetry at the Greek Community School, an official party is being held at the Greek Club - and Alternate Foreign Minister for European Affairs George Katrougalos will be in attendance.

These institutions in the city are at the heart of the now 500-person small Greek community in Addis. But a number of those interviewed said infighting has left some Ethio-Greeks feeling excluded. Community leaders, some say, lead with an iron fist and resist change. Some spoke of financial disputes, others of backward attitudes, such as prejudice against Turkish people who came to play a friendly sports match at the Greek Club.

Gabriel Shebale, an Ethiopian doctor who lived in Athens for nearly 30 years, is a friend of the community. He agrees there are issues ""because they often only interact with each other, and are not the largest community. They develop a ghetto-like system. The infighting makes the community weaker,"" he says.

The new Ethio-Greeks

Barbara Gembiaou owns the restaurant, which she runs with the help of her brother Filippos. Born in Greece but half-Ethiopian, Gembiaou moved to Addis eight years ago and set up Santorini shortly afterwards. Filippos followed a year later.

Both now have families in Ethiopia (new Ethio-Greeks) and they seem settled for now. Painted the Greek national colours of blue and white, the mainly al fresco restaurant full of dusty trinkets and old postcards has the homely feel of a Greek taverna.

The siblings are two of an increasing number of Greeks - some with Ethiopian heritage, others not - who moved to Ethiopia after the start of the Greek financial crisis in 2007. This is what brought back Shebale, the Ethiopian doctor, who said that with the crisis came increasingly negative attitudes towards foreigners.

Meanwhile, the embassy is encouraging Greeks to invest in Ethiopia's agriculture, technology, textile and export industries. Ambassador Patakias recently stated in the local media that trade between the two countries has risen from 12 million euros (roughly $14.7m today) in 2013 to 22.5 euros million (roughly $27.6m today) in 2016, and he expects it to increase at an even faster rate over the next few years.

'Magical culture'

But Gembiaou makes it clear she didn't set up her restaurant solely for business reasons.

""It's our house and we invite people in. As you've seen this place doesn't feel like a restaurant - you're only reminded it is when you have to pay before you leave,"" she says, adding, ""It's the soul of this place that makes it Greek.""

""Ethiopian culture is something magical for me and I still haven't discovered it all yet,"" explains Gembiaou, who sees many similarities between the two cultures.

""First there's the religion which gives you a culture, even if you don't believe. The fact that Ethiopia was never colonised is also important. They are very proud, as the Greeks are of how they freed their heritage from the Ottomans. So that makes our connection stronger.""

The restaurant owner goes on to highlight more day-to-day cultural similarities.

""Ethiopian and Greek TV dramas are similar. And coffee culture - we can both meet for coffee and pass three hours talking without realising it,"" she says with a laugh.

Gembiaou's initial reason for visiting Ethiopia was personal. ""After my father died we discovered among his personal things that we have a brother here who he left behind, so I came to find him,"" she explains.

Gembiaou found her brother - and even ended up marrying the Ethio-Greek who helped her locate him. The two have one child together, though they are now divorced.

A captain in the Royal Ethiopian Navy, Barbara and Filippos' Ethiopian father travelled to Greece to train as part of a bilateral agreement between the two countries. He later went on to set up the first Ethiopian restaurant in the country.

""My father was one of the committee to sign the contract between the two navies 60 years ago,"" Gembiaou says with pride.

She adds this is particularly relevant today as the during the Greek minister's visit a similar agreement will be signed, giving young Ethiopian seafarers the opportunity to work on Greek vessels.

Gembiaou pauses for a minute and then adds: ""I feel extremely happy about this because for me it's like history making circles.""",Ethiopia: The last Greeks of Addis Ababa,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/ethiopia-greeks-addis-ababa-180402114937892.html

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

The Government of Ethiopia is appealing for US$1.66 billion to provide support in agriculture and livestock, education, emergency shelter and non-food items (NFI), food, health, nutrition, protection and water, and sanitation and hygiene for 7.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Just under half of the target population are children. The Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) was released on 13 March 2018. While the document focuses on the immediate response requirements for 2018, it also lays out the basis for a three-pillared model that will allow for further planning and development investments, in line with a disaster risk management approach.

On 10 March 2018, a security incident between the Ethiopian Defence Forces in Moyale led to the death of 10 civilians and the injury of several others. The incident led to the displacement of over 10,000 people across the border to Kenya. In Kenya, the Kenyan Red Cross has reported that 80 per cent of the displaced are women and children and that there are about 600 pregnant women among the 10,557 refugees, who are being provided with basic supplies including food and water. These figures are currently being validated by the Kenyan Refugee Affairs Secretariat and UNHCR. On 21 March, the Secretariat of the State of Emergency Command Post stated that the displaced residents of Moyale who fled to Kenya are returning home. The Government of Ethiopia also announced that the State of Emergency inquiry board will investigate the deaths of civilians. A joint mission to assess the humanitarian situation in Moyale town took place from 23 to 26 March. The team, led by UNOCHA, included WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and UNDSS. The team was advised that essential services were disrupted immediately after the security incident; however, essential services are now operational. The team recommended to pre-position humanitarian supplies in order to immediately respond to any future needs.

Ethiopia continues to receive refugees and, as of 28 February 2018, 909,301 refugees were reported in Ethiopia. In the first two months of 2018, 15,097 refugees arrived in Ethiopia, including 7,202 in February.

“H. Res. 128 recognizes Ethiopia’s efforts to promote regional peace and security, and its partnership with the U.S. to combat terrorism, promote economic growth, and address health challenges. In addition, the resolution expresses concern about human rights abuses and contracting democratic space, and condemns excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces.

“The resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to lift the state of emergency, end the use of excessive force, release wrongfully imprisoned protesters, and improve transparency, while at the same time urging protesters and opposition groups to use peaceful discussion and avoid incitement.

“The resolution calls on the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development to cooperate and strengthen ties with Ethiopia, condemn human rights abuses, and promote accountability.”

Gov’t and UN brief Member States on Ethiopia humanitarian situation

On 21 March 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and the UN presented the 2018 humanitarian and disaster resilience plan (HDRP) to member states in Geneva. The HDRP seeks US$1.6 billion to provide emergency and long-term assistance for 7.88 million people affected by drought, floods and conflict with relief food or cash, and 8.49 million people with non-food assistance. According to the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Ethiopia Mrs. Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, all the needs to be addressed through the HDRP are immediate, and acute and massive.

Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator. Ms. Ursula Mueller who chaired the briefing reaffirmed the Secretary-General’s remarks at the High-Level event held in Addis Ababa in January 2017 that ‘Solidarity is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of justice and self-interest.’ The ASG reminded member states of the need for early action as the alarm bells are ringing by the end of March. “Today, the World Food Program’s ability to cover the emergency food needs of 1.8 million people in the Somali Region is in peril. Some $50 million is required to cover the costs of two rounds of emergency food assistance for those affected by drought – and, increasingly – conflict along the Oromia-Somali regional border. Supplies to treat moderate acute malnutrition are also at risk should timely and adequate funding not be secured.” The Government of Ethiopia has already committed $182 million for drought and IDP response and rehabilitation.

Protests in Ethiopia are the culmination of a long-simmering series of grievances and demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity.

After 3 years of relentless protests, Ethiopia started 2018 with rare good news. On January 3, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and his party pledged to release political prisoners and shut down the notorious Maekelawi detention center in Addis Ababa. In a 3-hour-long press conference, leaders of the ruling Ethiopian People‘s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) also took responsibility for the myriad of political challenges facing the country. The aim, EPRDF leaders said, was to foster national reconciliation and to widen democratic space. The announcement was roundly welcomed, including by a leery opposition, as a crucial step in the right direction.

A series of mixed signals followed. More than 6,000 political prisoners, including key opposition figures, journalists, and leaders of the country’s Muslim community, were released from prison. Not long after, on February 15, Hailemariam resigned saying he wanted to pave the way for reforms. It appeared that Africa’s second most populous nation was truly poised to turn a page on its repressive past. Not a day later, however, on February 16, authorities imposed a sweeping 6-month-long state of emergency. The decree was ratified by the EPRDF-controlled Parliament in a disputed vote on March 2.

More than 60 casualties have been reported since the state of emergency came into effect. In southern Ethiopia, thousands have fled violence and sought shelter and urgent humanitarian assistance in Kenya. The latest displacement is in addition to the more than 1.2 million people internally displaced, most of them in 2017, by a tit-for-tat border conflict between Oromia and Somali States, two of the largest of Ethiopia‘s nine linguistically based regional states. The humanitarian, security, and political crises are the most serious facing Ethiopia since 1991, when the communist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown.

To tackle these and other challenges, the 36-member executive leadership of the EPRDF held a series of high-stakes meetings. While they agree there is a problem, they are divided over how to respond to growing public pressure and ethnic discord. As a result, once a unified vanguard party, the EPRDF is now riven by a bitter power struggle. The heightened jostling for control of the party’s policy direction has brought to the fore long-suppressed questions of inequity in the EPRDF.

How Did Ethiopia Get to This Point?

To understand the current state of flux in Ethiopia, consider the EPRDF’s history. Founded in 1989, the EPRDF is, in theory, a coalition of four ethnically based political organizations: the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM).

At the time of the EPRDF’s founding, Mengistu Haile Mariam’s communist regime was on its last leg. The Cold War was coming to an end. Having set its sights on political power in Addis Ababa, the TPLF, which had led the armed insurgency against Mengistu, needed partners to cross into the vast region south of its base in northern Ethiopia. So it orchestrated the creation of the ANDM, the OPDO, and later the SEPDM.

Once the EPRDF came to power, a multinational federation, which promised self-determination for every nation, nationality, and people in Ethiopia, was forged as a compromise between ethnonationalists and unionists who favored a centralized Ethiopian polity. This approach, explicitly organizing the Ethiopian state along ethnic lines, was a stark departure from the emphasis on a single Ethiopian national identity promoted by the Mengistu regime and Emperor Haile Selassie before it. The 1995 Constitution called for decentralization and a significant degree of self-rule for states, promises that remained largely on paper.

From the beginning, the EPRDF proved to be a coalition of unequal partners. For example, each member party has 45 representatives in the powerful 180-member EPRDF Council, even though ethnic Tigrayans constitute just 6 percent of the country’s population. Moreover, the TPLF enjoys absolute control of the military and the security establishment as well as key economic sectors. The TPLF also controlled the office of Prime Minister until 2012, and the Foreign Ministry until 2015.

The power imbalance gave rise to charges of undue Tigrayan influence over the country’s political life. TPLF leaders vacillated between acknowledgement and entitlement, given the party’s outsized role in liberating Ethiopia from the tyranny of the Mengistu regime. The ascendancy of the minority Tigrayans displaced from power the more populous Amhara, who had played the dominant role in Ethiopian political life for most of the previous century.

This Tigrayan dominance was further fortified through strict party discipline known as democratic centralism, which encouraged constituent parties to engage in vigorous internal deliberations but mandated all to adhere to the ruling party’s policy direction once a vote was taken. Moreover, as EPRDF leaders have acknowledged, the TPLF maintained covert influence inside the EPRDF by propping up and empowering loyalists. These grievances gradually gave way to growing resentment against the TPLF and, more recently, ethnic Tigrayans.

The Context of Ongoing Protests

The Ethiopian protests are the culmination of a long-building series of grievances. After the disputed 2005 elections in which the EPRDF resorted to brutal violence to maintain power, the party embarked on a developmental state model, characterized by active state intervention in the economy as a way to boost its political legitimacy. But this effort was accompanied by a heightened muzzling of critics and the media as well as controlling access to information. It also meant the institutionalization of the instruments of repression.

While the EPRDF faced some level of opposition at every turn in its 25-year rule, the floodgates opened in 2014 when the Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, began protesting against the government’s land policy. The protests coalesced around a single Oromo axiom: “The matter of land is the matter of life.” The specific trigger was an urban master plan, which sought to expand Addis Ababa’s physical boundaries deep into the surrounding Oromia State. Surprisingly, the first sign of resistance came from within the OPDO, a one-time docile party seen among the Oromo as the TPLF’s puppet.

The EPRDF seemed to be caught off guard by the scale of the protests. Security forces responded to largely peaceful protests using disproportionate force. This engendered more outrage and protests. Many dozens of people were killed and thousands arrested.

Protests briefly subsided ahead of the May 2015 national elections, in which the EPRDF and its partners claimed 100 percent of the seats in Parliament. However, Oromo protests returned when authorities attempted to forge ahead with the Addis Ababa expansion plan. A massive security dragnet ensued, leading to the deaths of even more people and the arrest of tens of thousands. By then, the initial opposition to the “land grab” and concerns over the dispossession of Oromo farmers from Addis Ababa had grown to include protesting historic Oromo marginalization, the lack of freedom and economic opportunities, and demanding the release of political prisoners.

Under pressure, authorities shelved the urban master plan and made other cosmetic changes, including a cabinet reshuffle, which saw Tigrayans ceding control of the Foreign Ministry. But EPRDF leaders left popular demands for greater democratic rights, equal economic opportunities, and state autonomy virtually untouched.

In October 2016, the protests were curbed with the declaration of a state of emergency. When martial law was lifted 10 months later, the protests returned evermore vigorously. Crucially, the protests had by then spread to other regions, particularly Amhara State and a number of localities in the southern region.

Some of the grievances were localized but the overarching theme was the same: the gap between constitutional guarantees for democracy versus the existing centralized state and authoritarian party that controlled all aspects of life. For example, in Wolkait, an administrative district in Tigray State, ethnic Amharas wanted to be part of the Amhara State and send their children to school in Amharic. A two-decade effort to settle the matter through legal and political means was repeatedly frustrated. Those frustrations fed into wider resentment over Tigrayan hegemony.

In Oromia, the epicenter of the opposition, the OPDO faced a legitimacy crisis. It was buckling under the weight of protests and accusations of corruption and incompetence from other EPRDF partners. This pressure helped bring to power a new generation of OPDO party cadres who were not wedded to the legacy of armed struggle. They made bold overtures to Oromo nationalism and embraced most of the protesters’ grievances, vowing to reform their party and the EPRDF to address the Oromo question or to join the protesters if their reform efforts failed.

As the OPDO positioned itself as a quasi-opposition party, the TPLF was also trying to clean its own house. Facing inevitable decline and waning influence, the TPLF held a 35-day-long evaluation session in October 2017 that culminated in demotions of top party officials and a rare public display of self-criticism.

It is against this backdrop that EPRDF leaders, in large part to meet the OPDO’s demands, agreed to free political prisoners in January 2018. The freed prisoners were welcomed by a groundswell of public support and homecoming celebrations.

It is also important to recognize the leading role that youth, having come of age under the EPRDF’s one-party rule, have played in the protests. This underscores the major demographic transformations that have accompanied the calls for change. Ethiopia had an estimated total population of 52 million in 1990. It is now projected to be over 105 million with more than 70 percent of the population under the age of 30. Simultaneous to this was a rural-to-urban migration of young people. However, the pace of local job creation has not matched the number of college graduates. The influx in mobile phone usage and improved access to communications technology, meanwhile, means that this generation is far more connected to one another and to the outside world than any before it. These factors have all contributed to the resiliency of the protests.

The Way Forward

The EPRDF and, indeed, Ethiopia are at a crossroads. Resilient demands for greater freedom, equity, and opportunity indicate that the status quo is untenable. Reliance on military and security measures to quell opposition have proven futile. The EPRDF’s diagnosis of the problem in January was largely correct: the answer to Ethiopia’s malaise is greater democratic space and national reconciliation. This will require vacating the emergency decree, which has proven counterproductive to the party’s stated reform plans. It will also be necessary to address the root problems: the inequity within the governing coalition and the need for legitimacy.

A priority for reestablishing stability, therefore, should be to engage opposition parties in good faith negotiations setting forth a path for genuine popular dialogue and reconciliation. This process would entail freeing all political prisoners and setting in motion legal and political reforms to undo some of the most coercive measures that have brought the party and country to the precipice of collapse. These reforms would include the repeal of the Freedom of the Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation, the Charities and Societies Proclamation, and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. These sweeping pieces of legislation have been used to curtail opposition activities, muzzle independent journalists, and silence government critics.

Through heavy state involvement in the economy, Ethiopia has registered modest growth over the last decade. Events of the last several years illustrate that this authoritarian developmental model has backfired and is coming to a dead end. Continued efforts to subdue an increasingly restive population through repressive measures now risk unraveling the economy and the country‘s fragile federation.

It is remarkable that despite the mounting grievances, the protests have largely remained peaceful. This suggests the crisis can be resolved without widespread instability. However, the continued tug-of-war between protesters and the security sector is testing public patience. It will also embolden those who insist on armed rebellion as the only way to bring about change—a quintessential story for Ethiopia, which in its long history has never had a peaceful transfer of power.

All parties committed to Ethiopia’s stability should emphasize that only genuine dialogue and reform can avert a further deterioration.

Their middle class is growing, and they have become a regional superpower, who is a friend of the United States. Their military is professional and capable, and they are punching above their weight in the war against terrorism that continues to plague the continent. They promote regional peace and security by being one of the top troop contributors to UN peacekeeping missions around the world.

The last few years have been tough domestically for Ethiopia on a number of fronts, but that’s not surprising for a country that’s continuing to transition from a communist to a democratic nation.

The good news is that the Ethiopian government understands that human rights and governance conditions need to improve. That’s why the timing and negative, condescending tone of this resolution could not be worse and would work against the authors’ intent. It would undercut the new prime minister at just the time he needs to be encouraged.

Just one week ago, Dr. Abiy Ahmed was sworn in as Ethiopia’s new prime minister on a mandate to improve these exact issues. He is a personal friend of mine; in fact, I was with him on my last visit in October, and we prayed together for Ethiopia’s disunity to be healed.

During his inauguration, Prime Minister Abiy stated his commitment to accountability, justice, freedom, and the rule of law. He expressed his commitment to allowing true democracy (and by extension, political parties of all persuasions) to flourish, underscoring why he is the one who has what it takes to bring real change to Ethiopia.

We should give Prime Minister Abiy the opportunity to prove himself as a national leader before having the full weight of the United States House of Representatives tossed against him. A heavy-handed, strongly-worded resolution condemning his government, so soon after being sworn in, will severely curtail Abiy’s ability to enact needed reforms. In fact, they could backfire by fueling opposition groups in Ethiopia to undermine his entire administration.

Now is not the time to move a resolution with a tone like this. Ethiopia is a key friend, and Prime Minister Abiy deserves a chance at a strong start. The House can give him that by rejecting H. Res. 128.

Ethiopia would like them back. The V&A’s director, Tristram Hunt, has suggested a long-term loan. The Ethiopian government has welcomed Hunt’s offer. And there, for now, the matter rests.

The treasures, which include an 18th-century gold crown and a royal wedding dress, are part of a fascinating and beautiful collection with a tragic and little-known history. They were seized by the British in 1868 and have been in the V&A ever since. But the circumstances of their seizure, and the consequences, deserve to be much better known.

Looted Ethiopian treasures in UK could be returned on loan Read more

Even most of those who know something of British imperial history are unlikely to know much about the 1868 invasion of Abyssinia which lies at the root of the current debate about the future of these treasures. That’s because the Abyssinia campaign barely features in the dominant historical narratives about British imperial power. The discredited heroic narrative of imperial Britain had prominent places for the conquest of north America, India and even South Africa. The critical big post-colonial narrative that replaced it concentrated on India, the Middle East, the Atlantic slave trade and even Ireland. But the Abyssinia campaign has remained on the margins of both.

The 1868 war gets a passing ironic mention as one of the “justifiable wars” of the 19th century in 1066 and All That. The tragic and poignant fate of the Abyssinian Prince Alemayehu, who was brought to Britain with the treasure in 1868, is possibly marginally better known than the events that gave rise to it. Alemayehu met Queen Victoria and was sent to Rugby school. He died in Headingley, Leeds, at the age of 18 while staying under the care of his former tutor Cyril Ransome, father of the children’s author (and Guardian journalist) Arthur Ransome, and is buried in Windsor Castle. Alemayehu’s exile has recently been the subject of a film and a radio programme. But the wider truth is that this is a forgotten story – except in Ethiopia.

Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, was on the wrong side of Africa to be caught up in the Atlantic slave trade, though always vulnerable to the Arab slave trade. It was too mountainous and isolated to be routinely involved in the struggles between Britain, France and Turkey to control the Red Sea and the route to India. And when the European colonial “rush for Africa” began in earnest in the mid-19th century, it offered too few easy pickings in terms of minerals, cash crops and settlement.

Nineteenth-century Abyssinia, with its ancient culture and its dominant Coptic Christian religion, was both a place apart for the European powers and a place with real, if uneasy, connections to the neighbouring Ottoman Turkish world that dominated north-east Africa and the Middle East. When, in 1855, a remarkable local ruler called Kassa unified Abyssinia’s many provinces and crowned himself the Emperor Tewodros, the outside world began to be aware of one of the great African leaders of the 19th century.

Tewodros was a man of enormous energy and ambition. His aim, never fulfilled, was to create a modern nation state. Though he always struggled to maintain control, he abolished feudal dues, paid salaries to judges and local governors, outlawed bribery, confiscated firearms, forbade the slave trade and abolished polygamy. His growing power attracted foreign governments. A British diplomat visited him in 1855. And in 1862, after receiving a present of two pistols from Britain, Tewodros wrote to Queen Victoria with an audacious proposal. As the great Christian emperor of the south, he proposed an alliance with the great Christian empress of the north. Together, their armies would unite – and drive the Muslim Ottomans from the holy places in Jerusalem.

It was a fateful letter. Lord Palmerston’s government in London had no intention of getting involved. The letter was ignored. Tewodros responded by taking hostage the handful of Europeans in the country, including a British emissary. For years, efforts were made to negotiate the hostages’ release. But Britain’s refusal to send aid workers or to join in the Jerusalem adventure made that impossible. The situation festered and Tewodros’s power began to decline. In 1868, in an operation costing £9m – the equivalent of more than £1bn today – Britain sent an army of 13,000 troops. In April of that year, the British overwhelmed Tewodros’s army at the fortress of Maqdala. In a scene worthy of the climax of a Verdi opera, Tewodros committed suicide with one of the pistols from Queen Victoria.

Tewodros was unquestionably a tragic victim of British imperial might

With Tewodros dead, the British withdrew. The troops went back to India. The freed hostages went home. The railways that had been built to carry military equipment up from the Red Sea coast was pulled up. The Maqdala treasures, along with Tewodros’s son, were taken to Britain. The prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, told MPs that “We are about to vacate the country in a manner which will prove to the world the purity of our purpose.”

The Abyssinia war is an unusual episode in the British imperial story. It was not a war of plunder, of imperial rivalry or annexation. Politicians at the time thought it was a war about prestige. The British did it because they could. They had the wealth and the weapons; the Ethiopians had neither. Though Tewodros never ruled a stable Abyssinia, his overthrow weakened the fragile state at great human cost. Tewodros was unquestionably a tragic victim of British imperial might.

Abyssinia would be invaded twice more, defeating the Italians in their historic victory at Adowa in 1896, and then being brutally attacked by Mussolini in 1935. Today, Disraeli’s claims of moral purity are not words that anyone would use. And nor should they rule out the return of the Maqdala treasures.

Awol Allo in an interview with Radio France International () held that the development which took place over the weekend was, however, not a surprise to most watchers of Ethiopian politics over the past few years.

He said for the government to order the fresh detention of these people was a sign that it lacked the ideas to steer the country away from the current crisis. Ethiopia is without a substantive Prime Minister and is currently under a six-month state of emergency imposed on February 16.

“… the fact that this is happening at a time that we have a state of emergency and these are highly popular individuals, very high profile politicians re-arrested again says very clearly (I think) to everyone that is watching that the government has no clear vision, clear policy to get out of the current crisis,” he said.

And they are taking such a long long time to appoint a new Prime Minister shows very clearly that the former Prime Minister wasn't really in control at the time and that there were other people who call the shots behind the scene.

About a dozen politicians and journalists were arrested during a gathering in the town of Bahir Dar in the Amhara regional state. A lawyer associated with some of them said they were held for displaying a banned national flag and meeting without permit contrary to state of emergency rules.

According to Allo, the conflicting and contradictory signals sent by the regime all but lacked logic given the basis for the release of the re-arrested group and the incidents that followed their release.

Commenting on the lack of a Prime Minsiter, he said it was indicative of the fact that outgoing Hailemariam Desalegn was not in control over the last five years. “The fact that the ruling establishment didn’t care much about the resignation of the Prime Minister, he added.

“And they are taking such a long long time to appoint a new Prime Minister shows very clearly that the former Prime Minister wasn’t really in control at the time and that there were other people who call the shots behind the scene.”",Ethiopia re-arrests shows govt has no clear policy to exit crisis – Lawyer,http://www.africanews.com/2018/03/26/ethiopia-re-arrests-shows-govt-has-no-clear-policy-to-exit-crisis-lawyer/
