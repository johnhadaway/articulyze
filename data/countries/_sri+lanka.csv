0,sri+lanka,"Many of you will have heard the very sad news of the recent passing of our dear friend and colleague, Ms. Una McCauley, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka.

Ms. McCauley’s funeral took place on 2nd March and included two beautiful memorials; one for UN staff and another for the members of the Government of Sri Lanka, for development partners, civil society and friends. The large crowds who attended both memorials attest to the number of people that Una McCauley touched during her life.

As the first female UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Ms. McCauley was a bold, inspiring, and strong leader. As the most senior UN Official in the country, Ms. McCauley led the UN Country Team of 21 Resident and Non-Resident UN Agencies and acted as the representative of the UN Secretary-General in Sri Lanka. She was a passionate and caring humanitarian, and dedicated her life to serve people of the world.

Ms. McCauley served in Sri Lanka for six years; two years as UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, and prior to this, four years as the UNICEF Representative in Sri Lanka. Previously, she was the UNICEF Representative for Panama and Togo, and worked at the UNICEF offices in Sudan, Kenya, and Angola. With 17 years of service within the United Nations System and an additional 7 years of service working with children in the development sector, Ms. McCauley was instrumental in developing policies and strategic frameworks on leading global issues in a number of countries.

A national of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Ms. McCauley, was the loving mother of two sons.

The United Nations family will miss her dearly, especially her sense of humour, humility, passion, energy, and unwavering commitment to make lives better for all. Our deepest condolences are shared with her family.",http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/announcements/2018/un-mourns-passing-of-the-resident-coordinator-in-sri-lanka.html
1,sri+lanka,"The UN says it has allocated 11 million dollars (about N4 billion) to help 60,000 internally displaced people in Borno and other humanitarian operations in North-east Nigeria.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said nine billion dollars (about N3.2 billion) would be used to provide life-saving aid for some 60,000 people displaced by ongoing Boko Haram crisis in Borno.

The UN relief agency explained that the money was an allocation from the UN-managed country-based humanitarian assistance fund.

The UN quoted Mr Edward Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, as saying: “The crisis continues to displace thousands of vulnerable women, children and men every week.

“Many have gone through unspeakable hardship and the UN and its partners remain committed to help alleviate their suffering.’’

Set up through the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF), the assistance includes two million dollars (about N720 million) in support to the UN Humanitarian Air Service for frontline responders in the region.

“This UN fund give us the flexibility to prioritise those who are most in need of aid and act swiftly for the good of the people of north-east Nigeria,” Kallon said.

The UN said the North-east region’s humanitarian crisis, sparked mainly by Boko Haram’s years-long insurgency, remained one of the most severe globally.

“In the worst-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, at least 7.7 million people are in need this year, with about 80 per cent, or 6.1 million, targeted for humanitarian assistance.

“The nine million dollars allocation will help fund 15 projects supporting humanitarian rapid response in areas affected by large-scale conflict-related displacements, particularly in the northern parts of Borno, along the Maiduguri-Monguno axis.

“In just three months, the close to 30,000 people who have fled violence in hard-to-reach areas are in dire need of food, water, shelter, clothes and medical services.

“Additionally, the funds will help scale up the response near the border with Cameroon in eastern Borno – Gwoza, Bama, Dikwa, Kala-Balge, Monguno, Askira/Uba – and northern Adamawa – Madagali – where approximately another 30,000 have arrived following military operations.

“Finally, the funds will also help maintain UN Humanitarian Air Service operations, crucial to reach and deliver aid in remote areas of the North-east, especially where roads are unusable,” the UN said.

It explained that under the leadership of Kallon, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, the NHF is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

This is to provide flexible and timely funds for basic life-saving support, the UN said, adding to date it has raised 48 million dollars (over N17 billion) in contributions and pledges.

The NHF is one of 18 country-based pooled funds and was launched during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference for Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region in February 2017.

The contributions and pledges were realised through the generous support of Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Ireland, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, Canada, Spain, Luxembourg, the Arab Gulf Program for Development, Malta, Azerbaijan and Sri Lanka.

Of that 48 million dollars, 33 million dollars (about N12 billion), including this latest N3.2 billion allocation – has now been allocated to various organisations in support of the humanitarian response in North-east Nigeria.

2,sri+lanka,"MyCorps trains and empowers Malaysian youth by sending them on humanitarians missions to help marginalised communitieas in 10 countries worldwide.

The world is filled with pressing issues all the way from sanitation, housing to the bare necessities like proper food and clean water. And no one experiences these issues more than the marginalised communities across the globe.

As such MyCorps trains young, skilled and passionate humanitarians with the hope that they could eventually tackle these challenging issues. MyCorps provides a platform for Malaysian youths to serve and to have a positive impact all across the globe.

They organise frequent missions overseas where their volunteers live amongst the marginalised communities, and they work to solve the issues that they face.

Here are a few things you need to know about MyCorps, and their revolutionary missions.

1. Open for Malaysians between the ages of 18–30 years old.

MyCorps holds the belief that everyone has the potential to positively impact their community, and the world at large.

As such their only requirement is that you’re a Malaysian citizen (between 18–30 years old), and you should be passionate about working with the underprivileged and the marginalised.

You can either apply to be a volunteer in a specific vocation like Health, Construction, Education, Media and Social Entrepreneurship or you could opt to be a General Volunteer.

The MyCorps team would then determine the number of volunteers that they need in each field depending on the specific needs of the mission.

You could have an edge over other applicants if you have prior experience in volunteering or in the humanitarian field.

2. Each mission spans for 3 months.

This includes 1 month of intensive Pre-Departure Training, and 2 months of International Deployment.

Two weeks into their deployment, the volunteers conduct a needs assessment analysis where they identify gaps and problems faced by the community by speaking to the people themselves, their NGO partners, and even the local authorities.

Furthermore, there’ll be one week of project review and report writing once the team returns back to Malaysia.

After the programme is completed, all the volunteers are recognised for their efforts during the Ignition Night.

Parents, family and friends attend this event, and it’s also officiated by Malaysia’s Minister of Youth and Sport, YB Hairy Jamaluddin.

3. Participants have to attend one month of intensive training.

Known as Pre-Departure Training, participants are taught various hands-on skills related to Humanitarian and volunteerism, and are also introduced to their host countries.

These skills include fundraising, trauma healing and therapy skills, community engagement, networking, first aid skills (First Aid Examination and card granted) by top notch speakers.

The Pre-Departure Training also touches on topics like International Humanitarian Law, Sustainable Agriculture, Poverty, Malnutrition, Economy and Livelihood, Social Enterprises, Sustainable Development Goals, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).

Pre-Departure Training equips the participants with the relevant skills that are key for their mission, and it also helps them come up with creative and viable ideas.

“They can gain various knowledge and skills from the Pre-Departure Training. They can also expand networking with key players in humanitarian industry in Malaysia, and and abroad.”

“We’re very delighted because our volunteers are recognised and recruited to work with several NGOs upon completion of this program,” the MyCorps team added.

4. MyCorps wants to produce 100 volunteer leaders each year.

MyCorps usually recruits and deploys 40–50 volunteers for each of their missions.

“Our main objective is to train and develop young humanitarian leaders. By exposing them to a very challenging environment abroad, the volunteers would be able to learn and expand their knowledge and skills greatly.”

“Indirectly, MyCorps volunteers also become Social Ambassadors in the mission country, and this will further strengthen the bond between the both countries,” the team said.

“We wish to leave behind a good name and create a Malaysian legacy throughout all the countries that we’ve been to.”

They recruited and deployed 39 volunteers for their Pilot Mission, 49 and 48 volunteers for their first and second missions in Cambodia respectively, 44 were deployed in the Middle East, 49 in South Asia, and 46 in Africa.

In total they’ve conducted 6 missions with 265 volunteers.

5. So far, they’ve sent volunteers to serve in 10 countries.

Since 2015, volunteers have been sent to serve in Cambodia, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and they’re also currently working in Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.

“One of the main reasons as to why we send help to other countries is that we create projects that benefits the communities in need.”

“Our purpose and aim is not a one-time programme but we aim to create projects that are sustainable even after we leave the country, for example income generating projects, educational projects, water catchment projects for better supply of water, etc,” the MyCorps team told Jireh’s Hope.

“In MyCorps we don’t believe in giving but we believe in empowering. The community will be involved in implementing the project because we want to encourage the sense of ownership from the very beginning, and they need to learn how to manage it without the assistance of the volunteers.“

6. Volunteers completely immerse themselves and experience the challenges the underprivileged communities often face.

“We’ve always placed the volunteers within communities that lack basic needs such as water and electricity. Our volunteers in Lebanon for example stayed in refugee camps, experiencing both cold weather and harsh environments along with its occupants,” the team mentioned.

“In Bangladesh, they showered in the water ponds like the locals do. This mutual experience not only allows them to understand the community better but helps them to connect and accepted by the community, thus, making it easier for them to work together.”

MyCorps however works with various government agencies in Malaysia like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and embassies on both parts to ensure that the selected countries are safe enough for them to deploy their volunteers.

“While on the working ground, our local NGO partners are responsible to ensure safety and security of the volunteers. Of course, being away for 2 months is not an easy task but we trained them to work as 1 unit and to keep supporting each other.”

7. This year, MyCorps will be focusing on helping marginalised communities in Malaysia

“We call this project MyCorps @ Malaysia, and it is being run by MyCorps alumni who have completed their international deployment. They’ll work alongside the local community, various government, and non-government organisation to create sustainable projects all over the country,” the team promised.

“With the experiences they’ve gained from working abroad, we believe that our alumni can create great impact within our own community.”

At the same time, MyCorps will also be conducting two international missions just like the previous years.

COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China opened its first branch in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo on Wednesday evening.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was the Chief Guest at the ceremony said the opening of the Colombo branch was an important step in strengthening the island's economy and it opened a new chapter in the modern history of bilateral relations.

""The Bank of China is opening in Sri Lanka at a time when Colombo city is transforming into a megapolis. Bank of China has a crucial role to play in helping this island by strengthening our local businesses while also being able to attract more Chinese investments into the country,"" Wickremesinghe said.

The prime minister added Bank of China's success was also a testament to the rapid economic growth of China in the past three decades and while it was the fourth largest bank globally, it would not be too long before it emerged as the leading bank in the world.

Governor of the Sri Lankan Central Bank Indrajit Coomaraswamy, speaking at the ceremony, hailed the entry of the Bank of China into Colombo as a ""major landmark"" in the history of the Sri Lankan economy.

He said the bank, with its large network of branches in China and other parts of the world, will not only help expand trade in Sri Lanka but help small and medium enterprises grow and tie up with manufacturers overseas as part of international supply chains.

Chairman of the Bank of China Wang Xiquan said that the hundred-year-old institution now has 600 branches overseas and links with 1,600 financial institutions across the world.

He said, the opening of its Colombo branch will mark the beginning of a new era for the Chinese financial industry to serve Sri Lanka and its Colombo branch was an opportunity to closely focus on the overall strategic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka.

Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan described Sri Lanka as a ""time tested friend"" of China and thanked Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for the support he had given to set up a branch in Colombo.",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/29/c_137074423.htm

But Facebook chose to not block that and many other accounts, she said, while hers was peppered with death threats.",http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-srilanka-facebook-20180329-story.html
5,sri+lanka,"On March 29, this year’s iteration of the annual U.S.-led Pacific Partnership, the largest annual multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission in the Asia-Pacific, moved to Southeast Asia beginning with Indonesia. The ongoing exercise has once again put the spotlight on the evolution of U.S. drills in the region as part of its broader defense engagement.

As I have noted before, there are a whole range of U.S. or U.S.-led exercises involving Asia in general and Southeast Asia and particular, from the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise to the smaller Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training (SEACAT) exercise. Over the past few years, we have seen Washington and regional partners work on expanding some aspects of these exercises amid changing strategic realities (See: “What Did the Latest US Asia Maritime Security Exercise Achieve?”).

Pacific Partnership itself began in 2006 following the December 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of Southeast Asia. Led by the U.S. Navy in partnership with other like-minded countries and non-governmental organizations, it sees the combined force visiting several host nations every year and engaging in a variety of local outreach efforts to improve boost capabilities, build relationships, and bolster collective ability to respond to natural disasters.

The list of countries under the annual Pacific Partnership missions tends to feature a mix of continuity and change depending on the year. This year’s Pacific Partnership, which was planned for months culminating in the planning conference in mid-January, was set to feature military and civilian personnel from the United States as well as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Peru, and Japan, with mission stops including Micronesia, Sri Lanka, Japan as well as a few Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam out to June.

Several of the other distinguishing features we have seen in previous years were also set to continue this year, including the utilization of a multinational command-and-control structure (this year with a deputy mission commander from the United Kingdom and a mission chief of staff from Australia) and the highlighting of the role of women in HA/DR efforts in line with the Women Peace and Security Program initiative.

This year’s iteration of Pacific Partnership officially got underway in February, with the USNS Mercy departing the home port of San Diego on February 23, where it, along with the expeditionary fast transport ship USNS Fall River, would make separate mission stops as is usually the case.

On March 28, the U.S. Navy officially announced that Pacific Partnership was moving to Indonesia. The exercise activities in Bengkulu, Indonesia, which will last through April 12, will include civil engineering projects, conducting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) readiness drills, and partnering in community outreach engagements in the local Bengkulu community.

But of the various Southeast Asian stops, the one that has grabbed the most headlines thus far has been the Vietnam one. That is no surprise. As I have been noting in these pages, the high level of activity in U.S.-Vietnam defense ties, with some historic moves including the recent visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier there, have focused more attention to naval interactions tied to the bilateral relationship (See: “Why a First US Aircraft Carrier Vietnam Visit Matters”).",https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/us-pacific-partnership-2018-moves-to-southeast-asia/

UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday slammed the Central Bank saying it was responsible for the bond scam and the present economic crisis.

“The President, Prime Minister, the former president and the politicians are blamed for the economic crisis but no one speaks of the wrong doings which Central Bank officials are involved in"" the MP said.

He said the Central Bank officials were to be blamed for the interest rate hikes. “Can a person run a business by borrowing at 16 per cent,"" he asked.

Joint opposition MP Ranjith Soysa then asked whether the MP was saying that politicians should run the Central Bank and give the Officials of the bank to run the country,

“Sri Lanka will become another Uganda if Central Bank officials run the country,"" he said.

Mr Karunanayake said the main issue was that central bank officials remained though governments changed. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)",http://www.dailymirror.lk/147730/Ravi-blames-CB-for-economic-crisis
7,sri+lanka,"At the ongoing 37th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, Deputy UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Kate Gilmore reiterated her concerns over the slow progress on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka.

While presenting the High Commissioner’s report on promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka, Gilmore stated that in absence of willingness by the government to tackle impunity and gross violations of human rights, the High Commissioner’s office calls upon the member states to exercise universal jurisdiction.

The report specifically highlights the delays in constituting the long promised transitional justice mechanism on the atrocities and human rights abuses committed by both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

The Deputy High Commissioner’s deepening concern comes from the continual lack of compliance in implementing the comprehensive transitional justice agenda originally mandated by the Council resolution 30/01 in 2015.

This 2015 resolution was adopted following the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ Investigation report on Sri Lanka (OISL) in 2015, concerning the grave human rights violations and related crimes committed by both parties during the conflict. Last year, at the 34th Session, Sri Lanka asked for a further extension of two years to fulfill its prior commitments to the HRC.

So what has Sri Lanka achieved so far? In the last two years, Sri Lanka self-sponsored resolution 30/1, which committed to: review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act; establish a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; and set up an Office for Mission Persons and an Office for Reparations.

Unfortunately, until now the Sri Lankan government has only shown progress by setting up the Office for Missing Persons in September 2017, almost two years later, and the Office members were not appointed until two weeks before the presentation of the report in the current session.

The Sri Lankan Government has shown no sign of progress on setting up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Reparation Programme. The government had not yet made public the draft Bills for a Reparations Office and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

Furthermore, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is still in operation and used by the law enforcement agencies. In January 2017, the Committee against Torture noted that the Act is misused to curb the dissent of individuals and politicians and also restricted access to lawyers to facilitate enforced disappearances. Torture continues to be a common practice and is routinely used by police during investigations. The culture of impunity remains deeply entrenched in the system.

When ratifying the Convention on Enforced Disappearances, Sri Lanka had accepted the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearance (the Committee), but rendered the ratification ineffective by not accepting the individual complaint procedure; this would have allowed individual victims to file complaints to the Committee. Further, the domestic penal code is yet to criminalize enforced disappearance.

The report suggests that key preconditions for transitional justice remain unfulfilled. Assaults, death threats, surveillance and harassment of human rights defenders and victims of violations have continued.

The Sri Lankan government has been promising and seeking extension for implementation without showing any effective measures taken as echoed in the High Commissioner’s report. Furthermore, in repeatedly delaying and diluting the possibility of fixing accountability for gross violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, it is effectively ensuring impunity.

Victims of grievous harms remain voiceless and perpetrators can inhabit communities and go about their lives freely, thereby eroding the trust so vitally needed for sustained peace and development on the Island.

If Sri Lanka wants the international community to believe in its good intention, it must use the remaining period effectively and by 2019 implement the pledges made in the past. The government’s efforts must not aim to appease the international community but to fulfill its promise to its own minority that peace will be based on justice.",https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/transitional-justice-in-sri-lanka-from-denial-to-delay/

* Sri Lanka Navy takes delivery of the second advanced warship made in India

Fri, Mar 23, 2018, 10:30 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Mar 23, Goa: The Sri Lankan Navy on Thursday ceremonially took delivery of its second warship, built in India under a US$ 155 million contract inked for two such vessels.

The 2nd Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel (AOPV) constructed at the Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) for the mission requirements of Sri Lanka Navy, was officially handed over in India yesterday (22nd March).

Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, Chitranganee Wagiswara and Chairman and Managing Director of the GSL, Rear Admiral (Rtd) Sheker Mithal formally handed over the vessel to the Chief of Staff of Sri Lanka Navy Rear Admiral Neil Rosayro.

The construction work of the second AOPV commenced at the GSL in 2014 and the state of the art vessel is capable of conducting patrols, policing, reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and pollution control missions in Sri Lanka's maritime zones.

The first AOPV built at the Goa Shipyard was commissioned by the President Maithripala Sirisena on 2 August 2017.",http://www.colombopage.com/archive_18A/Mar23_1521824446CH.php
9,sri+lanka,"Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday reduced the responsibilities of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the backdrop of the ongoing political turmoil in the country.

The unity government of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) was thrown into a crisis after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s new party pulled off a stunning victory in local elections seen as a referendum on the ruling alliance.

Sirisena removed the control of Central Bank of Sri Lanka from Wickremesinghe in a further manifestation of the political crisis the unity government is currently faced with.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, which was also under the Prime Minister, has been brought under the Finance Ministry by Sirisena.

The changes, which sources said were against the wishes of the Prime Minister, were published in a gazette notification issued today.

The move came ahead of the next week’s no confidence motion against Wickremesinghe handed by the Joint Opposition of Rajapaksa. It is to be debated on April 4.

Wickremesinghe’s action to bring the Central Bank under his control was one of the main charges in the no confidence motion which alleges that it was a deliberate action to commit the fraud in the issues of Central Bank bonds in 2015.

Wickremesinghe’s handpicked governor of the Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran’s son-in-law’s firm was accused of committing a fraud in Bond deals.

Mahendran was sacked by Sirisena in 2016 and a Commission appointed had ruled that Mahendran’s son-in-law’s firm had made undue profits due to Mahendran’s action of providing them with inside information.

Mahendran, a Singapore national, has been issued with an arrest warrant while his son-in-law and the CEO of the firm have been in custody since early February.

Rajapaksa’s new political party, Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP), defeated Sirisena’s SLFP and Wickremesinghe’s UNP, winning 225 councils or two-thirds of the 340 councils which went to polls in February.

After registering the landslide win, Rajapaksa was quick to demand a snap general election which is scheduled to be held after August 2020.

Since the defeat, Sirisena has been seeking the removal of Wickremesinghe as the prime minister, attempting to form his own SLFP government, analysts have said.

However, in the absence of required numbers, Sirisena has to accept Wickremesinghe, they said.

Wickremesinghe has said that the result of the local body polls was a wake up call for the government.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sirisena-cuts-pm-s-duties-amid-ongoing-political-crisis-in-sri-lanka/story-xGOzbG8aJvlKlHqNz4gxJN.html
10,sri+lanka,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is seeking foreign investment from India, Japan and others amid criticism over his country’s reliance on Chinese loans for infrastructure projects.

In an interview in Colombo, Wickremesinghe defended a deal last year that gave a joint venture led by state-owned China Merchants Port Holdings Co Ltd. a 99-year lease to the southern port of Hambantota. The agreement gave Sri Lanka $1.1 billion in revenue at a time when it’s spending 80 percent of government revenues on servicing outstanding debts.

Ranil Wickremesinghe Photographer: Gian Ehrenzeller/Keystone via AP

“On Hambantota, the burden is off us, because China Merchants and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority have taken it over,” Wickremesinghe said on the sidelines of a business conference on Monday.

“We’ve been looking at inviting a broad range of foreign investors,"" he said. ""Initially the investors will come from China, Japan, India. Then the others will follow. We’d like to see them coming in from Europe.”

Since Wickremesinghe took power in 2015, he’s been under pressure to improve Sri Lanka’s finances. A previous administration secured billions of dollars worth of Chinese loans after the South Asian nation emerged battered from three decades of civil war in 2009, contributing to a debt burden that threatens to impede economic growth.

‘Tough Years’

Even with the sale of Hambantota and other concessionary measures, Sri Lanka has been forced to pursue other revenue-raising measures, including a recent tax reform. The country’s total debt to China was $5 billion at the end of 2017, according to government treasury figures.

“It’s an easing of the Chinese part of the debt burden, but we have the international sovereign bonds, so 2018, 2019 and 2020 are going to be tough years for us,” Wickremesinghe said.

Sri Lanka’s $1.5 billion 2027 bonds fell 9 cents on the dollar this year to 96.4 cents on Tuesday, near a record low since issuance last year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

The country has $1.5 billion in dollar bonds due in 2019 and another $1 billion in 2020, according to the data. Sri Lanka last paid a $500 million dollar bond in 2015.

India Worries

Sri Lanka was an early participant in China’s infrastructure-building plans that eventually became the Belt and Road Initiative backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in financing. Still, its appetite for Chinese cash waned after the debt burden forced it to sell the Hambantota port back to China Merchants Port Holdings.

The deal also prompted concern in India about its geopolitical rival China using a port close to its southern coastline for future military or strategic uses.

Public anger over Chinese debt helped Wickremesinghe rise to power three years ago with President Maithripala Sirisena in a coalition government that pledged to reevaluate China-funded projects they alleged were corrupt. But faced with few good options, the government has since negotiated concessions -- including turning a Chinese freehold land reclamation project in Colombo into a long lease -- while largely pushing ahead with the projects.

The administration’s sale of the Hambantota port in a debt-for-equity swap to China has been criticized by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had originally courted Chinese investment for his home district of Hambantota before losing power in 2015. A new political party backed by Rajapaksa triumphed over the ruling coalition parties in local elections in February.

Wickremesinghe said Monday that Sri Lanka needs to “focus on what is achievable and doable” by courting Asian investors first.

“Just as much as there is the Belt and Road Initiative, the Japanese are also taking a big initiative -- and the Indians,” he said.

Japan is interested in investing in the Colombo port, as well as the undeveloped east coast port of Trincomalee, a colonial-era British naval base, Wickremesinghe said. Indian investors have also expressed interest in a Chinese-built airport in Hambantota that’s barely used and has been criticized as a politically motivated Rajapaksa-era project.

GALLO IMAGES Steve Smith on the third day of the third test. He could not have known the impact that day would have on his career.

""We need to get it going, we've got to get it going.""

It's lunch on day three in Cape Town. The third test is starting to slip away from Australia. The ball is not swinging as it has in previous games. AB de Villiers has not even batted yet. Another lean session and the match will be lost, and with it the chance to claim the series.

Steve Smith knows this as he leads his team out onto the field. What he does not know is how the events of the next two hours will derail careers, shatter reputations and leave Australian cricket in utter disarray.

An intense rivalry

Sparks fly when Australia and South Africa play. The last series held in South Africa four years ago was marred by ugly sledging from both sides. Australia's request on the eve of the first test for the stump mics to be turned down between balls and overs was a sign the verbal barrage they had inflicted upon England in the home summer would be repeated.

They did not want their occasional swearing to be picked up but others believed the move was designed to give them free rein to chirp. One match official was heard to utter that it was only Australia that cares about this sort of stuff.

You did not need the microphone on when the first flash point of the series came. The pictures of David Warner's tirade towards Proteas opener Aiden Markram told a thousand words. Markram was being told in no uncertain terms he had just run out the team's best batsman, AB de Villiers. As de Villiers laid sprawled at the non-striker's end, the third man out in a top-order collapse, Nathan Lyon dropped a ball unnecessarily close to the dismissed batsman, costing him 15 per cent of his match fee for conduct ""contrary to the spirit of the game"".

GALLO IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES Nathan Lyon of Australia celebrates after taking a wicket during South Africa's first innings in the first test in Durban.

The Proteas recovered to make a game of it but were still soundly beaten. The focus should have been on Australia's dominant victory. Instead, the scrutiny was on the visitors' ugly behaviour.

A now infamous video of the two teams walking up the stairs to the pavilion had been leaked to South African media outlet Independent Media. Again, it was Warner. And again, no sound was needed.

The enraged vice-captain was repeatedly restrained by team-mates as he attempted to confront Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock over a vulgar slur he had made about Warner's wife Candice. Both men were charged for bringing the game into disrepute but Warner's offence was graded higher.

FAIRFAX MEDIA Australian cricketer can be seen physically restrained by team-mate in new CCTV footage from South African test.

Behind the scenes, the Australians suspected the Proteas were behind the leak. The seeds of distrust had been sewed. Their disconnect to the outside world was growing.

The moral high ground could have been with Australia but wasn't. Instead, the team was being widely criticised for being self-appointed moral arbiter over what was acceptable on the field. They drew a shifting line to suit themselves and the opposition had to move accordingly.

As Smith's team arrived at St George's Park for the start of the second test, the Cricket Australia board was drawing their own metaphorical line.

The nine directors had grown tired of seeing their players pushing the boundaries. There had not been any specific incident which had upset them but rather a gradual build up: a send off here, an f-bomb caught on camera. They were all consistent to the image of the ""ugly Australians"" that had plagued the team since the turn of the century.

THEMBA HADEBE/AP ""The fans expect better"", Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said of the ball tampering scandal.

It was time to remind the players how to behave while wearing the baggy green. The Spirit of the Game was invoked, urging respect for the opposition.

""Unfortunately neither team met this standard in Durban. The Australian team understands that fans expect better,"" said the statement, which was attributed to chief James Sutherland but came from above him.

""Australia has always prided itself on taking a highly competitive approach to international cricket. This will not change, however CA is confident that what occurred in Durban will remain an aberration.

""Under the period of the current team leadership, Australian players have received fewer sanctions under the ICC Code of Conduct than players from the majority of the nine top-ranked test playing nations.

""CA is confident that the rest of the series in South Africa will be remembered for enthralling cricket played in the right spirit by both teams.""

This confidence was misplaced. Australia had heeded the message, only to forget it a fortnight later.

Siege mentality

The Australians were about to have two more reasons to feel like they were getting dudded. In an ugly postscript to de Kock's stairwell slur, two Cricket South Africa executives were pictured alongside three men wearing Sonny Bill Williams masks on day one in Port Elizabeth.

The masks had been brought into the ground in an attempt to ridicule Warner.

SUPPLIED Clive Eksteen and Altaaf Kazi posing with spectators wearing Sonny Bill Williams masks during the second test.

The events on the field were no better for the team. Defeat beckoned.

Firebrand quick Kagiso Rabada had destroyed Australia's batting, not once but twice, taking 11 wickets. De Villiers was winning the battle of the wonderbats, defying the bowler-friendly conditions and Australia's vaunted attack for a blazing century.

In most major codes played in Australia, Rabada's shoulder tap on Smith would not have raised an eyebrow. Cricket, however, is not a contact sport. Rabada, the son of a doctor and a town planner, should have known this. He had form.

In February last year, he was fined 50 per cent of his match fee and handed three demerit points for a shoulder shove on Sri Lanka's Niroshan Dickwella. He was up to five demerit points by the time he was reported in Port Elizabeth. His bump on Smith would take his tally to eight – enough for a two-test suspension. He was out of the series unless he could overturn the level two charge.

AP South African paceman Kagiso Rabada celebrates with team-mates after taking a wicket in the second rest.

The nine-day break before the third test gave the tourists plenty of time to be just that. It had been a difficult fortnight. Even little things were going wrong. Three players had wanted to take advantage of the early finish in Durban to leave ahead of schedule but their flight was continually delayed. Eventually, they gave up, hauling their bags and kits back to the team hotel. There had also been a gastro outbreak. Mitchell Marsh was sick the first day and coach Darren Lehmann also caught the bug.

They all took some time off. Warner and his family went on safari. Smith and his fiancee Dani Willis visited a retreat. Coach Darren Lehmann wanted to see Robben Island but was denied by weather. Cameron Bancroft climbed Table Mountain and went shark diving. For him, there would be more highs and lows to come.

AP Cameron Bancroft was seen to hide the object down the front of his underpants before walking over to the umpires.

It did not take long for the camp to be snapped back into reality. While the Australians played, the Proteas worked on freeing Rabada, arguing his penalty was excessive compared to other incidents. Events in the cricket world were playing into their hands.

They seized upon the one-demerit point penalty handed to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh players after they nearly came to blows during a Twenty20 match in Colombo. How then could Rabada get triple that and miss two tests for what du Plessis described as a ""shirt flick"" on Smith?

The Proteas, however, were still backing a longshot – the ICC rarely overturns its decisions – but sometimes longshots win. The odds had tumbled as the hearing headed into a sixth hour.

Advocate Dali Mpofu, SC, one of the country's most high-profile lawyers, had planted enough doubt in the mind of the ICC's New Zealand-based judicial commissioner Michael Heron, QC, for him to be ""comfortably satisfied"" the contact was unintentional. Rabada was free to play.

This was another slap in the face to the Australians. That Smith was not called to give evidence raised further suspicion the deck had been stacked. What had been Australia against South Africa was now Australia against the world.

Smith, who had been criticised for staging by a ""hacker"" using Proteas paceman Vernon Philander's Twitter account, was furious. ""The ICC have set the standard, haven't they? There was clearly contact out in the middle,"" Smith said.

""I certainly won't be telling my bowlers to go out there and after you take a wicket go and get in their space. I don't think that is on and part of the game. But the standard has been set.""

On match eve, Smith posted on social media a team photo at Newlands with the stunning Table Mountain in the backdrop. This venue has played host to some famous chapters in the Australia-South Africa rivalry. It was here where a Clarke-led Australia was skittled for 47. Four years ago, they capped off an Ashes-winning summer by clinching a memorable decider in the final half hour of the last day.

The beautiful surrounds was in contrast to the ugliness that was to come. There was distrust from both sides. A rabid crowd added to the tension and a sense of injustice among the Australians. Lehmann's branding of the fan behaviour as ""disgraceful"" drew ridicule among those who remembered how he urged Australian crowds to turn on Stuart Broad.

The beginning of the end

Four years ago, it was Australia that was sceptical of the Proteas' management of the ball. Now it was the opposite.

Former South African star Fanie de Villiers, now working as a commentator, revealed the cameramen, when they were not scanning for scantily clad women in the crowd, had been instructed to keep their eye on the ball.

It took them ""an hour and half until they saw something"". That something was Bancroft using what we now know to be sandpaper to scuff up one side of the ball. There was disbelief when Bancroft, in a panic, attempted to hide the sandpaper in his jocks

YOUTUBE Australia opener Cameron Bancroft and captain Steve Smith admit to ball tampering during a press conference.

There is conjecture as to what exactly happened in the hours either side of this incident but what's not is the numerous sliding door moments on the day.

How Smith and Bancroft came to speak to the media should be reviewed, according to the players union, which is critical of CA's handling of the jaw-dropping press conference.

There are several versions doing the rounds of what happened, and why Lehmann didn't address the media, but ultimately it was Smith and Bancroft who faced the music. Some will now wonder how it would have played out for Smith had he avoided the cameras.

Steve Smith choked on his words on Thursday as he admitted full responsibility for a ball-tampering plot.

The more relevant question is how Smith allowed the ball-tampering to happen in the first place. Smith did not address this during his emotion-charged mea culpa on Thursday night.

CA's own investigation found Warner to be the ring leader, Bancroft the mule and Smith the leader who turned a blind eye.

Lehmann was cleared, his incredulous walkie-talkie message of ""What the f--- is going on?"" proof in the eyes of CA's head of integrity Iain Roy that he had no part. It is understood Lehmann has also told close friends he was not aware of the plot, though many disagree. Doubters also question if it was a three-man conspiracy. It's believed there were enough variations in the players' stories of innocence to convince Roy there was no mass cover up.

What should have been a series to savour for the high-octane bowling of Rabada and the Australian pacemen, and the skill of de Villiers, will instead go down as one of the most notorious chapters in modern cricket.

A tearful Darren Lehmann quits role as Australian coach in the fall-out from the ball-tampering scandal.

The aggression displayed by Australia since the lead in to the Ashes had turned to tears by this week. Smith stood down from the captaincy and was banned from international and domestic cricket for 12 months by Cricket Australia. Warner stood down as vice-captain and was banned for a year, and Bancroft for nine months. Lehmann resigned as coach late on Thursday night.

The wounds from this damaging episode will heal eventually, and the lessons hopefully learned from this story of hubris, mistrust and hypocrisy. There were numerous warning signals, all ignored.

A team had become so self-absorbed it had lost all sense of reality. But few could imagine how hard the house would come crashing down.

13,sri+lanka,"“We pride ourselves on being known for innovation, yet we are 90 out of 100 in the innovation index,” says Heminda Jayaweera – the cofounder of Venture Frontier Lanka. In his opinion, while Sri Lanka has technical talent, there is a piece that’s missing. That missing piece is a long-term incubator for startups, which Venture Frontier Lanka aims to be.

What is Venture Frontier Lanka?

Venture Frontier Lanka describes itself as, “the first entrepreneurship platform focused on the development of the complete startup lifecycle.” Its goal is to identify and nurture promising early-stage entrepreneurs. It then aims to offer practical training and mentorship in venture development. Finally, it would provide seed funding.

To do this, Venture Frontier Lanka utilizes a Public-Private-Donor (PPD) Partnership structure. This means working with key public and private stakeholders. In other words, work in partnership with the government, the private sector, and international donors to help entrepreneurs.

So what sectors is Venture Frontier Lanka interested in? Currently its interested in startups that operate in five sectors. These five sectors are tourism & leisure, agriculture, ICT, education, and healthcare.

The state of entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka

Speaking at the launch of Venture Frontier Lanka, Indi Samarajiva – Founder of Yamu said, “I’ve been in the Sri Lankan startup community for almost 6 years now and I’m a bit jaded. Aside from startups being difficult anywhere, Sri Lanka is especially horrible, for a few reasons.”

The first of these reasons he highlights is the lack of talent. The local education system doesn’t produce entrepreneurs. Nor does our immigration policy attract the best global talent. Secondly, there is very little investment money and few reasons for investors to put more money. Thirdly, the Sri Lankan market is so small that cities in India are larger. And finally, with the internet, startups are now competing globally.

“Starting a startup is nuts. You either have to be dumb enough to not think about all these disadvantages or crazy enough to not care.” – Indi Samarajiva

Indi went onto say that in good faith he couldn’t recommend the life of a startup founder. But he had faith and if anyone was still insistent on giving it a shot, the jaded founders like himself and the folks at Venture Frontiers will try to help you.

Meanwhile, Dr. Harsha De Silva – State Minister of Twitter Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, speaking at the launch of Venture Frontier Lanka shared, “To achieve prosperity as a country, we have to create jobs that pay well. This requires entrepreneurs and startups. They are the true engines of growth.”

But he admits the challenges that entrepreneurs face, which Indi highlighted. Dr. Harsha went onto say, “Those who need funds from the banks hardly get it.” The startup model requires banks to adopt different funding models. He went onto share that the government is working on reforms, which includes education reforms to make Sri Lanka more business-friendly.

Why is Venture Frontier Lanka here and how can they help?

Ovidiu Bujorean – CEO of Venture Frontier Lanka shared that they were in Sri Lanka for two reasons. These reasons are strong technical talent and many passionate entrepreneurs. He went onto say that the Sri Lankan market isn’t big compared to other countries in the region. Yet, the same applies to Israel, which Ovidiu shares have startups that think global from Day 01.

Currently, Venture Frontier Lanka is conducting a series of events across the country. You can find the list of events here to catch them. If you want to get in touch with them directly, then click here.",http://www.readme.lk/venture-frontier-lanka-sri-lankan-startups/
14,sri+lanka,"On the night of February 22, four drunken Muslim youths traveling on a three-wheeler in Sri Lanka’s Kandy district beat up a Sinhala Buddhist truck driver because he had not allowed them to overtake his truck. The police arrested the assailants but released them on bail.

Although intelligence officers had warned that the incident could be used to instigate ethnic tensions in the area, the police did not take immediate action. After the truck driver died and his body was being taken from the hospital on the night of March 2, feeling betrayed by state authorities, villagers burned tires in protest.

The daily Report Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox

Soon the protests spread to other areas in the region, culminating in mob violence and extensive destruction of Muslim-owned homes, shops and mosques by Buddhists. The violence killed two people and injured dozens.

The rioting was brought under control by March 9 after deployment of the Special Task Force, the declaration of a countrywide emergency, and a ban on Facebook and other social-media platforms for alleged promotion of hate speech. More than 80 people suspected of rioting were arrested.

Sinhalese Buddhist extremism has been vehemently condemned for the violence by the United Nations, Western governments, media, academia, and non-governmental organizations and their Sri Lankan counterparts. There is no question that violence by any group against another must be condemned and perpetrators must be held accountable. However, in order to avoid descent into further “religious” violence, it is important to move beyond a simplistic depiction of a majority aggressor and a minority victim and consider the multiple historical and social structural causes of the conflict.

Historical background

Communal harmony and cooperation rather than violence and conflict are the predominant features of Sri Lankan society. Muslims who started arriving in Sri Lanka around the 9th century as merchants and pilgrims were peacefully integrated into the society from about the 12th century. Sinhala kings, the Buddhist sangha and the people provided the facilities for the Muslim newcomers to practice their religion without hindrance.

Muslims fleeing persecution by the Portuguese and Dutch, who had ruled the island’s coastal lowlands since 1505, were welcomed and allowed to settle in the Sinhala kingdom. Muslim settlers married local Sinhala and Tamil women. The original Sinhala family names of some of these Muslim descendants are still in evidence in the Kandyan hill country disturbed by the recent riots.

Both colonial and local rulers have manipulated grievances and incited ethnic and religious groups against each other during times of crises and challenges to their authority. A case in point is the Rebellion of 1818, which sought to drive out the British from the Kandyan kingdom. It was sparked when the insecure and unpopular colonial regime appointed a Muslim as the headman of Wellassa, undermining the traditional authority of the Sinhala governor of the region. The British put down the rebellion with utmost severity and repression, consolidating their authority over the Sinhala chiefs and the population.

Similarly, a conflict that emerged in Gampola in Kandy district in May 1915 over the right of a Buddhist procession to play music while passing a Muslim mosque, was used by the British regime in its own interest of divide and rule. Failures of the British to uphold Buddhist customary rights and to arrest a Muslim man who shot dead a Sinhala boy led to widespread violence by Buddhists against Muslims in Kandy and other areas. The British declared martial law, killed a large number of suspected rioters and charged prominent Sinhala leaders with sedition and arrested them to secure colonial domination during the volatile World War I period.

During Sri Lanka’s post-independence period too, so-called ethnic riots have rarely been spontaneous outbursts of primordial Sinhala hatred toward minorities. Rather, communally based conflicts have arisen and been exacerbated either because of state inaction or manipulation by state and outside actors.

The 1983 anti-Tamil violence was a pogrom. Its outcome was the horrific 30-year armed conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). There were no mass Sinhala uprisings during the armed conflict against Tamils following LTTE attacks against the most important Buddhist sacred sites, including the Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, or against atrocities such as the killing of young Buddhist monks in Arantalawa.

There are many unanswered questions regarding the forces behind the spread of anti-Muslim violence in the current postwar period. The disturbances in southwestern town of Aluthgama in 2014 were reportedly carried out not by local Buddhist villagers but by outside groups engaged in a “planned and well-orchestrated attack to discredit the [then] government.”

There is speculation as to the origin and sponsorship of the extremist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), which has been spreading xenophobia, bigotry and hate speech against the Muslims in Aluthgama and elsewhere. There are unanswered questions as to why the BBS was founded in 2012 soon after its leaders returned from a trip to Norway and why its leader, the monk Galagoda Gnanasara, was given a five-year multiple-entry visa to the United States. After the Aluthgama riots, the previous government lost the 2015 presidential and parliamentary elections, losing the crucial Muslim vote.

While Buddhist extremism has been subjected to global condemnation, there is little attention paid to the extremist Wahhabi Islam that has been spreading across Sri Lanka for the last several decades. In order to avoid further religiously based violence, it is necessary to address how this intolerant and aggressive form of Islam imported from Saudi Arabia is aggravating tensions between Muslims and Buddhists as well as other communities and between different Muslim sects.

Indeed, how is the spread of Islamic extremism disturbing the island’s traditions of harmony and cooperation and contributing to communal violence?

Current situation

According to local villagers affected by this month’s events in Kandy, the violence there too was perpetrated not by local residents but by groups that came from outside. The riots emerged soon after the present regime was badly defeated at local-government elections on February 10, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is facing a non-confidence motion in Parliament. The defeat at the local-government elections conveyed public disapproval of proposed constitutional reforms and the ongoing sale of the country’s vital resources, assets and services to external interests including India, China, the US and transnational corporations.

The timing of the Kandy riots and the failure of the state to take timely action despite prior warnings have prompted many to ask: Was another unpopular and insecure regime seeking to promote communal conflict and destabilization to assert itself through authoritarian measures?

The disturbances in Kandy have provided new legitimacy to calls for internationally backed constitutional reforms as the basis for minority protection. However, constitutional reforms that provide the legal framework for dismemberment of the country along ethno-religious lines are likely to aggravate communal conflict. They will not address the structural violence rooted in corporate globalization and efforts of its state, media and NGO sectors and local allies to divert public attention away from widening economic inequality and massive social and environmental insecurities.

Moving forward

Sri Lankan Buddhists must not support xenophobic groups but safeguard their Buddhist heritage non-violently. Muslims must eschew extremist Islam and protect their traditional tolerant and gentle Islam. To avoid descent into religious wars, all individuals and groups must uphold the norm of unity within diversity and the qualities of generosity, compassion and wisdom over the lures of greed, hatred and ignorance promoted by both ethno-religious and economic fundamentalisms.

15,sri+lanka,"Right now, the JVP is set to back the Opposition move for a vote of No-Confidence on the Prime Minister. Has any member of that party reflected on the meaning of such a judgment in terms of the end-goal or purpose of the party?

by Shyamon Jayasinghe

( March 30, 2018, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) In the original days of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), it had a clear sense of purpose. Whether that purpose or general goal had been right or apt or realistic is another issue altogether. The important thing is that the party had a clear and unambiguous eventual goal to which it had been working under the leadership of Rohana Wijeweera, Gamanayake, etc. Ask the JVP today what its political purpose is and you will not get a valid answer. The crisis of the JVP today is that it has lost a purpose.

The JVP’s consistently poor showing at elections is largely an outcome of the fundamental reality that the party has ceased to be driven by anything other than being a critic of the government in power – whichever that may be. This is not a goal in any sense of a definition; it is just a state of negative becoming.

Contrast

By contrast, go back again to the 1969-70s. At that time, the JVP took the shape of a growing political force – burgeoning by the day and attracting hundreds of youth from the towns and villages. These youth discovered in the party and its messiah a deeply-enthusing idealism to embrace. JVP had been many things even then; but it carried the idealism of rectifying injustices from society and ushering in social justice for the poor and the disadvantaged of society by the destruction of the ‘evil that is capitalism’. The idea became viral and thousands of youth were able to conceal their prolonged training in the jungles.

When the uprising of April ’71 took place, it came as a shock to the broad masses of rulers and people. Rulers and others were thrown into confusion. Purpose can invest those in possession of it with dynamism and energy; with resilience

Doric’s classes

In my youthful days, the Samasamajists had such an appeal – although by then the appeal had weakened somewhat in intensity.

As a young undergraduate in Peradeniya, I remember how much we were magnetised by the theoretics of Doric De Souza, the exponent of Trotskyism. Doric, reflecting a strange coincidence with the JVP that was to come much later, conducted five classes which he held behind the Hindagala Hotel at the foot of Mahakande. Some of us were individually and collectively caught up and fired by pledging to fight for the eradication of poverty and all social ills which, Doric told us, had been due to the dominance of the capitalist class. We were made to feel heroic as revolutionaries.

A purpose drove us. The very idea of going out of ourselves to fight for a rule of the proletariat gave us adrenalin rushes. Some of us even neglected the reason for which our parents had spent for us to be in the university (at the time, the university wasn’t free). The wider and overriding goal of changing society drove fire within us.

One of our crowd, I remember, dear old “Shan,” wrote slogans on walls with the blood of his veins! In this way, the seniors who were indoctrinated (that is the right word) found it their purpose in turn to indoctrinate freshers who flowed in.

Personally, being a natural sceptic, I did entertain reservations even in those days. Subsequently and out of the university, my exposure to real life confirmed my previous suspicions. The confirmation hardened when, much later, I went to Melbourne University to take an MBA. My exposure to the disciplines of economics and business and to the economic development in Australia made be dump Doric for good.

I learnt how the later capitalism in fact had historically led to huge advances in wealth creation among the poor and working classes of the world. Small wonder that the movement for socialist revolution eventually lost steam and blew out. The idea of a revolution was confined to discourse in parlours and to the small gatherings of intellects.

Marxism in the JVP

On the other hand, the JVP still does officially hold on to Marxism and the guys are red-shirted. However, they haven’t declared any goal of socialism in their published and articulated programs. Have you heard any of them arguing for socialism as we heard the old Left shout hoarse during their golden days? That left has been liquidated and we now find only defunct ghosts like Vasudeva and D.E.W. Gunasekera who talk of everything save of socialism. Besides, they have nothing to show in terms of performance during their jurisdiction in the Rajapaksa Government.

JVP efforts harvested by others

What does seem to be the purpose of the JVP today? You think and you’ll find none. They simply criticise the Government in power. They attacked the Rajapaksas while the latter had been in power. The result was that their efforts translated into votes for the new Yahapalanaya Government. This is the precise impact of mere negative approaches to politics. The criticism of the government in power only helps the opposition. The party does the dirty work of others.

Did you observe how the JVP took on the recent Local Government elections? ‘Give us the villages’ (‘Apata gama deela balanna’) was the JVP slogan. Scathing assaults were directed on the Yahapalanaya Government; but the votes they may have elicited got lodged with the Pohottuwa.

I must say, Anura Kumar Dissanayake does his homework very well and he knows to find faults and to communicate effectively the deficiency of the ruling powers. He is a good politician with a lot of potential. But, then, who benefits – other than those waiting outside to come to Government? The Local Government elections signified a wash-out for the JVP and a swelling of Pohottuwa ranks.

No-Confidence motion impact on JVP fortunes

Right now, the JVP is set to back the Opposition move for a vote of No-Confidence on the Prime Minister. Has any member of that party reflected on the meaning of such a decision in terms of the end-goal or purpose of the party?

The Pohottuwa Opposition is clear about its goal and target, which is to cause instability and bring down the Government. The fall of Ranil means the collapse of the Yahapalanaya Government; thus making way for the return of the Rajapaksa cabal and the closure of all court action. If one looks at the different ‘misbehaviours’ cited in the motion not one can be causatively linked to Ranil as an individual. Thus Ranil isn’t the target; the fall of the Government is.

The JVP should ask themselves the question: how would such a result serve any overall purpose of their party beneficially? The evident outcome would be adverse for the JVP since the Rajapaksas winning would decimate their party further. The track record of the Rajapaksa Government provides enough evidence to surmise that a fresh return of that regime would mean the complete destruction of democracy and a further erosion of human rights.

A returned Rajapaksa regime would get about closing avenues for democratic dissent and conducting elections where the decision is pre-set. The hit squad will return and metamorphose Sri Lanka into another North Korea headed by a “dear leader!” This isn’t wild speculation if one were to assess the conduct and performance of the family regime’s last ruling exercise.

No strategy

A party’s strategy derives from purpose. Not having a purpose has also meant that the JVP doesn’t have a strategy. The party thinks for the day and acts on short term expectations. Not having a purpose means other things. It will denude the energy and drive of the party. The JVP will not be able to attract new members to the ranks.

At this rate, the party’s final end would be to slip into the cosy laps of the Right – just as Vasu or DEW have done. That, too, if the new regime of the Rajapaksas will incorporate the JVP into some concocted fake of a “joint” government.",https://www.slguardian.org/sri-lanka-crisis-in-marxist-jvp/

It is an identity crisis..an open dialogue of both the communities would help address the issue

The hate speeches already made by various people, especially since 2012 and the statements posted in the social media for the past six years, have fed the communities with hate

Business rivalry, envy and politics have been attributed to the recent wave of hate campaign by various groups and individuals

The rise of the percentage of Muslim population due to the drop in Tamil population from 21 percent to 12 percent was cited as an unusual growth

The deaths and migration of Tamils to other countries as a result of the war had caused an increase in the percentage of Sinhalese population as well

Most abayas sold here do not conform to the requirements taught in Islam

As it did on the wake of previous communal clashes in various places in the country, the Government said after the communal clashes in early this month that it would take action to filter the hateful statements and posts in the social media.



It was reported that Ministers had discussions in this regard with officials of the Facebook Inc. who visited the country after the temporary ban on social media following the anti-Muslim riots in Ampara and Kandy Districts.



However, the hate speeches already made by various people, especially since 2012 and the statements posted in the social media for the past six years, have fed the communities with hate sufficient to make a hell even out of a small road accident.



Interestingly, the trigger for the communal attacks in Aluthgama in 2014, in Gintota last year and in Digana this month, had been traffic issues.



However, there is a vast difference this time with Sinhalese intellectuals, Buddhist monks and the media being swift in countering the misconceptions such as the “wanda pethi” and with monks even physically coming forward to protect Muslims and their mosques in various parts of the country.



Sinhalese in Anamaduwa had dared to challenge racist elements by reconstructing an eatery that came under arson attack, within a day.



Monks in some areas had given shelter to terrified Muslim families in their temples, in spite of the Government being accused of inaction and the Police in some areas being accused of colluding with rioters.



This is a situation that could not be expected some three years ago.



Various reasons including business rivalry, envy and politics have been attributed to the recent wave of hate campaign by various groups and individuals, the prime ingredient of which has been vicious lies and distortions.



However, a sizable number of Sinhalese, including some educated people seem to succumb to those distorted campaigns.



During the Halal Controversy between 2012 and 2014, the Government or the concerned members of the business community, who had obtained the Halal Certificate voluntarily did not come forward to clear the misconception that prices had gone up due to the Halal Certificate.



Only one person had the courage to say that he had spent only 27 rupees per day for this certificate in order to broaden his market.



The Qur’an verses, almost all of which are contextual, were then cited out of context to demonize Muslims and these claims were vindicated by reports of barbaric acts of various terrorist groups in the Middle East, who are fighting each other in the name of Islam.



After being static for a century until the early eighties, the rise of the percentage of Muslim population due to the drop in Tamil population from 21 percent to 12 percent, was cited as an unusual growth in Muslim population.



In fact, the deaths and migration of Tamils to other countries as a result of the war after the eighties had caused an increase in the percentage of Sinhalese population as well.



The canards stooped to such a low level intellectually that claims were made that the welcome toffees served at certain shops owned by Muslims and under-garments sold at those shops contained sterilizing chemicals.



While the Government of the day seemed to connive with the groups spreading hate, one Minister of that Government warned that a small matchstick could create a hellhole as enough petrol had already been sprinkled all over the country.



He also suspected a foreign hand behind the hate campaign with a view to defeat President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the next Presidential election by antagonizing the Muslims against his Government. But his warnings fell on deaf ears of the leaders.



The hate campaign driving the past six years had been such that even a ‘clump of flour’ in a plate of beef curry was used to incite violence.



The hate campaign was facilitated by the Muslims as well by adamantly embracing more and more elements of Arab and Pakistani cultures such as the women’s abaya, face veil and the men’s Jubba. The more they changed their physical appearance the more did they psychologically detach themselves from the national fabric, creating an insular society amidst the Sinhalese.



This insularity is such that they, for years debate the way they should greet a non-Muslim or a Non-Muslim priest. This mindset, while strengthening the already prevalent language barrier, prevented them from not only allaying fears and misconceptions spread by the hate mongers among their neighbours but rather made the latter even to view them as strange creatures and suspect them.



The depiction of abaya, especially the black ones and the Jubba as symbols of extremism or fundamentalism is an unfounded vilification of Muslims as most of those who wear them, especially the women, do not know any politics or anything happening around them.



And there are no radical Islamic groups in Sri Lanka, except for fringe groups occasionally fighting each other over religious issues.



These attires came into the country as a result of Sri Lankans migrating to West Asian countries for employment.



However, there is no any specific reason for them to stick to those attires so admirably or adamantly in Sri Lanka, as Islam does not recommend a particular dress, but only certain requirements in any dress.



For the Muslims to assimilate with the Sinhalese in this regard is easier, as a majority of the latter has chosen, for their day-to-day use, the Western and Indian attires which are not strange or unacceptable to Muslims as well. Abaya or the Jubba is not popular among Muslims in Indonesia which is the home for the largest Muslim population in the world.



In fact, the most abayas sold at the Sri Lankan market do not conform to the requirements taught in Islam as they are so tight and decorative and pompous and also highly expensive.



The abaya, along with the face-veil, has in most cases become merely a fashion not corresponding with the Islamic way of life. Yet, certain businessmen have been successful in promoting such attires.



There is a campaign among the Muslims in the country for the proper integration of the community into the Sri Lankan social fabric, without harming the basic religious tenets, but unfortunately by a relatively small group. Their voice is hence not sufficiently heard of within the community and is not known to the Sinhalese either, due to the language barrier.



The increasing insular mindset of the Muslims and the unceasing vilification and alienation of them by hate-mongers have posed a question to the Muslims themselves as to who they are in Sri Lanka.



It is, in fact, an identity crisis. An open dialogue between the intellectuals of both the communities would help address the issue or minimise the ill effects of it.",http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Identity-Crisis-And-Muslims--147677.html
17,sri+lanka,"Black and white polka-dots covering her nine-months-pregnant belly, M.I.A. sauntered onto the Grammys stage in 2009 for a performance that would seem to announce the arrival of a supremely 21st-century sort of icon—artistically daring, unapologetically female, and from a part of the world the West has often ignored. But in retrospect now, the moment stands as the apex of her supposedly finished music career, a summit never reached again. Anyone unfamiliar with M.I.A. but familiar with the scripts of stardom could assume what came next: difficulty following up a barrier-busting hit, mistakes with the press, and personal setbacks. Stephen Loveridge’s documentary, Matangi/Maya/M.I.A., appears to start filling in that script, preluding the Grammys performance with footage of the rapper and producer’s breezy home life in Los Angeles. Then we see her arrive on stage in those blazing maternal polka dots, with the Clash-borrowed groove of her smash “Paper Planes” twitching to life, and— Related Stories The Urgent Message of M.I.A.'s Kala at 10

at 10 The Rapper of Refugees

M.I.A. Claims Victory, In Her Way Bang. The film smashcuts to news footage about the Sri Lankan Civil War, entering its bloody final phase in early 2009. The country’s military had, after decades of battle, beaten back the resistance fighters of the Tamil ethnic minority to a spot on the northern coast. “No-fire zones” for civilians to take refuge in were drawn by the government—and then bombed by that government, killing hundreds on a daily basis. The screen floods with images of the wounded and dead. This is not a normal pop documentary, because M.I.A. was not a normal pop star. On Tavis Smiley’s show earlier in 2009, she’d responded to a question about her artistic success by changing the subject to the “genocide” going on in her home country of Sri Lanka. On the Grammys red carpet, she sparred with a reporter over CNN omitting similar comments about genocide she made during an interview that, when it aired, focused on her music career. “You’re the first person that we’ve interviewed that says, ‘The piece was too much about me,’” the reporter shot back. “People mostly want it about them.”

Loveridge’s movie is a fantastic and kinetic fulfillment of Maya Arulpragasam’s desire, back then, to be heard as more than an entertainer. Starting with her 2004 debut, M.I.A. beat an aesthetically game-changing and controversy-strewn path across pop culture, broadcasting her backstory as a Tamil revolutionary’s refugee daughter who was trained in London art school and steeped in U.S. hip-hop. Her early aspiration of becoming a documentary filmmaker means Loveridge has a trove of electrifying pre- and post-fame footage to work with, which he uses for a smart, lively investigation of M.I.A.’s own vital themes: the lives of immigrants worldwide, the plight of the Sri Lankan people, and the question of whether pop stars can make effective political activists. In 1985, the young Arulpragasam came with her mother, brother, and sister, alongside a wave of Sri Lankan refugees, to South London, leaving behind her father, Arular, whom she barely knew. That father, for whom her first album is named, has long held a contested, un-pin-downable place in her mythology. “This is what happened to a kid whose dad went off and became a terrorist,” she says into the camera during a mid-’90s confessional she filmed, though later in the press she would emphasize his role as a peacebroker and humanitarian. Remarkably, the viewer gets to meet the famous Arular, whom Maya films when he comes to visit his estranged family. He describes the conflict in Sri Lanka as a human-rights crisis, he says he was the founder of the Tamil resistance movement, and he tells a story of smuggling bombs by hiding them under toys for his kids. Two of the three Arulpragasam siblings consider him a deadbeat. “His whole life is a dead end,” Maya’s brother, Sugu, says. “So now he’s talking about peace. Because he can’t fight now.” Maya, though, has a provocatively grateful take: “He’s made us damn interesting. He’s given us a bloody background!”

Her quest to understand this background—and document it—would send her on a 2001 trip to her childhood home in Sri Lanka. We see her hosts then were welcoming, but reluctant to share war stories, fearful of being caught in crackdowns on dissidents. They also appeared reluctant to take her interest in the Tamil struggle seriously—because she was a young woman, and because she was an expat. In a deeply striking moment, one of her subjects dismisses her credibility because she left the country as a child. “You never had the war zone experience,” he says with a smirk and a swat at the camera. Right there is the paradox of the refugee: In Sri Lanka, she’s an interloper, but in the West, she’s that too, taunted with slurs like “Paki.” That sense of placelessness—which could be conversely channeled as everywhereness—fueled her vibrant, riotous sound. Bookending the movie is the video shoot for her 2015 song “Borders,” whose valorization of refugees and migrants underlines M.I.A.’s significance in a post-Brexit, post-Trump world: If some politicians have their way, her story might not have been able to happen. Seen in the doc hopping across continents to record her classic 2007 album, Kala, she bonds with some of her collaborators, like the Nigerian rapper Afrikan Boy, as immigrants. “There’s always going to be something different about us that doesn’t relate to a white experience or a black experience,” she says. “It’s always something extra. Something else that you have to go and do, which is connect with your back-homeness.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/mia-documentary-review/556733/
18,sri+lanka,"Sri Lanka will “redouble” efforts to strike a free trade deal with China and conclude and expanded trade pact with India as part of the island nation’s strategy of becoming an Indian Ocean hub for investors and multinationals, the country’s top diplomat says.

Colombo inked a comprehensive free trade deal with Singapore in January and now has the bandwidth to finalize deals with Sri Lanka’s two largest trading partners “as quickly as possible,” said foreign secretary Prasad Kariyawasam in an interview.

“Since we have now done the trade deal with Singapore, we can redouble our efforts to finalize an expanded trade deal with India and China,” said Kariyawasam, the country’s former ambassador to the U.S. and top envoy to India.

In recent years, Sri Lanka -- which emerged from a three-decade civil war in 2009 -- has been known for taking Chinese loans to fund vast infrastructure projects, including ports and highways.

But Kariyawasam, speaking from his office in Colombo, said the projects are geared toward welcoming not just Chinese but Indian and other international companies and investors. The city’s developers hope people will make Colombo a regional base. A large, Chinese-orchestrated land reclamation project not far from his office will have luxury accommodation, international schools and a marina. It’s being marketed as a “world class city for South Asia.”

Evolving Environment

Negotiating deals with India and China won’t be easy.

New Delhi has dragged out trade deals before and Sri Lanka’s population is wary of Asia’s two most populous nations swamping this country of around 21 million people -- roughly the population of New Delhi -- with goods, services and professionals. Still, a Sri Lankan finance ministry official told Bloomberg News a deal with India could happen in about a year’s time.

“We are working hard to do those deals as quickly as possible, because that will benefit our trade, business and investment,” Kariyawasam said, adding that the country will also need to evolve its regulatory environment.
