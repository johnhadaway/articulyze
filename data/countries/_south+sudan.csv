0,south+sudan,"March 29, 2018 (WASHINGTON) – The European Union (EU) should more clearly and consistently assert leadership and develop much-needed financial leverage that could support a truly reinvigorated peace process in South Sudan, a country “hijacked by corrupt elites and marred by brutal conflict and urgent humanitarian crises”, the U.S-based advocacy group (Enough Project) said in a new report.

Entitled “EuroPressure: EU Financial Leverage for Impact in South Sudan,” the report says the EU’s principal answers to the South Sudan crisis have been financial aid and humanitarian support, rather than a comprehensive approach with meaningful leverage to drive change.

Brad Brooks-Rubin and Jonathan Benton jointly authored the report.

Last year alone, the EU reportedly provided over 350 million euros in aid to South Sudan, focusing particularly on assistance to South Sudan’s neighbours facing serious challenges related to caring for the over 2 million refugees, who have crossed the border for safety.

In addition, however, the United Kingdom plays a leading role in international diplomacy on South Sudan through its place in the “Troika” (along with Norway and the United States), and a number of EU member states also play critical roles in providing development assistance and support to South Sudan and the broader region.

The reports urges a modernized approach, including financial leverage and associated incentives, the likes of which have never been used by the EU with respect to conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, to demonstrate to violent kleptocrats in South Sudan who are bent on violence and corruption that leverage exists to stop them.

“The international community is slowly developing an evolving strategy of applying pressures to the spoilers of the South Sudanese peace process and those whose networks are profiting from diversion of oil wealth and other resources,” said Brooks-Rubin, co-author and Managing Director at the Enough Project and The Sentry.

He added, “The tide is shifting, and clear action by the European Union can press this effort forward and provide negotiators with real leverage to start to bring about real change in South Sudan.”

Early this month, the EU said it was ready to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan if its warring parties do not immediately cease hostilities and continue ignoring ongoing peace talks.

The threat of an arms embargo came a day after the United States on circulated a draft United Nations Security Council resolution that threatens to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan and to take ""all appropriate measures"" against those blocking its peace efforts.

“The European Union and its member states have led many elements of the evolving international architecture devoted to combating corruption and conflict around the world,” said Benton, report co-author and Operations Director at The Sentry in the report.

“There is now a clear opportunity for the EU to build on this leadership and apply new financial pressures to the crisis in South Sudan, where grand corruption is driving so much of the humanitarian crisis that Europe is spending hundreds of millions of euros every year to ease,” he added.

Meanwhile, the report lays out short, medium, and long term tools that the EU can deploy as part of a thoughtful and coordinated strategy to help end the crisis and suffering in war-torn South Sudan.

Among the measures, it says, are designating for sanctions key spoilers of the peace process and their business networks.

“Sanctions placed on only a few individuals and that lack enforcement are ineffective,” the report, adding that “Sanctions measures must impact not only individuals, but also their networks”.

Also, the EU has been urged to engage neighboring government by putting pressure on the key countries in the region, notably the financial intelligence units, central banks, and ministries of foreign affairs in Uganda and Kenya to monitor funds got from South Sudan.

The advocacy group further recommended “Imposing sectoral-based restrictive measures on economic sectors that are under the control of certain political and military elites, such as the extractive industries, banking, and transport sectors”.

Now in its fifth year, the conflict in South Sudan has left tens of thousands of people dead, more 2 million displaced and half of the population at threat of facing severe starvation, aid agencies say. A recent report by the United Nations and South Sudan government said up to 150,000 people could slip into severe famine this year.

Salva Kiir casts his vote in the 2010 elections.

A South Sudanese presidential adviser blamed the armed groups for obstructing the political process the IGAD is mediating to settle the more than four-years crisis in the country.

“The rebels are intransigent because the American sanctions have emboldened them. We know they are not going to engage in good faith in the next round of talks because they think the present government, the mandate of the transitional government of national unity expires in August,"" Tor Deng Mawien Presidential Adviser on Decentralization and Intergovernmental linkage told Sudan Tribune on Friday.

Mawien further predicted that the opposition would not sign a peace agreement and until August and then they will say that the ""government is illegitimate and then go around the region and the world preaching it"".

That will not happen. If the current efforts, including the revitalization process, fail to culminate into a new arrangement, the government will conduct elections”, he said.

""The gap between what the government proposes as the way to resolving the current situation and what the opposition is proposing is huge and wide. It is difficult to close,"" said Taban Deng Gai

The parties to the revitalization process are expected to meet next April to discuss a series of proposals the mediation will submit based on the positions of the two sides during the talks last February.

ANKARA

Unless speedy international support is granted to South Sudan, half of its population -- or 6.3 million people -- face a food crisis, while the number of people at risk of starvation could rise by another one million in the next three months, an international relief official said Thursday.

According to Rehana Zawar, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s country director in the Eastern African country, the country faces an acute food crisis. “Tens of thousands of families are at risk of starvation,” she said in a press release.

“Besides the challenges of restricted access to aid, the current level of aid can only help less than 50 percent of people in need,” she said.

“If things keep going the way they are, food sources will be extremely low, as food stocks run out in many parts of the country while the lean season of May to July approaches.”

“Our Rapid Response Teams are working overtime to deliver lifesaving aid to devastated areas, but needs are still overwhelming,” said Zawar, explaining the additional massive arrivals of displaced communities which resulted in mounting pressure on already limited resources.

Zawar urged the international community to act in time to save lives, saying: “We urgently need increased international support and resources for humanitarian aid, as well as free access to bring food and other emergency assistance to hard-hit communities. The only way to prevent a widespread famine is to act now before it’s too late.’’

Since 2013, South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan following a 2011 popular referendum, has remained the scene of a bloody civil war pitting government forces against armed opposition groups.

Despite a 2015 peace deal signed between the two sides, the conflict -- in which some 10,000 people are thought to have been killed -- remains ongoing.

The impact of the fighting has worsened the food crisis by causing the destruction of food production. Some two million people have fled their homes within the country, and another two million have fled as refugees.",http://aa.com.tr/en/africa/63m-south-sudanese-face-food-crisis-relief-official/1096571
3,south+sudan,"“South Sudan’s food crisis levels are shocking,” said Rehana Zawar, Norwegian Refugee Council’s Country Director in South Sudan. “Alarm bells are ringing as the threat of famine is now more widespread than this time last year. Tens of thousands of families are at risk of starvation.”

An estimated 6.3 million people – or half the population – currently face ‘crisis’, or worse, food security levels. That number will likely increase by another 1 million in the next 3 months, according to the latest projections. This is a significantly higher percentage of the population than was in need of humanitarian aid at same time last year.

Current levels of aid are expected to reach less than 50 per cent of people in need across the country. In addition, restricted access to aid and other food sources will be extremely low, as food stocks run out in many parts of the country while the lean season of May to July approaches.

The main reasons for the worsening situation is the compounded impact of 4 years of fighting, the destruction of food production, cattle being stolen or left behind, farmers afraid to access their lands, and high inflation due to economic crisis. These resulted in two million people that fled their homes within the country, and another two million who fled as refugees.

Since this time last year, violence has spread to more parts of the country. Areas worst affected by the food crisis are also those affected by the armed conflict, including central and southern Unity, northwestern Jonglei, and Wau in Western Bahr el Ghazal, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET).

Other areas are seeing massive arrivals of displaced communities, increasing pressure on already limited resources. Despite the challenges, humanitarian agencies continue to save lives by distributing food and other necessities to over 2.5 million people in need across South Sudan each month.

“Our Rapid Response Teams are working overtime to deliver lifesaving aid to devastated areas, but needs are still overwhelming,” said Zawar. “We urgently need increased international support and resources for humanitarian aid, as well as free access to bring food and other emergency assistance to hard hit communities. The only way to prevent a widespread famine is to act now, before it’s too late.’’",https://www.nrc.no/news/2018/march/south-sudan-inches-closer-to-famine/

Renk town is located in Renk County, Upper Nile State, near South Sudan’s border with Sudan. Since independance in 2011, Renk has become a major destination and transit point for returnees from Sudan and, since the beginning of the current conflict in 2013, for internally displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing conflict in Upper Nile State.

This factsheet provides results from the REACH road monitoring exercise in Renk town, Renk County. REACH monitors one entry point in Renk to record the arrivals and departures of South Sudanese returnee and IDP households (HHs) on a daily basis. Daily data is synthesized into a monthly factsheet to provide an overview of wider movement trends, including push/pull factors and intentions.

The following findings are based on primary data collected throughout January 2018, during which 67 departing HHs (260 individuals) and 35 arriving HHs (154 individuals) and 84 transiting HHs (301 individuals) were recorded. Enumerators interviewed respondents who were arriving in and departing from Sukjima bus station. Travellers interviewed by REACH in January were all going to and from Sudan. Respondents were selected based on pre-survey questions on motives of travel to ensure that only displaced people or returnees were interviewed. Not all entry points to Renk town were covered systematically, and most arrivals reportedly took place after data collection hours (9:00 a.m - 5:00 p.m). As such, the data presented in this factsheet is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-displacement-crisis-renk-road-monitoring-renk-county-upper-nile-2

PEOPLE TARGETED IN 2017: 6.2 M

PEOPLE REACHED BY THE END OF 2017: 5.4 M

In 2017, South Sudan’s conflict was in its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Nearly 4.3 million people – one in three South Sudanese – have been displaced, including more than 1.8 million who are internally displaced and about 2.5 million who are in neighbouring countries. About 700,000 people left South Sudan in 2017.

Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, the crisis was driven by both intensified clashes in Koch and Mayendit and food insecurity, which reached dire conditions. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit counties most affected. Hundreds of thousands of people fled to Uganda, where the population of South Sudanese refugees peaked at over one million in August.

Food insecurity and malnutrition in South Sudan reached record levels in 2017. In February, famine was declared in parts of Unity, meaning some 100,000 people faced starvation. Even though a concerted multi-sector response was able to halt the localized famile in Leer and Mayendit, some 4.9 million people were severely food insecure in South Sudan during that period. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles and kala-azar continued to spread in 2017. Cholera was most severe, with over 20,000 cases reported, including 436 related deaths.

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, making it the deadliest year for aid workers on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access incidents were reported, the highest number of incidents in a year, representing a significant increase, compared to 908 in 2016 and 909 in 2015. Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated in 54 incidents from multiple locations across the country.

Despite these challenges, aid agencies assisted over 5.4 million people in 2017. This included: more than 5.1 million people who received food assistance; over 2.8 million people vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped to access clean water; 930,000 people assisted with vital non-food items; around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis who were supported with access to education.

The 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion received. Clusters with the most significant funding gaps included Health, Protection, and Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/2017-south-sudan-humanitarian-response-review

In Yida refugee settlement, UNHCR registered 1,269 new arrivals (684 women, 585 men), which represents 132% increase against the same period last year when 545 new arrivals were registered. Food shortage in South Kordofan is the main driver for new arrivals.

During the reporting period, UNHCR relocated 1,520 refugees to Jamjang camps, including 488 to Ajuong Thok and 1,032 to Pamir. This number also includes 387 refugees previously settled in Yida and 1,133 new arrivals. As of 15 March, the refugee population across Jamjang camps and settlement was as follows: Ajuong Thok - 42,646, Pamir - 23,526, Yida refugee settlement - 52, 775.

In Pamir and Ajuong Thok refugee camps, UNHCR in collaboration with its partner Humanitarian Development Consortium (HDC) trained 50 Community Outreach Volunteers (COVs) to increase their understanding on their roles and responsibilities, code of conduct, as well as UNHCR mandate and policies.

In Pamir, UNHCR partner Danish Refugee Council (DRC) identified 151 (90 women, 61 men) Persons with Special Needs (PSNs) during General Food Distribution (GFD) and helped them receive food avoiding long queues. 60 PSNs were identified during the ongoing quality assessment by the DRC team. DRC also identified 8 (7 women, 1 man)

PSNs and supported them with psychosocial services and basic supplies such as soap, shoes, etc. after verification in Ajuong Thok.

In Ajuong Thok and Pamir refugee camps, UNHCR’s partner Lutheran World Federation (LWF) identified 123 separated and two unaccompanied children at the respective reception centres; so far, 27 were placed under foster parents care, nine were referred for other services, and 25 were reunified with parents.

During the reporting period, UNHCR partner Lutheran World Federation (LWF) conducted 11 Best Interest Assessments (BIAs) bringing the total number of BIAs so far completed to 50. UNHCR reviewed 34 BIAs of separated children and provided recommendations on areas for improvement to enhance the quality of assessment. The assessments revealed that the majority of family separations were due to the ongoing conflict and the need for education which is provided in refugee camps.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-unhcr-operational-update-1-15-march-2018
7,south+sudan,"YIDA, South Sudan -- Even as millions of South Sudanese flee their country in what the United Nations has called the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide, hundreds of thousands of people from Sudan's South Kordofan region have found a haven there.

Their presence raises concerns that their improvised camps are a hiding place for militants, and aid workers say they find it increasingly hard to do their jobs.

One such camp, home to more than 50,000 people, was ordered closed by South Sudan's government almost two years ago. It continues to thrive, and officials worry that the rainy season that begins in May will draw more of the militants who have been fighting for more regional autonomy from Sudan's government.

""We believe Yida is proactively being used as a base or as a [rest and relaxation] location for fighters,"" said Veton Orana, head of the United Nations refugee agency's office in South Sudan's northern town of Jamjang.

He said the continuous flow of people across the border to the camp just 12 miles away poses a problem for the agency, which is in charge of delivering aid to civilians who aren't linked with combatants.

Almost 300,000 Sudanese refugees are sheltering in South Sudan, according to the agency. About 116,000 are in Unity State, the location of Yida and two other camps.

While South Kordofan is officially part of Sudan, the area remained home to many pro-South Sudanese communities after South Sudan won independence in 2011. Today, fighters loyal to South Sudan still shelter in the Nuba Mountains, allowing people from both countries to move freely across the border.

Romea Osma arrived at the Yida camp five years ago, after her cousin and nephew were killed in fighting that broke out in 2011 between the government and opposition fighters in the Nuba Mountains. The 24-year-old escaped with her daughters, 2 and 6 years old.

Osma said her husband fights with the rebels in Sudan but crosses the border several times a year to see her and their children in Yida.

""He leaves his gun and uniform outside and comes in civilian clothes,"" she said.

Locals say 50 percent of food distributed to the camp by the U.N's World Food Program is carried north to feed families in Sudan, including fighters.

In order to maintain good relations with Sudan, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir in 2016 announced the closure of Yida. Refugees were given the option to move to two nearby U.N.-run camps that are farther from the border and comply with international regulations.

Two years on, however, Yida remains a bustling and vibrant hub. Several community members there said they refuse to leave.

""I heard about the relocation but I have vulnerable family back in Nuba so I'm staying. I won't move,"" said one resident, Aisha Tutuk. The 28-year-old mother of five said Yida's proximity to Sudan is invaluable as it allows her husband to visit easily.

South Sudan's government and the U.N. refugee agency said the camp isn't safe. Although the current cease-fire in the Nuba Mountains is holding, they fear that renewed clashes would target Yida's civilians.

But the camp's local authorities disagree.

""Now security is good and there's no need to move,"" said William Manyiel, the assistant commissioner for refugees for Ruweng state. If the refugees leave so will the humanitarian aid, he said, and his government doesn't have the capacity to provide for its people.

Humanitarian groups have been providing food, shelter and medical care to both the Sudanese refugees and their South Sudanese hosts for years.

South Sudan's government said it is in discussions with Yida's local officials to put ""strategies in place"" to assist with the transition to other camps, said John Dabi, deputy commissioner for refugee affairs.

Yet those familiar with the situation in Sudan question the move.

""The signs of any military presence within Yida camp seem nominal,"" said Tom Rhodes, former editor at Nuba Reports, an independent media outlet that focuses on Sudan.

Sudanese filmmaker and Nuba Mountain resident Hajooj Kuka said the U.N. ""felt that they didn't have a high level of control over the population in Yida so they wanted to move it and take over.""

Both the U.N. and South Sudan's government say they won't forcibly remove people, and currently the situation is at a standstill.

As long as there's aid, the probability of anyone leaving is slim, said resident James Kiir.

""Until you stop something hard like water or food, people will stay,"" he said.

• Centrality of protection: The protection crisis is the primary force behind rising hunger and malnutrition.

Trends continue to show that food insecurity rises wherever significant and/or prolonged violent conflict occurs. Intensified violence was most present in central Greater Bahr el Ghazal.

• Food insecurity: Roughly 5.1 million individuals experiencing IPC phases 3, 4, and 5, and represent the greatest proportion of South Sudanese to ever experience such levels of hunger and malnutrition. If the status quo remains, famine is likely to be present in many locations across South Sudan in the coming months.

• Optimize the response: Scaling interventions in a conflict sensitive way while increasing investment in recovery and resilience programing where possible will have the greatest impact on South Sudanese ability to face and bounce back from the numerous vulnerabilities they are currently facing.

• Economic situation: The deteriorating economic environment plays a significant role in preventing many South Sudanese from reaching their basic food needs.

• Over 138,000 displaced people in need of humanitarian assistance in Mundri East and West counties. An interagency team assessment conducted identifies the main needs as emergency shelter, medical supplies, water facilities, school materials, food and protection.

HIGHLIGHTS

In late February, the South Sudan Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Technical Working Group reported that approximately 5.3 million people faced severe levels of acute food insecurity during January, a 40 percent increase compared to January 2017. Famine is possible in South Sudan without unfettered and robust humanitarian assistance, according to the IPC analysis.

On March 6, the U.S. Government (USG) announced an additional $184 million in humanitarian assistance for the South Sudan response, including $145 million for interventions in South Sudan and nearly $39 million for life-saving assistance to South Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries. The new funding comprises more than $107 million from USAID/FFP, nearly $17 million from USAID/OFDA, and more than $60 million from State/PRM

CURRENT EVENTS

On February 26, the South Sudan IPC Technical Working Group reported that approximately 5.3 million people—nearly half of South Sudan’s population—experienced Crisis—IPC 3—or worse levels of acute food insecurity in January, with approximately 1 million people facing Emergency—IPC 4—levels.5 The severely food-insecure population represents a 40 percent increase compared to January 2017. The IPC analysis forecasts that food security in South Sudan will continue to deteriorate through July 2018 due to extreme macroeconomic instability and disrupted agricultural production resulting from conflict and population displacement. Famine in South Sudan may occur in 2018 if planned humanitarian assistance does not reach populations in need, the IPC Technical Working Group reports.

On February 13, USAID/FFP partner the UN World Food Program (WFP) transported approximately 500 metric tons (MT) of emergency food assistance via river barge from Upper Nile State’s Renk town, near the Sudan–South Sudan border, to the state’s Malakal town. The delivery represents the first time since December 2014 that WFP has used the river corridor to transport emergency food assistance between the two towns. WFP continues to explore new river transportation routes, which provide the UN agency flexible and cost-effective options to deliver life-saving food assistance.ns from both government and opposition forces, including in Unity’s Koch County and several parts of Central Equatoria. The Troika Heads of Mission—Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States—condemned the recent clashes between government and opposition forces in South Sudan.

INSECURITY, DISPLACEMENT, AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS

Continued clashes in Jonglei State prompted approximately 9,750 internally displaced persons (IDPs) to flee to Upper Nile’s Ulang County from January 1–February 5, according to a non-governmental organization (NGO) assessment. The assessment also identified acute health, nutrition, and protection needs due to assistance gaps and widespread displacement. IDPs reported limited access to functioning latrines, lack of food, and risk of sexual and gender-based violence. In February, NGOs reported that access constraints and bureaucratic impediments had delayed rapid responses to emergency needs among displaced populations in Ulang.

Clashes among armed groups in Yei County’s Makaia town, Central Equatoria State, displaced more than 3,360 IDPs to nearby Yei town between January 1 and February 19, according to the UN. Increased population movement to Yei town follows the January 26 establishment of a UN Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) temporary operating base in the town. Relief organizations are responding to increased need in Yei town by providing emergency food, health care, and shelter assistance to IDPs. However, IDPs in the area reported ongoing protection concerns, such as child abuse, family separation, and high levels of sexual and gender-based violence.

Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) elements denied passage to aid workers at a checkpoint in Western Bahr el Ghazal State’s Lokoloko town in early February, citing incorrect documentation, the UN reports. SPLA forces granted the humanitarian staff passage after the team returned several days later with additional documentation, including a letter from the Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GoRSS) Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and a copy of the November 2017 presidential decree calling on armed actors to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access in South Sudan. In addition, armed elements near Unity’s Bentiu town continued to operate unauthorized checkpoints and harass commercial vehicles transporting humanitarian cargo as of early March, according to the UN.

USAID/OFDA recently provided approximately $1.5 million in FY 2018 funding to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to support coordination, information management, and humanitarian advocacy and financing activities in South Sudan. The new funding brings total USAID/OFDA assistance for OCHA in South Sudan to $4 million from FY 2017–2018.

FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION

A combination of local crop production and humanitarian assistance since September 2017 has prevented worsening of food security in 17 counties and mitigated the risk of Famine in five counties, including in the Greater Baggari area in Western Bahr el Ghazal, the IPC Technical Working Group reports. Despite continued humanitarian assistance, populations in 71 out of South Sudan’s 86 counties are expected to face Crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity between May and July 2018. Furthermore, populations in 11 counties—including Jonglei’s Ayod, Fangak, Nyirol, Pibor, and Uror counties, Unity State’s Koch, Leer, Mayendit, and Panyijar counties, Upper Nile’s Longochuck County, and Western Bahr el Ghazal’s Wau County—could face Famine if humanitarian actors are unable to continue delivering humanitarian assistance in the coming months.

Despite adequate rainfall during the 2017 planting season, cereal production in 2017 decreased nearly 8 percent compared to 2016, representing the lowest cereal production since the current conflict began in December 2013, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The UN agency projects the crop deficit to worsen during 2018, with crop production expected to be an estimated 482,000 MT below average—more than 25 percent higher than the 2017 crop deficit. FAO reports that conflict in 2017 disrupted livelihoods activities for farmers and reduced the average area of land planted per household, particularly in Central Equatoria and Western Bahr el Ghazal, where harvested areas decreased by nearly 50 percent and more than 25 percent, respectively.

Approximately 76 percent of households in the vicinity of the capital city of Juba were food insecure and only 20 percent were consuming acceptable quantities and types of food as of late 2017, according to the recently released Juba Urban Food Security and Nutrition Study, which was conducted by UN agencies, NGOs, and the GoRSS. The assessment concluded that families in Juba remain highly dependent on markets to purchase food and the country’s ongoing economic crisis has reduced household purchasing power and restricted access to food. Nearly 50 percent of surveyed households reported using more than 65 percent of total household expenditures on food, while 35 percent reported relying on emergency coping strategies—such as consuming seeds or selling productive assets—to afford food. The assessment also identified GAM levels of more than 10 percent in Juba—similar levels compared to assessments conducted in 2015 and 2016.

USAID/FFP recently provided more than $107 million in emergency food assistance to support the humanitarian response in South Sudan. The USAID/FFP contribution includes nearly $75 million, including 36,000 MT of U.S. in-kind food aid, to support WFP’s emergency food assistance operations across South Sudan. USAID/FFP also provided approximately $17.8 million to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to support the provision of emergency food assistance in Jonglei. In addition, USAID/FFP provided approximately $14.4 million—including 1,170 MT of ready-to-use therapeutic food—to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to support life-saving nutrition interventions that treat children younger than five years of age facing severe acute malnutrition.

HEALTH AND WASH As of March 1, health actors had recorded 34 suspected meningitis cases, including 15 related deaths, in Torit County’s Imvrok and Iyire payams, Eastern Equatoria, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO). Approximately 95 percent of the population in Torit ages 1–29 years received meningitis vaccinations during a national campaign in 2016. However, relief actors report limited health services in the affected area and note that some households in the county are hesitant to seek assistance at health care facilities due to a preference for traditional medicine. Relief organizations are coordinating with local health authorities to scale up response efforts in Torit.

In February, increased measles transmission in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State prompted the declaration of an outbreak in Aweil Center and Aweil East counties, according to the UN. On February 13, health organizations in Aweil Center recorded three confirmed measles cases and two related deaths, resulting in the declaration of a measles outbreak. By late February relief actors in Aweil East had recorded 11 suspected cases of measles, including three confirmed cases, resulting in the declaration of an outbreak, WHO reported. The GoRSS Ministry of Health is coordinating response activities, including information campaigns, case management, and a reactive vaccination campaign. In response to the measles outbreaks, NGOs are bolstering disease surveillance activities in the two counties and plan to integrate nutrition screenings, Vitamin A distributions, and deworming activities in future vaccination campaigns, according to the UN.

Health actors reported 32 suspected cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), including five related deaths, between December 7, 2017 and February 18, 2018, according to WHO. Despite decreasing levels of human transmission attributable in part to public awareness campaigns, livestock transmission continues. The majority of RVF cases affect small ruminants, leaving female-headed households—commonly reliant on goats and sheep rather than large ruminants such as cattle—more vulnerable to food insecurity, according to USAID health advisors.

USAID/OFDA recently provided $3 million in FY 2018 funding to UNICEF to support multi-sector humanitarian interventions across South Sudan. Among other activities, the USAID/OFDA funding will support the commodity pipeline of the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster—the coordinating body for humanitarian WASH activities, comprising UN agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. With USAID/OFDA assistance, UNICEF will facilitate distribution of emergency WASH supplies, such as water containers and water purification tablets, to populations in need, while helping to mitigate the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases during the May-to-September rainy season.

USG RESPONSE

From February 19–20, USAID staff, including USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members, traveled to Upper Nile’s Aburoc and Kodok towns to assess humanitarian conditions and response efforts and meet with partner organizations and affected populations. The trip represented the first USAID visit to Aburoc since widespread violence prompted large-scale population displacement in the area during early 2017. In Kodok, the USAID team observed the efforts of USAID/OFDA partner World Vision to mitigate sexual and gender-based violence and other protection risks through provision of safe drinking water. World Vision is operating a water treatment system near the Nile River, which provides a safe place for women to collect water. In addition, the NGO is rehabilitating boreholes in Kodok, reducing the distance women must travel to access safe drinking water and thereby minimizing exposure to armed elements.

USAID staff, including DART members, visited Upper Nile’s Malakal town on February 14 to observe humanitarian conditions and relief activities in the town and nearby UNMISS protection of civilians (PoC) site. According to UNMISS, approximately 15,000–20,000 people are residing in Malakal town; however, the USAID team witnessed limited market activity during the mid-February visit. In addition, approximately 24,400 people were sheltering at the PoC site as of late February, according to the UN. Despite congested conditions, the USAID team observed comprehensive and well-organized humanitarian services in the camp. Communities within and outside of the PoC site in Malakal continue to depend on humanitarian assistance to meet basic needs, such as access to health care services, safe drinking water, food commodities, and nutrition assistance.

In Malakal, the USAID team visited a USAID/South Sudan-supported school and observed a USAID/OFDA–supported project that addresses food security, livelihoods, and WASH needs. In the PoC site, USAID staff visited a USAID/OFDA-supported health clinic, WASH facility, and psychosocial support center, as well as a USAID/South Sudan-supported youth center, library, and school.

INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

On February 6, the Government of Japan announced approximately $26 million in new humanitarian funding for the South Sudan response, which will support 16 NGOs to deliver emergency food, health care, nutrition, protection, and WASH interventions across the country. The Government of Japan is also providing an additional $8 million to assist South Sudanese refugees sheltering in neighboring countries.

CONTEXT The January 2005 signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the southern-based SPLA officially ended more than two decades of north–south conflict during which famine, fighting, and disease killed an estimated 2 million people and displaced at least 4.5 million others within Sudan. In July 2011, South Sudan became an independent state following a referendum earlier in the year.

On December 15, 2013, clashes erupted in Juba between factions within the GoRSS and quickly spread into a protracted national conflict. On December 20, 2013, USAID activated a DART to lead the USG response to the crisis in South Sudan. USAID also stood up a Washington, D.C.-based Response Management Team (RMT) to support the DART.

On February 20, 2017, the IPC Technical Working Group declared Famine levels of food insecurity in Unity’s Leer and Mayendit counties. On June 21, 2017, the IPC Technical Working Group declared that sustained humanitarian interventions had moderately improved food security conditions in Leer and Mayendit, resulting in the removal of the Famine level designation for acute food insecurity in the counties. Life-threatening food insecurity continues to impact households across South Sudan.

On October 19, 2017, U.S. Chargé d’Affaires, a.i., Michael K. Morrow redeclared a disaster in South Sudan for FY 2018 due to ongoing violent conflict, population displacement, restricted humanitarian access, and disruption of trade, markets, and cultivation activities, all of which have significantly exacerbated food insecurity and humanitarian needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-crisis-fact-sheet-5-fiscal-year-fy-2018
11,south+sudan,"The family of South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar say they're disappointed in a decision by the East African regional bloc IGAD to impose conditions on his release. The former vice president has been under house arrest in South Africa since 2016.

On Monday 26 March, the Council of ministers of the regional bloc called for South Sudan’s former vice president to be freed from house arrest in Johannesburg.

""Every time we asked who was keeping him in South Africa, we weren't given any answers. At least somebody has admitted now responsibility, now we've got answers,"" Machar’s wife, Angelina Teny, told RFI late on Thursday, in response to IGAD’s decision.

Riek Machar fled the South Sudanese capital Juba in July 2016 after fresh fighting broke out, jeopardizing renewed efforts to restore the August 2015 peace agreement.

With limited options available, Machar ended up in South Africa, and was placed under house arrest thereafter.

""We are not even aware why he’s there,"" says Teny, who is also a senior opposition member. She also expressed astonishment that IGAD ""would attach conditions to his release.""

They include the obligation for the leader of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) to renounce violence and refrain from obstructing the peace process.

""We’re not aware that Riek Machar has been engaged in any personal violence, that he had to personally renounce, so we see that that is baseless,"" Teny retorts.

‘From one prison to another’

A statement issued on Monday by officials from the eight countries in the bloc also added that Machar should ""be allowed to relocate to any country outside the region and not neighbouring South Sudan.""

""IGAD is basically trying to transfer him from one prison to another,"" Teny says in response.

""We don’t know what crime he has committed that justifies him being kept for a year and a half without charge.""

Machar was an instrumental figure in South Sudan’s fight for independence from Sudan. Yet since his exile, he has been frozen out of the peace process, angering members of his armed opposition.

Moreover, the decision by IGAD to transfer the rebel leader to a country outside of the East African region, has further strengthened suspicion that the regional bloc is biased in favour of Kiir.

""Isolating the SPLM-IO, then deciding to house arrest our leader, brings questions even to the process that IGAD is leading, and their impartiality in the process,"" challenges Teny.

Fledgling peace

IGAD, together with regional and international partners, have been trying to revitalize fledgling peace talks. Their efforts saw Machar declare a cessation of hostilities with the government of Salva Kiir on December 21, 2017.

Scarcely a day later, however, it was back to business as usual, as offensives were launched by both sides and President Salva Kiir demanded that diplomats and journalists cease publishing 'negative' reports.

The conflict, which began in 2013 as a political fallout between Machar and Kiir, has escalated into ethnic violence and the displacement of over 2.2 million people.

Today, the world’s newest nation should be benefitting from its rich oil reserves. It is instead facing famine and severe food shortages. And the patience of the international community is running out.

How much of the multi-layered conflict - that has at various times implicated Uganda, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia - can be blamed on Machar? His wife maintains that the rebel leader has always sought peace.

“In fact, the war has been a war of resistance, against the government’s scorched earth policy,"" explains Teny, which even rights groups have denounced.

Future of South Sudan

However, rights groups have also accused Machar of recruiting youth from Uganda to try and shore up the ranks of the SPLM-IO. These allegations have been dismissed as ""baseless"" by Teny.

""We actually have a policy of non-tolerance,"" she defends, before acknowledging that one of their commanders in Western Bahr el Ghazal, recently handed over 14 children that were found to be among their ranks.

""I’m not going to say that the SPLM-IO is 100% on the right and this and that. Sometimes things do happen, but they’re not policies.""

On the future of South Sudan, Teny maintains that a lasting peace agreement can only be achieved if IGAD can show its ""impartiality.""

If the bloc is truly serious about peace, then it should put pressure on all of South Sudan's leaders, not just Machar, she insists.

""IGAD is actually using words that are coined by Juba. For example, ‘renunciation of violence,’ this phrase emerged in Juba in 2016 and has now become part of IGAD’s statements and communiqués!""

To end the cycle of failed ceasefires that have tarnished the image of the world’s youngest nation, Tery says that ""IGAD must be neutral.""

Executive Summary

For the past several years, South Sudan has spiralled out of control. The nation’s still young history is marred by brutal conflict and failed peace agreements, creating one of the most extreme humanitarian crises in the world. As another Cessation of Hostilities agreement falters and hopes dim for regional leadership during a time of upheaval in Ethiopia, it is time for the European Union to more clearly and consistently assert leadership and develop much-needed financial leverage that could support a truly reinvigorated peace process.

The European Union provided over 350 million euros in aid to South Sudan in 2017, focusing particularly on assistance to South Sudan’s neighbours facing serious challenges related to caring for the more than 2 million refugees, who have crossed the border in search of safety. The United Kingdom plays a leading role in international diplomacy on South Sudan through its place in the “Troika” (along with Norway and the United States), and a number of EU member states play critical roles in providing development assistance and support to South Sudan and the broader region. Across the Atlantic Ocean, the United States remains a critical player on South Sudan policy issues. It has taken a number of strong steps to address the crisis since September 2017, including both the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s unprecedented issuance of an anti-money laundering “Advisory” to highlight concerns about corruption directly for the banking sector and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s non-sanctions measures focused on the oil sector. But the United States’ overall diplomatic strategy and level of engagement remains unclear, given the myriad uncertainties in the Trump administration, underscored by the recent dismissals of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. This, combined with paralysis on South Sudan in the U.N. Security Council, creates both an opening and a need for clearer action by the European Union to address the crisis.

To date, the European Union has principally answered with financial aid and humanitarian support, rather than a comprehensive approach that matches this critical engagement with meaningful leverage to drive change. Without this modernised approach to financial leverage and associated incentives—the likes of which have never been used by the European Union with respect to conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa—the crisis and suffering will persist.

On 2 February 2018, the European Union did take a first small step in this direction by designating for sanctions three current and former senior South Sudanese officials. The European Union should ensure that this is not an isolated action, but the first step in a sustained approach that follows this action by imposing and enforcing elevated financial pressures on other South Sudanese spoilers, from within the government and the opposition, who are driving violence and connected to grand corruption. Where possible, these measures should seek to impact the myriad companies that these leaders and their families own or control.

In the short term, the European Union can deploy the following modernised tools of financial pressure:

• Designating for sanctions key spoilers of the peace process and their business networks. Sanctions placed on only a few individuals and that lack enforcement are ineffective. Sanctions measures must impact not only individuals, but also their networks. Where possible, companies owned or controlled by those sanctioned should be included in EU actions, either formally or through indirect means, such as communications of names to banks.

• Issuing warnings or alerts to financial institutions concerning AML risks related to South Sudanese politically exposed persons (PEPs). These actions would have the greatest impact if EU member states with the most developed financial services sectors, such as the United Kingdom or Germany, take the lead.

• Engaging neighbouring governments. EU delegations should pressure key countries in the region, notably the financial intelligence units, central banks, and ministries of foreign affairs in Uganda and Kenya, to take action on AML risks related to South Sudanese PEPs. The European Union’s leverage with Kenya, a country that has focused heavily on developing its banking sector, has increased as it holds an increasing share of the country’s growing debt.

• Meeting with banks active in the region. In addition to governments, EU missions can highlight the risk of illicit activity and money laundering in relation to operations in South Sudan or with South Sudanese PEPs through direct meetings with banks. This includes major banks in the region, as well as those providing correspondent services from London, Berlin, and elsewhere in Europe.

In the medium to long term, the European Union should use these tools:

• Imposing sectoral-based restrictive measures on economic sectors that are under the control of certain political and military elites, such as the extractive industries, banking, and transport sectors. These measures need not be limited to asset freezes and travel bans but other measures that encourage responsible business behaviour by European and other companies, such as due diligence reporting requirements or more stringent limitations on lending.

• Further developing its autonomous evaluation process of high-risk third countries that have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes that pose significant threats to the EU’s financial system (rather than restricting to those countries that are of “economic importance” to the European Union).

• Becoming a cooperating member of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG).

• Convening discussions on governance conditional to disbursing non-emergency aid, and reassessing multilateral loans to government institutions led by corrupt politicians, like the Cotonou Agreement.

Deployed in a patient, persistent, and coordinated manner, these tools can build the leverage needed to finally change the calculations of those who have pushed South Sudan to crisis and strengthen the European Union’s role beyond one of providing never-ending financial and humanitarian assistance with no hope for a solution.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/europressure-eu-financial-leverage-impact-south-sudan
13,south+sudan,"March 28, 2018 (JUBA) - The Government of Japan has contributed $1 million for the mine action project dubbed “Enhancing the Humanitarian Mine Action Programme in South Sudan”.

Sign warning drivers in South Sudan to stay on the road or they might encounter land mines (Photo minefields.com)

Over the past six years, Japan has contributed over US $14 million to mine action operations in South Sudan, enabling the clearance of 3,034,713 sqm of land, the removal of 20,180 explosive hazards and the delivery of Mine Risk Education to 140,800 people, including 91,144 children.

Decades of civil war and continued conflict has littered vast areas of South Sudan with explosive hazards. Despite the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities signed by the Government of South Sudan and opposition parties in December 2017, armed violence and clashes have continued throughout the country.

The continued use of explosive weapons, such as rockets, grenades and mortars, has hindered the safe movement of the civilian population as well as the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance.

An estimated 6.3 million people in South Sudan – half the population – now live in counties where their safety is threatened by the presence of landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW).

While approximately 150 new hazardous areas are discovered every month, the full extent of contamination is unknown with large areas of the country requiring survey.

Continued funding from Japan will reportedly support four Field Assessment Teams (FATs) to mitigate the impact of explosive hazards, through survey and clearance as well as the provision of Mine Risk Education for conflict-affected populations.

The teams will provide national coverage from their bases in Bentiu, Bor, Malakal, and Wau to facilitate response in areas prioritized by humanitarian and development partners.

In South Sudan, mine action is a critical enabler of humanitarian aid, a key driver of socioeconomic development, and a strong promoter of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“The Government of Japan is committed to providing humanitarian, capacity building and development assistance to South Sudanese people. The US $1,000,000 assistance announced recently is part of the US $34 million assistance package to South Sudan,” the Japanese envoy to South Sudan, Seiji Okada said in a statement.

He added, “We trust UNMAS, together with its partners, will continue its important work of clearing land for people to go back to that land, so that they can engage in livelihood activities such as agriculture.”

The UNMAS South Sudan programme director, Tim Lardner, UNMAS lauded the Japanese government for its financial support.

“We admire Japan’s strong initiative and vital support for global mine action activities and for UNMAS. The Japanese people’s US $9.3 million donations to UNMAS for this year will benefit mine action programmes in six countries, including Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Sudan, Syria as well as South Sudan,” he said.

Japan has continued to be a supportive partner in mine action to South Sudan.

Last year, Japan supported risk mitigation of explosive hazards through survey and clearance, as well as risk education, but also maintained an important role in allowing UNMAS to work with government, through Mine Action Authority.

“It is great to have such a steady and reliable partner,"" stressed Lardner.

Humanitarian Coordinator calls for urgent action to avert worsening food crisis in South Sudan

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Alain Noudehou, led a high-level delegation of donors, heads of humanitarian agencies and partners to Leer in Unity on 7 March to see firsthand the plight of the 90,000 people living in the area. The delegation also met with the Governor of Leer, community leaders and aid agencies who are currently assisting tens of thousands of people across the region.

""Due to seasonal time pressure, we need funding now to reach millions of people with multisectoral assistance during the dry season, through road transport and prepositioning life-saving aid supplies. These same activities will be many times more costly if done by air transport during the rainy season,” said Mr. Noudehou. The Humanitarian Coordinator noted his concern regarding the potential effects of taxes and fees on humanitarian organizations and staff, which not only take much needed-resources from front line operations, but are often unpredictable and disruptive to the humanitarian response.

“Once again, I strongly urge all parties to the conflict to stop the fighting and to ensure that humanitarian agencies are given free, safe and unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan,” said Mr. Noudehou. Leer was one of two counties affected by famine in 2017. Although the famine was stopped, the situation remains fragile, with about 85 per cent of the population predicted to reach crisis and emergency food insecurity conditions (IPC Phases 3 and 4) by the end of April 2018.

Almost two-thirds of the South Sudan population at risk of rising hunger

More than 7 million people in South Sudan—almost two-thirds of the population—could become severely food insecure in the coming months without sustained humanitarian assistance and access, three United Nations agencies warned on 26 February.

If this happens, it will be the highest ever number of food insecure people in South Sudan. The period of greatest concern will be the lean season, between May and July. Particularly at risk are 155,000 people, including 29,000 children, who could reach the most extreme levels of hunger if assistance is not provided and sustained.

Improved access and a concerted humanitarian response succeeded in halting famine last year. Despite this, the scale and scope of food insecurity are reaching new highs, while crop production is compromised.

FAO, UNICEF and WFP warn that progress made could be undone, and more people than ever could be pushed into severe hunger conditions during May-July, unless assistance and access are maintained. Close monitoring of the situation, particularly in counties most at risk, will remain critical

""The situation is extremely fragile, and we are close to seeing another famine. The projections are stark. If we ignore them, we will be faced with a growing tragedy. If farmers receive support to resume their livelihoods, we will see a rapid improvement in the country's food security situation due to increased local production,"" said Serge Tissot,

Abstract

Introduction

The main causes of death during population movements can be prevented by addressing the population’s basic needs. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a framework for decision making to help prioritize vaccinations in acute humanitarian emergencies. This article describes MSF’s experience of applying this framework in addition to addressing key population needs in a displacement setting in Minkaman, South Sudan.

Case description

Military clashes broke out in South Sudan in December 2013. By May 2014, Minkaman, a village in the Lakes State, hosted some 85,000 displaced people. MSF arrived in Minkaman on 28 December 2013 and immediately provided interventions to address the key humanitarian needs (health care, access to drinking water, measles vaccination). The WHO framework was used to identify priority vaccines: those preventing outbreaks (measles, polio, oral cholera vaccine, and vaccine against meningococcal meningitis A (MenAfrivac®)) and those reducing childhood morbidity and mortality (pentavalent vaccine that combines diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B; pneumococcal vaccine; and rotavirus vaccine). By mid-March, access to primary and secondary health care was ensured, including community health activities and the provision of safe water. Mass vaccination campaigns against measles, polio, cholera, and meningitis had been organized. Vaccination campaigns against the main deadly childhood diseases, however, were not in place owing to lack of authorization by the Ministry of Health (MoH).

Conclusions

The first field use of the new WHO framework for prioritizing vaccines in acute emergencies is described. Although MSF was unable to implement the full package of priority vaccines because authorization could not be obtained from the MoH, a series of mass vaccination campaigns against key epidemic-prone diseases was successfully implemented within a complex emergency context. Together with covering the population’s basic needs, this might have contributed to reducing mortality levels below the emergency threshold and to the absence of epidemics. For the WHO framework to be used to its full potential it must not only be adapted for field use but, most importantly, national decision makers should be briefed on the framework and its practical implementation.

UNICEF and partners supported the release of 311 children (87 girls) associated with armed groups in Yambio, Western Equatoria state – the first release by any armed group in South Sudan in almost three years. These children are being supported to reintegrate back to their communities. This is the first phase of a process that is expected to see 700 children released from armed groups and forces in Yambio in the coming months.

South Sudan declared the end of its longest and largest cholera outbreak, which began in June 2016, with no new cases of cholera reported in over seven weeks. UNICEF and partners contributed to the efforts to overcome this outbreak through a range of prevention and response activities, including treating cholera patients and promoting good hygiene practices.

The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis was released in late February, and confirmed that in the absence of all forms of humanitarian assistance, up to 6.3 million people (57 per cent of the population) would be in Crisis (IPC phase 3) or Emergency (IPC phase 4) from February to April, including 50,000 people in hard-to-reach areas showing catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) conditions.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The longest and largest cholera outbreak was declared at an end, with no new cases of cholera reported in over seven weeks. The outbreak was first declared on 18 June 2016 and spread to many parts of the country, including Juba. By the time the last confirmed cholera case was discharged in December 2017, 20,438 cholera cases and 436 deaths had been reported. With the approaching rainy season, new cholera cases are likely to be reported.

After extensive negotiations with state and local authorities and local groups, UNICEF and partners supported the successful release of a total of 311 children associated with armed groups, including 87 girls, the largest number released in the country in nearly three years. The release was marked by a ceremony in Yambio, in Western Equatoria state, where the children were formally disarmed and provided with civilian clothes. This is the first phase of a process that is expected to see 700 children released from armed groups and forces in Yambio in the coming months.

The IPC food security update in late February confirmed that the food insecurity and nutrition situation in South Sudan remains of grave concern and is projected to significantly deteriorate as the lean season sets in.

In the absence of all forms of humanitarian assistance, some 6.3 million people (57 per cent of the population) are facing IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) levels of food insecurity in February to April.

This figure is projected to rise to 7.1 million people (65 per cent of the population) in May to July.

Out of this food insecure population, 50,000 people are estimated to be in IPC Phase 5 February to April, and this figure is expected to rise to 155,000 people in May to July.

These are, and will be, the highest levels of food insecurity ever experienced in South Sudan, with virtually every community in the country in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The depletion of food stocks and the early onset of the lean season due to conflict-related displacement and agricultural disruption are expected to exacerbate this outlook, and the poor nutrition situation is expected to deteriorate greatly as the lean season sets in around May/June. The risk of widespread famine (IPC Phase 5) remains extremely high in a worst-case scenario, especially with conflict-related restrictions to population movement and lack of sustained humanitarian assistance due to access constraints.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unicef-south-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-1-28-february-2018
17,south+sudan,"March 17, 2018 (JUBA) - The forum for non-governmental entities (NGOs) in South Sudan has appealed for more funding from donor countries to help avert a looming humanitarian crisis in the war-torn nation.

“NGOs are appealing to donors to continue to assist those most affected by the crisis in South Sudan in 2018 including vulnerable women, children and elderly people. Please support our effort to save lives and alleviate human suffering in the world’s youngest nation”, partly reads statement the forum issued.

The humanitarian crisis has continued to deepen and spread across South Sudan, with at least 7 people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, aid agencies say.

The conflict in South Sudan, now in its fifth year, has triggered the displacement of 4 million people internally and across the country’s borders with neighbouring nations.

""The economic crisis is driving high rates of food insecurity and malnutrition, with 48% of the population now estimated to be in crisis or worse levels of food security,” the NGO forum said in the statement.

In 2017, after the declaration of famine in southern Unity state, a large-scale humanitarian response helped to prevent its spread and mitigate worsening food insecurity for populations at particular risk.

However, the rates of food insecurity have remained high and the long-term impact of conflict and an economic crisis are engulfing previously productive regions.

A staggering 1.1 million children under the age of 5 are reported to be acutely malnourished and in need of life-saving services.

“In the absence of humanitarian assistance, during the lean season months of May-July 2018, an estimated 7.1 million (63% of the population) will face severe food insecurity, out of which 155,000 would be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) and 2.3 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4)”, further stressed the statement.

The group has warned that the current drivers of food insecurity to persist and worsen through the end of 2018, there is a heightened risk of famine in areas where large populations are already experiencing severe food insecurity.

They urged all parties to the conflict to bring an end to the fighting and support the peace talks.

NGO forum in South Sudan consists of over 300 members that include both local and international organizations.

In February 2018, population displacement was reported in Unity and Central Equatoria following clashes between government and opposition forces. From 16 to 17 February, fighting in Bauw, Koch County (Unity), led to civilian deaths, destruction of homes and displacement. Brief clashes were also reported in Leer town. In Central Equatoria, over 3,360 IDPs (653 households) were displaced from Makaia to Yei town, after fighting broke out.

During the same month, the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis estimated that in the worst case scenario, 6.3 million people, or 57 per cent of the population of South Sudan, would be severely food insecure from February to April 2018. In Eastern Equatoria, health partners reported suspected cases of meningitis, with 162 suspected cases and 30 deaths in Iyire and Imurok payams, Torit County. In February, South Sudan declared the end of its longest and largest cholera outbreak, with no new cases of cholera reported in over seven weeks. Since June 2016, over 20,000 suspected cholera cases and 436 deaths had been reported.

During February, aid agencies assisted over 1.4 million people out of the 6 million people targeted in 2018. This included: more than 1.2 million who received food assistance and emergency livelihoods; more than 382,000 who were provided with access to clean water; nearly 9,000 people assisted with vital non-food items, including blankets and mosquito nets; nearly 61,000 children and pregnant and lactating women provided with emergency nutritional assistance; nearly 216,000 children supported with access to education in emergencies; more than 153,000 people who received health care services; and nearly 60,000 people who received gender-based violence, child protection and mine awareness education services",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-dashboard-28-february-2018
19,south+sudan,"The Humanitarian Coordinator, Alain Noudehou, led a high-level delegation of donors, heads of humanitarian agencies and partners to Leer in the Unity region of South Sudan to see firsthand the plight of the 90,000 people living in the area.

The delegation met with the Governor of Leer, community leaders and aid agencies who are currently assisting tens of thousands of people across the region.

Leer was one of two counties affected by famine in 2017. Although the famine was stopped due to intensive humanitarian intervention, the situation remains fragile with about 85% of the population predicted to reach crisis and emergency food insecurity conditions (IPC Phases 3 and 4) by the end of April.

“Due to seasonal time pressure, we need early funding now to reach millions of people with multi-sectoral assistance during the dry season through road transport and prepositioning of life-saving aid supplies. These same activities will be many times more costly if done by air transport during the rainy season,” said Alain Noudehou.

A recent report analyzing food security in the conflict-affected country projected that more than seven million people - almost two-thirds of the population of South Sudan - could become severely food insecure between May and July without sustained humanitarian assistance and access.

With the conflict in South Sudan now in its fifth year, civilians across the country are continuing to suffer from hunger, disease and displacement. Nearly 4.3 million people – one in three South Sudanese – have been displaced, including more than 1.8 million who are internally displaced and about 2.5 million who are in neighbouring countries.

“Once again, I strongly urge all parties to the conflict to stop the fighting and to ensure that humanitarian agencies are given free, safe and unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan, and for all bureaucratic impediments to be removed,” said Alain Noudehou.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/humanitarian-coordinator-calls-urgent-action-avert-worsening-food-crisis-south

The Archbishop of Gulu Archdiocese who also doubles as the chairman of Uganda Episcopal Conference (UEC), John Baptist Odama has asked christians in Acholi sub-region to pray for peace in South Sudan.



Odama was speaking at a joint way of cross which attracted thousands of believers who turned up for the event.



The way of cross started at Christ Church parish of diocese of Northern Uganda and ended at Saint Basil, the great orthodox Parish in Layibi division, Gulu municipality.



The journey which brought all the three denominations of Catholic, Anglican and the Orthodox Church together is held every year to emulate the suffering of Jesus Christ.



Odama on his message emphasised that the way of the cross should help the believers to pray for the citizens of South Sudan who are suffering due to the war in their country.



“There is no peace in South Sudan, and the way of cross should help us to pray for them so that God gives peace to the people of South Sudan” Odama said.



Odama added that showing love to each other can bring peace in the country, adding that people should adopt that act of charity for peace to prevail in their life time.",https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1474530/christians-gulu-peace-south-sudan
21,south+sudan,"1. Background: Intervention overview

Nyirol East County is one of the County that makes up the newly created Bieh state. It consists of five Payams of lankien, Dengdor, Thol, Tut and Natim each headed by payam chief. The payams are further, divided in to bomas, each headed by boma chief, who are responsible to the payam chiefs (head chief). The payam chiefs in turn are directly responsible to the county commissioner. The population of Nyirol East County predominantly depends on livestock keeping, as the main source of livelihood and do practice farming at subsistence level. The level of education is minimal, with few able to read and write.

The population of Nyirol East County has not been stable since the outbreak of conflict in 2013 according to the local authority (ROSS Coordinator). The population keeps on changing from time to time, due to the influx of IDP from the neighbouring Counties. Towards mid last year (2017), there has been serious displacement of people from the neighbouring counties (Waat, Chuil, Khorphulus, Walgak and Uror) of Nyirol East County in to the five payams of Nyirol East County due to military engagements between rebels and the government forces. This has raised a concern and propelled the State Focal Person (SFP) for ES/NFIs Jongolei, to conduct a rapid assessment in Nyirol East in August 2017. The outcome of the assessment report shows, there exist IDPs in five payams of Nyirol East, displaced from Waat, Walgak, Chuil, Khorphulus, who arrived in the five payams of Nyirol East from July and August 2017 and are in dire need of humanitarian support.

Based on this rapid assessment report, ES/ NFIs cluster requested PAH to carry out assessment centred on ES/NFIs needs in the area. While on the ground, the assessment team [PAH team], vindicated the existence of IDPs in Lankien, Dengdor, Thol, Tut and Natiom payam of Nyirol East County, from Waat, Chuil, Khorphulus, Walgak and they are not in their home villages.

This resulted in to the registration and verification of IDPs in the five payams of Nyirol East County by the PAH team.

During the exercise, the team found out, the number of IDPs that came from all the five Payams of Nyirol East County were found to be 1250HH [7,815 individual]. This has not been in line with the previous assessment conducted by ES/NFI SFP Jongolei in August 2017 in which the number of the IDPs in the five payams of Nyirol East was 1680 HH [9,011 individuals]. Majority of the IDPs, come from Waat and Chill based on the registration and distribution records. The reduction in this number of IDPs from Waat and Chill was due to integration of some of the IDPs in to the host communities.

No tension registered between IDPs and the host community in terms of cooking items, land, and host families are willing to stay with the IDPs until the security situation in their places of origin is normal. Tukuls in the five payams are ok and the IDPs were, given some Rokubas by the hosting families. So, no overcrowding seen. The number of persons sleeping in a Rokuba range from 3-4 persons.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-post-distribution-monitoring-nfis-distribution-idps-returnees-and

JUBA, March 28 (Reuters) - South Sudan shut down mobile operator Vivacell's service overnight, demanding $66 million in license fees and locking out 900,000 subscribers.

Vivacell, owned by Lebanon's Fattouch Investment Group, is one of three mobile phone operators in South Sudan - competing with South Africa's MTN and Kuwait's Zain.

Last week, the government gave the company seven days to comply with unspecified rules and regulations and pay its license fee or its operations would be shut down.

""They have no license. We want them to pay a sum of 66 million dollars for their license and up to now they have not paid,"" Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told Reuters late on Tuesday.

International traffic had already been switched off last week, angering customers.

""It is abrupt and it has disorganized my business communication. I am losing contact (with overseas suppliers) by switching to another line, which is very painful,"" said Khalid Ramadhan, a Juba businessman who imports mobile phones and computers from places like Dubai.

Vivacell's managing director, Jesus Antonio Ortiz Olivo, said company officials went to Makuei's office this week to try to discuss the situation but the minister would not meet them.

""We are still working on it as of now. I cannot say anything in regards to the shutting down by the honorable minister,"" Ortiz Olivo told Reuters.

The company said on Wednesday it was engaging with the ""relevant authorities"" to ensure the network was restored in the shortest time possible.

""In the unfortunate event the network is not switched back on, Vivacell will duly provide for a clear mechanism for re-imbursement of the cash equivalent of the airtime and simcard stock currently being held by all the dealers,"" it said in a statement.

At midnight on Tuesday, the network signal on the mobile phones of Vivacell customers went off, making it impossible to receive or make any calls.

Vivacell accounts for nearly a third of up to 3 million mobile subscribers in South Sudan, which has been torn by civil war since 2013. Some of its customers were already planning to switch to another service provider.

One Vivacell subscriber, who did not wish to be named, said MTN was likely to be the biggest beneficiary of the switch-off, leading to congestion on the network.

""Vivacell should expedite means of resolving the differences with the government for the sake of the users,"" the customer said.
