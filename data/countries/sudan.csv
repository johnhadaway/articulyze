0,sudan,"Sennar / Nyala / Kadugli — Vehicle owners in Singa, capital of Sennar reported that their vehicles malfunctioned after they supplied them with fuel from one of the town's service pumps on Monday and Tuesday.

The fuel crisis has led to dryness of crops and other orchards along the banks of the Blue Nile river in Sennar.

Orchard owner Adil Yagoub told Radio Dabanga that ""The orchards planted with tomatoes, bananas and onions which rely on irrigation with pumps have been subjected to thirst and burning due to the lack of diesel"".

He said that the quantities of diesel certified by the security services are inadequate which doubled the losses.

South Darfur

On Tuesday students and residents of Nyala protested the lack of transportation because of the inability of the government to supply petrol and chanted against the government.

Yesterday morning the fuel crisis paralysed movement in Nyala.

Residents said the available vehicles are few compared to the city's population and the crisis has continued despite the begging the security forces to transport people from the gathering places.

South Kordofan

The authorities of Kadugli in South Kordofan began to withdraw fuel-handling cards for owners of vehicles operating in internal transport.

The Ministry of Commerce said that the markets were about to reach the stage of chaos as a result of what it called an unjustified rise in the prices of goods.

Trade Minister Hatim El Sir announced the establishment of a regulatory body to control the prices of goods in the market and monitor putting stickers on sales of goods, in addition to identifying telephone numbers for immediate notification and receipt of complaints about the absence of stickers.

The minister said in response to a parliamentary question on the rise in commodity prices that his ministry has made amendments to the Consumer Protection Act to control the prices of goods and not increase them.

The minister announced the opening of import in cooperation with the Central Bank to import production inputs and raw materials.",Sudan: 'Faulty Fuel' in Sudan's Sennar As Crisis Drags-On,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805090554.html
1,sudan,"Khartoum — Dr Mohamed El Mahdi Hasan, the head of the Political Bureau of Sudan's opposition National Umma Party (NUP), said that the political and economic crisis in Sudan has escalated in an unprecedented manner in the light of an official government silence.

in an interview with Radio Dabanga, Dr Hasan ridiculed the statements made by government officials to ease the fuel crisis and on the restart of El Jeili refinery.

He pointed to the continuation of the queues of vehicles in front of petrol stations and crowding of people in the transportation stations yesterday.

Dr Hassan explained that the crisis has severely affected drinking water in east and west Sudan. He criticised the government for not explaining the matter to the citizens and leaving them to the rumours and speculations and warned of the serious social and moral effects of economic crises.

He said that visiting delegations to Sudan do not have the keys to the solution, rather do they come to Khartoum to achieve their interests.

Dr Hassan explained that the solution of the crises should come from inside and rather than from abroad and harshly criticised the government for trying to resolve the crisis by buying fuel from brokers in the Red Sea.

He said that the respected countries resolve such issues by signing protocols with the oil-exporting countries rather than dealing with brokers' vessels.

Dr Hassan pointed to the aggravation of the political crisis within the ruling National Congress Party concerning the re-nomination of Al Bashir in 2020 and the escalation of conflicts among senior leaders in the government and the party.

He expressed surprise at bringing a number of Rapid Support Forces to Khartoum, explaining that the authority responsible for securing the capital is the police not any other party.

'Agriculture, transport affected'

Economic analyst Hafiz Ismail pointed to the serious effects of the current economic crisis on the productive sectors such as agriculture and transport, which affects the estimates of the budget of 2018 called for review.

in an interview with Radio Dabanga he said that the crisis has reached its peak during the last period with the exacerbation of the crisis of fuel and liquidity and the lack of confidence in the banking sector.

He considered the current economic crisis a natural result of the accumulation of crises during the previous years.

Ismail said that resolving the economic crisis is through clarity of the political vision and the development of an economic vision including structural treatments, and criticised the government for resorting to solutions such as cash deposits and commodity loans.

He explained that it leads to further complication of the crisis.

Ismail told Radio Dabanga that the agreements on commodity loans in oil under the exacerbation of the crisis mostly include a lot of unfair conditions.

He explained that the previous crises have been addressed through cash deposits or fast commodity loans, pointing out that the default in repayment leads to a permanent cessation of loans and exacerbation of crises.",Sudan Opposition Head Condemns Government Silence On Economic Crisis,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805090552.html

Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

This is the second incident involving an attack on aid workers by armed groups in April alone and the third in the last six months in South Sudan.",South Sudan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 04 | 30 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-04-30-april-2018
5,sudan,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Sudan witnessed keen improvements in security conditions in 2017, and limited new internal displacement, as compared with 2016. However, an increase in the number of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Sudan, in addition to disease outbreaks, and long-term food insecurity and malnutrition contributed to increasing the humanitarian caseload.

Estimates by the Government of Sudan show 386,000 people returned voluntarily to areas of origin, in 2017, either from refugee communities in neighbouring countries, or from internal displacement camps. On the refugee front, at least 195,000 people arrived in Sudan in 2017, many fleeing the conflict in South Sudan. Another 200,000 people are expected to arrive throughout 2018.

This movement foreshadows what is predicted for 2018, and already caused shifts in the humanitarian landscape. The cessation of hostilities in Darfur, and between Government forces and rebel movements in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, allowed humanitarians to reach hundreds of communities, many of whom had lain for years outside reach. Both this access and easier obtainment of travel permits and procedures for humanitarian workers was the product of painstaking negotiations between the Government and the United Nations. To this end, new government directives launched in late 2016 set the tone in 2017 for daily improvements in the relationship between Government and implementing partners.

In this partially transformed humanitarian backdrop, partners worked to align humanitarian assistance and resilience, selfreliance and prevention activities, essential building blocks in building the capacity of the most vulnerable to resist shocks such as conflict, drought, floods, health crises, and economic hardship.

Despite the positive security developments, humanitarian conditions suffered the dramatic effects of the Government of Sudan’s structural adjustment reform, and the steep devaluation of the Sudanese pound. Combined with drought conditions, rampant inflation triggered by currency devaluation caused the price of grain to double, tipping another 1.5 million people into severe food insecurity in at least three states covered by humanitarian aid – Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur.

On a related but separate note, malnutrition continued to afflict millions of children across Sudan. Humanitarian partners reached 1.4 million children under five with Vitamin A supplementation, integrated with immunization services. Another 377,657 children with severe acute malnutrition had access to treatment services and programmes. Successful forays in treating malnutrition as a cross-cutting issue served to influence humanitarian partners to work together to gain efficiency in programme-delivery for improved results.

BASIC HEALTH PROVISION AND DISEASE OUTBREAK

On the health front, 824 people died and thousands more suffered from Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), a water-borne disease closely associated to cholera. Fully preventable, AWD occurs because of poor hygiene and lack of basic sanitation. Although 1.7 million people were provided access to sufficient drinking water, and 520,000 with access to adequate sanitation, in 2017, 12 per cent of Sudan’s population continued to practice open air defecation, contributing to the AWD problem.

On a more positive note, at least 78 per cent of all children born in Sudan were delivered with support from a trained midwife. In this regard, SHF funds were instrumental in providing power to health clinics and posts in Darfur, contributing to an environment for safe deliveries.

LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT AND LIVELIHOODS

The scale and long-term nature of displacement, especially in Darfur, has caused an unprecedented loss of livelihoods for millions. In 2017, a push towards voluntary returns to areas of origin exposed both the displaced and host communities to competition for scarce resources, leading to further economic hardship and uncertainty about the future.

As the war in Darfur recedes, millions of people in displacement camps began to show signs of restlessness, resulting in a marked increase in cases of inter-communal violence and petty crime both in camps and in host communities.

In many parts of Darfur, inter-communal conflict is a large cause of insecurity, and has reportedly kept IDPs from returning to areas of origin. Localised armed violence in many cases replaced the formerly warring militias. Such localised armed violence, which takes place most frequently between sedentary farmers and pastoral communities, and the many nomadic communities remained only partially resolved with the establishment of several animal migration corridors for the benefit of pastoralist communities, and to preserve agricultural fields.

Of additional concern, many of the displaced return to lands which had been occupied in their absence by other communities, militias or agri-businesses. Addressing the issue of land tenure and the management of resources will be pivotal in consolidating peace and in providing an exit strategy from Sudan’s protracted humanitarian crises to one of nation-building and economic development.",Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

AWD cases reported only in Central Darfur during March

While all the other 17 States in Sudan—where AWD was reported before—continued to report zero cases in the past three months, during March, new cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) were reported in Central Darfur State. This was reported in the latest AWD update issued by Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) this week. Between 1 March and 3 April 2018, 151 cases of AWD were reported in Central Darfur, with no AWD-related deaths. The total number of new AWD cases reported from Central Darfur from February to March is 468, with almost all cases reported from 63 inaccessible villages in West Jebel Marra locality.

The incidence of AWD outbreak in Sudan started on 17 August 2016 in Kassala State and by May 2017 had spread to 10 states, expanding by August 2017 to all 18 of Sudan’s states. So far, the disease has claimed 823 deaths (case fatality rate of 2.23 per cent) resulting from 37,000 cases (attack rate – 10,09 per 10,000). It has also affected all demographic groups, with females constituting 59 per cent and children below 5 years of age accounting for 15 per cent of all reported cases.

To eliminate the transmission of AWD, response activities must continue until four-week consecutive zero reporting is in place nationwide, in all localities. WHO and FMoH have proposed an in-depth evaluation of AWD response and risk assessment to refine and re-strategize control efforts in early 2018.

There has been fighting here in the capital of South Sudan's Unity State since the country's civil war began in 2013.

Today, after a year of relative calm, violence has again surged between government forces and the opposition.

The head of the United Nations Mission in Unity, Hiroko Hirahara, believes that this is linked to an upcoming round of peace talks.

""People started becoming a bit more political because they wanted to position themselves,"" she told Euronews' reporter in South Sudan, Monica Pinna.

""That doesn’t only mean politically but also what they occupy. Because if and when the peace process starts talking about the implementation of the agreement, these questions will come up: 'Where is your territory?' 'Who are you?' 'Which party are you representing?'""

Five years of civil war

The civil war has entered its fifth year.

Today armed conflict is ongoing and potentially expanding in the states of Unity, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Upper Nile. What's more, the west of the country could easily flare up again, according to NGOs.

The conflict has triggered a desperate humanitarian situation with over two million refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries and two million more people internally displaced (IDPs).

The biggest camp for internally displaced people is in Bentiu. Some 120,000 people live in the so-called 'Protection of Civilians' settlement, watched over by the UN and assisted by NGOs and agencies like UNICEF.

""The humanitarian situation is becoming almost unbearable, with areas remaining cut off for weeks,"" UNICEF's Field Office head in Bentiu, Mustapha Ben Messaud, told Euronews.

""Since 2013, we've had 100 humanitarian workers lose their lives. The population suffers this on a daily basis. They face violence. Over the past six weeks, unfortunately, 30,000 children have been unable to go to school because of the latest fighting in this geographic area.""

Active hostilities impacting humanitarian operations have led to record levels of food insecurity. Last year, famine was declared in parts of Unity State, meaning 100,000 people faced starvation.

""Over 6 million South Sudanese people are suffering from severe food insecurity as a result of the conflict,"" Monica Pinna said from outside the local hospital.

""Malnourushed children are an early indicator. Here at Bentiu's hospital, the numbers are growing, each week.""

""Currently, we have 120 cases admitted for severe acute malnutrition and these cases have been increasing on a monthly basis,"" explained Gitau Nicholas Chege, Nutrition Program Manager with Care International.

""This is in regard to the influx of IDPs who come here. If these children are not screened, they end up dying.""

South Sudan's government urged the United States on Wednesday not to ""abandon"" the country after Washington said it would review its assistance programs because it could not continue a partnership with leaders perpetuating ""endless war"".

The US is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Its funding provides aid to millions of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda and lifesaving assistance such as food to people still inside the war-torn country.

Washington's statement says the US is committed to saving lives but does not want its assistance to ""prolong the conflict"" or facilitiate corrupt behaviour by elites.

""The Government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,"" the White House declared.

""I saw many bodies on the ground, but nobody buried them""

More mothers are coming with their children for hospital treatment in Bentiu from Leer, a county in southern Unity that is currently under fire.

Nyajiel Pech is 30-years-old and has 5 children. She had to walk for six days without food to reach the hospital. Her son is severely malnourished.

""Many people died, many people escaped and went to the bush but have disappeared since,"" she said.

""I saw many bodies on the ground, but nobody buried them. We ran away when we saw this.""

Fought largely along ethnic lines, the war started just two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011.

The world's youngest state plunged into crisis when President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer.

Rampant sexual violence is also used as a weapon of war in South Sudan.

10,sudan,"Saudi Arabia will supply Sudan with oil in the next five years to help it alleviate a severe fuel crunch in the country, Sudan’s Oil Minister Abdul Rahman Osman said on Monday after a visit to Saudi Arabia.

“We returned from Saudi Arabia after negotiations with the Saudi side to supply Sudan with oil for five years,” AFP quoted Osman as telling reporters in Sudan’s capital Khartoum.

“Sudan will receive 1.8 million tonnes of oil in the first year. After that each year the quantity will be raised by seven percent,” the oil minister noted.

Saudi Development Bank will facilitate the financing of the Saudi-Sudanese agreement, Osman said, without providing details about the financial terms of the oil supply agreement or when deliveries would begin.

Sudan is trying to ease a fuel shortage crisis that began in early April. Back then, officials blamed the dwindling gasoline and diesel supplies at gas stations on delays in the maintenance of a key refinery. Shortage of foreign exchange reserves has also contributed to the crisis.

Despite efforts by the government to ease the fuel crunch, the crisis has intensified, and fuel prices on the black market surged this week to five times the official prices, and people are queuing for hours to fill up their tanks at gas stations where there is still fuel left.

A delegation from Sudan led by oil minister Osman visited Saudi Arabia last week to ask OPEC’s largest producer for help. Sudan is part of the Saudi-led Arab coalition that is fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Sudan has been eager to build an oil industry after the split with South Sudan when it seceded in 2011. After the secession, the two countries have remained mutually dependent on oil revenues, with South Sudan owning 75 percent of the oil reserves, while the north owns the only current transport route to get oil to international markets.

The estimated total population in the locality is 264,000, 60 per cent of whom are women and children. Significant needs have been identified and preparation for an integrated response plan is ongoing.

• The State Ministry of Health in Central Darfur, and Water and Environmental Sanitation project (WES) together with health and WASH partners, have developed a six-month (9 Feb – 31 Aug, 2018) integrated health and WASH response plan to address the current and ongoing outbreak and better prepare for future outbreaks.

• UNICEF supported the transportation of 1,110 children to attend their basic education grade eight exams, a test to transit from primary to secondary education, in East and South Jebel Marra

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

In Central Darfur, a joint government, UN and NGOs assessment mission with UNICEF participation was conducted in Rokero town and six other villages in North Jebel Marra locality between 14 and 21 February 2018. The assessment covered an area inhabited by residents, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees from Sortony, Tawila and El-Fasher. An estimated 60 per cent of the population are women and children. Only 37 per cent of health facilities (9 out of 24) are functioning, out of which only four were providing integrated treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). In the assessed areas, only four out of seven health facilities provide nutritional services and the remaining health facilities only deliver health services, with malnourished cases either referred to the far distant North Darfur or Rokero. Also, only 25 per cent of households (HH) have latrines, and only two health facilities have incinerators. The available schools in the area are poorly constructed, using local materials, and it was observed that around 85 per cent of children are out of school in the villages covered by the assessment. Five out of seven communities reported cases of violence against children and issues regarding child labour and abduction. UNICEF, together with partners, is working on the preparation of an integrated response plan that will cover, among others, the Child Protection, Education, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions.

Since the start of 2018, the deteriorating economic situation in Sudan continues to impact on the population especially the most vulnerable, including 2.6 million children in need of humanitarian assistance. An inter-agency assessment to identify the effect on the most vulnerable population is ongoing. Also, UNICEF Sudan office has requested technical support from a social policy specialist in the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office to help with analysing the potential impact of the crisis on the Sudanese population, particularly children in a more comprehensive and integrated way, in addition to other relevant areas of support.","UNICEF Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/unicef-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018

Intensified fighting in Unity displaces populations, exacerbates needs

Armed actor attacks result in at least three aid worker deaths during April

USAID provides $103 million in additional funding to support emergency operations in South Sudan

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- Increased fighting between government and opposition forces in Jonglei and Unity states since mid-April has generated population displacement, disrupted relief operations, and exacerbated needs. Violence associated with clashes in Unity resulted in at least three South Sudanese humanitarian worker deaths during April; the UN has recorded at least 100 aid worker deaths in South Sudan since the beginning of the crisis in December 2013.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- The recent violence against humanitarian personnel and assets in Unity has prompted relief organizations to evacuate more than 30 staff and suspend humanitarian operations across central Unity, according to the UN.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- USAID recently provided more than $103 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan, bringing total USG assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan to more than $991 million from FY 2017–2018.","South Sudan - Crisis Fact Sheet #7, Fiscal Year (FY) 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-crisis-fact-sheet-7-fiscal-year-fy-2018
14,sudan,"KHARTOUM, 9 May 2018 (UNHCR): - The UN Refugee Agency welcomed today a generous contribution of USD 2 million from the Government and people of Japan to protect and assist South Sudanese refugees in Sudan. Japan’s funding will help UNHCR work with the Government of Sudan to address the increasing humanitarian needs of South Sudanese refugees who have sought safety in Sudan due to the continued violence in their country.

“We are very grateful to the people of Japan for their support. This contribution is yet another show of Japan’s solidarity with South Sudanese refugees and Sudanese host communities,” said UNHCR Representative, Ms. Noriko Yoshida. “UNHCR is committed to working together with Japan to ensure that the assistance reaches vulnerable refugees, but also, importantly, to find solutions for their situation.”

Japan’s funding will help UNHCR provide urgent life-saving assistance and international protection to 160,000 refugees and host communities in White Nile and East Darfur States. The assistance will include access to safe water, emergency shelter, and core relief items, such as jerry cans, kitchen tools and sleeping mats. It will also allow UNHCR to support the registration of South Sudanese refugees by the Commissioner for Refugees (COR) and to provide protection and assistance to unaccompanied and separated children.

“The Japanese Government, recognizing the scale of the crisis, supports this project which is the continuation of intervention for South Sudanese refugees,” said Ambassador of Japan to Sudan,

Mr. Shinji Urabayashi. He also said “I highly appreciate the generosity of the government and the people of Sudan and the important role they play in response to this refugee crisis.”

Sudan is one of the countries hosting the largest number of refugees and asylum-seekers in the region, including from South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen. This funding comes at a critical time, with UNHCR’s operations in Sudan only 14 per cent funded for 2018 – leaving a US$ 224 million shortfall.",Japan provides USD 2 million to support UNHCR’s activities in Sudan,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/japan-provides-usd-2-million-support-unhcr-s-activities-sudan
15,sudan,"In response to the Statement from the Press Secretary on the Civil War in South Sudan on May 8, 2018, Ciaran Donnelly, senior vice president of international programs at the International Rescue Committee, said:

“For most of its young life, South Sudan and its people have been trapped in a vicious cycle of conflict punctuated by flawed and failed peace attempts. As an operational humanitarian agency working to alleviate the conflict-driven suffering of the South Sudanese people, we share the US government’s frustration at the unwillingness to reach a speedy and peaceful resolution to the conflict and the heartbreaking disregard for human life displayed by all parties to this conflict.

The IRC welcomes US efforts on conflict resolution and inclusive and accountable political process – both are essential foundations for durable peace and inclusive development. And only focused and determined US and international diplomacy can make these long-sought goals a reality.

But while the South Sudanese people wait for and work toward the government they deserve, independently-delivered humanitarian aid is the last remaining lifeline for the long-suffering civilian population – over half of whom are dependent on humanitarian assistance (7.6 million). This conflict has driven 4 million, mostly women and children, from their homes and left more than five million people on the brink of starvation, resulting in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

The IRC recognizes the US’s generosity as the largest humanitarian donor to South Sudan, and we urge the US government to use this review as an opportunity to recommit to the people of South Sudan by affirming that life-saving humanitarian assistance, delivered by credible international partners, will not be affected by the review.

The South Sudanese people, caught between an intensifying conflict and deepening food insecurity crisis, must not be used as a political bargaining chip or forced to pay an even higher price for the failings of their leaders. Through our staff on the ground — almost all of whom are South Sudanese themselves — we see the hopes and potential of the people of South Sudan. We see beyond their suffering and understand that while humanitarian assistance can be the difference between life and death today, they yearn to play an active role in rescuing their communities and eventually their country from catastrophe.

While frustration and anger with the Government of South Sudan is justified, the US and the international community must not give up on the people of South Sudan. Halting or cutting humanitarian aid would only punish innocent civilians, not their leaders who are responsible for the ongoing crisis.

The only way to ease the suffering of the South Sudanese people is to end this conflict. Cutting humanitarian assistance will not hasten an end to war - it will only lead to further suffering and certain, yet preventable, death of South Sudan’s most vulnerable.”

16,sudan,"South Sudan's government urged the United States on Wednesday not to ""abandon"" the country after Washington said it would review its assistance programs because it could not continue a partnership with leaders perpetuating ""endless war"".

""We are asking the United States not to abandon this country because we need them … their role to assist the population of South Sudan is crucial and cannot be ignored,"" said Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mawien Makol Ariik.

The Trump administration threatened Tuesday to cut aid to South Sudan unless the country's civil war ends and peace is restored.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. will begin reviewing its assistance to the East African nation to ensure the money does not contribute to or prolong the conflict, or enable predatory or corrupt behaviour.

The U.S. is South Sudan's largest donor, giving over $3.2 billion in humanitarian assistance since civil war broke out in December 2013, according to the U.S. Embassy.

Sanders' announcement means $110 million in aid planned for South Sudan in 2018 could be in jeopardy.

""The United States government will not continue in a partnership with leaders who are only interested in perpetuating an endless war characterized by ethnically motivated atrocities,"" Sanders said.

Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of South Sudan President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

""The government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,"" the White House declared in a statement.

The loss of U.S. humanitarian assistance would deal a severe blow to a country in which millions are malnourished and famine threatens to make a return. In addition to the money that goes inside the country, U.S. funding provides aid to millions of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda

More than 2 million have fled

Tuesday's announcement came amid rising international frustration over a war that has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis in years. More than two million people have fled South Sudan in what amounts to Africa's largest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

In recent months, the U.S. imposed a unilateral and largely symbolic arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctioned the oil-rich country's state-run oil company and oil ministry.

Producton in some of South Sudan's oilfields has been shut down due to the conflict, but the government says around 130,000 barrels per day of oil are being produced. Juba spends well more than half its budget on weapons and paying soldiers, according to UN experts.

Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

The government is fighting a war with a number of rebel groups, some of them loyal to former vice-president Riek Machar, who is under house arrest in South Africa after he was fired by Kiir.

The warring parties signed a ceasefire in December in the Ethiopian capital, but it was violated within hours. A new round of talks is scheduled to begin May 17 after delays, but there is little hope among diplomats it will end the war.","South Sudan pleads with U.S. not to cut aid, as White House is threatening",http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-sudan-reaction-us-aid-1.4654672
