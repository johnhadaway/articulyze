1,sudan,"Khartoum - Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has ordered the closure of 13 diplomatic missions and most of Sudan's trade offices abroad, the state news agency reported late on Wednesday, in a bid to cut government spending amid serious economic woes.

Sudan has been largely cut off from international financing in the past decades by U.S. sanctions. These were lifted in October but since then Sudan has struggled to attract investors to help prop up its flagging economy.

Last month Bashir sacked Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour, one day after he asked parliament to step in and help Sudanese diplomats who had not been paid their salaries in seven months.

In his decree issued on Wednesday Bashir ordered the foreign ministry to implement a ""foreign representation restructuring plan"".

It did not identify the missions that are due to close but also includes cutting staff at seven missions down to just the ambassadors, SUNA reported.

Sudan will also shut all its trade and economic offices abroad, apart from the one in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, which was kept open to finalise arrangements for Sudan's participation at Dubai's Expo 2020, SUNA said.

Administrative staff would be cut by 20 percent, in addition to a previous decision to cut staff by 30 percent, the agency said. The decree also dismissed administrative staff at the foreign ministry and diplomats were instructed to handle administrative duties.

Sudan devalued its currency earlier this year in a bid lure back foreign investors. Since then the pound has plummeted to about 35 to the U.S. dollar and inflation has jumped to over 50 percent.",Sudan closes diplomatic missions in deep spending cuts,https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/sudan-closes-diplomatic-missions-in-deep-spending-cuts-14778853

Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

This is the second incident involving an attack on aid workers by armed groups in April alone and the third in the last six months in South Sudan.",South Sudan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 04 | 30 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-04-30-april-2018

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

SUDAN,

Sudan has summoned the Central African Republic (CAR) ambassador to protest the deadly attack on its embassy in Bangui, Foreign Affairs ministry said.

Mr Abdul Rahim Abdullah was summoned by the Khartoum authorities on Saturday after CAR police attacked the Sudanese embassy on Friday, occasioning the death of one member of staff.

“The Foreign ministry has summoned the CAR ambassador in Khartoum Abdul Rahim Abdullah in order to protest against the attack on the Sudanese embassy in Bangui,"" the ministry said in statement.

However, the statement said CAR Faustin Archange Touadera and the Interior ministry had promised to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice.

One of the world's poorest countries, the CAR spiralled into bloodshed after long-time leader Francois Bozize was overthrown in 2013 by a mainly Muslim rebel alliance called the Seleka.

France intervened militarily to push out the Seleka alliance, but the country remains plagued by violence between ex-rebels and vigilante militias.

Many armed groups are nominally organised along Christian or Muslim affiliations.

They both typically gain their revenue from extortion, roadblocks or mineral resources.

IGAD, in a letter issued on Sunday, called for the need to intensify engagement with the South Sudanese parties so as to identify any possible options of ensuring the next peace talks ends successfully.

“In order for the process to be focused and meaningful, the engagements need to be limited to representatives of the parties,” partly reads the letter addressed to the parties,” the letter reads.

“I would therefore request you to nominate five representatives to come to Addis Ababa for the consultations from 10th May-12th 2018,” adds the letter signed by IGAD special envoy to South Sudan, Ismail Wais.

In recent days, however, ceasefire monitors have expressed concerns over renewed fighting in South Sudan ahead of the next round of talks due in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa this month.

“In order, therefore, to maximize the likelihood of reaching final agreement during the next round, which begins on 17 May 2018, the Council of Ministers and the Special Envoy consider that it is necessary to intensify the engagement with and between the parties,” further stated IGAD’s letter.

In February, the South Sudan peace talks stalled over a text mediators and opposition officials want added to a provision that authorizes levying punitive measures against individuals who violate the peace process.

South Sudan has been mired in conflict between the government of President Salva Kiir and rebels led by ex-Vice President Riek Machar since December 2013. The conflict has killed tens of thousands and displaced almost over 2 million people from their homes, including over a million refugees who fled into neighbouring nations.

First convoy of Sudanese refugees from Chad

For the last 15 years, Adam El-Nour Abakar, 45 years old, was in exile in Chad. Last week, Adam and his family returned to their home in Kebkabiya village, in North Darfur with their five Children, all of whom were born in Chad.

“I’m so happy to return to my country with my family. I really feel comfortable and content. I cannot thank UNHCR and the Governments of Chad and Sudan enough for facilitating our return to Sudan,” said Abakar, with a deep sigh.

Adam and his family are part of a first convoy of 53 Sudanese refugees, who returned to Sudan from eastern Chad on 14 April, after more than a decade in exile. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the Commissioner of Refugees (COR), Hamad El-Gizouli, welcomed the returning Sudanese refugees at the reception centre in Tina, North Darfur. Besides three months of food rations, the returnees were provided with a reintegration package and transportation of personal belongings and livestock to their home villages in North Darfur. The return follows the signing of a Tripartite Voluntary Repatriation Agreement in Khartoum on 31 May 2017, between the Governments of Sudan and Chad and UNHCR. Mr. El-Gizouli described the return as a historic moment. He reiterated the importance the Sudanese Government attaches to the voluntary return of refugees, and the hope that these returnees will be able to rebuild their lives as Sudanese citizens.

Sudan and Chad—with assistance from UNHCR and its partners—plan to repatriate 20,000 refugees from Chad this year. At least 300,000 Sudanese refugees are in Chad, many of whom fled Sudan following the conflicts in Darfur between 2003 and 2004. With the new stability and improved general security in Darfur, many have indicated an interest in returning, according to UNHCR.

8,sudan,"In South Sudan, Denial of Humanitarian Aid is a War Tactic

Christine Monaghan is research officer, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict

May 4 2018 (IPS) - When I visited South Sudan last year, I heard story after story about health professionals and humanitarian workers being prevented from doing critical work. Government officials regularly increased fees for nonprofits trying to alleviate the effects of conflict, stopped humanitarian convoys from delivering life-saving supplies, and erected bureaucratic obstacles designed to impede access to civilians in need.

“There are ‘sitting fees’ you need to pay to government and the opposition when negotiating access to deliver aid,” one aid worker told me. “There are ‘airport fees’ for landing at the airstrip; to carry cash into the field – anything more than $100 requires an authorization from at least five different ministries. You line everything up and then they will say something is missing or something has changed.”

These are just some examples of obstacles the South Sudanese government has created to prevent humanitarian workers from doing their vital work in a conflict zone. Government officials – and the opposition – have blatantly denied humanitarian aid, preventing civilians from accessing essential services and NGOs from functioning. This strategy is being used as a war tactic, and contributing to the spread of disease, injury and death.

The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance.





In a new report , Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict found that in 2016 and 2017, there were at least 750 incidents involving denial of humanitarian access, many of them committed by government authorities. In dozens of interviews with health, humanitarian and NGO workers I conducted in South Sudan and neighboring Uganda, I heard about many disturbing steps the government has taken to block access for humanitarian workers and NGOs.

In recent years, I have investigated denials of humanitarian access in many conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Yemen. But the extent to which this is happening in South Sudan is far beyond anything I have seen.

In March 2017, for example, the government increased work permits for foreigners from $100 to a staggering $10,000. Two months later, it increased registration fees for international NGOs, from $2,000 to $3,500. Government officials have also interfered in the recruitment of NGO staff by reviewing candidate lists and even sitting in on interviews and vetoing choices. They have frequently changed license and registration requirements, making it difficult for NGO staff to travel for work.

“The government has required new license plates at least three times, which also requires new driver’s licenses and new registrations,” a humanitarian worker told me. “They announce the new procedure on Thursday and then pull you over on Friday if you haven’t complied and make you pay a fee.”

All this is taking place in a country that is in desperate need of humanitarian aid. As of December, at least 20 percent of South Sudan’s 1,900 hospitals had closed, and about half were functioning with extremely limited capacity, according to the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Warring parties were responsible for at least 50 attacks on medical facilities in 2016 and 2017 – another part of the war strategy and a vicious way to prevent civilians from accessing care. As a result, malnutrition, cholera and famine are gripping parts of the country.

The strategy behind these actions is clear – it is part of the war arsenal. The government has succeeded in shrinking humanitarian space and making a harrowing situation for civilians even more miserable. Humanitarian organizations always do important work, but in South Sudan, their work is indispensable, as it has gone well beyond the traditional mandate of providing emergency health assistance. Since 2013, humanitarian organizations have provided up to 80 percent of all health care services in the country, according to OCHA.

As is often the case in conflict zones, children and women are disproportionately affected by these war tactics. Of the four million people who have been displaced, children and women make up to 85 percent of this number, according to OCHA.

At Watchlist, we are calling on South Sudanese government to uphold its obligations to allow for unimpeded humanitarian access. A dedicated independent body should be established to investigate incidents of denials of humanitarian access, and all procedures for humanitarian and NGO workers should be made consistent and transparent.

Even in wartime, there are rules to be followed. They are designed to limit the impact of conflict on children, women and civilians at large, and allow the most vulnerable to access humanitarian assistance. The government of South Sudan has shamelessly violated these rules and gone out of its way to endanger the lives of its own citizens.

The international community must take immediate action to end this insidious tactic of war that has had devastating consequences for the children of South Sudan.

AWD cases reported only in Central Darfur during March

While all the other 17 States in Sudan—where AWD was reported before—continued to report zero cases in the past three months, during March, new cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) were reported in Central Darfur State. This was reported in the latest AWD update issued by Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) this week. Between 1 March and 3 April 2018, 151 cases of AWD were reported in Central Darfur, with no AWD-related deaths. The total number of new AWD cases reported from Central Darfur from February to March is 468, with almost all cases reported from 63 inaccessible villages in West Jebel Marra locality.

The incidence of AWD outbreak in Sudan started on 17 August 2016 in Kassala State and by May 2017 had spread to 10 states, expanding by August 2017 to all 18 of Sudan’s states. So far, the disease has claimed 823 deaths (case fatality rate of 2.23 per cent) resulting from 37,000 cases (attack rate – 10,09 per 10,000). It has also affected all demographic groups, with females constituting 59 per cent and children below 5 years of age accounting for 15 per cent of all reported cases.

To eliminate the transmission of AWD, response activities must continue until four-week consecutive zero reporting is in place nationwide, in all localities. WHO and FMoH have proposed an in-depth evaluation of AWD response and risk assessment to refine and re-strategize control efforts in early 2018.

Since the beginning of the crisis, IDPs from Unity and Jonglei States have perceived Nyal as a safe location with ample resources. Recently, Nyal has also become a key location for people travelling to and from nearby islands.

Since 1 November 2016, REACH has monitored three ports in Nyal - Gap Port, Nyal Port and Katieth Port - to record the arrivals and departures on a daily basis. The information gathered covers household (HH) demographics, key push and pull factors, health concerns, vulnerable populations, and general transportation routes. The daily data was synthesised to provide evidence for more effective humanitarian planning.

The REACH team collected information from 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to ensure complete coverage of Nyal’s three ports. REACH teams attempt to interview all arrivals and departures at the household level using a contextualised survey. However, the data presented here is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Sudan witnessed keen improvements in security conditions in 2017, and limited new internal displacement, as compared with 2016. However, an increase in the number of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Sudan, in addition to disease outbreaks, and long-term food insecurity and malnutrition contributed to increasing the humanitarian caseload.

Estimates by the Government of Sudan show 386,000 people returned voluntarily to areas of origin, in 2017, either from refugee communities in neighbouring countries, or from internal displacement camps. On the refugee front, at least 195,000 people arrived in Sudan in 2017, many fleeing the conflict in South Sudan. Another 200,000 people are expected to arrive throughout 2018.

This movement foreshadows what is predicted for 2018, and already caused shifts in the humanitarian landscape. The cessation of hostilities in Darfur, and between Government forces and rebel movements in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, allowed humanitarians to reach hundreds of communities, many of whom had lain for years outside reach. Both this access and easier obtainment of travel permits and procedures for humanitarian workers was the product of painstaking negotiations between the Government and the United Nations. To this end, new government directives launched in late 2016 set the tone in 2017 for daily improvements in the relationship between Government and implementing partners.

In this partially transformed humanitarian backdrop, partners worked to align humanitarian assistance and resilience, selfreliance and prevention activities, essential building blocks in building the capacity of the most vulnerable to resist shocks such as conflict, drought, floods, health crises, and economic hardship.

Despite the positive security developments, humanitarian conditions suffered the dramatic effects of the Government of Sudan’s structural adjustment reform, and the steep devaluation of the Sudanese pound. Combined with drought conditions, rampant inflation triggered by currency devaluation caused the price of grain to double, tipping another 1.5 million people into severe food insecurity in at least three states covered by humanitarian aid – Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur.

On a related but separate note, malnutrition continued to afflict millions of children across Sudan. Humanitarian partners reached 1.4 million children under five with Vitamin A supplementation, integrated with immunization services. Another 377,657 children with severe acute malnutrition had access to treatment services and programmes. Successful forays in treating malnutrition as a cross-cutting issue served to influence humanitarian partners to work together to gain efficiency in programme-delivery for improved results.

BASIC HEALTH PROVISION AND DISEASE OUTBREAK

On the health front, 824 people died and thousands more suffered from Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), a water-borne disease closely associated to cholera. Fully preventable, AWD occurs because of poor hygiene and lack of basic sanitation. Although 1.7 million people were provided access to sufficient drinking water, and 520,000 with access to adequate sanitation, in 2017, 12 per cent of Sudan’s population continued to practice open air defecation, contributing to the AWD problem.

On a more positive note, at least 78 per cent of all children born in Sudan were delivered with support from a trained midwife. In this regard, SHF funds were instrumental in providing power to health clinics and posts in Darfur, contributing to an environment for safe deliveries.

LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT AND LIVELIHOODS

The scale and long-term nature of displacement, especially in Darfur, has caused an unprecedented loss of livelihoods for millions. In 2017, a push towards voluntary returns to areas of origin exposed both the displaced and host communities to competition for scarce resources, leading to further economic hardship and uncertainty about the future.

As the war in Darfur recedes, millions of people in displacement camps began to show signs of restlessness, resulting in a marked increase in cases of inter-communal violence and petty crime both in camps and in host communities.

In many parts of Darfur, inter-communal conflict is a large cause of insecurity, and has reportedly kept IDPs from returning to areas of origin. Localised armed violence in many cases replaced the formerly warring militias. Such localised armed violence, which takes place most frequently between sedentary farmers and pastoral communities, and the many nomadic communities remained only partially resolved with the establishment of several animal migration corridors for the benefit of pastoralist communities, and to preserve agricultural fields.

Of additional concern, many of the displaced return to lands which had been occupied in their absence by other communities, militias or agri-businesses. Addressing the issue of land tenure and the management of resources will be pivotal in consolidating peace and in providing an exit strategy from Sudan’s protracted humanitarian crises to one of nation-building and economic development.",Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Sudan is to close 13 overseas diplomatic missions and will slash the number of staff at its foreign ministry, state media reported Thursday, as the government faces a crippling economic crisis.

A decree by Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, will also cut staff at seven other missions down to just one person. The move comes two weeks after Bashir sacked foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour for highlighting his ministry’s problems in parliament.

“The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country,” Bashir’s decree stated, according to official news agency SUNA.

The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country - Presidential decree

According to SUNA, the foreign ministry’s entire administrative staff are being dismissed, with diplomats expected to take over their duties. Staff at all overseas missions will be cut by 20 per cent at least.

The total number of job losses was not provided and the missions affected were not named.

All of Sudan’s overseas trade and economic offices will also be shuttered, SUNA reported, except the one in Abu Dhabi responsible for finalising arrangements for the country’s participation in Dubai’s Expo 2020.

On 18 April, Ghandour asked MPs to step in and help cover the foreign ministry’s costs, complaining staff’s wages and rent on diplomatic missions could not be paid. The next day, Bashir relieved him of his position.

The Sudanese central bank denied at the time there was any problem funding state institutions, though recognised there was a paucity of foreign currency.

“The central bank has never delayed payment to the foreign ministry's employees,” it said in a statement at the time, “as it understands very well the importance of diplomacy for the future and stability of our country"".

Sudan has been experiencing economic problems since South Sudan’s breakaway in 2011, which stripped the East African country of some 75 per cent of its oil earnings.

More recently, an acute shortage of foreign currency has seen the Sudanese pound plummet against the US dollar.

In January, Sudan’s parliament passed a budget aiming to address the country’s economic woes, devaluing the Sudanese pound and cutting subsidies on essential goods.

Inflation rose to 56 per cent in March, while high prices and shortages of food and fuel provoked street protests that were quashed by a campaign of mass arrests.

Hopes Sudan’s economic situation would improve were raised in October when Washington lifted sanctions on the country that had stood for two decades, a coup that Ghandour had a large hand in.

A quick recovery has not emerged, however, with investment slow to come in and international banks wary of conducting business with their Sudanese counterparts.",Sudan shuts 13 diplomatic missions as cash crisis deepens,http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/cash-strapped-sudan-closes-13-diplomatic-missions-2007995028

An AU statement yesterday said that the AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) on Saturday started its five-day visit to Khartoum and Darfur, Sudan for the assessment.

The council will assess the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) in light of the ongoing review of the mission aimed ensuring a smooth and seamless exit of the UNAMID.

The PSC will urge all Sudanese parties to commit to the full realisation of peace and stability in Darfur following the resolution of the conflict which lasted for almost 15 years, said the statement.

The statement said that the PSC visit is taking place at a time when the security situation is reported to have sustainably improved in Darfur, thus necessitating a gradual withdrawal of the UNAMID.

“The AUPSC therefore deems it imperative to gather first-hand information on the current status of the situation prior to making decisions on the future of the UNAMID, while guaranteeing the protection of civilians in Darfur,” said the statement. — Xinhua.","AU delegation in Sudan to assess security trends, IDPs",https://www.herald.co.zw/au-delegation-in-sudan-to-assess-security-trends-idps/

• In Central Darfur, North Jebel Marra locality, a joint government and interagency assessment mission including UNICEF was conducted in seven villages. The estimated total population in the locality is 264,000, 60 per cent of whom are women and children. Significant needs have been identified and preparation for an integrated response plan is ongoing.

• The State Ministry of Health in Central Darfur, and Water and Environmental Sanitation project (WES) together with health and WASH partners, have developed a six-month (9 Feb – 31 Aug, 2018) integrated health and WASH response plan to address the current and ongoing outbreak and better prepare for future outbreaks.

• UNICEF supported the transportation of 1,110 children to attend their basic education grade eight exams, a test to transit from primary to secondary education, in East and South Jebel Marra

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

In Central Darfur, a joint government, UN and NGOs assessment mission with UNICEF participation was conducted in Rokero town and six other villages in North Jebel Marra locality between 14 and 21 February 2018. The assessment covered an area inhabited by residents, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees from Sortony, Tawila and El-Fasher. An estimated 60 per cent of the population are women and children. Only 37 per cent of health facilities (9 out of 24) are functioning, out of which only four were providing integrated treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). In the assessed areas, only four out of seven health facilities provide nutritional services and the remaining health facilities only deliver health services, with malnourished cases either referred to the far distant North Darfur or Rokero. Also, only 25 per cent of households (HH) have latrines, and only two health facilities have incinerators. The available schools in the area are poorly constructed, using local materials, and it was observed that around 85 per cent of children are out of school in the villages covered by the assessment. Five out of seven communities reported cases of violence against children and issues regarding child labour and abduction. UNICEF, together with partners, is working on the preparation of an integrated response plan that will cover, among others, the Child Protection, Education, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions.

Since the start of 2018, the deteriorating economic situation in Sudan continues to impact on the population especially the most vulnerable, including 2.6 million children in need of humanitarian assistance. An inter-agency assessment to identify the effect on the most vulnerable population is ongoing. Also, UNICEF Sudan office has requested technical support from a social policy specialist in the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office to help with analysing the potential impact of the crisis on the Sudanese population, particularly children in a more comprehensive and integrated way, in addition to other relevant areas of support.","UNICEF Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/unicef-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018
18,sudan,"Sudan — The severe fuel shortage that is impacting transport, agriculture, utilities, services, and commodity prices across Sudan, continues to cause disruptions in several states.

The disruption of Sudani internet network in Abu Jubeiha in South Kordofan has prevented any financial transactions by banks since Sunday.

Banks closed

A bank employee told Radio Dabanga that as a result of the disruption, the banks in Abu Jubeiha have been suspended from Sunday until Tuesday.

He said that the stalling of the financial transactions of banks has affected all commercial activity in the town.

Water shortage

Sodari in North Kordofan and border towns in North and West Kordofan have been suffering from severe thirst as a result of a lack of the shut-down of the water pumping engines since the beginning of the fuel crisis a month ago.

The price of a gallon of petrol has amounted to SDG 600 (*$21.30) and a gallon of diesel SDG 300 ($10.66)

Mohamed Teirab of the leadership of the Sudanese Congress Party told Radio Dabanga from Sodari that ""The water crisis has intensified in those areas two weeks ago where thirst caused death of livestock, especially sheep amid occurrence of severe conflicts at the water resources.

The price of a barrel of water has amounted to SDG 40 ($1.42) in Abu Zabad in West Kordofan.

Power cuts

The electricity supply has been reduced to two hours instead of five hours due to lack of fuel.

The fuel crisis caused shortages of medicines in various localities in El Gedaref state.

Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that medicine vehicles and medical supplies were unable to provide the women of the locality with medicines due to lack of fuel for a week.

They warned that the health situation in the localities would worsen in the event the medicine crisis persists.

They reported the long lines of vehicles in front of fuel stations on Tuesday.

Kassala

In Kassala, the authorities' decision not to provide fuel for travel buses until the passengers get on board has led to exacerbation of the suffering of the passengers.

Residents from Kassala have complained to Radio Dabanga that they had been delayed in the bus trip to Aroma and asked the authorities to immediately cancel the decision.

Ed Damazin

The southern and northern districts of Ed Damazin have seen a severe drinking water crisis as a result of the non-operation of some water stations in the town due to lack of fuel.

Residents told Radio Dabanga that the northern districts of Arkawit, Banat, El Nasir and El Hijra and El Zuhour in southern Ed Damazin have been suffering from severe thirst for two weeks due to lack of fuel which caused disruption of some water pumps.

Residents of Aroma in eastern Sudan have complained of three days of power cuts and the continued fuel crisis.

Ahmed Dirar said in an interview with Radio Dabanga that the continuous interruption of electricity and the lack of fuel have led to complete paralysis in the city.

Ali El Atta, a member of the National Assembly, said the diesel crisis has led to serious losses to farmers in the garden sector in Kassala state amounting to SDG 11 billion (*$390 million).

He added that the total cultivated area is about 10,000 acres, including 7,000 acres of fodder, and 3,000 acres of vegetables.

He said the garden sector needs additional quantities to ensure continued productivity.

Press ban

The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) has forbidden newspapers in Sudan from publishing any material related to the fuel crisis.

The NISS ban includes writing about protests and demonstrations or ""negatively writing about goods"".

In a directive to the editors of newspapers, the NISS called on them not to cover the crisis, but ""to be satisfied with the official statements issued by the government on these topics"".

Fuel supplies began dwindling in early April, with officials blaming maintenance delays at a key refinery, although foreign currency shortages have also played a role.

The crisis has since escalated despite official pledges to resolve it.

The shortage has hiked prices of petrol on the black market, with a gallon costing 150 pounds ($5.30, 4.40 euros) in Khartoum, over five times the official price of 27 pounds.

""I purchased two gallons at this high cost from the black market,"" said Mohamed Abbas, a resident of a working class neighbourhood in the capital.

""I bought it from someone who had filled his car tank after waiting the whole night at a fuel station.""

Another Khartoum resident told AFP that he too had waited through the night outside a fuel station to fill his tank.

""From 11:00 pm Friday until 7:00 am today I was waiting in my car at a fuel station,"" he said.

Most petrol stations were receiving less than their alloted quotas of petrol and diesel, with attendants often keeping the outlets shut once they sold their stock.

Farmers too complained that they were unable to transport their products to market as hundreds of trucks had been grounded.

""My entire crop of tomatoes is destroyed,"" said Ali Khider, a farmer from the state of Jazira.

""For a week now I have been unable to transport it to the main market because there is no vehicle.""

Officials promised a quick end to the crisis, saying it was caused by a delay in maintenance work at the country's main refinery north of Khartoum.

But an acute shortage of foreign currency has also aggravated the situation.

""There are some oil tankers waiting at Port Sudan to be unloaded but there's a delay in paying them,"" Minister of State for Oil Saadeddin Bushra told lawmakers this week.

21,sudan,"""I'm afraid I'll starve to death,"" said Gatdin Bol. Curled on a dirt floor, the frail 65-year-old said he survives only by eating fruit from the trees in this remote South Sudanese town in the shadow of civil war.

Three months ago when government troops attacked Bol's hometown in Jonglei state they stole everything he owned, including his food, he said. He fled with his wife and four children, walking for two months until they reached Kandak in Ayod County. They remain hungry. The planting season has yet to begin and they missed the United Nations' food registration and aren't eligible for assistance.

Five years into South Sudan's civil war more than 7 million people are facing severe hunger without food aid, according to the latest analysis by the U.N. and the government. Aid workers warn that a recent surge in fighting could once again plunge thousands of people into famine.

""In the places where there is displacement and we can't get there, it's a cause for concern,"" Adnan Khan, the World Food Program country director, told The Associated Press during a food distribution this week in the rebel-held town of Kandak.

Ayod is one of 11 counties in South Sudan that face extreme hunger. Remote and lacking basic resources like water and health care, the majority of its residents subsist on food aid.

""Ayod remains precarious as people heavily rely on food drops, which they then have to share with displaced kin. With very few of them cultivating and the rainy season set to disrupt humanitarian activities the situation can only get worse,"" said Nicholas Kerandi, food security analyst for the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

During the visit to Kandak, several people told AP they had nothing to eat.

""The army looted my garden and took my food. If I don't find food I can go days without eating,"" said Puot Kuony, hanging his head.

In March, the 45-year-old said he saw soldiers shoot and kill his uncle and run over him with a truck before stealing Kuony's food while attacking his hometown of Wau. He fled to Kandak with his wife and three children, but unable to cultivate and without a food registration card he begs for rations from neighbors.

Authorities in Kandak estimate that half the population, about 9,000 people, have been displaced from other parts of Jonglei state, which has been at the heart of the fighting. Since March about 1,800 people have arrived, straining the community's few resources.

Residents blame South Sudan's civil war for their deteriorating situation.

""We want peace so people can move around and cultivate and not feel trapped. Everyone across South Sudan relies on food relief and as a leader of the country you can't say that's OK,"" said Jung Gony Yut, humanitarian coordinator for the opposition in Magok County.

South Sudan's government is doing what it can to ensure that ""normalcy"" returns to its people, said spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. In the worst-affected areas the government asks aid workers to step in and provide relief, including opposition-held areas, he said.

But the international community's patience is wearing thin as reports continue of aid workers being blocked from carrying out their work, and as peace talks yield little progress. The next round of talks begins May 17.

Thousands of people had fled to the swamps, surviving on wild vegetables and fruit alone, the chief of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, David Shearer, said in a statement.

""Earlier this year it felt like we were moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""But after seeing the effects on civilians of this conflict, I believe there is a real risk that the situation will further undermine the chance for lasting peace.""

* Drivers spent night in line at gas station to buy fuel

By Khalid Abdelaziz

KHARTOUM, April 24 (Reuters) - Vehicles queued for hours at gas stations in Sudan’s capital on Tuesday as a fuel shortage caused by the government’s difficulty in importing it due to a foreign currency crisis hit home.

Once an exporter of oil, Sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of what had been the country’s oil output and its main source of foreign currency.

“I have been waiting at the gas station from last night until midday today. This bus is my only source of income,” said Adam Abdullah.

The 45-year-old bus driver is one of many workers who spent the night at a gas station to refuel their vehicles.

“I have been waiting for hours to find transportation to return home. This is something we cannot stand. Where is the government?” asked Intesar Awad from a bus station in the heart of Khartoum.

Hundreds of others queued for rides home around her - joining lines that have built up since the end of last week as the currency crunch has bitten deeper.

The Sudanese pound has dropped to 35 to the dollar from 33 pounds earlier this week, a black market trader told Reuters. He expected the Sudanese pound to weaken further in coming days.

Inflation quickened to 55.6 percent in March year-on-year from 54.34 percent in February.

Prices have risen since the pound plummeted to record lows on the black market in recent months, prompting the central bank to make two steep devaluations since the start of the year.

It now officially trades at about 28 pounds to the dollar from 6.7 pounds in late December.

The Sudanese pound hit a record low of about 40 pounds to the dollar earlier this year on the black market, but the devaluations and a ban on deposits of dollars obtained from the black market have reversed this trend.

The central bank has also introduced restrictions on withdrawals, leaving many unable to take out cash from banks.

Minister of State for Finance Abdelrahman Drar said in a statement on Tuesday that five tankers carrying petroleum products had arrived at Sudan’s main port to alleviate the shortages.

Potentially increasing the short-term uncertainty, two Nigerian oil companies, Express and Misana, on Monday sold their 30 percent joint stake in Sudan’s al-Rawat oil field to Sudan National Petroleum Corporation or Sudapet, Khartoum’s state news agency SUNA reported.

Sudapet now owns all the shares in al-Rawat, which falls along the While Nile, 420 km south of Khartoum. It hopes to increase output in the long-term, reducing the dependence on imports, through increased exploration.
