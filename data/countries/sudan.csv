0,sudan,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration threatened Tuesday to cut aid to South Sudan unless the country’s civil war ends and peace is restored.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. will begin reviewing its assistance to the East African nation to ensure the money does not contribute to or prolong the conflict, or enable predatory or corrupt behavior.

The U.S. is South Sudan’s largest donor, giving over $3.2 billion in humanitarian assistance since civil war broke out in December 2013, according to the U.S. Embassy.

Sanders’ announcement means $110 million in aid planned for South Sudan in 2018 could be in jeopardy.

“The United States Government will not continue in a partnership with leaders who are only interested in perpetuating an endless war characterized by ethnically motivated atrocities,” Sanders said.

The loss of U.S. humanitarian assistance would deal a severe blow to a country where millions are malnourished and famine threatens to make a return.

Tuesday’s announcement came amid rising international frustration over the civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and created Africa’s largest refugee crisis in years. More than 2 million people have fled South Sudan in what amounts to Africa’s largest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

The most recent attempt at a cease-fire took effect in December but was violated within hours. Human rights groups have long accused officials in the government of President Salva Kiir of profiting off the conflict and blocking the path to peace.

Another round of peace talks, to be mediated by a regional bloc in neighboring Ethiopia, is scheduled to start May 17.

The U.S. in recent months imposed a unilateral and largely symbolic arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctioned the oil-rich country’s state-run oil company and oil ministry.

1,sudan,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Sudan witnessed keen improvements in security conditions in 2017, and limited new internal displacement, as compared with 2016. However, an increase in the number of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Sudan, in addition to disease outbreaks, and long-term food insecurity and malnutrition contributed to increasing the humanitarian caseload.

Estimates by the Government of Sudan show 386,000 people returned voluntarily to areas of origin, in 2017, either from refugee communities in neighbouring countries, or from internal displacement camps. On the refugee front, at least 195,000 people arrived in Sudan in 2017, many fleeing the conflict in South Sudan. Another 200,000 people are expected to arrive throughout 2018.

This movement foreshadows what is predicted for 2018, and already caused shifts in the humanitarian landscape. The cessation of hostilities in Darfur, and between Government forces and rebel movements in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, allowed humanitarians to reach hundreds of communities, many of whom had lain for years outside reach. Both this access and easier obtainment of travel permits and procedures for humanitarian workers was the product of painstaking negotiations between the Government and the United Nations. To this end, new government directives launched in late 2016 set the tone in 2017 for daily improvements in the relationship between Government and implementing partners.

In this partially transformed humanitarian backdrop, partners worked to align humanitarian assistance and resilience, selfreliance and prevention activities, essential building blocks in building the capacity of the most vulnerable to resist shocks such as conflict, drought, floods, health crises, and economic hardship.

Despite the positive security developments, humanitarian conditions suffered the dramatic effects of the Government of Sudan’s structural adjustment reform, and the steep devaluation of the Sudanese pound. Combined with drought conditions, rampant inflation triggered by currency devaluation caused the price of grain to double, tipping another 1.5 million people into severe food insecurity in at least three states covered by humanitarian aid – Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur.

On a related but separate note, malnutrition continued to afflict millions of children across Sudan. Humanitarian partners reached 1.4 million children under five with Vitamin A supplementation, integrated with immunization services. Another 377,657 children with severe acute malnutrition had access to treatment services and programmes. Successful forays in treating malnutrition as a cross-cutting issue served to influence humanitarian partners to work together to gain efficiency in programme-delivery for improved results.

BASIC HEALTH PROVISION AND DISEASE OUTBREAK

On the health front, 824 people died and thousands more suffered from Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), a water-borne disease closely associated to cholera. Fully preventable, AWD occurs because of poor hygiene and lack of basic sanitation. Although 1.7 million people were provided access to sufficient drinking water, and 520,000 with access to adequate sanitation, in 2017, 12 per cent of Sudan’s population continued to practice open air defecation, contributing to the AWD problem.

On a more positive note, at least 78 per cent of all children born in Sudan were delivered with support from a trained midwife. In this regard, SHF funds were instrumental in providing power to health clinics and posts in Darfur, contributing to an environment for safe deliveries.

LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT AND LIVELIHOODS

The scale and long-term nature of displacement, especially in Darfur, has caused an unprecedented loss of livelihoods for millions. In 2017, a push towards voluntary returns to areas of origin exposed both the displaced and host communities to competition for scarce resources, leading to further economic hardship and uncertainty about the future.

As the war in Darfur recedes, millions of people in displacement camps began to show signs of restlessness, resulting in a marked increase in cases of inter-communal violence and petty crime both in camps and in host communities.

In many parts of Darfur, inter-communal conflict is a large cause of insecurity, and has reportedly kept IDPs from returning to areas of origin. Localised armed violence in many cases replaced the formerly warring militias. Such localised armed violence, which takes place most frequently between sedentary farmers and pastoral communities, and the many nomadic communities remained only partially resolved with the establishment of several animal migration corridors for the benefit of pastoralist communities, and to preserve agricultural fields.

Of additional concern, many of the displaced return to lands which had been occupied in their absence by other communities, militias or agri-businesses. Addressing the issue of land tenure and the management of resources will be pivotal in consolidating peace and in providing an exit strategy from Sudan’s protracted humanitarian crises to one of nation-building and economic development.",Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

AWD cases reported only in Central Darfur during March

While all the other 17 States in Sudan—where AWD was reported before—continued to report zero cases in the past three months, during March, new cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) were reported in Central Darfur State. This was reported in the latest AWD update issued by Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) this week. Between 1 March and 3 April 2018, 151 cases of AWD were reported in Central Darfur, with no AWD-related deaths. The total number of new AWD cases reported from Central Darfur from February to March is 468, with almost all cases reported from 63 inaccessible villages in West Jebel Marra locality.

The incidence of AWD outbreak in Sudan started on 17 August 2016 in Kassala State and by May 2017 had spread to 10 states, expanding by August 2017 to all 18 of Sudan’s states. So far, the disease has claimed 823 deaths (case fatality rate of 2.23 per cent) resulting from 37,000 cases (attack rate – 10,09 per 10,000). It has also affected all demographic groups, with females constituting 59 per cent and children below 5 years of age accounting for 15 per cent of all reported cases.

To eliminate the transmission of AWD, response activities must continue until four-week consecutive zero reporting is in place nationwide, in all localities. WHO and FMoH have proposed an in-depth evaluation of AWD response and risk assessment to refine and re-strategize control efforts in early 2018.

After assessing the situation in all 18 states, 17 localities from nine states have been identified for an Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign, targeting refugees and host communities. Vaccination will be carried out during 2018-2019.",Sudan: Humanitarian Bulletin | Issue 08 | 16 – 29 April 2018 [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-08-16-29-april-2018

• UNICEF supported the transportation of 1,110 children to attend their basic education grade eight exams, a test to transit from primary to secondary education, in East and South Jebel Marra

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

In Central Darfur, a joint government, UN and NGOs assessment mission with UNICEF participation was conducted in Rokero town and six other villages in North Jebel Marra locality between 14 and 21 February 2018. The assessment covered an area inhabited by residents, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees from Sortony, Tawila and El-Fasher. An estimated 60 per cent of the population are women and children. Only 37 per cent of health facilities (9 out of 24) are functioning, out of which only four were providing integrated treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). In the assessed areas, only four out of seven health facilities provide nutritional services and the remaining health facilities only deliver health services, with malnourished cases either referred to the far distant North Darfur or Rokero. Also, only 25 per cent of households (HH) have latrines, and only two health facilities have incinerators. The available schools in the area are poorly constructed, using local materials, and it was observed that around 85 per cent of children are out of school in the villages covered by the assessment. Five out of seven communities reported cases of violence against children and issues regarding child labour and abduction. UNICEF, together with partners, is working on the preparation of an integrated response plan that will cover, among others, the Child Protection, Education, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions.

Since the start of 2018, the deteriorating economic situation in Sudan continues to impact on the population especially the most vulnerable, including 2.6 million children in need of humanitarian assistance. An inter-agency assessment to identify the effect on the most vulnerable population is ongoing. Also, UNICEF Sudan office has requested technical support from a social policy specialist in the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office to help with analysing the potential impact of the crisis on the Sudanese population, particularly children in a more comprehensive and integrated way, in addition to other relevant areas of support.","UNICEF Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/unicef-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018

* Drivers spent night in line at gas station to buy fuel

By Khalid Abdelaziz

KHARTOUM, April 24 (Reuters) - Vehicles queued for hours at gas stations in Sudan’s capital on Tuesday as a fuel shortage caused by the government’s difficulty in importing it due to a foreign currency crisis hit home.

Once an exporter of oil, Sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of what had been the country’s oil output and its main source of foreign currency.

“I have been waiting at the gas station from last night until midday today. This bus is my only source of income,” said Adam Abdullah.

The 45-year-old bus driver is one of many workers who spent the night at a gas station to refuel their vehicles.

“I have been waiting for hours to find transportation to return home. This is something we cannot stand. Where is the government?” asked Intesar Awad from a bus station in the heart of Khartoum.

Hundreds of others queued for rides home around her - joining lines that have built up since the end of last week as the currency crunch has bitten deeper.

The Sudanese pound has dropped to 35 to the dollar from 33 pounds earlier this week, a black market trader told Reuters. He expected the Sudanese pound to weaken further in coming days.

Inflation quickened to 55.6 percent in March year-on-year from 54.34 percent in February.

Prices have risen since the pound plummeted to record lows on the black market in recent months, prompting the central bank to make two steep devaluations since the start of the year.

It now officially trades at about 28 pounds to the dollar from 6.7 pounds in late December.

The Sudanese pound hit a record low of about 40 pounds to the dollar earlier this year on the black market, but the devaluations and a ban on deposits of dollars obtained from the black market have reversed this trend.

The central bank has also introduced restrictions on withdrawals, leaving many unable to take out cash from banks.

Minister of State for Finance Abdelrahman Drar said in a statement on Tuesday that five tankers carrying petroleum products had arrived at Sudan’s main port to alleviate the shortages.

Potentially increasing the short-term uncertainty, two Nigerian oil companies, Express and Misana, on Monday sold their 30 percent joint stake in Sudan’s al-Rawat oil field to Sudan National Petroleum Corporation or Sudapet, Khartoum’s state news agency SUNA reported.

Sudapet now owns all the shares in al-Rawat, which falls along the While Nile, 420 km south of Khartoum. It hopes to increase output in the long-term, reducing the dependence on imports, through increased exploration.

5,sudan,"By Salah Shuaib

Recently, multiple discussions have emerged in the political scene calling upon the Sudanese opposition parties to participate in the 2020 elections. Prominent experts, politicians, and intellectuals, among them Alsir Sidahmed, Nabil Adeeb, Elnour Hamad, and others, have tried to address the opposition’s weakness by linking it to its insistence to boycott previous general elections sponsored by the regime.

Focusing on blaming the opposition for its inability to reinvigorate societal bases for change was the most consumed topic by those seeing the upcoming elections as a way of making a difference in the country’s politics.

But, the arguments about the importance of the electoral process have failed to convince the public opinion that the government could be much serious this time to create a free democratic atmosphere, which may contribute to activate political action and encourage the opposition parties to rely on the outcome of the voting process.

Moreover, the writers calling for the participation of the opposition in the 2020 elections seemed to trust the potentiality of the Islamic government to change its Islamist doctrine, ignoring the dominance of the Sudanese Islamic Movement (SIM) over all state institutions, including the extremely influential and powerful institution: The National Intelligence and Security Services organ.

Apparently, they have forgotten that the Sudanese Islamists systematically made a massive effort to destroy the political parties and groups, so they cannot be able to recover their past glory by competing with this unjust regime.

These new intellectual efforts have resulted in a sharp divergence of views among opposition groups concerning the upcoming elections. And in this respect, each party involved in the dialogue has continued to strengthen its arguments to win the public opinion on its side.

In any event, this constructive dialogue of opposition’s figures about the 2020 elections does not principally express their vitality in facing the country’s traumatic situation. Instead, such a discussion raises awareness versus the opposition’s profound tactical differences over the resistance of the regime.

Undoubtedly, the opposition is historically facing critical problems. However, the solutions should not be necessarily through participating in the regime’s orchestrated aimless elections. Sudan’s crisis goes beyond the idea of being tied only to our political leaders’ weak response to the Sudanese Islamists’ aggressive state.

Many of us know that the Sudanese crisis, evidenced by the faults of both the opposition and the government, is deeply rooted in the failure of the structural setting of the hierarchical system of the state itself.

It is difficult, therefore, to accept that the solutions to the crisis lie only in resorting to the ballot box that the ideologically conflicting parties compete for. Elections will not change the situation if there is no agreed-upon societal will, which is absent since the time of Sudan’s independence.

Now, the government has brought the country to the brink of collapse, while the opposition has no room to act, let alone works for reform freely. In short, resolving the crisis preoccupying the government and the opposition together lies, preferably, in a radical change that brings about a new system of governance with a contemporary standard.

It is illogical to urge the regime to pave the way for the political parties to compete with it through national elections or other means. Inevitably, the nature of the Sudanese Islamic Movement, SIM, wouldn’t let other political groups share with it the governance burden.

Since its establishment, the SIM’s religious doctrine was based on narrow objectives to controlling the whole state with ideologically legislative, executive and judicial settings. Hence, it’s is ironic to encourage opposition parties to participate in the 2020 elections without a free environment for a peaceful and smooth transfer of power.

In fact, there was a lot of examples of how the governing Islamists had rigged their internal elections in the past. There were published reports that the regime’s leaders were involved in altering some of the SIM’s election results to prevent the undesirable winners from being elected.

Due to the full control, it applied to the state’s apparatuses after its military coup in 1989, the NCP has exploited, since then, all governmental resources to help its members win any election. As such, it will become impossible to compete with the ruling party as long as it possesses powerful, political mechanisms alone.

looking at it in retrospect, in the past elections held before the session of South Sudan, the National Congress Party, NCP, rigged the process and thus unlawfully won the presidential, parliamentary and state elections.

Boycotted by the major political parties, due to the lack of electoral transparency, the 2015 elections failed to convince the nation of its worth. “It is the opposite of a great day for democracy. There was general apathy, a sort of fatalism that Bashir and his party were competing with themselves. The boycott was systematic, including even from the membership of the ruling party.”, said Suliman Baldo for the Telegraph.

However, despite the weakness of the argument of the advocates of the idea of competing with the regime through the electoral system, these advocates have succeeded to activate a beneficial dialogue on the Sudanese political dilemma on the one hand and the crisis of both, the opposition and the government, on the other hand.

Perhaps this type of useful debate alerts all Sudanese to the need for a radical change and overthrowing of al-Turabi’s state setting whether through elections, a military coup, or a popular revolution. Even though, concerns about overwhelming chaos continue to rise as the expectations of the collapse of the Sudanese state escalate systematically.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Sudan is to close 13 overseas diplomatic missions and will slash the number of staff at its foreign ministry, state media reported Thursday, as the government faces a crippling economic crisis.

A decree by Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, will also cut staff at seven other missions down to just one person. The move comes two weeks after Bashir sacked foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour for highlighting his ministry’s problems in parliament.

“The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country,” Bashir’s decree stated, according to official news agency SUNA.

The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country - Presidential decree

According to SUNA, the foreign ministry’s entire administrative staff are being dismissed, with diplomats expected to take over their duties. Staff at all overseas missions will be cut by 20 per cent at least.

The total number of job losses was not provided and the missions affected were not named.

All of Sudan’s overseas trade and economic offices will also be shuttered, SUNA reported, except the one in Abu Dhabi responsible for finalising arrangements for the country’s participation in Dubai’s Expo 2020.

On 18 April, Ghandour asked MPs to step in and help cover the foreign ministry’s costs, complaining staff’s wages and rent on diplomatic missions could not be paid. The next day, Bashir relieved him of his position.

The Sudanese central bank denied at the time there was any problem funding state institutions, though recognised there was a paucity of foreign currency.

“The central bank has never delayed payment to the foreign ministry's employees,” it said in a statement at the time, “as it understands very well the importance of diplomacy for the future and stability of our country"".

Sudan has been experiencing economic problems since South Sudan’s breakaway in 2011, which stripped the East African country of some 75 per cent of its oil earnings.

More recently, an acute shortage of foreign currency has seen the Sudanese pound plummet against the US dollar.

In January, Sudan’s parliament passed a budget aiming to address the country’s economic woes, devaluing the Sudanese pound and cutting subsidies on essential goods.

Inflation rose to 56 per cent in March, while high prices and shortages of food and fuel provoked street protests that were quashed by a campaign of mass arrests.

Hopes Sudan’s economic situation would improve were raised in October when Washington lifted sanctions on the country that had stood for two decades, a coup that Ghandour had a large hand in.

A quick recovery has not emerged, however, with investment slow to come in and international banks wary of conducting business with their Sudanese counterparts.",Sudan shuts 13 diplomatic missions as cash crisis deepens,http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/cash-strapped-sudan-closes-13-diplomatic-missions-2007995028

The South Sudanese Army, which is loyal to President Salva Kiir, has repeatedly clashed with rebel groups loyal to the deposed vice president, Riek Machar. Both sides have been accused of targeting aid workers and committing widespread human rights abuses.

Edmund Yakani, executive director of the humanitarian group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, in Juba, said it has seen a rise in attacks on South Sudanese aid workers since mid-March.

“The trend toward targeting humanitarian work is on a daily basis increasing,” said Mr. Yakani, whose 60 staff members around the country report daily on the conditions. “When the population is in need and humanitarian workers are being targeted, it’s using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war.”

Parts of Yei state are controlled by a rebel group loyal to Mr. Machar, but a senior rebel official there, Frank Matata, said he did not believe it was behind the kidnapping. Earlier this week, he said, there were skirmishes in the area between the rebels and a breakaway faction. He said it was not immediately known who was holding the aid workers or where.

“I do not believe it was us,” Mr. Matata said, “because I was not notified. They would have told me.”

Lam Paul Gabriel, a spokesman for the main rebel group in South Sudan, the SPLM-IO, said he did not know whether his group was behind the kidnapping, which he learned about on Wednesday when a United Nations official reported staff members as missing.

All of the missing are South Sudanese citizens working for the United Nations and other international organizations. One is from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; two from Unicef; one from the South Sudanese Development Organization; two from Across, a Christian aid group; three from Plan International; and one from Action Africa Help International.

“I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conducive to the delivery of assistance,” Mr. Noudehou said.","10 South Sudan Aid Workers Are Abducted, U.N.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- Increased fighting between government and opposition forces in Jonglei and Unity states since mid-April has generated population displacement, disrupted relief operations, and exacerbated needs. Violence associated with clashes in Unity resulted in at least three South Sudanese humanitarian worker deaths during April; the UN has recorded at least 100 aid worker deaths in South Sudan since the beginning of the crisis in December 2013.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- The recent violence against humanitarian personnel and assets in Unity has prompted relief organizations to evacuate more than 30 staff and suspend humanitarian operations across central Unity, according to the UN.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼- USAID recently provided more than $103 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan, bringing total USG assistance for the emergency response in South Sudan to more than $991 million from FY 2017–2018.","South Sudan - Crisis Fact Sheet #7, Fiscal Year (FY) 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-crisis-fact-sheet-7-fiscal-year-fy-2018
12,sudan,"Sudan — The severe fuel shortage that is impacting transport, agriculture, utilities, services, and commodity prices across Sudan, continues to cause disruptions in several states.

The disruption of Sudani internet network in Abu Jubeiha in South Kordofan has prevented any financial transactions by banks since Sunday.

Banks closed

A bank employee told Radio Dabanga that as a result of the disruption, the banks in Abu Jubeiha have been suspended from Sunday until Tuesday.

He said that the stalling of the financial transactions of banks has affected all commercial activity in the town.

Water shortage

Sodari in North Kordofan and border towns in North and West Kordofan have been suffering from severe thirst as a result of a lack of the shut-down of the water pumping engines since the beginning of the fuel crisis a month ago.

The price of a gallon of petrol has amounted to SDG 600 (*$21.30) and a gallon of diesel SDG 300 ($10.66)

Mohamed Teirab of the leadership of the Sudanese Congress Party told Radio Dabanga from Sodari that ""The water crisis has intensified in those areas two weeks ago where thirst caused death of livestock, especially sheep amid occurrence of severe conflicts at the water resources.

The price of a barrel of water has amounted to SDG 40 ($1.42) in Abu Zabad in West Kordofan.

Power cuts

The electricity supply has been reduced to two hours instead of five hours due to lack of fuel.

The fuel crisis caused shortages of medicines in various localities in El Gedaref state.

Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that medicine vehicles and medical supplies were unable to provide the women of the locality with medicines due to lack of fuel for a week.

They warned that the health situation in the localities would worsen in the event the medicine crisis persists.

They reported the long lines of vehicles in front of fuel stations on Tuesday.

Kassala

In Kassala, the authorities' decision not to provide fuel for travel buses until the passengers get on board has led to exacerbation of the suffering of the passengers.

Residents from Kassala have complained to Radio Dabanga that they had been delayed in the bus trip to Aroma and asked the authorities to immediately cancel the decision.

Ed Damazin

The southern and northern districts of Ed Damazin have seen a severe drinking water crisis as a result of the non-operation of some water stations in the town due to lack of fuel.

Residents told Radio Dabanga that the northern districts of Arkawit, Banat, El Nasir and El Hijra and El Zuhour in southern Ed Damazin have been suffering from severe thirst for two weeks due to lack of fuel which caused disruption of some water pumps.

Residents of Aroma in eastern Sudan have complained of three days of power cuts and the continued fuel crisis.

Ahmed Dirar said in an interview with Radio Dabanga that the continuous interruption of electricity and the lack of fuel have led to complete paralysis in the city.

Ali El Atta, a member of the National Assembly, said the diesel crisis has led to serious losses to farmers in the garden sector in Kassala state amounting to SDG 11 billion (*$390 million).

He added that the total cultivated area is about 10,000 acres, including 7,000 acres of fodder, and 3,000 acres of vegetables.

He said the garden sector needs additional quantities to ensure continued productivity.

Press ban

The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) has forbidden newspapers in Sudan from publishing any material related to the fuel crisis.

The NISS ban includes writing about protests and demonstrations or ""negatively writing about goods"".

In a directive to the editors of newspapers, the NISS called on them not to cover the crisis, but ""to be satisfied with the official statements issued by the government on these topics"".

Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

The U.S. is beginning a comprehensive review of its aid programs to South Sudan over the country’s lack of progress toward resolving in its ongoing civil war.

The White House on Tuesday cited South Sudan's elevation of officials sanctioned by the U.N. and exile of others who signed a 2015 peace accord for initiating the review.

“The Government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,” the White House declared in a statement.

The U.S. is South Sudan’s largest donor of humanitarian assistance, but it has grown frustrated with the worsening crisis in the world’s newest country. It imposed an arms embargo on South Sudan in February, and has sanctioned leading individuals and oil-linked entities multiple times.

The U.S. called for a transitional government that would encompass South Sudan’s warring ethnic groups and include a system of checks and balances. And it said the upcoming evaluation of assistance programs would focus on making sure U.S. aid is not contributing to the war.

“The United States Government will not continue in a partnership with leaders who are only interested in perpetuating an endless war characterized by ethnically-motivated atrocities,” the U.S. said Tuesday.

The prospect of famine is threatening South Sudan, where 7 million people are at risk of severe hunger without food aid.

In a joint statement today signed by SLM chairperson Minna Arko Minnawi, JEM chairperson Dr Gibril Ibrahim and SML-TC chairperson Alhadi Idriss, the movements recognise that ""the establishment of a durable peace is essential for all people of Sudan,"" and that they ""remain resolved to adhere to the AUHIP Roadmap Agreement of 2016 as the means of achieving peace for all Sudan.""

The joint declaration says: ""The objectives of the extended cessation of hostilities are to protect civilians, provide unhindered humanitarian access to war-affected populations, and create a conducive environment for peace talks.

""The Cessation of Hostilities shall enter into force at 11:59pm (SLT) on May 7 2018 and will extend for three months to 11:59pm (SLT) on August 6 2018. The Cessation of Hostilities shall apply throughout the conflict areas of Darfur.""

The new declaration recalls the Sudan Revolutionary Front's (SRF) prior declarations on unilateral Cessations of Hostilities, dated October 17 2015, April 21 2016, and October 13 2016; the Justice and Equality Movement's and the Sudan Liberation Movement/A's prior declarations on unilateral Cessations of Hostilities for Darfur, dated May 3 2017 and November 30 2017; and their further declarations joined with Sudan Liberation Movement- Transitional Council, dated November 31 2017 and January 31 2018.

The signatories commit that they ""will not initiate an attack or wage an offensive,"" and that all armed groups under their control shall comply with the cessation of hostilities, noting that ""the cessation of hostilities shall not prejudice against acts of self-defence, acts for the protection of civilians, or acts against uncoordinated moving targets within or around the conflict areas.""

'Political negations should start immediately'

The signatories request that political negotiations should start immediately to end the ongoing conflict by peaceful means.

They ""note with deep concern the government of Sudan's multiple and repeated violations of its own unilateral cessation of hostilities declarations, most recently exemplified by its condemnable and barbaric attacks on civilians in Jebel Marra, which resulted in the further mass displacement of civilians.""

They are ""deeply disturbed by the government of Sudan's continued violations of international law and attacks against civilians, including attacks on internally displaced persons camps in Darfur.""

The signatories ""further deplore the Government of Sudan's continued detention of political leaders and activists with a blatant disregard to international humanitarian law, and thus call for the immediate release of all political detainees and prisoners of war.""

In conclusion, they seeking action from the international community to put an end to the government of Sudan's policies and acts of violence in Darfur with particular regard to the recent attacks on civilians, to condemn the government's violations of its own cessation of hostilities, and to pursue guarantees for unimpeded humanitarian access to Darfur.",Sudan: Darfur Armed Groups Declare Immediate Humanitarian Ceasefire,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805080533.html

The UN World Food Programme yesterday warned that seven million people, or two thirds of the population, are facing food shortages.

It also warned that 150,000 are at risk of famine.

A concerted international effort is now needed in the country, which is in the midst of civil war.

Liam Cunningham accompanied the RTÉ news team in his role as ambassador for the World Vision aid agency, and spoke with Ray Kennedy in a village on the outskirts of the capital Juba which funding from Ireland helped to construct.
