Staple food prices continue to increase following removal of wheat subsidies – FEWS NET

In its latest update, FEWS NET reports that despite the above-average 2017/18 harvest, staple food prices continued to increase in Sudan during February 2018. This follows the removal of wheat subsidies and the devaluation of the Sudanese Pound in early 2018.

Retail millet and sorghum prices increased by 20 to 30 per cent between January and February in most markets. On average, current levels of retail staple food prices (sorghum, millet, and wheat) are two to three times higher than last year’s levels and the recent four-year average, according to FEWS NET.

In attempts to control the prices of staple foods and improve market access, the Strategic Reserve Corporation (SRC) of the Agricultural Bank of Sudan (ABS) is pre-positioning and selling subsidized sorghum in parts of Kassala and North Darfur affected by poor rains in 2017, and subsequent poor 2017/2018 harvest. Poor households in parts of Kassala and North Darfur who have been affected by belowaverage rains in 2017 are likely to continue to face Crisis - Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3 - levels of food insecurity through May 2018. In response to this, the SRC has prepositioned a total of 160,151 metric tons (MT) of sorghum in Kassala (11,430 MT) and North Darfur (10,930 MT),

FEWS NET says.

Meanwhile, most areas of Sudan, are expected to continue facing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels of food insecurity through September 2018, FEWS NET reports. However, most internally displaced persons (IDPs) in areas controlled by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement – North (SPLM-N) in South Kordofan and IDPs in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur are likely to continue to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity through May 2018. This is mainly due to their displacement, poor harvests or limited agricultural opportunities, and/or very high staple food prices. The food security among IDPs in SPLM-N areas of South Kordofan is likely to deteriorate further to Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels between June and September 2018. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in South Sudan reported in its latest operational update that 1,269 new arrivals from SPLMN areas in South Kordofan were registered in Yida refugee settlement, Unity State (near the border with Sudan) during 1-15 March 2018. This represents 132 per cent increase compared to the same period last year when 545 new arrivals were registered.

In 2017, South Sudan’s conflict was in its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Nearly 4.3 million people – one in three South Sudanese – have been displaced, including more than 1.8 million who are internally displaced and about 2.5 million who are in neighbouring countries. About 700,000 people left South Sudan in 2017.

Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, the crisis was driven by both intensified clashes in Koch and Mayendit and food insecurity, which reached dire conditions. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit counties most affected. Hundreds of thousands of people fled to Uganda, where the population of South Sudanese refugees peaked at over one million in August.

Food insecurity and malnutrition in South Sudan reached record levels in 2017. In February, famine was declared in parts of Unity, meaning some 100,000 people faced starvation. Even though a concerted multi-sector response was able to halt the localized famile in Leer and Mayendit, some 4.9 million people were severely food insecure in South Sudan during that period. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles and kala-azar continued to spread in 2017. Cholera was most severe, with over 20,000 cases reported, including 436 related deaths.

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, making it the deadliest year for aid workers on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access incidents were reported, the highest number of incidents in a year, representing a significant increase, compared to 908 in 2016 and 909 in 2015. Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated in 54 incidents from multiple locations across the country.

Despite these challenges, aid agencies assisted over 5.4 million people in 2017. This included: more than 5.1 million people who received food assistance; over 2.8 million people vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped to access clean water; 930,000 people assisted with vital non-food items; around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis who were supported with access to education.

3,sudan,"Sudan vowed on Tuesday that it will remain in a Saudi-led coalition fighting rebels in Yemen, after a deadly ambush reportedly killed dozens of its soldiers in the war-torn country last week.

Khartoum has deployed hundreds of soldiers in Yemen since 2015 as part of the alliance battling on the side of the country's government against Iran-backed Huthi rebels.

On Friday it suffered one of its heaviest losses when dozens of Sudanese soldiers were killed by insurgents in an ambush, Yemeni military sources and rebels said.

Sudan's Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour insisted his country would remain involved in Yemen at a meeting with envoys from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

""The minister affirmed Sudan's position of continuing to be part of the coalition troops to bring back stability in Yemen,"" the foreign ministry said.

Sudan has not officially confirmed or denied the deaths of its soldiers in the ambush.

But the ministry said the three ambassadors who met Ghandour ""offered their condolences to families of martyrs and hoped for a speedy recovery of those wounded in operations in Yemen in recent days"".

The Huthi rebels hit a Sudanese military convoy in the northern province of Hajjah before dawn on Friday, according to military sources in Yemen.

The losses were reported to be the heaviest suffered by Sudanese troops in Yemen since they were deployed in the war-torn country.

The Huthis reported the attack on their Al-Masirah website, saying dozens of Sudanese soldiers had been killed and armoured vehicles destroyed.

Khartoum's decision to join the Saudi-led coalition was part of a major foreign policy shift after it broke its decades-old ties with Tehran.

The Sudanese military has largely refrained from offering details of its operations within the coalition against the Shiite Huthis.

In a rare announcement in April 2017 the army said that five of its troops had been killed while fighting for the coalition.

President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's government was driven from Yemen's capital after the Huthis overran the city in 2014, sweeping southwards from their northern bastion.

Nearly 10 000 people have been killed since the coalition joined the Yemen war in 2015, triggering what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

In South Kordofan, Al Abassiya locality, an inter-agency assessment mission including UNICEF was conducted in 18 hard-to-reach communities with about 34,896 people in need, 60 per cent of whom are women and children. It was the first time in 7 years that some of these communities were reached by humanitarian aid organisations since the conflict reoccurred in 2o11.

In response to the Jebel Marra nutritional crisis in Central Darfur, UNICEF and partners continued to provide integrated support, including Primary Health Care services to 703 vulnerable children under 5 years, supporting vaccination campaigns reached 307 children under 1 year and the disinfection of the water distribution system and wells reached more than 30,000 people.

UNICEF and UNHCR have agreed on a 'Joint Plan of Action', as a revision to a 2015 Letter of Understanding (LOU) that defines roles and responsibilities in refugee response across sectors, both in and out of camps.

The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for Children and Armed Conflict paid a five-day visit to Sudan. During the visit, the progress in implementing the Action Plan to protect children in armed conflict was reviewed by the SRSG and the government officials, and the remaining steps were reaffirmed for completion.

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

In South Kordofan, an inter-agency assessment mission including UNICEF was conducted in 18 hard-to-reach communities in Al Abassiya locality between 4 and 8 February 2018. Some 34,896 people in need were identified, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and vulnerable populations in the host communities. An estimated 60 per cent of these are women and children. This was the first time in 7 years that some communities were reached by humanitarian aid organisations since the conflict reoccurred in 2011. Dire needs were identified including lack of nutrition treatments and health facilities with medical staff in 16 communities, unsafe quality and inadequate quantity of water in all the 18 communities, and around 90 per cent of the community members practicing open defecation. In addition, 1,692 internally displaced students (966 girls and 726 boys) were attending the 13 visited schools and an estimated 2,000 school aged children in the IDP community are out of school. The low enrolment rate is partially related to the long distance that some children need to travel to attend school, since there are no schools near their settlements. UNICEF responded immediately to the most affected newly accessible communities in collaboration with the State Ministry of Health and the Water and Environmental Sanitation project (WES) based on the acute watery diarrhoea data. The preparation of an integrated response plan is ongoing.

An inter-agency WASH taskforce mission including UNICEF visited Sortony, North Darfur, from 4 to 7 February to assess the alarming levels of the water scarcity in the community. Currently, 220,000 IDPs including 105,600 children stay in the location mainly because of the forced displacement which occurred in some areas in the Jebel Marra region between January and April 2016. The major challenge is that there are no water resources in the direct vicinity of Sortony, causing clashes between different tribe-based groups for control of the limited boreholes near the community. To improve the situation, a piped water supply system was established for a few areas by Oxfam America, UNICEF and WES. UNICEF and partners are now covering the operational costs of the pipe water system, complemented with water trucking. However, a durable solution, with the construction of additional piped water networks, is required for providing at least 15 litres per capita per day.

Since the start of 2018, the deteriorating economic situation in Sudan continues to impact on the population especially the most vulnerable, including 2.3 million children in need of humanitarian assistance. A reduction in purchasing power stems from a 50 per cent increase in the price of basic commodities such as wheat and sorghum, depreciation of the Sudanese pound, banning of some import materials, and increased export tariffs, without an accompanying increase in income or social safety nets. This situation is expected to cause higher rates of malnutrition, hinder access to health services and reduce opportunities to receive education. An inter-agency assessment on identifying the impact on the vulnerable people is ongoing.","UNICEF Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/unicef-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018
5,sudan,"South Sudan’s former military chief said on Monday he had formed an organisation to challenge President Salva Kiir, accusing him of looting the country’s resources and turning it into a failed state.

Paul Malong was sacked early last year amid resignations by some generals who alleged abuses by the military and tribal bias in the army ranks. Since November he has been in exile in Kenya where he was allowed to travel after months of tension between him and his guards and Kiir’s government.

Malong said in a statement that his new organisation called South Sudan-United Front (SS-UF) was “a struggle to … arrest the carnage” and steer the nation back to democracy.

If he wants to fight, let him fight and we will meet him in the field.

Rebellion is booming. This letter is allegedly from Malong Awan. #SouthSudan pic.twitter.com/3kj9kxAk8g — Sisi Majok ?? (@modernemeid) April 9, 2018

South Sudan plunged into a civil war in 2013 after a political disagreement between Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, degenerated into a military confrontation.

A 2015 agreement aimed at ending the conflict failed after hostilities again broke out between the two rivals. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted about a quarter of the country’s population of 12 million.

In the statement, Malong said Kiir “concentrated all his efforts with the help of a small clique around him to quite literally loot the coffers of our great nation to total bankruptcy”.

Malong’s wife Lacy Ayak confirmed to Reuters that her husband had written the statement, which took the form of an open letter to the people of South Sudan.

It was not immediately clear whether Malong’s organisation would join forces with rebels to fight Kiir militarily or would try to challenge him politically.

However, Malong said he was ready to participate in planned talks to end the conflict in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa this month.

Although the opposition was initially solidly behind Machar, in recent years anti-Kiir forces have splintered into factions which has partly complicated efforts to end the war.

Government spokesman Michael Makuei told Reuters that Malong was angry because of his sacking, adding that he had been part of the government that he is now criticising, meaning he shared responsibility for what he thinks went wrong.

“If he wants to fight, let him fight and we will meet him in the field,” Makuei said.

6,sudan,"The former head of the South Sudan army, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has formed a new rebel group known as the South Sudan United Front (SSUF).

General Paul Malong Awan released a statement Monday outlining the objectives of his new group, which he said will fight ""systemic corruption, stop ongoing carnage, steer the country [South Sudan] toward democracy, justice, equality and freedom.""

Awan also pledged to respect the cessation of hostilities agreement signed in December last year by the various warring parties and he urged the regional bloc, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to allow his new group to be part of the high-level revitalization forum meeting scheduled April 26 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

A spokesman of the South Sudan United Front, Sunday De John, told VOA's ""South Sudan in Focus"" program Monday from Nairobi, Kenya, that the new group will work toward achieving peace in South Sudan.

""The real change that would be impacted on the lives of people [in South Sudan] through good governance and the rule of law. The current state of South Sudan is not commensurate with the principles on which South Sudanese went to the bush to [fight] for 21 years.'' John said.

South Sudan Information Minister and government spokesman Michael Makuei declined to comment Monday. He scheduled an interview with VOA on Tuesday.

Sanctions

The European Union imposed sanctions in February on Awan and three current South Sudanese officials implicated in human rights violations and obstructions of their country's peace process.

John said the sanctions imposed on Awan by the U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union are not justified. He said the former chief of staff was carrying out orders from President Salva Kiir, who is the commander in chief of the South Sudan army.

Awan had been a longtime governor of Northern Bahr el Ghazal before he was appointed chief of general staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army by Kiir. His appointment followed mass resignations by senior generals who claimed the SPLA was involved in ethnic cleansing and war crimes.

Awan was fired by Kiir in May 2017, and attempted to return to his hometown of Aweil. However, his convoy was intercepted at Yirol. He was persuaded by the elders in Yirol to return to Juba to talk with Kiir, and was placed under house arrest there.

The former army chief was released in November 2017 to seek medical treatment in Kenya after one of his wives and community leaders pleaded for his release.

Rebel groups

Awan's statement expressed interest in joining various rebel groups that have been meeting at the Ethiopia capital in an effort to end the conflict in South Sudan.

""It is not an opportunistic move. It is the comprehensive peace that is desired by South Sudanese,'' John said.

It is not immediately clear how many people have joined Awan's new rebel group. John said the size and the structure of the forces of South Sudan United Front will remain a secret.

The conflict has devastated the country, causing a humanitarian, political and economic crisis. More than 1.5 million people are on the brink of famine — twice as many as the same time last year. More than 4 million people, or a third of South Sudan's population, have fled their homes, causing Africa's largest refugee crisis.

The report carried by SUNA did not say how many individuals would be released, but said the move came in the spirit of ""reconciliation, national harmony and peace.""

It said the release ""opens the door to participation of all political forces"" to discuss the country's issues.

Opposition figures in Sudan are regularly detained, and parties who opposes al-Bashir face numerous state obstacles.

Sudan is grappling with a currency crisis and hyperinflation that has stoked discontent, although public demonstrations are effectively banned and regularly quashed by security forces.

Protests erupted in Khartoum and other parts of the country in January after the government slashed subsidies and devalued the local currency, measures aimed at strengthening the battered economy. Hundreds of people were detained in those and subsequent protests, though some were later released.

A rebellion by South Sudan’s former army chief signals a further escalation in the more than four-year civil war, complicating peace talks just as Africa’s youngest nation faces a looming famine.

The announcement by Paul Malong, who led President Salva Kiir’s forces before being fired last year, adds yet another armed group to a conflict that’s claimed tens of thousands of lives, has been marked by widespread atrocities and caused Africa’s largest refugee crisis since it erupted in December 2013.

Malong’s rebellion comes amid “what is already a boiling situation in the country,” said Augustino Ting Mayai, director of research at the Sudd Institute, a think tank in the capital, Juba. “He has added fuel to the current crisis.”

Malong, who moved to neighboring Kenya after his dismissal, was among three current or former South Sudanese officials sanctioned by the U.S. in September for their alleged roles in destabilizing the country. The army he controlled has been repeatedly accused by the United Nations of atrocities including the rape and killings of civilians.

His insurgent group, the South Sudan United Front, on Monday decried “systematic corruption which has devastated the lives of all citizens on a daily basis.”

Economic Chaos

A slump in oil production and lower global prices has caused economic chaos in South Sudan, which depends on crude for almost all its revenue. Some areas of the country are on the brink of famine and two-thirds of the 12 million population may face food shortages by May.

Peace talks are due to resume in Ethiopia on April 26 between the government and nine opposition groups, not including Malong’s. The negotiations seek to revive a 2015 agreement that shattered in mid-2016 weeks afters its enactment, ushering in more violence and fresh rebellions in the southern Equatoria region.

Malong in his statement didn’t say how many fighters he commands. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said by phone that Malong’s declaration was “overdue” and the ex-army chief had “never worked on anything good for the country.”

“If he is going to fight South Sudan, he should understand that the same people that he was using to fight the rebels are the same people who will fight him,” Ateny said.

Analyst Mayai said that although Malong may find it difficult to muster large-scale support because of South Sudan’s ethnic divisions, any rebellion he does organize is likely to extend the conflict.

It “is going to be tough for him in terms of human resources to wage a full-scale war,” Mayai said by phone.",Ex-Army Chief's Rebellion Adds Fuel to Fire in South Sudan's War,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/ex-army-chief-s-rebellion-adds-fuel-to-fire-in-south-sudan-s-war
9,sudan,"In South Sudan, the causes of famine run deeper than just food shortage. Since gaining independence from its northern neighbor in 2011, South Sudan has seen its long-sought peace dissolve rapidly into bitter conflict, turning the world’s youngest country into one of its most unstable. The conflict has thrown South Sudan’s already-fragile institutions into disarray and left much of the nation fearing for its safety, as government and opposition forces clash across the country. In this climate, food has become increasingly scarce. Crops are looted, roads are destroyed, and government forces continue to block food shipments to opposition-controlled regions.

Though it is clear that war has limited peoples’ access to food, social issues help fuel the acute hunger in South Sudan and perpetuate the cycle of famine and violence: polygyny—one man marrying multiple women—and forced marriages. With more than 4.8 million people in South Sudan facing food insecurity—almost half the country’s population—many families have turned to dowry payments to put food on the table. With hunger now gripping much of the country, activists report that South Sudanese families are coming under increased pressure to force young women and girls into marriage in order to obtain cattle, which serve as a source of food, financial security, and social status. For many young South Sudanese women and girls, marriage is not a choice but a tragic obligation.

The issue of forced marriages is as much linked to hunger and violence as it is to the unequal and abusive treatment of women. In South Sudan, the practice of polygyny is both legal and widespread. Girls as young as 12 years old are pushed into marriages with men many years older, many of whom meet dowry demands by marrying off women in their own family. Educated women are viewed as arrogant, disrespectful, and promiscuous, so families usually attempt to marry their daughters before they have even completed school in order to maximize the dowry they receive. Unsurprisingly, these practices cause women to suffer physical and emotional abuse: Child brides can suffer acutely from the trauma of separation from their families and the expectation to engage in a sexual relationship before they are willing. Famine has not so much created these problems as it has further skewed marriage incentives, adding fuel to an already raging fire.

In addition to threatening the well being of young women in South Sudan, polygyny also perpetuates civil conflict in the region. Polygyny inevitably creates a class of unmarried, usually poorer, men. Constrained by their socioeconomic status and unable to find wives, these men are pushed out of their home communities. With the promises of a bride and heightened social status, joining the armies of the civil war’s opposing factions becomes increasingly appealing. At times, it may seem like the only way for a young man to escape polygyny’s underclass.

International interventions in this civil war have consisted of humanitarian responses, as well as diplomatic and economic pressure. A recent arms embargo imposed by the United States joins other targeted sanctions, but with Russian and Chinese resistance on the Security Council, there is little hope for significant UN pressure on South Sudan. Humanitarian assistance, specifically food aid, remains the most effective international tool in alleviating the effects of the conflict. The United States has allocated over a billion dollars towards food aid—over $500 million in 2017 alone—which, along with contributions from other countries, comprises the single largest sector of international humanitarian spending on South Sudan.

Although food aid helps to alleviate food insecurity in the short term, it fails to address the underlying economics of forced marriages that contribute to the problem. A systemic imbalance in the marriage market created by polygynous marriages will continue to pull young girls out of schools and force young men into a future of instability and violence. Thus, while remaining an important immediate response to South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis, food aid falls short of creating the meaningful social stability required for peace and prosperity in the country.

The key to a long-lasting solution is education. Families who rely on their daughters’ dowries for security see education as a threat, so they treat educated young women as economic objects. It is imperative for families to look toward education rather than away from it. Having a more educated female population generally leads to later marriages, lower fertility rates, lower maternal and infant mortality rates, and greater social mobility. Through education, daughters can become valuable workers who contribute to their families using their skillsets rather than through just the value of their marriage.

Challenging cultural norms requires significant commitment of time and effort, but change is both possible and necessary. A unique opportunity to achieve this shift lies in pairing food aid with education; by doing so, the international community can implement targeted interventions, as aid workers decide how and where to distribute food. Policy makers can draw inspiration from publicly and privately funded Food for Education programs, such as the US Department of Agriculture’s McGovern-Dole Program, which incentivize school attendance by providing school meals along with training to teachers and other support activities. These successes illustrate a potential plan for a similar program which boosts girls’ education, challenges the practice of forced marriages, and serves as the first step toward finding a long-term solution to South Sudan’s food shortage crisis.

The situation in South Sudan is dire: The vicious cycle of the country’s civil war and its polygynous traditions have led to ever-deepening hunger and violence. Both a cause and a consequence of South Sudanese force marriage practices, the current food crisis calls for a re-evaluation of current aid efforts in the region. Food aid, though effective in the short-run, fails to offer a sustainable, long-term solution to forced marriages and the marginalization of women in South Sudanese society. True progress will only come when both the country’s immediate and deep-rooted issues are tackled in a way that acknowledges and addresses the indivisible link between the two.

IOM’s health rapid response team worked in close partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the State Ministry of Health, the International Rescue Committee and other health agencies.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can become life threatening if complications, such as pneumonia, arise. The campaign, which involved over 117 teams of five people each, targeted children aged six to 59 months.

“Children are extremely vulnerable to outbreaks of measles and other contagious diseases, particularly in areas such as Aweil East where health conditions are further compromised by severe food insecurity and poor living conditions,” explained Derebe Tadesse, IOM Migration Health Officer. “The measles vaccine will save lives. With just one dose, 85 per cent of children over nine months and 95 per cent of children over twelve months of age are immune.”

Protracted displacement, access constraints and poor health and water and sanitation infrastructure have contributed to yearly cholera outbreaks in South Sudan since the crisis began in 2013; the longest lasted from June 2016 to February 2017, killing 436 people.

As a preventive measure, IOM completed the first round of several two-round oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Malakal and Wau, reaching approximately 24,300 and 36,100 individuals respectively in late March. The second-round campaigns are slated to begin in both locations in the coming days. The campaigns target both internally displaced persons within the Malakal and Wau protection of civilian sites and displaced and host communities in Malakal and Wau towns.

In 2017, IOM completed oral cholera vaccination campaigns in Unity, Warrap and Eastern Equatoria, reaching more than 469,800 people with the vaccine.

As the country endures the fifth year of a humanitarian crisis, an estimated 5.1 million people are in need of emergency health care assistance. IOM teams work across the country, in displacement sites, remote locations and host communities, to provide aid to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.

IOM’s health rapid response teams are supported through funding from the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance and the Government of Japan.

12,sudan,"Last month, European Union officials signed a deal with Sudan to improve counterterrorism cooperation, again with a view toward lifting sanctions.

In January, protests erupted in Sudan after the government put forward a new budget that would have cut economic subsidies, possibly leading to higher consumer prices, while continuing to pour resources into military spending. The protests, fueled in part by the opposition Communist Party, led to the arrests of the political prisoners.

Last year, Mr. Bashir named a longtime ally to the new post of prime minister and said he would not seek re-election. But that is a pledge he has made and reneged on in the past.

“He’s a big liar, and I don’t think he will hand over power,” said Jalal Moustafa, an activist with the opposition Sudanese Congress Party, who says he was jailed from Jan. 6 to 15 without charges — the sixth time he has been held by the authorities.

“I was detained as a pre-emptive action to avoid us talking to people so they could cordon off the streets,” Mr. Mustafa, 58, said in a phone interview. He said he was verbally but not physically abused.

Mr. Bashir freed some 80 political prisoners in late February but at least 50 others remained in detention as of last weekend, including Mohamed Mokhtar al-Khatib, the leader of Sudan’s Communist Party.

Mr. Mustafa suggested that Mr. Bashir had freed the prisoners in anticipation of a scheduled visit by United Nations human rights officials.

Jehanne Henry, a Human Rights Watch researcher who closely monitors Sudan, said that among those freed were Amjed Farid, a human-rights activist; Salih Mahmoud Osman, a human rights lawyer; Mohieldeen Aljalad, a communist activist; Dr. Sidiq Kaballo, an economist.

“We know that at least a dozen are over 70, and another dozen over 60, and many of these older guys do have various health conditions,” she said of the other prisoners. The oldest was 83, she said.

Humanitarian Coordinator calls for urgent action to avert worsening food crisis in South Sudan

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Alain Noudehou, led a high-level delegation of donors, heads of humanitarian agencies and partners to Leer in Unity on 7 March to see firsthand the plight of the 90,000 people living in the area. The delegation also met with the Governor of Leer, community leaders and aid agencies who are currently assisting tens of thousands of people across the region.

""Due to seasonal time pressure, we need funding now to reach millions of people with multisectoral assistance during the dry season, through road transport and prepositioning life-saving aid supplies. These same activities will be many times more costly if done by air transport during the rainy season,” said Mr. Noudehou. The Humanitarian Coordinator noted his concern regarding the potential effects of taxes and fees on humanitarian organizations and staff, which not only take much needed-resources from front line operations, but are often unpredictable and disruptive to the humanitarian response.

“Once again, I strongly urge all parties to the conflict to stop the fighting and to ensure that humanitarian agencies are given free, safe and unhindered access to all areas of South Sudan,” said Mr. Noudehou. Leer was one of two counties affected by famine in 2017. Although the famine was stopped, the situation remains fragile, with about 85 per cent of the population predicted to reach crisis and emergency food insecurity conditions (IPC Phases 3 and 4) by the end of April 2018.

Almost two-thirds of the South Sudan population at risk of rising hunger

More than 7 million people in South Sudan—almost two-thirds of the population—could become severely food insecure in the coming months without sustained humanitarian assistance and access, three United Nations agencies warned on 26 February.

If this happens, it will be the highest ever number of food insecure people in South Sudan. The period of greatest concern will be the lean season, between May and July. Particularly at risk are 155,000 people, including 29,000 children, who could reach the most extreme levels of hunger if assistance is not provided and sustained.

Improved access and a concerted humanitarian response succeeded in halting famine last year. Despite this, the scale and scope of food insecurity are reaching new highs, while crop production is compromised.

FAO, UNICEF and WFP warn that progress made could be undone, and more people than ever could be pushed into severe hunger conditions during May-July, unless assistance and access are maintained. Close monitoring of the situation, particularly in counties most at risk, will remain critical

""The situation is extremely fragile, and we are close to seeing another famine. The projections are stark. If we ignore them, we will be faced with a growing tragedy. If farmers receive support to resume their livelihoods, we will see a rapid improvement in the country's food security situation due to increased local production,"" said Serge Tissot,

AWD cases decline in Central Darfur as aid organizations respond to the situation.

Some parts of the country will face increasing food insecurity through September 2018 – FEWS NET.

Government authorities granted permission for the extension of refugee camps in White Nile and East Darfur states.

At least 105.7 sq km of land and 37,898 km of roads have been cleared in Sudan of various types of landmines and unexploded ordinances – UNMAS.

Number of AWD cases in Central Darfur down after joint and coordinated response

Quick action on the part of Government and the United Nations was instrumental in curbing in February a new outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) in Central Darfur (Jebel Marra area). The outbreak entailed 300 new cases, reported after a ten-week period of zero cases in Central Darfur, and a three-week period of zero cases nationwide.

Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and State Ministries of Health (SMoH), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Agency (UNICEF), and health sector partners responded to the outbreak with an aggressive response strategy that included the establishment of isolation centres, examination centres in schools, bolstering water quality control and filtering, rapid response training in nine Central Darfur localities, and close monitoring of the situation on the ground. So far, WHO deployed an emergency team to Central Darfur from West Darfur. This team includes a public health officer and a logistics officer, as well as two team members in Zalingei providing full support to Nertiti locality. The focus and priority of the team is to respond to AWD cases and control the outbreak.

Preparations and planning for the upcoming rainy season are also underway. At the same time, preparedness activities in areas where there have been no reports of AWD are continuing, including daily reporting, replenishment of medicines and supplies, ensuring quality of safe drinking water, making sure there is an adequate number of trained staff as well as an operational plan for response, and raising public awareness on the prevention and best practices to mitigate AWD.",Sudan: Humanitarian Bulletin | Issue 05 | 26 February – 18 March 2018 [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-05-26-february-18-march-2018
15,sudan,"In March at the Carter Center in Atlanta, South Sudan’s minister of health announced that Guinea worm transmission had been stopped within South Sudan. It has been fifteen months since the last reported case, and the disease has a life cycle of twelve months. That means the disease is gone from South Sudan, though it could be reintroduced from elsewhere. The World Health Organization is expected to certify South Sudan as free of Guinea worm. Elimination of Guinea worm is a massive, even spectacular, achievement orchestrated by an American non-governmental organization, the Carter Center, working with African ministries of health, numerous local partners, and a veritable army of village volunteers.

In 2016, there were twenty-five reported cases of Guinea worm in the world, in South Sudan, Mali, Chad, and Ethiopia, but now, the disease is found only in the last three. Those three countries have a better health infrastructure than South Sudan, with its ongoing civil war and massive displacement of population. Hence, if the disease can be eliminated in South Sudan, it is likely soon to be entirely eliminated from the face of the earth. That would make it the second human disease after smallpox to be eliminated. It is to be hoped that polio will be the third.

When the Carter Center began its campaign in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases worldwide. Present in ancient Egypt and mentioned in the Old Testament, Guinea worm is (or was) a scourge of the poor. It is a parasite, the larvae of which are transmitted in water. After the larvae is ingested by a human body, a three-foot worm develops. The worm then makes its way out of the body through a sore, often on a foot, by excreting an acid. Guinea worm itself is not fatal, but it is excruciatingly painful, debilitating, and increases vulnerability to other diseases. There is no cure for the disease. Modern treatment is the same as it was for the ancient Egyptians: the emerging worm is carefully wrapped around a stick to prevent infection. Guinea worm can be prevented through the filtering of water. That requires a public education campaign.

The Carter Center had the imagination to take as its focus a disgusting but non-fatal disease that almost exclusively plagues the poor. With its campaign against Guinea worm, it might be argued that the Carter Center has done more than most official assistance programs to mitigate the lives of the African poor.

A UN publication announcing the end of Guinea worm in South Sudan noted that former president Jimmy Carter, the founder of the Carter Center, announced in 2015 that he had been diagnosed with cancer: “He said he was responding well to treatment and he expected to outlive the last case of Guinea worm. President Carter is now 95 and cancer free, and Guinea worm disease just lost the fight in South Sudan.”

16,sudan,"(Juba, 10 April 2018): The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, has strongly condemned the killing of an aid worker in Bentiu, Unity, and called for the immediate and unconditional release of seven others abducted by an armed group in Morobo County,

Central Equatoria.

Over the weekend, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, transporting five aid workers along Nhialdlu-Bentiu road, killing one national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO. CARE International staff were robbed at gunpoint while travelling in the vicinity on the same day.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 98 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013. Most have been South Sudanese nationals.

In a separate incident in Central Equatoria on 25 March, seven national staff from SSUHA, a national aid organization, were taken by SPLA-IO forces while travelling in a 3-vehicle convoy from Kupera County to Lainya County. The convoy was delivering supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Kupera, Limuro, Wuji and Koyoki.

Mr. Noudehou called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need. These events are a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance each day.","Humanitarian Coordinator condemns killing of aid worker, calls for the release of seven others held by armed group",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/humanitarian-coordinator-condemns-killing-aid-worker-calls-release-seven-others
17,sudan,"If the opportunity presented itself, Majak Daw would jump at the chance to return to Sudan.

The 27-year-old, in his ninth season of AFL, told a group of Sudanese youths that he’d love nothing more than to return to his place of birth for a trip, one day soon.

Daw hasn’t been back to Sudan since he and his family fled the civil war when he was just nine, but dreams about reuniting with his grandparents and extended family in the not too distant future.

“I’m not scared to go back to Sudan,” Daw told his curious audience.

“I just need to find the right time to return and really plan a proper trip.”

Speaking to around 30 students - who moved to Victoria from either Darfur or the Nuba Mountains in Sudan - Daw couldn’t help but see a younger version of himself in each and every one of them.

“I just want to make myself available to you all and show the Australian community as well as our own kids and community that we are good people doing good things,” Daw told them during a special clinic arranged by The Huddle.

“And if you can’t see a representation of yourself, you won’t know what you can be or the options you have.”

The occasion was far from just another football education session for Daw, but a way to connect with youths from a similar background.



“For me it isn’t all about footy,” Daw said.

“Footy is my passion and my dream, but the fact that I can get out in front of so many people and encourage others to get involved in their community, that’s what’s important.

“It gives me confidence that there will be more African people in the AFL.

“I love being able to teach other people about my culture and my biggest goal is to bridge the gap between the African and the Australian culture.”

The students Daw addressed are part of an initiative called iCan, started by not-for-profit Stand Up which runs programs that focus on strengthening the Sudanese community from within by creating role models through tutoring, goal setting, and career guidance.

And Daw’s influence and impact on the young group could not be overstated.

“Majak comes from the same background as us and has shown that if we work hard we can achieve a lot,” Shema Mohamed said.

“He’s inspirational.”

As Mohamed commented on what Daw meant to the group, four young women sitting next to her nodded enthusiastically.

Throughout the afternoon Daw was asked about the ins and outs of being an elite athlete, how he got such large biceps, how he found his passion, stays motivated, and if he gets nervous playing in front of tens-of-thousands of people.

Judging by his standout performance against Melbourne on the weekend in front of 35,000 people at the MCG, the answer to that last question is a profound, ‘No’.

So for now, football is the main thing on Daw’s mind and making sure he stays in the North Melbourne side, but when the season is over, he might just end up on a plane heading to Africa.

UNICEF, in coordination with partners, responded to a suspected Meningitis outbreak (173 suspected cases; 31 deaths reported) in Eastern Equatoria, first reported 15 February. UNICEF supported with case management through the provision of essential drugs/supplies, establishing a treatment center, and community engagement and social mobilization through UNICEF’s partner (South Sudan Red Cross) whose trained volunteers conducted house-to-house sensitizations on meningitis and community surveillance.

Food insecurity and the nutrition situation remains dire, with further deterioration projected in May/July if appropriate, timely and integrated interventions are not taken. UNICEF has actioned a 180-day response plan but funding is critical for scale up efforts, especially in WASH and Health.

Ten Integrated Rapid Response Missions (IRRMs) with WFP have been conducted in most affected counties including Panyijaar, Baggari, Nassir, Raja, and Rubkona, reaching 131,819 people, including 28,317 children under the age of five. The UNICEF and WFP IRRM partnership has expanded to include FAO, providing beneficiaries with additional life-saving services.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Despite February’s declaration of the end of South Sudan’s longest and largest cholera outbreak, there is high risk of a new outbreak in South Sudan with the oncoming rainy season, coupled with poor sanitation condition, poor water and food handling practices. Children and women are the most vulnerable to an outbreak. The deteriorating food insecurity and nutrition situation could decrease the immunity of malnourished children, thereby increasing the consequences of a cholera outbreak. Other disease outbreaks (e.g. measles, and malaria) could also worsen the morbidity and mortality of children. The outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues to evolve in Eastern Lakes State, South Sudan, with another county affected. As of 9 March 2018, a total of 40 cases and four deaths have been reported from Yirol East (37 cases, 4 deaths) and Yirol West (3 cases, no deaths) counties. Of these, a total of six confirmed, three probable and 12 suspect RVF cases (with pending laboratory results) have been reported. Nineteen suspected cases were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. The majority of suspected cases have been women (57.1 per cent), and individuals aged 20-39 years make up the majority (72.2 per cent) of cases.

A suspected meningitis outbreak in Eastern Equatoria, first reported on 15 February, is on the decline with only two suspected cases reported in week 12 (19-25 March). A total of 173 cases with 31 deaths (CFR= 17.92 per cent) have been reported since the index case.

The February 2018 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projected 6.3 million (57 per cent) and 7.1 million (63 per cent) of the population are facing crisis and emergency (IPC Phases 4 and 3 respectively) acute food insecurity in the absence of humanitarian assistance in February-April and May-July 2018, respectively. 55,150 people are projected to face catastrophic nutrition conditions in February-April and May-July 2018, respectively.","UNICEF South Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, 28 February – 31 March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unicef-south-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-28-february-31-march-2018
19,sudan,"Humanitarian needs & key figures

The HNO identifies the needs of people based on their vulnerabilities. For example, rather than assuming that all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are in need because they are displaced, only vulnerable IDPs have been considered. The main humanitarian needs in Sudan result from several factors: New and protracted displacement due to conflict, and chronic poverty and under-development including due to economic sanctions, affect access to basic services, disrupts the livelihoods and food security of many people and exposes the displaced to serious risks to their safety and dignity. Acute malnutrition in children under the age of five is above emergency thresholds in various areas across the country. Refugees and asylum seekers, especially from South Sudan, continue to arrive in Sudan seeking protection and humanitarian assistance. Returnees (both refugees and IDPs) are also vulnerable. Natural hazards in Sudan in particular floods and droughts impact food security and the livelihoods of vulnerable people.

The total number of people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 is 5.5 million, an increase of 0.7 million compared to 2017. The increase in needs is due to: Access to areas that opened up in Jebel Marra, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, within the framework of the revised directives on humanitarian action published by the Government’s Humanitarian Affairs Commission (HAC) in December 2016, enabled needs assessments to be conducted revealing severe malnutrition and access to basic services below emergency thresholds. While agricultural production improved in 2017, food insecurity needs increased mainly driven by increases in prices. Without an increase in income, a larger proportion of IDPs are finding themselves with very limited economic access to food. The Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) outbreak that started in 2016 continued throughout 2017.

1 Basic services for internally displaced people

Darfur remains an epicentre of large-scale protracted displacement and most IDPs are unable to meet their basic needs independently. While the number of people displaced in 2017 has been limited, new needs have emerged in areas that have opened up to humanitarians workers, especially in Jebel Marra, South Korfodan and Blue Nile. According to recent estimates from the government of Sudan, as of November 2017, the number of IDPs has reduced from 2.3 million to 1.997 million. Based on revised estimates, there are about 386,000 returnees who have voluntarily returned to their places of origin across Sudan. The UN and partners will continue to work with the Government to further verify these numbers.

The United Nations (UN) and partners estimate that a further 500,000 displaced people live in host communities and settlements in Darfur. Armed movements in South Kordofan and Blue Nile estimate that an additional 545,000 people are displaced in areas under their control

2 Food insecurity

The government Food Security Technical Secretariat (FSTS) estimates that in 2018, some 4.8 million people are living at crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity. Arable lands in some food-producing areas are difficult to access and, even when crops can be grown, inadequate transport infrastructure has prevented access to markets.

3 Acute malnutrition in children

According to the Ministry of Health of the 2.47 million children and PLW suffering from wasting (Global Acute Malnutrition – GAM) annually in Sudan, some 694,000 suffer from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). In 2018, 11 out of the 18 states have a malnutrition prevalence of above 15 per cent, which is above the emergency threshold as per WHO standards.

4 Influx of refugees

In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million refugees and asylum seekers are living in Sudan and in need of humanitarian assistance. This includes over 455,000 South Sudanese refugees who had arrived in Sudan, as of 15 October, since the start of the conflict in South Sudan in December 2013, and an estimated 200,000 additional South Sudanese refugees anticipated to arrive in 2018.

There are also over 155,000 refugees living in protracted situations across five states in Eastern Sudan.",Sudan 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-2018-humanitarian-needs-overview

NAIROBI — As the rainy season descends on South Sudan, an unprecedented number of people face severe food insecurity. Access to people in need is already difficult in the country, where a civil war has raged for more than four years. With the rains, access to these populations will now be further hampered as flooded roads become impassable, leaving populations isolated in pockets throughout the country and unable to receive emergency aid.

This year, some 5.3 million people — or 48 percent of the population — are estimated to be facing severe food insecurity in the post-harvest season in South Sudan, meaning that they are somehow dependent on humanitarian food aid. This is a 40 percent increase from last year. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification has warned that at its peak, this figure could reach 7.1 million people in need of assistance in the coming months.

The spread of the conflict has resulted in a higher number of people in need than previous years, said Simon Cammelbeeck, World Food Programme acting South Sudan country director. In the past, there were parts of the country that to a certain extent escaped the conflict. But over the past two years, the conflict has spread to essentially the whole country, leading to an escalating number of people in need. A famine situation is likely without an urgent increase in aid, according to a recent press release from the Norwegian Refugee Council.

“South Sudan’s food crisis levels are shocking,” said Rehana Zawar, NRC country director in South Sudan, in the release. “Alarm bells are ringing as the threat of famine is now more widespread than this time last year. Tens of thousands of families are at risk of starvation.”

As the fighting spread, it reached the nation’s breadbasket of Equatoria in 2016, causing farmers to flee their land. This has caused a severe decrease in the overall food production in the country. There is currently an estimated deficit of more than 1 billion pounds of locally produced cereal, according to a crop and food security assessment from WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This is a 26 percent increase from last year. This is compounded by an economic crisis, where civil servants have also not been paid for months.

“In the past, traders came to Equatoria to buy sorghum and maize and then moved it to parts of the country which had deficits,” said Cammelbeeck. “But the production is less and the trade is hampered because of the conflict. The traders cannot access where there is a little bit of surplus.”

Newly displaced populations are also trying to situate themselves out of the reach of armed militants, which means that they are harder to access for humanitarian actors, said Elizabeth White, policy adviser at Oxfam.

Towns and urban areas have also seen large arrivals of displaced populations, increasing pressure on already limited food sources, said Geno Teofilo, regional head of communications and advocacy for East Africa and Yemen for the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The coming rains

The rainy season has started in parts of the country and is spreading to other areas, which will push the country into its “lean” months and last until November. The rains are a major hindrance to access in outlying areas, which cannot be reached by road once the rains have started. The food security crisis is expected to be at its worst in the next few months because after the initial rains, there is expected to be some local food production. This makes May to July the most critical period to reach vulnerable populations, said Cammelbeeck.

“We have to continue providing at a large scale or there is the risk that people will fall back into some kind of emergency, or famine-like situation, like what happened last year,” said Cammelbeeck. “If we drop support, very quickly people will get into bad shape in a relatively short time, starting with the children and pregnant and lactating women.”

During the rainy season, the humanitarian sector has to depend heavily on airplane drops of emergency aid to reach remote communities, which is an expensive way to deliver aid. This is coupled with the fact that the crisis is underfunded. The crisis has only been funded 8.3 percent, with a $1.6 billion deficit, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Because of this, wide-scale use of air drops is not financially feasible.

The humanitarian sector is scrambling to pre-position supplies in strategic locations in the lead-up to the rains so that it can still reach the most vulnerable. Beyond road and air transport networks, rivers are also used to reach populations. As the water table rises, more communities will be accessible by boat, which is a cheaper option than air dropping supplies. Because of limited resources, agencies such as WFP have not yet been able to deliver the total pre-positioned tonnage of food, as planned, said Cammelbeeck. Without an increase in resources, WFP food rations will need to be reduced.

“There is a big concern that if we have to cut the rations, [the situation] will worsen quickly,” he said. “We hope that we will not get to the situation that we had last year where we had famine-like situation.”

Beyond reaching populations with food, it is essential that these population also receive water, sanitation, and hygiene services, so that their bodies are in conditions where they can absorb that food, said White. Last year, WASH needs were only 35 percent funded, as compared to almost 70 percent funded for food security, she said.

“You’ve got new arrivals in areas, now hosted by communities that might have access to a certain number of boreholes for clean water, a certain number of latrines,” said White. “Now you’ve got considerably more people using those resources, which inherently brings challenges in the ability to uphold safe hygiene and sanitation practices.”",Rainy season in South Sudan threatens to further isolate populations,https://www.devex.com/news/rainy-season-in-south-sudan-threatens-to-further-isolate-populations-92497

7 troops sent to prison for Rohingya slayings

Burma’s military on Tuesday sentenced seven personnel to 10 years in prison and hard labor as accomplices in the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslims in troubled Rakhine state, officials said.

The troops also were permanently expelled from the army, according to a statement released by the army chief.

The army in January made a rare admission that its soldiers had killed 10 Rohingya villagers who were captured and accused of being “terrorists” amid insurgent attacks last year in Inn Din village in northern Rakhine. The military said the soldiers confessed to the slayings.

The security forces had launched brutal counterattacks against Rohingya Muslims, a long-persecuted minority in the predominantly Buddhist Burma, after a Rohingya insurgent group attacked police outposts on Aug. 25. The military called it a “clearance operation” against terrorists, but the United States and the United Nations branded it as “ethnic cleansing” after the operation drove nearly 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh.

Bashir orders release of political prisoners

Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir ordered the immediate release of all political prisoners on Tuesday as part of national dialogue efforts, the state news agency said.

The report by the Sudan News Agency did not say how many would be released, but it said the move came in the spirit of “reconciliation, national harmony and peace.” It said the release “opens the door to participation of all political forces” to discuss Sudan’s issues.

Opposition figures in the country are regularly detained, and parties that oppose Bashir face numerous state obstacles.

Sudan is grappling with a currency crisis and hyperinflation that have stoked discontent, although public protests are effectively banned and regularly quashed by security forces.

Protests erupted in Khartoum, the capital, and other parts of the country in January after the government slashed subsidies and devalued the currency in a bid to strengthen the economy. Hundreds were detained in those and subsequent protests.

LIBYA

Thousands being held unlawfully, U.N. says

Libyan militias, including some affiliated with authorities, are holding thousands of prisoners in prolonged arbitrary and unlawful detention that includes torture, the United Nations said Tuesday.

Men, women and children have been rounded up based on “tribal or family links and perceived political affiliations” and held with “little or no recourse to judicial remedy or reparations,” the organization said in a report.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein noted “the sheer horror and arbitrariness of such detentions” and urged Libyan authorities to act.

Libya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising in which dictator Moammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed. The country is now ruled by rival governments in the capital, Tripoli, and in the east, each backed by militias.

The report says around 6,500 people are being held in prisons overseen by the Justice Ministry, but it notes that no statistics are available for those held by other ministries or armed groups.

The regionally coordinated policy of isolating the (SPLM/A (IO) since the breakdown of ARCISS on July 8, 2016, was syndicated by subjecting its leader, Dr Riek Machar to indefinite solitary confinement in South Africa. Initially, the publicity of his ordeal was that he was in Pretoria as a guest of the Republic of South Africa. South African authorities later disputed that without disclosing who actually detained him while on a medical visit in that country. To our disbelief and relief, the IGAD Council of Ministers Resolution dated March 26, 2018, has cleared the clouds that Dr Riek Machar was indeed and is still a political detainee of IGAD. The catchword in the wording of that document is “relocation”(not “release”) which could be legally interpreted as a transfer to another indefinite detention in another country chosen by his captors against his will. To anyone connecting the dots, it all makes sense as a manifestation of IGAD’s failure to abide by the rule of law and the cardinal ethos that qualify the regional organization to mediate the peace process aiming at resolving the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. Among so many elements of injustice, in this case, the following spectral violations stand out:

1. It goes without first and foremost invoking the basic tenet of the criminal justice that deprivation of human liberty is subject to due process of law. In accordance with that universal standard, even initially lawful detention becomes arbitrary if it is not subject to speedy trial or periodic review. Hence, under the existing international law, the circumstances of Dr Machar’s indefinite detention in South Africa contravene Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That international humanitarian right covenant prohibits inhumane treatments such as kidnapping, indefinite detention, being “disappeared” with no access to court, family or friends all of which depict Dr Machar’s ordeal in every jurisdiction under the existing international criminal justice system.

2. Pursuant to Article 9 (a&c) of the Cessation of Hostility Agreement (CoHA) brokered by none other than the IGAD itself, the implementation of the CoHA assigned on December 21, 2017, commences with the unconditional release of all the political detainees. This legally covers Dr Riek Machar as a political detainee of IGAD, which of course includes Kiir’s regime. It must also be discerned that the tone of IGAD Council of Ministers Resolution is loaded with discordant prejudice and overt hostility against the person and persona of Dr Riek Machar in violation of Article 4(1) of CoHA, which abhors belligerent or hostile communication during this time of revitalizing ARCISS. This prejudicial tone comes out even louder in the self-incriminating coercion against Dr Machar to unilaterally renounce violence. This infers hostile prejudice portraying Dr Machar as the sole catalyst behind the ongoing violence in South Sudan.

3. Dr Riek Machar has not been formally charged with violation of any law under the IGAD jurisdiction. This makes his detention illegal by all standards of modern criminal law. The technical term for that illegal practice is” false arrest”. The mockery of justice in that political kangaroo court of IGAD is best illustrated by the conditions attached to even the relocation of this political detainee from one confinement to another under the same status. One of those conditions reads: “Riek Machar must renounce violence for IGAD to relocate him to another location to be determined by his self-appointing judges including his erstwhile political enemy( Kiir’s regime). Any jurist or student of criminal law can easily discern this case of Dr Machar versus the IGAD as a malicious political persecution vanquished by the victors. It is a spectre of injustice where the victim of violence is arbitrarily victimized and the violent offender (Kiir) who has been an orgy of pogrom and genocide since December 2013 is elevated to the status of a judge to condemn his political enemy to rot in IGAD political jails.

4. Volumes of records surrounding the ongoing crisis in South Sudan have exonerated Dr Machar as a victim of political violence since December 2013. In pursuit of peace and dialogue with Salva Kiir, Dr Machar has escaped death twice from Salva Kiir who pursued him up to Gadiang in December 2013 and again up to the Grampa Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2016. Under that the sun, nothing can demonstrate Kiir’s violence than those hot pursuits involving drones and warplanes. Yet, nobody is asking Salva Kiir to renounce violence. The records must also be informed that it was Dr Machar who signed the ARCISS first without any reservation and risked his own life to return to Juba under pressure and assurance by the leadership of IGAD-PLUS as guarantors that they would do everything in their power to ensure that ARCISS is implemented to that letter and spirit. Nobody needs to be reminded here that IGAD failed to do its part leading to the collapse of ARCISS. In a betrayal of Dr Machar and the people of South Sudan, IGAD did not only condone the violation of the agreement it brokered but also recognized that junta of Kiir and Taban as TGONU in violation of Article 6 (4) of ARCISS.

5. Despite all the betrayals by the IGAD and the international community, Dr Machar maintained his pursuit for peaceful settlement of the ongoing conflict even in his South African jailhouse and has written several letters to all the well placed regional and world leaders to intervene in the South Sudanese crisis by resuscitating the ARCIS. He continued with his relentless search for peace amidst military offensive by Kiir’s regime until the commencement of HRF that he supported and sent high-level delegation under the leadership of his Deputy, Honorable Hennery Odwar in December 2017.

6. Dr Machar was again the first to embark on the full implementation of COHA by instructing his forces to release all POWS and stranded civilians under their custody. This has been done and witnessed by the international organizations concerned including the UNOCHA, International Red Cross and the International Rescue Committee. Kiir failed to reciprocate. The fascist regime has done the gross opposite by executing the POWs and sentencing detainees and abductees to death in violation of Article 6( a&c) of CoHA and the Geneva Convention. To date, the fascist regime has continuously attacked the opposition-held areas obstructing the delivery of the humanitarian relief and causing untold suffering to innocent civilians again in violation of Article 8(1&4) of the CoHA. It was also sensational that the IGAD Council of Ministers expressed “extreme concern on the report submitted by CTSAMM reporting flagrant violations of the CoHA by Kiir’s regime during the 61st Extraordinary Meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers without asking Salva Kiir to renounce violence.

7. During the Phase II of the HLRF peace talks, the SPLM/A (IO) signed the Declaration of Principles (DoP) which Salva Kiir’s regime adamantly declined to sign in protest of article 28, which provides for punitive action against the violator and spoilers. This can be easily understood as the regime’s audacity to pursue violence and obstruction of the peace process. Again Salva Kiir was not asked to renounce violence and negotiate in good faith. Instead of doing the needful, the IGAD mediating team succumbed to Kiir’s intransigence and made the signing of that roadmap document optional.

8. As broadly evidenced by its continued cooperation and collaboration with Kiir’s regime, the IGAD has legitimized Kiir’s violence by condoning all the war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed by Kiir’s regime since December 2013. This is policy is pursued in deliberate denial of the crude reality on the ground that the people of South Sudan are currently protected from the genocidal violence of Salva Kiir’s regime by the United Nations within their own states capitals and the national capital, Juba where they are confined to POCs of UNIMISS. Furthermore, there is no stronger evidence of Kiir’s violence than the testimonies of the refugees and IDPs that have confirmed the ugly truth that Kiir’s violence is responsible for refugee and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. In any case, it is desolate that the IGAD member states hosting the victims of Kiir’s violence as refugees have miserably failed to ask this violent warlord to renounce violence.

9. The delicate point this region and the international community keep missing is the cold and bitter truth that the ongoing civil war in South Sudan is a popular armed uprising against the oppressive and genocidal policies of Kiir’s ethnocentric regime. So, reducing it to the person of Dr Riek Machar is a public insult to the collective intelligence and the dignity of the people of South Sudan who are humanly obliged to resist Kiir’s oppression with Dr Machar in the fences or outside the fences of IGAD jails. If anything, it is Dr Machar’s physical participation in the peace process that could bring the light closer to the end of this long dark tunnel of political violence in South Sudan. That is why the region and the world must subscribe to Dr Machar’s wisdom that the only sure and practical way to permanently end the ongoing violence is signing and implementing agreements such as COH that the SPLM (IO) has so far implemented. Anything else will only prolong the suffering of the people of South Sudan.

10. Given the mountain of factual evidences presented afore, it is hereby submitted that the judgment in that political kangaroo court of IGAD is fraught with gross violation of international humanitarian and human right law, violation of CoHA, double standards and conflict of interest legally and morally disqualifying the regional organization from its current status as a mediator in the peace process to resolve the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. In the light of this overwhelming credibility crisis, the IGAD must expressly take the following actions to save whatever little credibility it might still have to continue with mediating the peace process in South Sudan: Unconditional release of Dr Riek Machar to freely participate in the peace process, putting Salva Kiir where he belongs as a warring party (not a judge or mediator), holding him responsible for violation of CoHA and obstruction of the peace process since the year 2014 and ask him to renounce violence. With this submission, I rest my case and I look forward to hearing from the IGAD kangaroo court and the verdict in the court of public opinion.

25,sudan,"Omar al-Bashir reported to be freeing those detained after unrest but details are unclear

Sudan’s president, Omar al-Bashir, has ordered the release of “all political detainees” held in the country, state media said, weeks after mass arrests in a crackdown on anti-government protests.

Hundreds of opposition activists, leaders and protesters were arrested in January by security agents to curb demonstrations that erupted on the back of rising food prices, including bread.

“President Omar al-Bashir on Tuesday issued a decree to release all political detainees held across the country,” the official Suna news agency reported.

“The decision aims to promote peace and harmony among all political parties in order to create a positive environment for achieving national goals,” it said.

The January arrests came after sporadic protests erupted in the capital Khartoum and some other towns of Sudan after the price of bread more than doubled.

Some activists were later freed but many remained in detention, including top opposition leaders Khaled Omar of the Sudanese Congress party and Mokhtar al-Khatib, the head of the Sudan Communist party.

Sina did not say how many prisoners would be set free and did not identify any of them.

The US and European embassies in Sudan had called for the release of all detainees, with Washington’s mission saying many were being held in inhumane conditions.

Sudanese authorities had cracked down on protesters in a bid to prevent a repeat of deadly unrest that followed an earlier round of subsidy cuts in 2013. At that time, dozens of people were killed when security forces crushed demonstrations, rights groups said.",Sudan's president orders release of all political prisoners,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/sudans-president-orders-release-of-all-political-prisoners
