Nyal town is located in Northern Panyijiar County, Unity State, along the banks of the Sudd, the third largest swamp in the world. Since the beginning of the crisis, IDPs from Unity and Jonglei States have perceived Nyal as a safe location with ample resources. Recently, Nyal has also become a key location for people travelling to and from nearby islands.

Since 1 November 2016, REACH has monitored three ports in Nyal - Gap Port, Nyal Port and Katieth Port - to record the arrivals and departures on a daily basis. The information gathered covers household (HH) demographics, key push and pull factors, health concerns, vulnerable populations, and general transportation routes. The daily data was synthesised to provide evidence for more effective humanitarian planning.

The REACH team collected information from 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to ensure complete coverage of Nyal’s three ports. REACH teams attempt to interview all arrivals and departures at the household level using a contextualised survey. However, the data presented here is not representative, rather indicative of movement trends for the assessed population. This factsheet is based on data on 626 people departing (150 HHs), 429 people arriving (103 HHs), and 8 people transiting (3 HHs), which was collected from 5 to 29 March 2018.","South Sudan Displacement Crisis: Nyal Port Monitoring - Panyijiar County, Unity State, South Sudan (March 2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-displacement-crisis-nyal-port-monitoring-panyijiar-county-unity-6
4,sudan,"(Juba, 26 April 2018): Ten aid workers have gone missing outside South Sudan’s Yei town in Central Equatoria region.

Their convoy was en route to Tore from Yei town, early on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being are unknown. The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou demanded their swift return.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being,” said Mr. Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff, are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The ten humanitarian staff, all nationals, include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, one from the South Sudanese Development Organisation, (SSDO), two from ACROSS, three from Plan International and one from Action Africa Help (AAH).

“I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conducive to the delivery of assistance,” said Mr. Noudehou.

This is the second incident involving aid workers being held by armed groups in April alone, and the third in six months.

Sudan is to close 13 overseas diplomatic missions and will slash the number of staff at its foreign ministry, state media reported Thursday, as the government faces a crippling economic crisis.

A decree by Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, will also cut staff at seven other missions down to just one person. The move comes two weeks after Bashir sacked foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour for highlighting his ministry’s problems in parliament.

“The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country,” Bashir’s decree stated, according to official news agency SUNA.

The decisions have been taken in order to cut costs given the economic situation in the country - Presidential decree

According to SUNA, the foreign ministry’s entire administrative staff are being dismissed, with diplomats expected to take over their duties. Staff at all overseas missions will be cut by 20 per cent at least.

The total number of job losses was not provided and the missions affected were not named.

All of Sudan’s overseas trade and economic offices will also be shuttered, SUNA reported, except the one in Abu Dhabi responsible for finalising arrangements for the country’s participation in Dubai’s Expo 2020.

On 18 April, Ghandour asked MPs to step in and help cover the foreign ministry’s costs, complaining staff’s wages and rent on diplomatic missions could not be paid. The next day, Bashir relieved him of his position.

The Sudanese central bank denied at the time there was any problem funding state institutions, though recognised there was a paucity of foreign currency.

“The central bank has never delayed payment to the foreign ministry's employees,” it said in a statement at the time, “as it understands very well the importance of diplomacy for the future and stability of our country"".

Sudan has been experiencing economic problems since South Sudan’s breakaway in 2011, which stripped the East African country of some 75 per cent of its oil earnings.

More recently, an acute shortage of foreign currency has seen the Sudanese pound plummet against the US dollar.

In January, Sudan’s parliament passed a budget aiming to address the country’s economic woes, devaluing the Sudanese pound and cutting subsidies on essential goods.

Inflation rose to 56 per cent in March, while high prices and shortages of food and fuel provoked street protests that were quashed by a campaign of mass arrests.

Hopes Sudan’s economic situation would improve were raised in October when Washington lifted sanctions on the country that had stood for two decades, a coup that Ghandour had a large hand in.

A quick recovery has not emerged, however, with investment slow to come in and international banks wary of conducting business with their Sudanese counterparts.",Sudan shuts 13 diplomatic missions as cash crisis deepens,http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/cash-strapped-sudan-closes-13-diplomatic-missions-2007995028

* Drivers spent night in line at gas station to buy fuel

By Khalid Abdelaziz

KHARTOUM, April 24 (Reuters) - Vehicles queued for hours at gas stations in Sudan’s capital on Tuesday as a fuel shortage caused by the government’s difficulty in importing it due to a foreign currency crisis hit home.

Once an exporter of oil, Sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of what had been the country’s oil output and its main source of foreign currency.

“I have been waiting at the gas station from last night until midday today. This bus is my only source of income,” said Adam Abdullah.

The 45-year-old bus driver is one of many workers who spent the night at a gas station to refuel their vehicles.

“I have been waiting for hours to find transportation to return home. This is something we cannot stand. Where is the government?” asked Intesar Awad from a bus station in the heart of Khartoum.

Hundreds of others queued for rides home around her - joining lines that have built up since the end of last week as the currency crunch has bitten deeper.

The Sudanese pound has dropped to 35 to the dollar from 33 pounds earlier this week, a black market trader told Reuters. He expected the Sudanese pound to weaken further in coming days.

Inflation quickened to 55.6 percent in March year-on-year from 54.34 percent in February.

Prices have risen since the pound plummeted to record lows on the black market in recent months, prompting the central bank to make two steep devaluations since the start of the year.

It now officially trades at about 28 pounds to the dollar from 6.7 pounds in late December.

The Sudanese pound hit a record low of about 40 pounds to the dollar earlier this year on the black market, but the devaluations and a ban on deposits of dollars obtained from the black market have reversed this trend.

The central bank has also introduced restrictions on withdrawals, leaving many unable to take out cash from banks.

Minister of State for Finance Abdelrahman Drar said in a statement on Tuesday that five tankers carrying petroleum products had arrived at Sudan’s main port to alleviate the shortages.

Potentially increasing the short-term uncertainty, two Nigerian oil companies, Express and Misana, on Monday sold their 30 percent joint stake in Sudan’s al-Rawat oil field to Sudan National Petroleum Corporation or Sudapet, Khartoum’s state news agency SUNA reported.

Sudapet now owns all the shares in al-Rawat, which falls along the While Nile, 420 km south of Khartoum. It hopes to increase output in the long-term, reducing the dependence on imports, through increased exploration.

Black market fuel prices surged on Saturday in Khartoum and other Sudanese towns as petrol and diesel shortages forced residents to queue for hours outside gas stations.

Fuel supplies began dwindling in early April, with officials blaming maintenance delays at a key refinery, although foreign currency shortages have also played a role.

The crisis has since escalated despite official pledges to resolve it.

The shortage has hiked prices of petrol on the black market, with a gallon costing 150 pounds ($5.30) in Khartoum, over five times the official price of 27 pounds.

""I purchased two gallons at this high cost from the black market,"" said Mohamed Abbas, a resident of a working class neighbourhood in the capital.

""I bought it from someone who had filled his car tank after waiting the whole night at a fuel station.""

Another Khartoum resident told AFP that he too had waited through the night outside a fuel station to fill his tank.

""From 23:00 Friday until 07:00 today I was waiting in my car at a fuel station,"" he said.

Most petrol stations were receiving less than their alloted quotas of petrol and diesel, with attendants often keeping the outlets shut once they sold their stock.

Farmers too complained that they were unable to transport their products to market as hundreds of trucks had been grounded.

""My entire crop of tomatoes is destroyed,"" said Ali Khider, a farmer from the state of Jazira.

""For a week now I have been unable to transport it to the main market because there is no vehicle.""

Officials promised a quick end to the crisis, saying it was caused by a delay in maintenance work at the country's main refinery north of Khartoum.

But an acute shortage of foreign currency has also aggravated the situation.

""There are some oil tankers waiting at Port Sudan to be unloaded but there's a delay in paying them,"" Minister of State for Oil Saadeddin Bushra told lawmakers this week.

The crisis comes amid surging inflation that has triggered sporadic anti-government protests in Khartoum and other towns.

Sudan's overall economy has been hit hard, particularly after the south separated from the north in 2011, taking with it about 75% of the country's overall oil revenues.

• In Central Darfur, North Jebel Marra locality, a joint government and interagency assessment mission including UNICEF was conducted in seven villages. The estimated total population in the locality is 264,000, 60 per cent of whom are women and children. Significant needs have been identified and preparation for an integrated response plan is ongoing.

• The State Ministry of Health in Central Darfur, and Water and Environmental Sanitation project (WES) together with health and WASH partners, have developed a six-month (9 Feb – 31 Aug, 2018) integrated health and WASH response plan to address the current and ongoing outbreak and better prepare for future outbreaks.

• UNICEF supported the transportation of 1,110 children to attend their basic education grade eight exams, a test to transit from primary to secondary education, in East and South Jebel Marra

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

In Central Darfur, a joint government, UN and NGOs assessment mission with UNICEF participation was conducted in Rokero town and six other villages in North Jebel Marra locality between 14 and 21 February 2018. The assessment covered an area inhabited by residents, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees from Sortony, Tawila and El-Fasher. An estimated 60 per cent of the population are women and children. Only 37 per cent of health facilities (9 out of 24) are functioning, out of which only four were providing integrated treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). In the assessed areas, only four out of seven health facilities provide nutritional services and the remaining health facilities only deliver health services, with malnourished cases either referred to the far distant North Darfur or Rokero. Also, only 25 per cent of households (HH) have latrines, and only two health facilities have incinerators. The available schools in the area are poorly constructed, using local materials, and it was observed that around 85 per cent of children are out of school in the villages covered by the assessment. Five out of seven communities reported cases of violence against children and issues regarding child labour and abduction. UNICEF, together with partners, is working on the preparation of an integrated response plan that will cover, among others, the Child Protection, Education, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions.

Since the start of 2018, the deteriorating economic situation in Sudan continues to impact on the population especially the most vulnerable, including 2.6 million children in need of humanitarian assistance. An inter-agency assessment to identify the effect on the most vulnerable population is ongoing. Also, UNICEF Sudan office has requested technical support from a social policy specialist in the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office to help with analysing the potential impact of the crisis on the Sudanese population, particularly children in a more comprehensive and integrated way, in addition to other relevant areas of support.","UNICEF Sudan Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/unicef-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018

Despite the continued conflict in South Sudan, accountability for human rights violations can be initiated drawing on the recent UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan investigative report.

An air of impunity pervades the conflict in South Sudan, which shows no sign of ending while the humanitarian costs continue to mount. To counter this perception, observers should keep in mind that the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan announced in February that it had collected enough evidence to hold more than 40 South Sudanese officials accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Drawing from events in four of South Sudan’s original 10 states (Western Bahr el Ghazal, Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, and Upper Nile) from 2016 and 2017, the report found egregious violations of human rights, humanitarian law, and international criminal law committed primarily by government forces and its affiliated militia, but also by armed opposition.

The Commission’s conclusion that war crimes and crimes against humanity are still occurring affirms earlier findings by the Commission, UN Mission in South Sudan (2014), the African Union (2015), the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2015), and several nongovernmental organizations. The report contains harrowing stories of crimes including:

Killing of civilians

Sexual violence including rapes of men and women, gang rape, castration, forced nudity, and genital mutilation

Pillaging and destruction of property

Forced displacement

Denial of due process

Censoring of speech and media

Attacks on humanitarian workers including killing, harassment, and looting; in 2017, 30 aid workers were killed

The searing brutality of these decidedly ethnically targeted crimes leaves little to the imagination. For instance, the Commission recounts through the words of a surviving son, the story of a woman whose eyes were gouged out by SPLA soldiers with a spear when she sought to protect her 17-year-old daughter from being gang raped. After being blinded, she was gang raped by 17 soldiers. Her husband was then castrated, his genitals were mutilated, and then he was beheaded.

The Commission identifies, for the first time, individuals suspected of planning, ordering, facilitating, and abetting international crimes and human rights violations. In particular, the report adopts command responsibility as a legal framework for establishing the criminal responsibility of military and political leaders. This framework is used to apportion responsibility to individuals named in a confidential list submitted to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to be maintained pending legal action. This list will be transmitted to the prosecutor of the hybrid court for South Sudan once he or she is appointed. The resolution that authorized the Commission allows individual states to access preserved evidence should they wish to prosecute individuals in their national courts.

The report findings highlight that the conflict is marked by a progressive deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Tens of thousands of people were dislodged—repeatedly in some cases—by the counterinsurgency operations launched by the SPLA and affiliated militia in each of the four areas assessed. According to the Commission, the number of people displaced has passed 2.4 million refugees and 1.9 million internally displaced. Of these, over 1 million have taken refuge in Uganda alone.

Humanitarian agencies reported systematic impediments to access that have exacerbated food insecurity, resulting in some deaths by starvation. Barriers to access include exorbitant work visa fees, denial of permits to access areas of need, bureaucratic obfuscation, roadblocks, looting of supplies and facilities, and the killing and harassment of aid workers. There were 1,159 humanitarian access incidents in 2017 alone. Forty-seven percent of these involved violence. According to the Commission, humanitarian aid has become a “political football,” with multiple sides in the fragmented conflict seeking to manipulate distribution of assistance in favor of certain communities or toward themselves.

Action Points

The Commission’s report demonstrates that the peace agreement signed in 2015 has failed to end egregious abuses and create conditions that allow the implementation of measures to return the country to normalcy. To protect civilians and humanitarian workers from continuing intimidation, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) has called for adherence to the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians, and Humanitarian Access signed by the parties on December 21, 2017.

Ceasing attacks on humanitarian workers by all parties is imperative and should be backed up by punitive measures in case of violations. The Terrain Hotel trial involving the prosecution in a military court of 12 soldiers who had gang raped several foreign aid workers and killed John Gatluak, a Nuer journalist, in July 2016 is instructive in this regard. The case was brought to trial after strong international pressure compelled the Government of South Sudan (GOSS) to take action. The case shows that even in a context of limited capacity to pursue justice domestically, ways can be found to hold trials for egregious crimes committed during the course of the conflict. It also demonstrates the importance of external pressure to facilitate domestic action to ensure accountability for abuses.

A future hybrid court should prioritize investigation and prosecution of war crimes against the humanitarian sector, including the killings of 97 aid workers since the fighting began in 2013. The GOSS should also facilitate the delivery of assistance by eliminating permit fees and removing bureaucratic red tape and other impediments to access.

Attacks on the humanitarian sector have taken place in a context of increased intimidation of civil society and the media through murder, detention, and dismissals. Some of the abuses documented in a recent UNMISS-OHCHR report include censorship of articles, confiscation of newspapers, closure of media houses, and blocking of websites. The GOSS intelligence organization, the National Security Services, is responsible for more abuses than any other institution, committing 33 percent of incidents. Other institutions cited are the police, SPLA, local officials, and the South Sudan Media Authority.

Given the government’s continued perpetuation of these actions, the process of establishing the proposed hybrid court should be accelerated. The AU should consider appointing the prosecutor prior to the signing of the memorandum of understanding envisaged in the peace agreement between the AU and GOSS. Juba should fast track national legislation that affirms cooperation between the hybrid court and the GOSS, including with regard to access to witnesses, review of documents in the custody of the government, and sites of burials, among other issues. Should the AU’s Peace and Security Council’s calls for the adoption of national legislation fail to elicit a response, and if the prosecutor is unable to proceed for lack of cooperation, consideration should be given to establishing an UN-backed ad hoc international tribunal or triggering the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

The GOSS has also delayed establishing the Commission on Truth, Reconciliation, and Healing and the Reparations Authority provided for in the 2015 peace agreement. Accordingly, donor support for civil society efforts to document violations and crimes should be enhanced.

In the face of the continuing GOSS obfuscation, despite the serious criminal allegations and deteriorating humanitarian conditions, the international community, primarily consisting of the UN, AU, and Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, must exert maximum leverage—diplomatic, political, and military—to precipitate remedial action on human rights, humanitarian access, and justice. The GOSS’s active suppression of these tenets of the rule of law, as documented by the Commission’s assessment, compels regional actors to enforce sanctions adopted by the UN, EU, and bilaterally to exert pressure on political and military decisionmakers in South Sudan to change course.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

South Sudan’s conflict continued unabated through its fourth year, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of a crisis marked by displacement, hunger and disease. Major offensives in Jonglei and Upper Nile forced tens of thousands of people to flee fighting in Wau Shilluk, Tonga, Maiwut and Pagak. In Unity, Koch and Mayendit saw intensified clashes. The Equatorias were hardest hit by conflict, with Yei, Lainya, Wonduruba, Kajo-keji, Magwi and Torit among the most affected locations.

Increased displacement

By year end, 4.3 million people, one in three South Sudanese, had been uprooted, including 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. Around 85 per cent are women and children. Nearly 700,000 people left South Sudan. As conflict intensified in the Equatorias, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reached one million by August.

Continuing economic decline

The cost of living escalated throughout the year, with effects most acute in urban areas. Annual inflation in Juba exceeded 180 per cent, as the local currency depreciated to record lows against the US dollar. Fuel shortages worsened, and the payment of salaries for public sector employees was disrupted.

Unprecedented hunger

Food insecurity and malnutrition escalated. In February famine was declared in Unity, with some 100,000 people facing starvation. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), by September a record 6 million people across the country were severely food insecure. While famine was alleviated through the coordinated response, at year end the outlook for 2018 was for worsening food insecurity and malnutrition.

Worsening health crisis

Conflict and economic hardship continued to undermine the delivery of basic health services, weakening people’s ability to cope with illness. Diseases such as cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis and kalaazar continued to spread. Over 20,000 cases of cholera were reported, with 436 related fatalities, in the country’s longest ever outbreak that started in 2016. Only an estimated 22 per cent of health facilities remained fully operational, as a result of the destruction of infrastructure, attacks on health workers and shortages of supplies and skilled personnel.

Unchecked rights violations

Violence and rights violations were ubiquitous and largely unconstrained. Gender-based violence (GBV), was pervasive although widely unreported as a result of stigma and fear. Daily tasks for subsistence, such as collecting water and firewood, placed women and girls at risk. Other vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities faced the worst consequences of the conflict and lack of basic services.

Children increasingly at risk

Reported incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other serious violations affecting children surpassed 100,000 since the start of the conflict. The number of children recruited into armed groups surpassed 19,000, and the number of registered cases of unaccompanied, separated or missing children topped 16,000. Damage and destruction to schools and the absence of teachers continued to undermine access to education, with a record number of children – more than 2 million – out of school.

Refugees hosted in South Sudan

By the end of 2017 some 279,000 refugees were being hosted, many from Sudan, located mainly in the north of the country, and others from Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, located mainly in the south of the country. Refugees were exposed to violence in conflict affected areas, limiting access to basic services and constraining livelihood options. The number of people seeking refuge in South Sudan was expected to increase to more than 300,000 in 2018.

Insecurity and humanitarian access

Thirty aid workers were killed in 2017, the deadliest year for aid workers in South Sudan on record. At least 1,159 humanitarian access-related incidents were reported, the most incidents tracked in a year to date and a significant increase over 2016 (908 incidents reported) and 2015 (909 incidents reported). Active hostilities impacted humanitarian operations, with 612 aid workers relocated from different areas across the country in 54 separate incidents. Operational interference and bureaucratic impediments persistently challenged humanitarian operations.

Rigorously prioritised and coordinated response

Despite these challenges, more than 5.4 million people were assisted under the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), including over 5.1 million people who received food assistance; 2.8 million people who were vaccinated against communicable diseases; 2.8 million people who were helped with access to clean water; and 930,000 people who received vital non-food items. Around 950,000 children and pregnant and lactating women were treated for acute malnutrition; and 420,000 children facing crisis were supported with access to education.

The 2017 HRP was 73 per cent funded, with US$1.2 billion secured. Logistics, Food Security and Livelihoods, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, and Nutrition secured higher coverage of their requirements. Other clusters secured less than half of their requirements, including Coordination and Common Services, Education, Health, Emergency Shelter and Non-food Items, Protection and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.",South Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
12,sudan,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Sudan witnessed keen improvements in security conditions in 2017, and limited new internal displacement, as compared with 2016. However, an increase in the number of South Sudanese refugees arriving in Sudan, in addition to disease outbreaks, and long-term food insecurity and malnutrition contributed to increasing the humanitarian caseload.

Estimates by the Government of Sudan show 386,000 people returned voluntarily to areas of origin, in 2017, either from refugee communities in neighbouring countries, or from internal displacement camps. On the refugee front, at least 195,000 people arrived in Sudan in 2017, many fleeing the conflict in South Sudan. Another 200,000 people are expected to arrive throughout 2018.

This movement foreshadows what is predicted for 2018, and already caused shifts in the humanitarian landscape. The cessation of hostilities in Darfur, and between Government forces and rebel movements in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, allowed humanitarians to reach hundreds of communities, many of whom had lain for years outside reach. Both this access and easier obtainment of travel permits and procedures for humanitarian workers was the product of painstaking negotiations between the Government and the United Nations. To this end, new government directives launched in late 2016 set the tone in 2017 for daily improvements in the relationship between Government and implementing partners.

In this partially transformed humanitarian backdrop, partners worked to align humanitarian assistance and resilience, selfreliance and prevention activities, essential building blocks in building the capacity of the most vulnerable to resist shocks such as conflict, drought, floods, health crises, and economic hardship.

Despite the positive security developments, humanitarian conditions suffered the dramatic effects of the Government of Sudan’s structural adjustment reform, and the steep devaluation of the Sudanese pound. Combined with drought conditions, rampant inflation triggered by currency devaluation caused the price of grain to double, tipping another 1.5 million people into severe food insecurity in at least three states covered by humanitarian aid – Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur.

On a related but separate note, malnutrition continued to afflict millions of children across Sudan. Humanitarian partners reached 1.4 million children under five with Vitamin A supplementation, integrated with immunization services. Another 377,657 children with severe acute malnutrition had access to treatment services and programmes. Successful forays in treating malnutrition as a cross-cutting issue served to influence humanitarian partners to work together to gain efficiency in programme-delivery for improved results.

BASIC HEALTH PROVISION AND DISEASE OUTBREAK

On the health front, 824 people died and thousands more suffered from Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), a water-borne disease closely associated to cholera. Fully preventable, AWD occurs because of poor hygiene and lack of basic sanitation. Although 1.7 million people were provided access to sufficient drinking water, and 520,000 with access to adequate sanitation, in 2017, 12 per cent of Sudan’s population continued to practice open air defecation, contributing to the AWD problem.

On a more positive note, at least 78 per cent of all children born in Sudan were delivered with support from a trained midwife. In this regard, SHF funds were instrumental in providing power to health clinics and posts in Darfur, contributing to an environment for safe deliveries.

LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT AND LIVELIHOODS

The scale and long-term nature of displacement, especially in Darfur, has caused an unprecedented loss of livelihoods for millions. In 2017, a push towards voluntary returns to areas of origin exposed both the displaced and host communities to competition for scarce resources, leading to further economic hardship and uncertainty about the future.

As the war in Darfur recedes, millions of people in displacement camps began to show signs of restlessness, resulting in a marked increase in cases of inter-communal violence and petty crime both in camps and in host communities.

In many parts of Darfur, inter-communal conflict is a large cause of insecurity, and has reportedly kept IDPs from returning to areas of origin. Localised armed violence in many cases replaced the formerly warring militias. Such localised armed violence, which takes place most frequently between sedentary farmers and pastoral communities, and the many nomadic communities remained only partially resolved with the establishment of several animal migration corridors for the benefit of pastoralist communities, and to preserve agricultural fields.

Of additional concern, many of the displaced return to lands which had been occupied in their absence by other communities, militias or agri-businesses. Addressing the issue of land tenure and the management of resources will be pivotal in consolidating peace and in providing an exit strategy from Sudan’s protracted humanitarian crises to one of nation-building and economic development.",Sudan Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
13,sudan,"Sudan — The severe fuel shortage that is impacting transport, agriculture, utilities, services, and commodity prices across Sudan, continues to cause disruptions in several states.

The disruption of Sudani internet network in Abu Jubeiha in South Kordofan has prevented any financial transactions by banks since Sunday.

Banks closed

A bank employee told Radio Dabanga that as a result of the disruption, the banks in Abu Jubeiha have been suspended from Sunday until Tuesday.

He said that the stalling of the financial transactions of banks has affected all commercial activity in the town.

Water shortage

Sodari in North Kordofan and border towns in North and West Kordofan have been suffering from severe thirst as a result of a lack of the shut-down of the water pumping engines since the beginning of the fuel crisis a month ago.

The price of a gallon of petrol has amounted to SDG 600 (*$21.30) and a gallon of diesel SDG 300 ($10.66)

Mohamed Teirab of the leadership of the Sudanese Congress Party told Radio Dabanga from Sodari that ""The water crisis has intensified in those areas two weeks ago where thirst caused death of livestock, especially sheep amid occurrence of severe conflicts at the water resources.

The price of a barrel of water has amounted to SDG 40 ($1.42) in Abu Zabad in West Kordofan.

Power cuts

The electricity supply has been reduced to two hours instead of five hours due to lack of fuel.

The fuel crisis caused shortages of medicines in various localities in El Gedaref state.

Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that medicine vehicles and medical supplies were unable to provide the women of the locality with medicines due to lack of fuel for a week.

They warned that the health situation in the localities would worsen in the event the medicine crisis persists.

They reported the long lines of vehicles in front of fuel stations on Tuesday.

Kassala

In Kassala, the authorities' decision not to provide fuel for travel buses until the passengers get on board has led to exacerbation of the suffering of the passengers.

Residents from Kassala have complained to Radio Dabanga that they had been delayed in the bus trip to Aroma and asked the authorities to immediately cancel the decision.

Ed Damazin

The southern and northern districts of Ed Damazin have seen a severe drinking water crisis as a result of the non-operation of some water stations in the town due to lack of fuel.

Residents told Radio Dabanga that the northern districts of Arkawit, Banat, El Nasir and El Hijra and El Zuhour in southern Ed Damazin have been suffering from severe thirst for two weeks due to lack of fuel which caused disruption of some water pumps.

Residents of Aroma in eastern Sudan have complained of three days of power cuts and the continued fuel crisis.

Ahmed Dirar said in an interview with Radio Dabanga that the continuous interruption of electricity and the lack of fuel have led to complete paralysis in the city.

Ali El Atta, a member of the National Assembly, said the diesel crisis has led to serious losses to farmers in the garden sector in Kassala state amounting to SDG 11 billion (*$390 million).

He added that the total cultivated area is about 10,000 acres, including 7,000 acres of fodder, and 3,000 acres of vegetables.

He said the garden sector needs additional quantities to ensure continued productivity.

Press ban

The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) has forbidden newspapers in Sudan from publishing any material related to the fuel crisis.

The NISS ban includes writing about protests and demonstrations or ""negatively writing about goods"".

In a directive to the editors of newspapers, the NISS called on them not to cover the crisis, but ""to be satisfied with the official statements issued by the government on these topics"".

Aid worker deaths amid insecurity and increasing needs

Three aid workers killed in renewed conflict in Unity

Three national aid workers were killed in April, following renewed fighting in multiple locations of Unity. The aid workers were killed in separate incidents in Rubkona, Mayendit and Leer counties. On 7 April, armed men shot at an NGO vehicle, clearly marked with the Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) logos, while transporting five aid workers along Nhialdiu-Bentiu road. One national staff working for Hope Restoration, a national NGO was killed in the attack. A day later, a health worker was shot dead while fleeing inter-communal clashes near a national NGO health facility, in Lual village, Mayendit County. Later in the month, a third aid worker was shot and killed while returning to check on a health clinic that had been looted in Leer County.

The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, strongly condemned the attacks.

“Aid workers risk their lives every day to provide life-saving assistance to people in need in South Sudan. I strongly condemn the targeting of aid workers and demand that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice,” said Mr. Noudehou. “Our deepest condolences go to the families of the victims and the affected organisations,” he added.

At least 100 aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict in December 2013; the majority being South Sudanese nationals.

Partners suspend operations as insecurity intensifies

Armed clashes between government and opposition forces erupted from 14 to 18 April in Jazeera, Ding-Ding, (Rubkona County), Koch town (Koch County) and Nimni (Guit County), forcing a number of aid workers to suspend their operations.

A team of aid workers that was drilling boreholes in Ding-Ding was forced to suspend their activities due to insecurity. Fighting in Koch town saw the relocation of nine aid workers from two aid agencies. Hundreds of civilians were reportedly displaced.

On 18 April, a national NGO staff was shot and injured in crossfire in Nimni, while hundreds of civilians fled their homes for safety. Clashes were also reported in Koch town, Koch County, Dablual, Rubkuai and Thaker in Mayendit County, from 18 to 25 April, forcing the relocation of 44 aid workers from multiple agencies back to Bentiu town, Juba and Rumbek. Health, education, nutrition and water, sanitation and health (WASH) activities benefiting thousands of people were disrupted. An unknown number of houses have been burnt to the ground, creating enormous challenges for return and reintegration.

Aid workers released after three weeks in detention

Seven national staff members from South Sudan Health Association’ (SSUHA) - a national NGO, were released on 15 March after being detained by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-iO) forces for 20 days. The aid workers were taken captive on 25 March while on mission from Kupera County to Lainya County, to deliver supplies to health centres serving thousands of people in need in Koyoki, Kupera, Limuro and Wuji areas. The aid workers were in good health when they were handed over to a humanitarian partner. Three agency vehicles that had been confiscated and temporarily used by the authorities were returned to the organisation.

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Alain Noudehou, called for the immediate and unconditional release of the aid workers and strongly urged all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the delivery of aid. He asserted that free, safe and unhindered access is essential to reach the millions of South Sudanese people in need.

This is a reminder of the dangers that humanitarian workers face in delivering assistance every day. Aid worker security in Africa’s youngest nation remains a key concern, with humanitarians constantly being harassed, intimidated, beaten and killed.

Ten aid workers missing near Yei

Ten aid workers have gone missing near Yei town, the capital of Yei River State, in Central Equatorial region. Their convoy was headed to Tore Payam from Yei town on 25 April to conduct a humanitarian needs assessment. Their whereabouts and well-being remained unknown as of 30 April.

In a statement issued on 26 April, Mr. Noudehou demanded their immediate release without preconditions.

“We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being, said Mr Noudehou. “These individuals, UN and NGO staff are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.”

The missing national staff include one from UNOCHA, two from UNICEF, two from the Association of Christian Resources Serving Sudan, one from Action Africa Help, three from Plan International and one from South Sudanese Development Organization. “I firmly condemn the latest attack against colleagues engaged in emergency humanitarian assistance in Central Equatoria and call on all parties to the conflict in South Sudan to ensure a safe and secure environment, conductive to the delivery of assistance,’ said Mr. Noudehou.

AWD cases reported only in Central Darfur during March

While all the other 17 States in Sudan—where AWD was reported before—continued to report zero cases in the past three months, during March, new cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) were reported in Central Darfur State. This was reported in the latest AWD update issued by Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) this week. Between 1 March and 3 April 2018, 151 cases of AWD were reported in Central Darfur, with no AWD-related deaths. The total number of new AWD cases reported from Central Darfur from February to March is 468, with almost all cases reported from 63 inaccessible villages in West Jebel Marra locality.

The incidence of AWD outbreak in Sudan started on 17 August 2016 in Kassala State and by May 2017 had spread to 10 states, expanding by August 2017 to all 18 of Sudan’s states. So far, the disease has claimed 823 deaths (case fatality rate of 2.23 per cent) resulting from 37,000 cases (attack rate – 10,09 per 10,000). It has also affected all demographic groups, with females constituting 59 per cent and children below 5 years of age accounting for 15 per cent of all reported cases.

To eliminate the transmission of AWD, response activities must continue until four-week consecutive zero reporting is in place nationwide, in all localities. WHO and FMoH have proposed an in-depth evaluation of AWD response and risk assessment to refine and re-strategize control efforts in early 2018.

After assessing the situation in all 18 states, 17 localities from nine states have been identified for an Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) campaign, targeting refugees and host communities. Vaccination will be carried out during 2018-2019.",Sudan: Humanitarian Bulletin | Issue 08 | 16 – 29 April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-08-16-29-april-2018
