Plunging oil production in Venezuela is causing a national economic and humanitarian crisis that could tip the global oil market “decisively into deficit,” according to a report published Thursday.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro is clinging to the hope that his oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, will help deliver “everything out country needs” — despite critics claiming the experiment is doomed to fail.

At the same time he appears to be ignoring warning signs about the country’s oil production.

""Within the OPEC countries, the biggest risk factor is, and will likely remain, Venezuela,"" the International Energy Agency said in its closely-watched monthly report.

Oil production in Venezuela has plummeted in the last two years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration claiming production is 300,000 barrels a day less than in 2017.

OPEC cut back oil production in recent years to boost the price of oil after 2014 collapse, but now the unplanned drop in Venezuela’s oil production could cause a shortage of oil.

""Without any compensatory change from other producers it is possible that the Latin American country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit,"" the report said.

Venezuela has suffered hyperinflation following the 2014 collapse of oil prices, leaving the government, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserve, unable to subsidize imports and struggling to pay its foreign debt.

The IMF projects that inflation will reach 13,000 percent this year.

On the ground, citizens are struggling to buy basic food and supplies, while the country’s minimum wage has been increased 21 times since Maduro took charge in 2013 — most recently on March 1.

And things are likely to get worse for Maduro and Venezuela if the U.S. Senate confirms Mike Pompeo as Rex Tillerson’s replacement at the State Department.

“Pompeo will likely align with more hawkish voices in the administration calling for stepped-up sanctions, including those that would further restrict Venezuela's ability to export crude and further curtail the regime's revenue,” Helima Croft from RBC Capital Markets told Axios.

Despite the worsening crisis, Maduro has continued to boast about the petro, which he believes will help the country circumvent crippling international sanctions.

He told the members of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela last week that the money raised from the sale of the petro would form part of a wider “economic solution” and would strengthen the country's “monetary sovereignty, to make financial transactions and overcome the financial blockade.”

Maduro claimed Wednesday the pre-sale of the digital coin had been a huge success, raising $5 billion from 83,000 investors in 127 countries. However, there is no proof this is true.

A report from the Brookings think tank hammered the petro project, saying it would likely fail and in doing so would harm the legitimate use of cryptocurrencies in general, contributing “to the idea that cryptocurrencies facilitate fraud.” It also said that if successful the petro could spur other countries to follow suit.

“Other countries may feel emboldened to act more aggressively if economic sanctions can be thwarted through cryptocurrency sales.”

The Treasury has already warned U.S. investors that buying the petro would violate sanctions. This week Florida Senator Bill Nelson sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanding to know what the department was doing to prevent Maduro from raising funds via the petro — and whether it needs new power to counter cryptocurrencies being used in this way.

SAN JOSÉ DE LA COSTA, Venezuela — The last time Génesis Vasquez heard her husband’s voice, he was about to board a small wooden boat sailing from Venezuela to the nearby island of Curaçao. Unable to find permanent work in Venezuela and struggling to provide for his family, Jóvito Gutiérrez Yance hoped to find new opportunities abroad.

“Pray for me and light a candle,” he told Génesis before bidding her goodbye and joining 30 other passengers crowded aboard the fragile vessel. They left the port of San José de la Costa just before dawn.

The boat never made it to Curaçao. It capsized close to the island’s southeastern coastline on January 10. Search and rescue operations led mainly by the Curaçaoan authorities were hampered because the Venezuelan government had ordered a temporary shutdown of air and maritime traffic with Curaçao and two neighboring islands a few days before. Rescue teams recovered only five bodies. The rest, including Jóvito, are still missing.

“He went for us, for our dreams,” Génesis said on a stiflingly hot day at their home in northwestern Venezuela. The couple could not afford to have the children they wanted, she explained. Now all Génesis can do is wait for news, her dreams of a family shattered.

Venezuela is in the grip of a human rights crisis that has forced people to make a desperate and hazardous 60-mile journey to Curaçao, a Dutch-Caribbean island, in search of safety and subsistence. Many are fleeing political persecution following a government crackdown on dissent that has led to the deaths of at least 120 protestors.

Some are leaving because they can no longer feed their families due to hyperinflation and chronic food shortages. Others have left in search of functioning health care and medicines that are no longer available in Venezuela. The shipwreck in January was a sign of just how desperate things have become.

Jóvito’s wife is now stuck in tortuous limbo without news from her husband. Meanwhile, the parents of 18-year-old Jeanaury Jiménez, whose body was recovered after the ship sank, are trying to balance their grief with worries about the future.

Jeanaury had been deported from Curaçao once before, and she promised her parents she would never repeat the risky voyage. But when her twin sisters were born prematurely, the family struggled to feed them. Jeanaury decided to return to Curaçao in the hope of finding work.

Days after Jeanaury’s body was found, her mother paced the family home in the coastal town of La Vela de Coro with the baby twins in her arms. She cannot find milk or formula for them. Their father stares at the floor as he explains that his truck driver’s salary is no longer enough to cover the family’s needs. Photos of Jeanaury hang on the living room walls.

While families like Jeanaury’s wonder where their next meal will come from, routes out of Venezuela have grown increasingly inaccessible. The cost of a flight or even land travel is too expensive for most people, while the intermittent closure of borders has led to the emergence of dangerous clandestine routes controlled by smugglers. Women, children, adolescents and indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable to health and security concerns.

Many neighboring countries lack asylum systems to support Venezuelans when they arrive, and a number have tightened immigration controls on Venezuelans in recent years. In 2016, Curaçao Governor Lucille George-Wout made an inflammatory speech alleging “almost all the arriving persons are exclusively from the areas of delinquency, illegal job[s] and prostitution.”

People continue to leave, willing to risk discrimination and the dangerous voyage for a shot at a safer existence. Since 2014, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, at least 145,000 people from Venezuela applied for asylum abroad. Another 444,000 have applied for arrangements outside the asylum system that would allow them to live and work in a different country for an extended period of time.

The Razz family, from La Vela de Coro on Venezuela’s northwestern coast, knows better than most how dangerous the journey out of the country can be. Normelys, 34, lost her husband Danny in the fatal sinking on January 10. Her younger sister Nereida is still waiting for news from her husband, Oliver, who is missing. Both men were traveling to Curaçao in search of work, and the double tragedy has left the family in even more precarious circumstances.

Normelys remembered her last phone call with her husband Danny before he set sail. “He said to me: ‘Tell my daughters that I love them; where I’m going, I’ll be fine. Don’t be sad,’” she said. “His voice was that of someone saying goodbye.”

It is common for those who do make it to Curaçao to be arrested and deported and to make repeat attempts to get there again. Danny had been to Curaçao twice before and had even saved enough money to open a moto-taxi business back in Venezuela but ongoing financial problems drove him to flee for the island again.

A third Razz sister, Neyra, spent two months living on the island without papers in 2017. She would occasionally clean houses for money, but police raids were a constant worry. Eventually she was arrested, detained for two weeks and sent back to Venezuela.

Like many people, Neyra had gone to Curaçao in the hope of buying staples like food and medicine that are no longer available in Venezuela. She quickly found that things weren’t so easy for those without valid travel documents.

“My life there was horrible,” Neyra said. “I wanted to bring back medicine, food, but they don’t let you buy medicine even with a medical record. You feel totally powerless.”

Venezuela has ignored international calls to address the causes of the human rights crisis that’s forcing people to leave and has refused to accept international cooperation to guarantee access to food and medicines. Instead, the government is doubling down on repressive measures, making life unbearable for those who stay.

The Venezuelan state has an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all Venezuelans, while the international community must provide Venezuela with the support to do so.

Neighboring countries share a responsibility to come up with regional solutions. Indeed, The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has called on states to implement mechanisms for the protection and humane treatment of migrants and refugees. Peru, Brazil and Colombia have taken some steps toward this but much more needs to be done to prevent further tragedies.

Two months on from the shipwreck, the families of those who are still missing are urging the Venezuelan and Curaçaoan authorities to keep searching for them and to carry out DNA testing on bodies that have yet to be identified. They say their pleas have been met with silence.

“Venezuela is not okay,” Nereida Razz said. There has still been no news of her husband. But bereaved as she is, Nereida understands why Oliver had to leave.

“He left in search of something better, because living this way breaks your heart.”

2,venezuela,"Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis is now a crisis in next-door Colombia. Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing their country’s economic collapse each day, and pressure is mounting to help them. The diaspora here in South Florida is making an especially strong call.

Former Venezuelan Senator and opposition leader Pablo Medina just arrived in Miami after touring the Venezuelan-Colombian border. Some 600,000 Venezuelans now reside in Colombia, and thousands more keep coming by the day.

They’re escaping the catastrophic food and medicine shortages in Venezuela under the authoritarian socialist regime there. Medina says conditions for those refugees in Colombia is now worsening as well.

“Thousands of Venezuelan women and men knocking on the doors of homes there asking for food,” Medina said at the Arepazo Dos restaurant in Doral on Wednesday. “Hospitals are inundated.”

Medina heads a new expat group called the International Coalition for Venezuela. In Doral, he and other members said they’ve sent a letter to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the U.N. asking for a formal humanitarian crisis declaration for the border refugees - a step that could lead to the construction of better camps for them.

“This letter is important because we need that humanitarian help around the world going to that border zone,” said Miami lawyer Rafael Moros, the Coalition's secretary.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images

José Antonio Abreu, the Venezuelan musician, economist and educator who created the acclaimed network of youth orchestras known as El Sistema, died Saturday at age 78. Abreu's death was announced by El Universal, the Caracas-based newspaper run by his brother Jesus Abreu. The country is observing three days of national mourning.

El Sistema, Abreu's globally lauded ""system,"" with over 300 teaching locations, has taken hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged children in Venezuela under its wing, instructing them in classical music within numerous choirs and orchestras.

The El Sistema approach has been widely copied in Europe and North America and enthusiastically championed by Abreu's most successful protégé, Gustavo Dudamel, the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, who continues to tour the Venezuelan Youth Orchestra worldwide.

""The music and arts have lost one of its brightest figures,"" Dudamel told the Los Angeles Times. ""Maestro Abreu taught us that art is a universal right and that inspiration and beauty irreversibly transform the soul of a child."" Dudamel got his start playing the violin in one of Abreu's youth orchestras, and by age 13 he was the assistant conductor of the local chamber orchestra. At 17 he was made music director of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra.

El Sistema, while separate from the Venezuelan government, has relied on state funding and has not been immune to the country's ongoing political upheaval. In 2017, Dudamel, in an open letter, spoke out against the hard line positions of Nicolás Maduro, saying ""enough is enough."" His letter came one day after reports were published in Venezuela that a young El Sistema violinist named Armando Cañizales was killed in a Caracas street protest. Later, officials cancelled Dudamel's 2017 tour with the Venezuelan Youth Orchestra. ""We are deeply moved by the physical departure ... of Maestro Abreu,"" said Venezuelan President Maduro on state television, Reuters reported.

YouTube

Abreu was born May 7, 1939 in Valera, Venezuela, where he began studying music at age nine, before moving to Caracas. At 25, Abreu was given the titles of master composer and teacher, according to his El Sistema biography. From there, he studied conducting and economics, a career path which afforded him inroads into governmental management, laying the groundwork for the foundation of Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, now known as the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra.

With just a handful of students in an empty parking garage, Abreu began El Sistema in 1975.

""Since I was a boy in my early childhood, I always wanted to be a musician,"" Abreu said in his acceptance speech for the 2009 TED Prize, ""and thank God, I made it. From my teachers, my family, and my community, I had all the necessary support to become a musician. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children would have the same opportunity I had.""

He continued: ""Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right a right for all the people ... To sing and to play together means to intimately coexist.""",https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/03/26/597006488/jos-abreu-venezuelan-conductor-who-envisioned-musical-education-for-all-dead-at

A Colombian church has donated 250,000 wafers to Venezuela's Catholic Church, which has struggled to buy its own because a shortage of flour.

The diocese of the city of Cucuta, which is on the border between the two countries, donated the wafers ahead of Easter celebrations.

The wafer is used to celebrate Holy Communion during Roman Catholic Mass.

In a statement, the Colombian church said the wafers had been handed over on a bridge between the two countries.

Venezuela has been hit hard by an economic crisis and shortages of food and medicine have become common.

This has meant the country's churches have found it difficult to make their own wafers due to a shortage of flour.

In the run-up to Easter, when the wafer is used to celebrate Holy Communion, the Colombian Catholic church said it was its moral duty to help Venezuelans celebrate the festivities.

""It is important to attend to the needs that afflict the faith as a result of this time of border crisis,"" a statement from the diocese said.

""At this time of the week, the central mysteries of the Christian faith can be celebrated.""

VALENCIA, Venezuela -- They died side-by-side when flames tore through an overcrowded police station jail in Venezuela. Many of them are being buried side-by-side, too.

Weeping relatives arrived at the central cemetery in the industrial city of Valencia on Friday carrying the caskets of many of the 68 victims who were killed in the fire to place them in a freshly dug mass tomb.

Cemetery workers said they were prepared to bury at least 32 people two days after the blaze in three-deep graves separated by a layer of cinderblock. Simple white crosses with their handwritten names, dates of birth and shared death date were put around the tomb.

""How am I going to forget seeing my husband burned?"" asked Wilca Gonzalez, 36, whose husband was the first to be placed into the ground Friday. ""How can you forget that?""

The mass burial comes as relatives, human rights advocates and international leaders are pressing Venezuelan officials to provide a full account of what happened and hold those responsible accountable. Aside from confirming the death toll on Twitter, officials have been largely silent and have not yet explained how one of the worst jail fires in the nation's history took place.

""I want to know who is responsible,"" Gonzalez said, though she said she had little hope for justice.

Varying versions of the tense moments leading up to the devastating fire are circulating among relatives and advocates, with some accounts suggesting that the inmates themselves started the blaze in an attempt to escape. At least one family member contends their relative called and claimed that guards were pouring gasoline in the cellblock before the flames began to spread.

Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Nicolas Maduro, said four prosecutors were being assigned to investigate the tragedy and pledged a ""thorough investigation to immediately shed light on the painful events that have put dozens of Venezuelan families in mourning.""

As Venezuela struggles with an economic crisis worse than the Great Depression, advocates say prisoners face especially dire conditions, going hungry in increasingly crowded cells. Inmates also frequently obtain weapons and drugs with the help of corrupt guards. Heavily armed groups control cellblock fiefdoms.

The United Nations' human rights office said Thursday it was ""appalled at the horrific deaths"" and urged Venezuela to quickly address concerns like judicial delays, the excessive use of pre-trial detention and cramped quarters that can lead to riots and violence.

The incident is one of the worst mass casualty events at Venezuelan prisons and jails, but is not the first. A fire at a prison in the western state of Zulia killed more than 100 inmates in 1994. In 2013, 61 people died and over 100 were injured, mostly from bullet wounds, during a riot in Barquisimeto.

An estimated 32,000 detainees are being kept in Venezuelan police stations that are filled far past capacity, according to A Window to Freedom, an advocacy group that monitors conditions at the nation's jails. The jail at the Valencia police station was built to hold 35 detainees, but at the time of the fire some 200 people were believed to be inside.

Despite Venezuelan laws mandating that detainees be held for a maximum of four days after an initial arrest, relatives said many of the Valencia prisoners had been jailed for far longer, waiting to be transferred to larger facilities. Many had been imprisoned on suspicion of relatively minor crimes and had not yet gone before a judge.

The family of Gonzalez's husband, Erickson Zapata, 23, said he was wrongly jailed with several others suspected of robbing a cellphone. They said he should have been detained for no more than 10 days but instead had been in the jail for 10 months. He was kept in the largest part of the facility with 60 people crammed inside, many sleeping on makeshift hammocks from bedsheets.

Gonzalez said the last time her husband called her from inside the jail, he was pleading for help.

""I can't breathe,"" he cried. ""I'm suffocating.""

She identified his body by his crooked left ring finger and his uniquely large front teeth.

On Friday, his father, Jesus Zapata, 42, stood next to his son's casket holding his bible. With three other men, he helped lower the coffin into the ground.

His quiet sob turned into open crying as workers covered the coffin with planks, preparing the grave for the next inmate to be placed on top.

Cúcuta is the principal border point into Colombia with up to 40,000 people passing every day.

One lady who we cross has arrived with acute appendicitis. She has made it just in time.

On the Venezuelan side of the border, crumbling hospitals are at breaking point. Now in its fifth year of recession, the International Monetary Fund forecasts inflation will hit 13,000% in Venezuela by the end of this year.

In middle of 2017, the Red Cross, funded by the EU Humanitarian Aid office, set up a reception facility next to the bridge in a bid to alleviate a crisis it says nobody wants to see or talk about.

Javier Francisco Gonzalez, the country manager from the German Red Cross says: ""The Red Cross has been opening and closing this post every morning and night. As a way to raise our hand and say: 'Something is happening here and we need to draw attention to this'. It's an invisible crisis on both sides.""

Three nurses and a doctor are always on duty in the first aid tent.

Many people come with chronic diseases. They often need simple, cheap, medicine, which is no longer available in Venezuela.

There are also cancer patients desperate to restart treatment, as well as the malnourished.

Juan Carlos Gonzalez, a Red Cross coordinator at the emergency facility says: ""We are providing assistance to a person who fainted. We brought him here and it looks like he is suffering from malnutrition. Every day we treat five to six cases of malnutrition.""

The Red Cross post is located next to the migration office, where over 3,000 migrants queue daily to have their passports stamped. Many have taken days to cross the border.

Getting in touch with their families is a priority.

One man, who was a professional bull-fighter in Venezuela wants to go to Peru with his wife. They are looking for work to send some money home to their three children who they have left in Venezuela.

""The first thing was charging the phone to call our family. We haven't heard from them for four days. (The guards on the Venezuelan side) are charging 10 dollars per person to stamp their passport. If you don't have it the queue lasts for days and days and days. This has to be done for free. You cannot charge for it.""

Faced with this massive influx of migrants, Colombia has called for international help.

The EU's Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Christos Stylianides recently visited Cúcuta.

He announced Europe would be providing 2 million euros to Venezuela and 6 million to Colombia.

Speaking to Euronews the EU Commissioner said: ""For the Colombian authorities it is a huge challenge to deal with this unprecedented situation, because of course they face also their challenges in their country about the reconciliation process and peace process. So, our humanitarian aid is going in both sides, inside Venezuela and inside Colombia. Especially in Venezuela we are trying a lot in order to find ways in particular to provide medicines and to find projects to deal with acute malnutrition.""

Venezuelan families are constantly settling in Cúcuta. Illegal migrants, with no documents, are moving into the city's deprived neighbourhoods.

The Norwegian Refugee Council, with EU Aid, is organising activities for 500 children not in school.

Area Mananger Luz Yadyra Galeano Saavedra says the goal is to get them back into the classroom.

""Children can now have access to the schools, but their right to enroll doesn’t mean they'll be able study. That's because many of these children live irregularly in the country. Their parents have no documents enabling access to any kind of legal right inside Colombia. What does this mean? It means for example that these kids don’t receive any certificate when they finish the school year,"" she says.

Some 4,100 Venezuelan pupils are registered at school in the department of Norte de Santander. Andreina's daughters are among them.The family settled illegally in Cúcuta three years ago. In Venezuela Andreina was a nurse and says she had a normal life. Her daughters and nephew had to wait one year before they could go to school.

""The children are managing to study regularly. Regularly in terms of their documents, but financially it's not normal. It's not easy to maintain three children at school when you are a foreigner without documents. If you manage to get food, how is it possible to buy items, like school uniforms, shoes. That is very difficult,"" she says.

It's estimated that 230,000 illegal migrants live in Cúcuta.

8,venezuela,"Thousands of Venezuelans are pouring out of their crippled nation in one of the biggest migration crises in Latin American history, causing growing alarm in the region and prompting neighboring countries to rush thousands of soldiers to the border.

The massive scale of the exodus is being compared to the flow of Syrians into Western Europe in 2015. And, just as in that crisis, countries overwhelmed by the flood of new arrivals are beginning to bar their doors.

A boy from Venezuela’s indigenous Yukpa community stands at the entrance to the border bridge in Cucuta, Colombia, last month.

“This is a humanitarian crisis,” said Willington Munoz Sierra, regional director of the Scalabrini International Migration Network, a Catholic charity running a shelter in this border city, where desperate Venezuelans are now living in parks and cheap motels or sleeping on sidewalks. “In Venezuela, children are dying. People are starving and being persecuted. What they’re getting from us is a door in the face.”

Nowhere is the crisis more acute than here in Colombia, where 3,000 troops are fanning out across the 1,400-mile border to contain an influx of Venezuelans fleeing a collapsing economy and an increasingly repressive socialist regime. Roughly 250,000 Venezuelan migrants have surged into Colombia since August, with 3,000 a day still arriving.

The sheer numbers have led to a backlash in Colombian cities and towns, prompting the national government last month to suspend the issuance of temporary visas for Venezuelans. Colombian authorities are now launching operations in which dozens of Venezuelans a day are captured and expelled.

Police detain a Venezuelan woman without a valid visa in Cucuta. “I can‘t go back,” the distraught woman told officers.

“Let’s go!” Maj. Jarlinzont Zea barked into his walkie-talkie one recent afternoon, jumping out of a police truck in this city of 650,000. Simultaneously, dozens of Colombian officers and migration officials poured out of vehicles and stormed a park, sending panicked Venezuelans scattering.

One slight young woman, in a black tank top and denim shorts, didn’t move fast enough.

“What’s your name?” an officer demanded.

“Andie,” she said, quaking.

“Papers,” insisted the officer.

“I don’t have any.”

“Where are you from?”

“Venezuela,” she said, near tears. “Please. I — can’t. I can’t go back.”

‘I cannot feed my children’

Latin America has seen mass exoduses before. In the decades after Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, about 1.4 million Cubans fled the island, many heading for the United States, where they transformed the social and ethnic fabric of Miami. During the 1980s and 1990s, more than 1 million people — more than a quarter of the population — were displaced during El Salvador’s civil war.

Yet there is little precedent in the region for the speed and intensity of the Venezuelan migrant crisis.

After the leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez became president in 1999, thousands of Venezuelans — especially from the upper classes — moved out of the country. But the current exodus is far more dramatic.

Under Chávez’s handpicked successor, President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has reached a breaking point, with lower oil prices and economic mismanagement leading to the world’s highest inflation rate and spiraling indexes of poverty and malnutrition. At the same time, Maduro’s government has jailed and allegedly tortured opponents, sparking a wave of political asylum seekers.

Nearly 1 million Venezuelans have left their country over the past two years, according to the International Organization for Migration, with experts citing a surge during the second half of 2017, when the economy took a sharp turn for the worse. That figure is in addition to the hundreds of thousands who departed between 1999 and 2015.

“Our migration levels are now comparable to Syria or to [the Rohingya going to] Bangladesh,” said Tomás Páez, an immigration expert at the Central University of Venezuela. More than 1 million Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and others fleeing war and poverty poured into Europe in 2015, and 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have recently fled persecution in Burma, seeking refuge in Bangladesh.

Globally, the growing Venezuelan diaspora is reshaping cities from Miami to Buenos Aires to Madrid. But most Venezuelan migrants are staying in Latin America, where countries are handling a dire situation in different ways.

Peru, for instance, is offering temporary resident permits to Venezuelans, granting them the right to work. Last year, nearly 149,000 Venezuelans entered the country, up from 40,000 in 2016, according to Peruvian government statistics.

“We’re going to Peru because I cannot feed my children in Venezuela,” said Liuiben De Navarro, a 28-year-old Venezuelan seamstress who, on a recent morning, crossed the Colombian border at dawn with her two young children.

She and a host of other Venezuelans — army deserters, laborers, nurses — arrived to a barrage of offers from vendors peddling trips on rickety buses to cities such as Quito, Lima and Santiago. A few feet away, desperate Venezuelans sold scrap metal to Colombian junk merchants. “We buy hair!” yelled another Colombian merchant as a young Venezuelan woman sat in a chair under a tree, blushing as the scissors cut her long locks, destined to become a wig.

“I love my country,” De Navarro said. “But we cannot get food.”

In Brazil, President Michel Temer declared a state of emergency after a visit to his country’s border with Venezuela last month and pledged $20 million plus a new field hospital to ease the crisis. Four shelters on Brazil’s border are now packed with Venezuelans, officials say, with an estimated 40,000 additional Venezuelan migrants residing in Boa Vista, the closest big Brazilian city to the border.

Officials say they will treat the newcomers as Brazilian citizens. But Temer also vowed to double the number of troops at the border.

In October, overwhelmed Panama imposed new visa requirements on Venezuelans, making it far more difficult for economic migrants and asylum seekers to enter the country. In January, 308 Venezuelans were expelled or agreed to return to their countries when faced with deportation. From 2010 to 2016, Panama deported only 196 Venezuelans in total, according to government statistics.

“We’ve been coming here en masse, like people fleeing from a war zone,” said Marcos Ardon, 47, a former business owner in Venezuela now working in a Panama City coffee shop. “You’re on the bus and you hear people speaking with a Venezuelan accent everywhere now. You feel like [Panamanian] people don’t like it, that we’re too many here.”

A border crackdown

Colombians flocked to Venezuela to find work in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Now the job-seekers are Venezuelans heading in the opposite direction.

Venezuelans have enjoyed access to special permits good for two years in Colombia’s border region, allowing them to stay up to seven days at a time. Facing severe food and medical shortages at home, most have stocked up on supplies, or visited hospitals, before returning across the border.

But Colombian officials say those visas became a lure for Venezuelans looking to start a new life — bringing a dramatic surge across the border that reached a peak of 90,000 people a day in December. In early February, President Juan Manuel Santos suspended the issuing of new temporary visas and declared a massive militarization of the border.

The moves cut the daily flow almost in half — though critics say it has only motivated migrants to cross at dozens of illegal entry points along the border, putting them at risk of harm from guerrillas and criminal bands. Locals, meanwhile, are accusing the Venezuelans already here of harming the economy and driving up crime.

“We need to close the border,” said Nancy Pineda, a 30-year-old Cucuta fruit seller. “They come with fruit they buy for nothing in Venezuela and sell for prices here that I can’t compete with. They come here, killing and robbing Colombians. We need take our city back.”

That is just what Colombian authorities say they are doing — staging operations several times a day in which they round up migrants lacking valid visas. Jozef Merkx, representative for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in Colombia, said the agency is concerned about the operations. But because Venezuela is not at war, its people are harder to classify as refugees in need of international protection.

“People fleeing Syria were generally seen as refugees, but that’s not the case with Venezuelans,” Merkx said. “Venezuela is not being bombed. It has some of the dimensions [of a refugee crisis], but not all Venezuelans are refugees.”

‘You have to go’

On a recent morning in Cucuta, however, the scene resembled a refu­gee crisis, with women clutching babies and exhausted families toting old suitcases streaming across a border bridge. The most desperate headed straight to the hospital.

“We don’t know where to turn,” said Jose Urriola, 30, standing next to his 18-month-old daughter, Mavis, who languished in a hospital bed. The family had recently arrived from Venezuela. The little girl was malnourished and also had developed a life-threatening heart blockage. The hospital was petitioning national authorities for funds before proceeding with the costly operation.

Winston Martínez, deputy director of Colombia’s migration agency, said the country was not conducting “mass deportations.” Instead, he said, it was carrying out special operations designed to limit the number of Venezuelans without valid visas. He noted that the government is offering Venezuelans who have passports the chance to apply for special resident visas and has already awarded more than 160,000.

“Like any country, we need to have a safe and secure border,” Martinez said. But many Venezuelans weren’t able to get passports in their homeland because of the cost and long wait.

The operations are sending as many as 100 migrants a day back to Venezuela.

Shortly after Andie, the woman in the black shirt and jean shorts, was detained by police, they loaded her onto a truck. About 15 minutes later, she and three dozen other migrants were released at a border bridge swarming with mosquitoes.

One by one, the migrants walked back toward Venezuela as the Colombian officers watched.

And then only Andie was left.

“You have to go,” said a female officer. More than a dozen Colombian officers surrounded the thin Venezuelan.

“I can’t,” Andie said, her voice breaking. “Please. I’m pregnant, and we won’t survive there.”

The officer paused.

“I’m sorry, honey, but you need to go back.”

Andie nodded, then turned. Sobbing and clutching her stomach, she walked across the bridge.

9,venezuela,"“In this neighbourhood, everyone is like family,” Raquel Zarraga says of the poor barrio of Las Delicias, near the Colombia–Venezuela border.

“We feel comfortable and secure,” she adds, “even when we are living in a room without a door.”

Zarraga, 35, is one of nearly 600,000 Venezuelan migrants officially living in Colombia, though many suspect the true number to be closer to one million. They were driven from their country – once the most prosperous in Latin America – by a downward spiral of hyperinflation, high crime and shortages of essential goods.

“In Venezuela there was unemployment and lack of food,” Zarraga, originally from the north western town of Tinaquillo, tells i. “We had a house and services but ate only one meal a day.”

Displacement crisis

The extreme downturn, blamed by most analysts on the mismanagement of President Nicholas Maduro’s government, has led to the largest displacement crisis in the western hemisphere. Every day, thousands of Venezuelan migrants cross into Colombia, and there are severe concerns for their health and wellbeing.

Unknown numbers live in desperate and isolated conditions, vulnerable to sexual exploitation or forced recruitment by armed groups. In addition, relief workers are increasingly worried about the xenophobia migrants are encountering. Many have faced discrimination at the hands of Colombians who fear for their jobs.

But in finding a home in Las Delicias, Zarraga says she has gained a new family. Situated on the south-western outskirts of Cúcuta, the notorious border city between Colombia and Venezuela, Las Delicias was unrecognised by the government until 2015.

The community – which still lacks basic infrastructure – is home to around 2,500 people, about half of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs). After years of internal conflict, Colombia has one of the highest IDP rates in the world, with many people living on the fringes of society.

In solidarity

But in Las Delicias, the IDP’s shared experience of displacement has led to an extraordinary empathy and solidarity with the 270 newer arrivals from Venezuela.

“When I came to Colombia, I didn’t know anyone,” says Zarraga. “But after I met Graciella, our families shared a room for four months.”

“It’s very sad to see people in the streets with kids and no food to eat. We help with our hearts and our hands.”

Graciella Sanchez, 39, is a long-term Las Delicias resident and an IDP from Colombia’s Caqueta department. She was forced to flee her home in 2007, after she received an anonymous letter telling her that she could no longer sell food to the military from her small restaurant.

“I decided to leave and travel very far away,” she says. “I left everything, my house, my possessions, and came just with my kids. I didn’t know anyone in Cúcuta.”

A decade later, the deepening crisis in Venezuela led to the arrival of migrants like Zarraga and her family.

Local empathy

“It reminds me of my own situation,” Sanchez says. “Many people had to flee in Colombia and abandon everything.”

After the pair met, Sanchez let Zarraga’s family stay for free in her small house.

“We all lived together for four months, 10 or 11 people under the same roof,” she says. Then, Sanchez had her property extended for her friend’s family, where they now sleep.

“I gave her the room because it was the same thing when I was displaced,” Sanchez says.

“I came here alone, with only my kids. I understand what they are living through.”

The cramped living conditions – three mattresses lie on the floor in a bare brick room – are a step down from Zarraga’s former home in Venezuela. In a front room, there is a wheelbarrow of jerry cans – her daughter, Roxana, a 19-year-old former medical student, illicitly sells petrol by the road for a meagre income.

Life without fear

But here, Zarraga says, her family can eat three times a day and live without the fear of violence that stalks life in Venezuela.

“I left some of my family in Venezuela, but Graciella is like a new family to me,” she says. “I don’t feel neglected, I feel good.”

The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which was previously working with IDPs in the community, has adapted its strategy in Las Delicias and across Colombia to deal with the influx of Venezuelan migrants.

The agency’s workers are concerned about the impact the migration crisis will have on Colombia and fear that the political response has been lacking.

This is echoed by community leaders from Las Delicias and other nearby settlements, who say that resources are already too overstretched to cope with more newcomers.

Stark generosity

But there is also widespread sympathy among Las Delicias residents for their new neighbours. Other Venezuelan families i spoke to also shared stories of stark generosity from their neighbours, who are largely IDPs.

Among them, Lisseth Portillo, 33, who was given a plot of land for free by Luzdelly Mosquera’s family, after she was evicted from a previous home.

Mosquera, an IDP, highlights an important aspect of the current crisis – many Colombians sought refuge in Venezuela during the country’s conflict. Now, the tables have turned.

“We want to help because Venezuelans opened the doors to Colombians in the past,” Mosquera says.

“It’s very sad to see people in the streets with kids and no food to eat,” she adds. “We help with our hearts and our hands.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/from-crisis-in-venezuela-to-haven-in-colombia-the-families-of-south-americas-great-migration/
10,venezuela,"The Esequibo region has been the focus of a territorial dispute between the former British colony and the Bolivarian government for decades.

Venezuela is asking Guyana to reestablish diplomatic ties in order to reach a ""practical and satisfying solution to the territorial controversy"" regarding the oil-rich Esequibo region, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said Friday.

""Under the aegis of the Geneva Agreement of 1966, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela proposed the Goverment of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana to reestablished the diplomatic contacts that allow for a practical and satisfying solution of the territorial controversy,"" the ministry said in a statement.

The invitation comes after Venezuela rejected a United Nations decision to hand the case over to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a proposal that was in turn welcomed by Guyanese authorities.

""We concluded that a meaningful progress in the controversy has not been reached and that's why the ICJ was chosen as the means to be used for the resolution,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on January 30.

But Venezuela doesn't consider the ICJ's resolutions to be binding, prefering instead to follow guidelines established in the Geneva Agreement of 1966, which states that the dispute should be ""solved amicably in a way that's acceptable for both parties.""

The Geneva Agreement of 1966 was signed between Venezuela and the United Kingdom regarding steps for a future resolution of the border controversy. Venezuela had rejected the Arbitral Award of 1899 between both countries as ""null and void,"" claiming sovereignty over a portion of what was then British Guiana.

Venezuelan lawyer Severo Mallet-Prevost revealed how Russia and Britain made a secret deal in order to influence the judges over the definition of the borders during the 1899 Arbitral Tribunal Award.

British Guinana was granted independence a couple of months after the Geneva Agreement was signed.

In 2015, the oil company Exxon Mobil found an oil field in the disputed area, which restarted the territorial conflict.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made an initial request for a U.N. Good Offices mediation in July 2015 after Guyana began exploratory measures to extract oil in the disputed Esequibo territory.

12,venezuela,"VALENCIA, Venezuela — They died together when flames tore through an overcrowded police station jail in Venezuela.

Now many of them are buried beside each other, too.

Weeping relatives lowered caskets of many of the 68 people officials say were killed in one of the nation’s worst jail fires into a freshly dug mass tomb on Friday.

Cemetery workers said they expected to bury about half of those killed in three-deep graves, each separated by a layer of hastily constructed cinderblock. Simple white crosses with their handwritten names, dates of birth and shared death date were put around the tomb.

“How am I going to forget seeing my husband burned?” asked Wilca Gonzalez, 36, whose loved one was the first to be placed into the ground Friday. “How can you forget that?”

A relative grieves during the funeral of Alirio Duran, 25, at the Municipal Cemetery of Valencia, Venezuela, Friday, March 30, 2018. Weeping relatives arrived at the central cemetery on Friday carrying the caskets of many of the 68 victims who were killed in a police station fire to place them in a freshly dug mass tomb. Cemetery workers said they were prepared to bury at least 32 people two days after the blaze in three-deep graves separated by a layer of cinderblock. (Ariana Cubillos/Associated Press)

The mass burial comes two days after the horrific blaze in the industrial city of Valencia where an estimated 200 people were being kept in cells meant for no more than three dozen. As they bury their dead, relatives of those killed are clamoring for answers from officials who have yet to release a full account of what happened, state how many were injured or release the names of those killed.

“The state is keeping far too silent,” said Humberto Prado, director of the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory, an independent group that advocates for prisoner rights.

In a statement Friday, the Venezuelan government defended its commitment to human rights and instructed the chief prosecutor’s office to investigate. Officials also lambasted the United Nation’s human rights office for comments made Thursday urging Venezuela to address concerns like dangerously cramped cells and ensure the nation’s jails and prisons meet international standards.

“It makes their biased position on Venezuela publicly clear,” the statement read.

Rights advocates said the relative silence from officials was symptomatic of a larger unwillingness to address long simmering concerns about the nation’s jail system. According to the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory, at least 32,000 people are being placed in police station jails designed as temporary holding cells for 8,000. Inmates are often able to obtain drugs and weapons with the help of corrupt guards.

Now as Venezuela struggles with one of the most severe economic contractions in modern Latin American history those conditions are believed to have gotten even worse. Like much of the nation, activists say prisoners are going hungry and unable to get needed healthcare.

“With the country undergoing hyperinflation, and the population suffering from mass scarcities of basic goods and medicines, conditions inside Venezuela’s penal system have descended to levels that can best be described as draconian,” said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.

The incident is one of the worst mass casualty events at Venezuelan prisons and jails, but is not the first. A fire at a prison in the western state of Zulia killed more than 100 inmates in 1994. In 2013, 61 people died and over 100 were injured, mostly from bullet wounds, during a riot in Barquisimeto.

Absent an official narrative, relatives were left to cobble what little details they could on their loved ones’ final moments from photographs passed along from cell phones and survivor accounts.

Jeyne Lugo, whose 27-year-old son Roner was killed, said he called her shortly before the fire and said police had shot a pregnant woman at the jail in the head. Inmates then set a mattress on fire to draw attention to the dying woman in an apparent bid to get her aid, she said. He told her that officers then began pouring gasoline, igniting the flames further and causing them to spread.

After the blaze Lugo received a photo showing her son’s right leg alongside the body of a deceased pregnant woman, her face covered in blood. She recognized her son’s leg because of the thick scar running up his calf, the remnant of a surgery he’d undergone after an accident years before.

While she said officials have told the families most died from asphyxiation, she doubts that account. According to her, a survivor claims her son survived the blaze but was shot.

She criticized what she called a hasty effort by officials to close the case.

“I’ve never seen anything that quick,” she said.

Other accounts suggest the inmates may have set the fire in an attempt to escape.

Carlos Nieto, the director of A Window to Freedom, an organization that monitors prison conditions, said accounts from survivors and relatives indicate the incident began when inmates tried to hold two guards captive. Later they reportedly set some mattresses on fire in an attempt to force guards to open the cells.

He said the only survivors managed to escape because firefighters broke through a wall in the back of the cells and questioned authorities for not doing more to help them out.

Those inside the jail are believed to have been a mix of inmates awaiting trial or already sentenced for a variety of crimes, many relatively minor in nature.

The family of Gonzalez’s husband, Erickson Zapata, 23, said he was wrongly jailed with several others suspected of robbing a cellphone. They said he should have been detained for no more than 10 days but instead had been in the jail for 10 months. He was kept in the largest part of the facility where 60 people were crammed inside, many sleeping on makeshift hammocks made from bedsheets.

Gonzalez said the last time her husband called her from inside the jail, he was pleading for help.

“I can’t breathe,” he cried. “I’m suffocating.”

She identified his body by his crooked left ring finger and his uniquely large front teeth.

On Friday, his father, Jesus Zapata, 42, stood next to his son’s casket holding his bible. With three other men, he helped lower the coffin into the ground.

His quiet sob turned into open crying as workers covered the coffin with planks, preparing the grave for the next inmate to be placed on top.

13,venezuela,"President Donald Trump banned U.S. purchases of a cryptocurrency the Venezuelan government is rolling out, as part of a campaign to pressure the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump issued an order on Monday prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions using the oil-backed currency, called the Petro. He authorized Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to issue any necessary regulations to enforce his order.

Maduro created the currency to try to salvage his country’s failing economy, where inflation is estimated to spiral to 13,000 percent this year.

The ban complicates the Maduro government’s efforts to boost its foreign reserves through a digital token. Venezuela’s offering accepted transactions in U.S. dollars and euros, meaning that Venezuelan citizens are forbidden from participating given a ban on buying foreign currency.

“It’s a pretty big blow,” said Russ Dallen, the managing director at Caracas Capital. “Since most cryptocurrencies are not actually backed by anything real, cryptocurrency speculation is based on the greater fool theory — I can buy this at $100 because there is someone who is a bigger idiot who is going to buy it at $200. When you take the U.S. out of that equation, you reduce the interest and potential for that speculation.”

New Sanctions

Mnuchin met with other finance ministers on Monday at the G20 conference in Buenos Aires to discuss the situation in Venezuela. His department also announced sanctions on four more current and former Venezuela government officials, according to a statement posted on Treasury’s website.

The sanctioned officials are Willian Antonio Contreras, the vice minister of internal commerce; Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar, who is acting as head of the office of the national treasury, according to the U.S.; Americo Alex Mata Garcia, an alternate director on the board of the National Bank of Housing and Habitat; and Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuela Institute of Social Security.

“President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis. Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency – a ploy that Venezuela’s democratically-elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,” Mnuchin said in a statement.

In his meeting with his international counterparts, Mnuchin said, “we discussed how to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro’s economic policy.”

A press official for Venezuela’s Information Ministry declined to comment.

Pence Speech

In August, the Trump administration barred the trading of new debt issued by Venezuela’s government and state-owned oil company in U.S. markets amid deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the oil-rich nation. The U.S. government has been weighing sanctions on Venezuela’s all-important oil sector before the nation’s presidential election on May 20. That would be a potentially crippling blow to the Maduro government, which depends almost exclusively on crude sales to sustain what’s left of the economy.

The Treasury Department warned investors in January to steer clear of the digital currency, calling it “another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people.”

Vice President Mike Pence will pressure Maduro’s government in a speech Wednesday to a session of the Organization of American States, his office said.

“The Vice President will call on all members to increase pressure on the Maduro regime to restore the country’s democracy and address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Venezuela,” Pence’s spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, said Monday in a statement.

14,venezuela,"Cucuta, Colombia - A pink stroller is surrounded by rubbish where children covered in dirt linger around a makeshift camp under a bridge in Colombia's Cucuta.

The anesthetised gaze in the children's eyes reflects their precarious health situation which worsens by the week.

They are sheltering from the scorching sun in the shadow of a bridge that connects Venezuela with Colombia. This a point of relief for many Venezuelans who have faced the hardship of a long trip fleeing the humanitarian and economic crisis facing their home.

Under the bridge, the crude reality of the migration crisis is impossible to miss.

About 550,000 Venezuelans left for Colombia at the end of 2017, according to migration authorities. There has been a 62 percent increase in the second half of last year, with many crossing on foot.

Among those fleeing are complete indigenous clans who are trying to escape hunger in Venezuela and are hoping to receive medical aid for themselves and their children in Colombia.

There are two main entrance points to get from Venezuela to the Colombian border city Cucuta. The Simon Bolivar Bridge, crossed daily by thousands and a symbol for the mass exodus of Venezuelan refugees, and the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, a quieter border crossing under which rights groups are saying a humanitarian disaster is taking place.

It is here that a number of indigenous groups can be found. They either waded through the river or were able to cross the bridge before access was restricted.

Under the bridge, people rest on the ground as underfed toddlers with bloated bellies and babies with scabies roam around.

""The children are dying because of the lack of medicines and food,"" says the 38-year-old Remigio Segundo Romero Yordes.

Romero belongs to a complete indigenous Yukpa clan, of about 150 persons that left their ancestral lands of the Sierra de Perija, in Venezuela's Zulia state, just across the border.

At a distance of a few hundred metres, two additional Yukpa clans add to the more than 700 indigenous refugees who have crossed to Colombia, according to the local ombudsman's office of Colombia. The majority are living in dire conditions.

The ombudsman's office tells Al Jazeera that many of the children here have tuberculosis and are malnourished.

Nevertheless, staying in Venezuela was not an option according to Romero.

""When [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro received power from [late President] Chavez, he terminated everything,"" Romero says. ""There is no food and there are no medicines.""

The indigenous hope to receive aid and support in Colombia and are determined to stay.

An uncertain future

Last year, inflation in Venezuela reached at least 2,600 percent and this year it is expected to overtake 13,000 percent, according to the IMF.

{articleGUID}

Meanwhile, there are severe food and medicine shortages, which worsen every week. The homicide rate is among the highest in the world and the government has cracked down on opponents.

Most of the indigenous people who have fled to Colombia sleep in makeshift tents made from branches and rubbish bags.

Children can be seen playing cards under canopies. Some have a dry rash all over their body. Women often hang up clothes they washed in the dirty waters of the Tachira River, which is also used for consumption.

Today, the Yukpa survive by selling hats and baskets on the streets of Cucuta - a chaotic, dusty city and a sprawling open-air market for Venezuelan contraband goods.

Older women braid hats that are sold at the entrance of the bridge by a few men who try to get the attention of passersby.

They say they feel completely abandoned, adding that the Colombian government is not aiding them.

""Better said, they are threatening us,"" says Romero, who first arrived in August 2017.

He says that the Colombian government already deported them to Venezuela three times for not having valid identity papers, but they came back every time.

The municipality did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.

Binational tribe

The Yukpa belong to a binational tribe that lives on both sides of the border.

{articleGUID}

Olga Lucia Fuentes, a Colombian consultant in development, human rights and peace, says that Colombia's Constitutional Court ordered the state in 2009 to formulate plans to ethnically safeguard the survival of all Yukpas, whose existence was previously under threat by the Colombian internal conflict.

Most Yukpa do not possess identity papers, however, and it is hard for them to prove their binationality. Horacio Guerrero, Director of Indigenous Affairs of Colombia's Ministry of the Interior, said Venezuela did not respond it the ministry's request to establish the identity of the Yukpa. They are, therefore, treated as regular foreigners by Venezuelan authorities.

Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos announced last month that only Venezuelans with a valid passport and holders of a migration border card, of which no new ones are issued, can enter Colombia.

According to Pedro Santiago Posada Arango, director of indigenous issues from the national Ombudsman's office in Colombia, however, the Yukpa are ""an indigenous border community [and] they have all the rights to enter Colombia, independently of whether they are registered in on or in both countries"".

He adds that the Yukpa ""should be treated as border peoples and therefore should receive help and attention"".

Posada stresses that the situation is very complicated and that there needs to be an assessment of those living under and near the Francisco de Paula Santander Bridge.

He says that errors have been made and that the regular requirements cannot be asked from the Yukpa, because of their special status.

Additionally, Christian Visnes, director of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Colombia, says Colombia signed up to the Cartagena agreement and, therefore, cannot deport refugees of any kind.

""Every person that has humanitarian needs should be received and their humanitarian needs should be attended,"" Visnes tells Al Jazeera.

He suspects that the state might be afraid of attracting more indigenous Yukpa if aid is given, but ""in this case, it's evident that there are humanitarian needs and, therefore, they should not be deported"".

'We will end up dead'

For the Yukpa themselves, it is a matter of life or death.

{articleGUID}

""It's like escaping from boiling water and they throw us right back in,"" Romero explains.

""We will end up dead,"" he says as he fears the consequences of the grave health situation of his clan.

There is also distrust between the indigenous groups and Colombian authorities.

On a few occasions, when the Family Welfare state-institute handed out milk and bread, they also asked which children were ill, sometimes removing children from the makeshift camps.

""I haven't seen my baby in a month,"" wails Milagro, a 17-year-old mother, who only gave her first name, tells Al Jazeera.

Milagro watched as Family Welfare took away her child, she says, adding that she has no idea where her daughter was taken.

According to Gladys Navarro Uribe, president of the Colombian Red Cross - section Norte de Santander, the children who are removed are taken care of by the Family Welfare institute.

A source with Family Welfare, who asked not to be named, also says the Colombian state sometimes removes children found in ""vulnerability or in danger, and with health problems"". The source adds that the children are placed in substitute homes from the institute and are taken back as soon as they are ready to return.

Additionally, the source denies that the Yukpa are deported, but rather ""returned"" to their lands, adding that their presence under the bridge is a disturbance to the nearby neighbourhoods.

To compound the misery of the Yukpa, many often wade the river water to go back to the Venezuelan border to receive food - though rotten - that they cannot obtain on the Colombian side.

Indigenous women who fear being detained and deported, choose to wade through the deeper parts of the river to bring food, often carrying young children with them.

If they are caught, the food is often taken by Colombian customs authorities, the Yukpa say.

""Sometimes, the women take about 10 kilos. The DIAN [Colombian customs] take the food from them saying that it is contraband,"" says the 39-year old Bertilio Gonzalez, a member of one of the three Yukpa clans. ""This is for our consumption!"" Gonzalez adds.

DIAN authorities maintain that the food that is taken does ""not comply with sanitary standards"".

Such food seizures have led to violent confrontations between the Yukpa and the DIAN, illustrating a crisis that looks certain to deepen.

Back at the makeshift camp where Romero lives, he waves his arms as he goes on about the binationality of his peoples.

""They do not recognise us as indigenous, but rather as regular Venezuelans,"" he says.

""We can cross the border without documents!"" he says while walking through the rubbish.

""In the [Colombian and Venezuelan] constitution, the indigenous are recognised!""",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/indigenous-yukpa-face-humanitarian-crisis-fleeing-venezuela-180310123952276.html

Since President Nicolás Maduro’s rise to power in 2013, the country continues to endure a crushing humanitarian crisis with severe food shortages, malnutrition, limited healthcare supplies, including antibiotics, hyperinflation, and major spikes in infectious diseases, including measles, malaria and tuberculosis, spurred by extreme poverty.

In a recent report, The New York Times exposed the harrowing conditions surrounding surging TB rates, noting that the beleaguered country once boasted the lowest rates of the infection in Latin America. Jacobus de Waard, the director of the tuberculosis laboratory at the Institute of Biomedicine in Caracas, told the newspaper: “Tuberculosis is hitting us hard. We’re losing the fight.” Caracas, the nation’s capitol, has seen a 40 percent spike in incidences of TB since last year. “All these forms of tuberculosis that we forget about are starting to reappear,” de Waard said.

As food supplies dwindle, malnutrition — as well as stress — rises, making citizens more susceptible to illnesses like TB. “Tuberculosis is the shadow of misery,” José Félix Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister, told the Times. “If there’s a disease that is a marker of poverty, it’s tuberculosis.”

Experts worry that as more families and friends have to huddle together in close living quarters due to economic losses and pressures transmission of the infection will increase. And, as more citizens flee to nearby nations, risk of an epidemic will become more likely.

Doctors told the paper that the country is ill-equipped to handle the TB surge due to limited access to antibiotics, as well as doctors and nurses, many of whom have fled to other countries.",http://people.com/chica/tuberculosis-rates-spike-amid-humanitarian-crisis-in-venezuela/
17,venezuela,"CARACAS, Venezuela — His family thought he just had a bad cold, nothing serious.

But Victor Martínez kept getting worse. By mid-January, he lay in a hospital ward, wasting away from tuberculosis. A month later, at his wake, stunned relatives tried to reckon with the resurgence of a disease that many Venezuelans thought had been mostly confined to the history books.

“I really don’t know what to think,” said Nileydys Yesenia Aurelia Martínez, his niece. “Even the last thing you’d imagine is happening.”

Tuberculosis, a disease that until recently seemed to be under control in Venezuela, is making an aggressive comeback, overwhelming a broken health care system ill equipped for its return, doctors and infectious disease specialists say.

The illness — like malaria, diphtheria and measles — has surged in Venezuela during a profound economic crisis that has battered almost every aspect of life and driven an exodus of Venezuelans, including many experienced doctors.

18,venezuela,"The Simon Bolivar bridge has become symbolic of the mass exodus of migrants from Venezuela. The crossing is also just one piece in the complex puzzle facing Colombia, as it struggles to absorb the increasing number of migrants prompted by its neighbour’s economic and social meltdown.

Up to 45,000 migrants cross on foot from Venezuela to Cúcuta every day. The Colombian city has become the last hope for many fleeing Venezuela’s crumbling economy. Already four million people, out of a population of 30 million, have fled Venezuela due to chronic shortages of food and medicine.

Venezuelans, who have crossed the border, describe what life is like in their home country.

“Back there, there is no food, you can’t find anything. There are no medicines. We had to come here to vaccinate the baby,” one woman says.

“At home we only have electricity for two hours a day. We have water from one to three hours every two days. There is no gas,” says another man.

“It’s a challenge to be able to get everyone in our family to sit at the table to have at least one meal a day,” adds another man.

Now in its firth year of recession, critics blame both government incompetence and corruption in Venezuela for the country’s economic crisis.

Crippled by hyperinflation, last year inflation topped 2600%. This year the IMF expects it to hit 13,000%.

President Nicolas Maduro recently announced plans to change the face value of the country’s bolivar currency, knocking three zeros off.

Despite that redenomination, the real value of the minimum wage in Venezuela still only amounts to six US dollars a month.

For those making the journey, Colombia offers a way out of the mess.

“It is much cheaper here and you can get anything. You can find mayonnaise, toilet paper, the essential things needed to feel human. There is no toilet paper or napkins back home. How is it possible that one litre of petrol costs one bolivar and one litre of water costs 5,000, for the love of God!,” says one man.

The bridge from Venezuela to Cúcuta is the main border point between the two Latin American neighbours.

Scores of small businesses have sprung up – from stalls offering to buy hair to wheelchair-taxi services – proof of people’s ingenuity in the face of extreme adversity.

It is estimated more than a million Venezuelans have settled in Colombia. On arrival they are not considered refugees.

But irrespective of whether those fleeing want to live in Colombia – or simply use it is as a gateway elsewhere – they first need to be allowed in, as Rafael Zavala from the UNHCR explains.

“In order to enter Colombia, they need a passport. There are people who manage to get the border mobility card, which is a temporary permit. In addition to that, about a year ago Colombia created a special visa, which is another way of establishing yourself once you are already in the country. To obtain it you must have entered Colombia regularly, with your passport stamped.”

To stem the flow of migrants from Venezuela, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos recently announced an end to the border mobility card scheme.

The temporary visas were the most common documents used by poor Venezuelans given the difficulty of obtaining a passport.

One man crossing the border tells us: “You cannot get a passport. You can get one if you pay. They were asking for around 10 million bolivares. A salary is about 400-500 thousand bolivares. This means half a million bolivares, and we are talking 10 million. That’s more than one year’s salary to pay for a passport”

With neither the correct documents or the right to work, thousands of Venezuelans – who once held decent jobs at home – have been reduced to begging for food and small change in Cúcuta.

At one shelter run by the Catholic Church, they distribute more than 1,000 free meals a day. Some just cross the bridge for the food.

One man tells us: “The situation is horrible. We come here because in San Cristobal there is no food. I worked at the Town Hall of San Cristobal, but the money wasn’t enough to eat.”

Others cross the border in the hope of finding any sort of job to send some money back home – many families have been split apart.

One mother trying to find work in the city says: “Venezuela is a country which makes me deeply sad because I’ve left my three children behind in order to come here and find a job to send them some money. What would I do if I brought them here? Where would I keep them? I could not keep them on the street.”

Euronews: “Where are you going to sleep tonight?”

“I don’t know. Perhaps in the street, wherever I can find,” she says.

The epicentre of Venezuela’s migrant exodus in Colombia is in the historically volatile region of Norte de Santander.

Armed groups still control vast swaths here, despite a peace deal with FARC in 2016.

That officially ended the 52-year conflict but many of Colombia’s internally displaced now live in Cúcuta’s poorest districts, while the number of Venezuelan migrants entering the city’s vulnerable neighbourhoods since August is believed to have risen from zero to 3000.

Church missionaries who work in the city’s poorest areas say the migrants run a huge risk of exploitation.

Father Francesco Bortignon tells us: “This massive influx of Venezuelans, many of whom are trained professionals, has obviously presented a big opportunity for dishonest employers. They can make half promises, pay badly or not pay them at all. The migrants can also be recruited and sent somewhere. They can be asked to harvest coffee, or even coca leaves.”

Faced with large numbers of migrants, Colombia has called for international help. The EU’s chief for Humanitarian Aid Christos Stylianides recently met President Santos and also visited Cúcuta for himself.

During the visit he announced Europe would be providing an addition 31 million euros in funding – 2 million of which will go to Venezuela and 6 million to Colombia.

“For the Colombian authorities it is a huge challenge to deal with this unprecedented situation, because of course they face also their challenges in their country about the reconciliation process and the peace process. So, our humanitarian aid is going to both sides, inside Venezuela and inside Colombia. Especially in Venezuela we are trying a lot, in order to find ways in particular to provide medicines and to find projects to deal with acute malnutrition,” Stylianides said.

International aid agencies are also working with the Colombian government to provide more shelter for the migrants.

But President Santos has been heavily criticised over Colombia’s efforts to stem the migrant flow.

The head of one migration centre, Willinton Muñoz Sierra, believes Bogota’s stricter policy could backfire by actually increasing the number of illegal entries.

“The measures taken by the Government are effectively a diplomatic closure of the border. Now Venezuelans need a passport or a special permit to enter. Everything is much more complex. The alternative for migrants is to go via illegal entry points. Everyone knows there are criminal groups acting outside the law. This puts the migrants welfare at risk, “he says.

Since February the authorities in Colombia claim migrant numbers have dropped by more than 30%.

They also say nearly 1,500 people have been repatriated.

The Venezuelans we spoke to branded the new measures as “deportations”. One young man forced onto the street, despite having a passport, , was among them.

“As a Venezuelan citizen when I arrive in another country I know there are laws that must be observed. I am working and looking for a legal way to earn a living and get by every day. You cannot evict me from the country and even less take the merchandise as they have done. In Venezuela there are six million Colombians that make a living there and still do very well. But when I come here, they want to throw me out? Why? Where is the justice in that? What did Bolivar want? A united nation. There is xenophobia in Colombia. There is xenophobia because we are Venezuelans.”

From the Colombian border Euronews’ Monica Pinna says the plight of many migrants remains desperate.

19,venezuela,"In 2018 Venezuela is struggling though the hemisphere's worst economic problems. Inflation is rapidly spiraling towards crisis levels and everyday economic activity continues to be severely encumbered by a nonsensical system of currency controls. In 2018 Venezuela's GDP is expected to contract by double digits for the third straight consecutive year. Economic output in Venezuela fell by 16% in 2016, 14% in 2017, and is expected to drop by 15% this year. Meanwhile, after jumping from 112% in 2015 to 2,400% last year, inflation in Venezuela is expected to hit five-digit levels in 2018. Venezuela's slow-burning economic collapse is quickly becoming a regional humanitarian crisis as Venezuelans flee in ever larger numbers, looking for refuge in neighboring and nearby countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have already fled their country and sought asylum in Colombia. The economic dynamics in Venezuela are also causing major problems for the private sector. Major multinational companies such as General Motors, Pepsi, Delta, and IBM have all reported serious problems relating to their operations in Venezuela. McDonalds continues to operate in Venezuela, in spite of the fact that according to The Economist's Big Mac Index, Venezuela's currency has lost 99.9% of its dollar value over the past two years. I reached out to Jason Marczak, the Director of the Adrienne Arscht Latin America Center, at the Atlantic Council, a Washington D.C.-based think-tank, to ask about Venezuela's trajectory in 2018.

Nathaniel Parish Flannery: Venezuela's economy has been struggling for years. Do you think the problems there need to be recognized as a crisis?

Jason Marczak: Absolutely. And in fact a wave of attention is now laser focused on its crisis. The calamity facing Venezuela is one of unprecedented proportions with reverberations far beyond its borders. Hyperinflation has set in, with this year’s inflation rate projected to hit 13,000 percent. Malaria has resurfaced years after its eradication. The homicide rate is the world’s second highest, but even that does not fully measure how dangerous daily life has become. And people are hungry and without medicine. A study we recently conducted at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center showed that 84 percent of Venezuelans consider the country’s food supply situation to be, at least, poor; and more than half of those consider it dire.

And the situation isn’t happening in a silo, nor is it contained domestically. The effects are reverberating across the region as Venezuelans flee government persecution and attempt to escape daily suffering. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees released a report just this week calling on countries in the region to find sustainable solutions to treat the population of Venezuelans leaving the country. The massive migratory flows coming out of the country are placing a heavy burden on Colombia, which is being flooded with Venezuelans and needs assistance from the international community. Officially, there are over 600,000 displaced Venezuelans in Colombia alone, with the actual number likely much higher, and the rate at which people are leaving the country is not slowing down. In Brazil, President Michel Temer declared a state of emergency last month as a response to the massive number of Venezuelans migrating into the country.

Parish Flannery: Given the serious nature of the problems crippling Venezuela’s economy how is Maduro's government able to maintain control?

Marczak: President Maduro is able to maintain control through tight controls of the people and funneling illicit money to those who help control the levers of power. The government has at its disposal a far-reaching intelligence apparatus, advised by Cuba’s own intelligence service, which intrudes into all aspects of Venezuelan life. The government also has suppressed freedom of press while maintaining a system of state-run media outlets that control information flows and diffuse propaganda. The combination of government intelligence with a lack of freedom of the press has kept the opposition groups at bay and prevented formal organization on a larger scale. Social media platforms, such as Facebook and WhatsApp help those who oppose the government to maneuver around these barriers but, so far, it is not enough.

The crisis is also making it more difficult for the people who, without food or medicine, increasingly find it a tremendous burden to mobilize against the government. For many Venezuelans, the monthly government handout of basic food supplies is the only thing keeping them from starving. The hunger and desperation that afflicts people draws the attention away from regime change and toward survival. Additionally, the population migrating out of the country is made up almost entirely of people that hold animosity toward the government, meaning that as more people leave, less remain to support the opposition.

Finally, there is a pervasive system of corruption and cronyism among the high and mid-level positions in the government that has allowed Maduro to pay off the officials he needs to preserve his grip over the country. This is particularly true with regard to the military officials that must control an increasingly demoralized military.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanielparishflannery/2018/03/22/venezuelas-economic-crisis-worsens-in-2018/

21,venezuela,"For Tamara Taraciuk Broner, the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela hits home. Venezuela provided her Argentinian parents refuge when their homeland was controlled by a brutal military junta. Now a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, Taraciuk Broner was born in Venezuela, but was able to return to Argentina as a young child after the repressive government there was toppled.

Today she views her job as helping Venezuelans who have fled their own repressive regime return home one day. “That is a very important part of what we do,” she told a roomful of academics, students and members of the community at a March 8 luncheon at the UM Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas (U-MIA).



In welcoming the group, Dr. Felicia Marie Knaul, director of U-MIA, said the center was “extremely pleased to partner with Human Rights Watch” and their researchers who work throughout the world to promote social justice and human rights.

”I am the child of a concentration camp survivor,” Knaul said. “It breaks my heart to hear about these abuses, injustices, but we have to bear witness. There is no excuse for our silence, for not doing something.”



Taraciuk Broner worked undercover in Venezuela for Human Rights Watch for eight years, while the late President Hugo Chavez was still in power, and continued her work, contacting victims of abuse, lawyers and others affected by the repressive regime of his successor, Nicolas Maduro. Those observations culminated in reports and videos that, she said, document the enormous concentration of power that allowed the Chavez and Maduro governments to commit all kinds of abuses.



Maduro further solidified his authoritarian hold when his supporters took control of the National Assembly, increasing violence against opponents, and pushing the country into an economic decline that has caused hyperinflation, severe shortages of food and medical supplies, and declining health.



In early 2017, Taraciuk Broner said, a Venezuelan Ministry of Health report showed that, the year before, maternal mortality had increased by 65 percent, infant mortality by 30 percent and malaria cases by 76 percent. These figures put Venezuela above the threshold of a crisis, according to the World Health Organization.

“Things have gotten worse since then,” she said, noting that the minister who authored the report was fired. Adding to the suffering in Venezuela, Taraciuk Broner said, is Maduro’s denial of a humanitarian crisis, which Human Rights Watch’s meticulous fact-gathering has corroborated. By denying the existence of a crisis, she said, Venezuela has closed the door to international aid that could alleviate some suffering and death.



“We don’t do things for the sake of it, we do so to provoke change,” said Taraciuk Broner, “When we say things happen it’s because we can corroborate every assertion we make.”

Taracuik Broner said the reports and graphic videos disseminated by Human Rights Watch has spread knowledge of the humanitarian crisis worldwide. But now, she said, the organization faces the daunting task not only of maintaining interest in the country but also generating sufficient pressure for change.



“We are trying to advocate for the governments in the regions and beyond to redouble pressure for Maduro to end abuses,” she said.



Specifically, Human Rughts Watch recommends countries impose targeted sanctions against high-ranking Maduro government officials who are implicated in abuses. Such sanctions could include freezing their assets and blocking their entrance to specific countries, she said.



Only the United States, Canada and the European Union have implemented sanctions. But Human Rights Watch will continue pressuring other countries to follow suit, she said.

CARACAS, Venezuela — Economic pledges may be par for the course in election campaigns, but in hyperinflationary Venezuela, the candidates' dueling promises are going further, with the incumbent vowing to lop a few zeros off the currency, while his main challenger calls for the adoption of the U.S. dollar.

President Nicolás Maduro late Thursday briefly outlined his monetary rescue plan. In a country where a dozen eggs can cost 250,000 bolivars ($5) amid worsening inflation, he would chop three zeros off the currency — arguably bringing the price for those eggs down to 250.

“I ask you all for your prayers and support for the success of the monetary reconversion,” Maduro said in a televised event Thursday night.

The move came as Henri Falcon — a former governor running against Maduro in elections set for May — is proposing a far more radical fix. He wants to follow the path of countries such as Ecuador and Panama by dollarizing the Venezuelan economy. Doing so, he says, would prevent the printing of new bills — instantly constraining inflation.

Socialist Venezuela is going through a crisis that has left people struggling to pay for food and find medicines. Prices are being influenced by a black-market exchange rate that rises by the day and is currently five times the nearly inaccessible official rate.

Customers are standing in hours-long lines at banks to take out a daily limit, set so low that it barely covers the price of a cup of coffee. Larger transactions are done by bank card or transfer — although some vendors are charging double for electronic payments.

Maduro’s redenomination plan was met with serious skepticism by critics and analysts, who say that the impact on hyperinflation would be minimal — and that the plan would be confusing. By June 2, under Maduro’s plan, new bolivars with lower denominations would be circulated — but old ones, with denominations as high as 100,000, would remain valid. It would leave vendors charging two prices — one for old bills, the other for the redenominated bolivar.

Salaries too would be redenominated — so little would change in terms of buying power.

Economists say simply chopping zeros off the bolivar notes is unlikely to halt hyperinflation, since the government would still be printing reams of cash. In addition, the forces that have sent prices soaring, including food and medical scarcities, would remain in place. In fact, some Venezuelan business owners have already started eliminating three zeros from prices, simply because they're too long to fit in printed receipts.

“Taking out three zeros doesn’t in any way solve any of the causes of hyperinflation,” said Jean Paul Leidenz, senior economist at Caracas-based Ecoanalitica. “It’s just a cosmetic fix that won’t work.”

Maduro’s announcement is just his latest attempt to control runaway inflation: He has already launched a new cryptocurrency, the petro. An executive order by President Trump, however, has banned U.S. transactions in the petro, which U.S. officials have dubbed “a scam.” Few see the petro as a genuine solution — and Maduro’s new redenomination plan appears to be a tactical admission that the government is seeking another answer.



Henri Falcon, presidential candidate for the Progressive Advance Party, speaks at a news conference Tuesday in Caracas. (Manaure Quintero/Bloomberg News)

One thing is certain: The debate on how to halt hyperinflation is at the center of a presidential election that opposition leaders have called a farce and have boycotted. But Falcon — a former ally of leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez, who, before dying of cancer in 2013, handpicked Maduro — insists he has a chance.

The Yankee dollar, Falcon says, will help him win.

Falcon’s dollarization plan has appeared to hit a nerve with the country’s impoverished people.

In Latin America, Ecuador, Panama and El Salvador use the U.S. dollar — constraining budgetary spending and the setting of interest rates while providing monetary stability. Under Falcon’s plan, everything from salaries to taxes to food would be priced in dollars, and for a certain period, low-income earners would receive a $25 monthly subsidy through a so-called “solidarity card.”

“The prices of everything are calculated at the rate of the dollar here. The only thing that isn’t dollarized is salaries,” Falcon said in an interview with The Washington Post. “We want people to recover their purchasing power. We need them to.”

Falcon’s dollarization plan, analysts say, may present Venezuela with a bigger fix than Maduro’s redenomination.

“One is a superficial, makeup-like change, and the other is an actual restructuring aimed at stopping inflation,” Leidenz said.

That’s not to say dollarization doesn’t carry risks. It would bind the hands of the government on monetary policy, and would leave Venezuela’s economy under the influence of a currency whose value it cannot control.

“Dollarizing is like cutting out an important arm you need, an important tool, in exchange for stopping hyperinflation as fast as possible,” Leidenz said. “It’s a debate I wish was happening among academics, not through electoral propaganda.”

Faiola reported from Miami.

The U.S. Agency for International Development is providing this new initial assistance, totaling $2.5 million, in partnership with the Colombian government. The funds will go to humanitarian organizations that provide Venezuelans with emergency food and health assistance in impacted border areas.

This funding is in addition to the $36.5 million the State Department is providing in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to support the regional humanitarian operations of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international organizations. Those operations include assistance for Venezuelans now resident outside their country.

Colombia at risk

The Venezuelan exodus has sparked alarm across Latin American nations. It is estimated that as many as 3 to 4 million Venezuelans have emigrated, with several hundred thousand in 2017 alone. The bulk of these migrants in 2017 have fled to neighboring Colombia. The Colombian Ministry of Defense, Luis Carlos Villegas, said that there were approximately 700 thousand Venezuelan immigrants registered in the country.

While Beasley said Venezuela's humanitarian crisis was not being driven by an armed conflict, he also warned that the crisis could worsen. He pointed to the example of Syria, a country with a smaller population than Venezuela, which began with a minor food emergency and now has 6 million people a day that need UN food assistance.

As hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine batter Venezuela, the UN has offered to assist the South American nation directly. Yet, President Nicolas Maduro has repeatedly rejected offers of humanitarian aid, claiming that these are veiled attempts by the US and others to destabilize his government.

Beasley stressed the importance of shielding Colombia from the adverse effects that Venezuela's crisis could bring. ""Colombia has made so much progress in the past many years with peace and the last thing it needs now is for all that success to be undone,"" he said.

On Saturday, the UN Refugee Agency asked countries in the region to share the burden of the Venezuelan refugee tide and appealed for countries to allow them in and provide them the necessary protections.

Venezuela on the brink The last straw Violent protests erupted across the country following a Supreme Court decision in late March to strip the legislative branch of its powers. Amid an international outcry, President Nicolas Maduro reversed the decision, but it was too late. Thousands have since taken to the streets to call for new elections. They show no signs of stopping.

Venezuela on the brink Worth less than the paper it's printed on As of March, Venezuela's inflation rate surpassed 220 percent, according to the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics. The country's largest bill - the 100 bolivar note - was worth just $0.04 at the end of last year. Shopping trips now require stacks, or even bags, of cash to buy the bare necessities.

Venezuela on the brink Starvation a growing problem An estimated 80 percent of food items and other basics were in short supply by last year. Venezuelans spend more than 30 hours a week waiting in lines to shop, and are often confronted with empty shelves when they finally enter a store. President Maduro blames the crisis on US price speculation. The opposition, however, accuses the government of economic mismanagement.

Hospitals around the country have compared conditions to those seen only in war zones. As patient deaths rise, health officials have sounded the alarm on the rise of malaria and dengue fever.

Venezuela on the brink Running on empty Electricity blackouts and fuel shortages have also driven Venezuelans to desperation. Despite Venezuela's possession of the world's largest oil reserves, drivers face long lines at the gas pump. A 50-percent collapse in oil prices in 2014 devastated the oil-dependent economy. In 2013, revenues were $80 billion. That figure dropped to $20 billion by 2016, according to IMF figures.

Venezuela on the brink The roots of the economic crisis Lower poverty rates, better education and health, and economic growth: These are all part of the legacy of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013. Equally part of the socialist's legacy was mismanagement. Not only did he fail to keep the state oil company up to date under increased government control, but his government also overspent despite a drop in oil production after 2006.

Venezuela on the brink Maduro continues legacy Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, has been in office for four years and has two more to go. The opposition center-right coalition, which has controlled the National Assembly since 2015, has accused him of ""abandoning his post"" by failing to stem the economic devastation. It has also denounced him for rights abuses.

Venezuela on the brink Government cracking down on opponents From the governor of Miranda to the mayor of Venezuela's capital Caracas, authorities have attempted to quash anti-government protests by arresting its opposition leaders. Venezuelan authorities have detained Leopoldo Lopez, Antonio Ledezma and Henrique Capriles, considered the face of the opposition movement.

Venezuela on the brink Opposition far from finished Aside from protests, the opposition collected 2 million signatures for a referendum last year, roughly 10 times the number required. And in a move against the Supreme Court - and in lieu of impeachment hearings - it also held a symbolic trial for Maduro. Numerous attempts to stymie its efforts to pressure the government have only emboldened these lawmakers.

Venezuela on the brink Spinning out of control Since the outbreak of explosive protests in April, scores of people have died and hundreds more have been injured. Rights campaigners say police have arrested thousands. Meanwhile, the government has pushed through with the election of an all-powerful constituent assembly, which critics are afraid will cement Maduro's grasp on power.

Venezuela on the brink Venezuela's National Assembly seizes power from opposition-led congress Venezuela's pro-government constituent assembly has adopted the authority to pass legislation on a range of issues affecting security and sovereignty, effectively taking away the powers of the country's congress, which was under the opposition's leadership. During its first session, the National Assembly fired former top prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who subsequently fled to Colombia.

Venezuela on the brink Westerns powers slap sanctions Venezuela's ruling officials In response to the ongoing political crisis, the United States and European Union have imposed a series of sanctions against ruling officials. The US has blacklisted members of the Constituent Assembly and frozen all of Maduro's assets that are subject to US jurisdiction. The EU, meanwhile, has banned arms sales to the country and is lining up to freeze assets and impose travel restrictions.

Venezuela on the brink Debt default looms In November, the oil-rich, cash-poor nation faced its day of reckoning, as officials met with creditors to hammer out a deal to keep the country from defaulting on its debt — estimated to be up to $150 billion. US and EU sanctions, however, have limited the chance of an agreement. Whatever the consequences of a default, creditors will almost certainly go after the country's oil reserves.
