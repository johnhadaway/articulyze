In 2018, 44,790 severely malnourished children, including 2,516 children with medical complications, have been admitted in UNICEF supported treatment programmes. The number of admissions to date exceeds the number of admissions during the same period in 2017 by 33 percent. The increasing trend in admissions highlights a sustained risk to of malnutrition.

UNICEF and partners have launched a national measles vaccination campaign aiming to reach 4.7 million children. The campaign started in Puntland in January, where 933,406 children were reached (93 percent coverage). The campaign is now planned to continue in south and central states, as well as Somaliland where an additional 3.7 million children will be targeted.

In response to continued critical needs for emergency access to safe water, UNICEF and partners supported an additional 40,500 people from 28 displaced person settlements through emergency water trucking and water voucher provision in Nugaal, Bay, and Banadir regions.

UNICEF held inception workshops in Puntland and Somaliland for a new Children on the Move programme aimed at mitigating against the effects of child migration, and provide services for children at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse whilst on the move. The workshops trained ministry and civil society child protection workers on key strategies to identify children at risk and on the development of case management for children who are moving within Somalia and across borders.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical due to ongoing impacts of drought, displacement and conflict. As per the FSNAU-FEWSNET 2017 Post Deyr findings, 5.4 million people are still in need of urgent assistance, including 2.8 million children. An estimated 1.2 million children are or will be acutely malnourished over the next year, including 232,000 children at risk of life-threatening severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Over 4.4 million people need humanitarian WASH services, with 3.5 out of 5 people without adequate water to meet basic needs. More than 5.7 million people require basic health services, including critical needs in maternal and child health, as one in seven Somali children die before the age of five. Disease outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera and measles continue to represent a major threat to children, with over 1,000 cases of AWD/cholera (56 per cent children under 5) and 2,500 cases of measles reported in 2018. Over 3 million children, out of 4.9 million in country, are estimated to be out of school. More than 2.1 million people have been displaced, including over 1 million in the last year alone; and displacement flows continue at critical levels into areas such as Baidoa in Bay Region, which has received between 500 and 2,000 new arrivals per week since mid-January, 2018. 4 Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups continue to exacerbate high levels of acute humanitarian needs. More than 76 percent of recorded gender-based violence (GBV) survivors are reported to be from IDP communities. Grave violations against children continue at worrying rates, with 402 cases, mostly abductions, recruitment and use, and killing/maiming reported in January 2018.",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/unicef-somalia-humanitarian-situation-report-2-1-28-february-2018

This is one of the central pillars of the Fund, which was set up to support the highest-priority needs by the best-placed responders. The SHF thus works hand in hand with its implementing partners, with a view to support and understand their needs and expectations.

Consequently, the primary objective of the 2017 SHF Implementing Partners’ survey was to determine the non-governmental implementing partners’ satisfaction with the services provided by the SHF and factors that cause satisfaction or dissatisfaction, which may lead to changes and adjustments in the management of the Fund, where possible or necessary. In the future, the SHF may solicit similar feedback from other stakeholders.

The survey was carried out from 27th of December 2017 until 31st of January 2018. Of 109 eligible SHF non-governmental partners invited to respond, feedback was received from 82 non-governmental organizations.

Responses received indicate high level of satisfaction. More than 80 per cent of organizations are satisfied with the focus of the Fund’s 2017 allocations and almost 75 per cent participated in the strategic prioritization processes resulting in allocation strategies.

The overwhelming majority of respondents (96 per cent) are satisfied with documents guiding the application process; eight in ten organizations find it good or excellent. The vast majority of respondents – more than 90 per cent – stated that working with the SHF has an impact in the capacity strengthening of the organization.

These results confirm the importance of the SHF in the humanitarian response in Somalia, not only by providing timely and flexibly resources to respond to humanitarian needs, but also contributing to strengthening the capacity of implementing partners and, through this, to the overall effectiveness and accountability of humanitarian response in Somalia.

Some areas of improvement recommended by the respondents, touched on the communication process and the need for trainings on finance management, project submission, among others. Some measures are already being placed and the SHF team will conduct an in-depth/further analysis of the findings to make sure the majority of suggestions can be incorporate in the operation to strengthen the Fund.",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-shf-2017-implementing-partners-survey-final-report

Priority areas for humanitarian response

Humanitarian situation deteriorates as drought worsens.

The State-by-state drought analysis released by OCHA in February, shows that drought continued to contribute to the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the first quarter of 2018. Most areas have experienced at least four successive seasons of below normal rainfall, resulting in water shortages, loss of livestock and crop failure, and leading to widespread acute food insecurity. Download the State-by-state analysis here: https://tinyurl.com/ycgkae4b This analysis identifies the priority areas for response and provides an overview of the operational presence of humanitarian partners across the country. It notes that areas such as Awdal, Bari, Sanag, Nugal, Sool and Woqooyi Galbeed have experienced four consecutive seasons of below normal rains.

Consequently, of the one million people in the priority areas, more than half are in Emergency (IPC 4). Urgent nutrition support is required as most of these places have critical levels of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) of 15 per cent or higher. Some areas in Galgaduud and Mudug have seen massive displacement of pastoralists to urban and periurban areas in search of assistance due to the loss of their livestock. Over half of the population of Galmudug is in need of aid. By the end of 2017, the Gaalkacyo IDP population had the highest malnutrition rates in the country of 21.9 per cent.

A high concentration of extremely vulnerable displaced persons has made the Banadir region one of the priority areas for humanitarians. It hosts more than 700,000 IDPs. Nearly 270,000 displaced people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and 4), while most of the IDPs in Mogadishu face critical levels of acute malnutrition (16.1 per cent GAM prevalence).

About 154,000 IDPs were forcefully evicted in Mogadishu in 2017.

Baidoa, in Bay region, continues to be one of the areas requiring urgent and sustained humanitarian response. Displaced people continue to arrive, fleeing drought and armed hostilities. In February alone, 12,600 people arrived in Baidoa and the number is expected to grow, according to the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).

Malnutrition among the IDPs is at critical levels of 15.1 per cent GAM prevalence. Loss of assets and livelihood opportunities have severely exacerbated their vulnerability, and made them largely dependent on aid. Without assistance, they risk sliding into further crisis, undermining the prospects for reintegration and long term recovery",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/humanitarian-bulletin-somalia-march-2018
3,somalia,"Key Messages

Humanitarian situation: The drought situation in Somalia still persists with below normal rainfall being recorded across Somalia. However, food security improved slightly due to the continued large-scale humanitarian assistance and the short term impact of the rains. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection has reduced from 6.7 million in October 2017 to 5.4 million in February 2018.

• Malnutrition status: A slight improvement in nutritional status in Somalia has been observed with national mean Global Acute Malnutrition rate reducing from 17.4% in October to 13.8% in December 2017. However, 301,000 children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourished, including 48,000 who are considered severely malnourished and may face increased risk of disease and death.

• Displacements by drought: While 2 million people have been displaced in Somalia since January 2017 according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix of December 2017, a significant reduction in the monthly average of new displacement has been recorded since July 2017.

• World Vision continues to respond: The programme supported 253,472 adults (86,607 male and 166,863 female); and 148,412 children (65,305 boys and 83,107 girls) through our food security, health, nutrition, water and hygiene, education and Gift-in-kind interventions.

• Adaptations in programming: The programme has established the Context Monitoring and Analysis System (CMAS).

Severe drought conditions continue to compound the humanitarian situation in parts of Somalia. Some areas in the north are experiencing intensifying drought condition. Somaliland and Puntland authorities have called for urgent humanitarian assistance. Water shortages have led to stress induced migration of pastoralist communities in search of water and pasture in several areas. US$717 million is required between January and June 2018 to sustain famine prevention efforts. This is part of the $1.5 billion required for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan.

5,somalia,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – The head of Caritas Somalia is calling on the international community not to forget the Horn of Africa country as other crises divert the world’s attention.

“I believe it is urgent not to forget the Somali people,” María José Alexander told Crux in an e-mail interview.

“We should advocate [our] home governments about humanitarian aid allocations and help the Somali government and institutions to become stronger. Somalia needs to become stronger and stop depending so much on international aid,” she said.

She told Crux the situation in Somalia has been “fragile” since the fall of President Mohamed Siyad Barre in 1991, which led to collapse of all government institutions and the rise of competing militias in the country.

“The country has been facing civil war, calamity, and difficulties to solve ordinary state problems such as the provision of personal security, proper education, and food security. Added to this, extraordinary issues related to environmental matters and terrorism have now been a constant in the country,” Alexander said.

Although the situation is more stable in the northern part of the country, the risk of famine has continued to threaten several parts of Somalia – a situation made worse by the fact that “many parts are controlled by Al-Shabaab and now in Puntland [in the north of the country] there is also presence of elements affiliated to ISIS.”

Al-Shabaab – “The Youth” in Arabic – is an Islamic jihadist organization which once controlled the capital Mogadishu, and still exerts influence over large parts of the country. In 2012, the organization pledged its allegiance to al-Qaeda.

At the end of 2017, the United Nations said some 6.2 million people were in need of humanitarian and protection assistance and more than half that number required urgent life-saving assistance.

The world body also said 2017 saw the displacement of a further one million Somalis, taking the total across the country to more than two million.

Since that time, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has fallen to 5.4 million, but Alexander said that is still a staggeringly high number.

“Out of the 5.4 million people, 2.7 million are still in crisis and emergency and the other 2.7 in stress. In this sense, the number of people in the stress phase has reduced but not the number of people in crisis and emergency.”

In all this, the government has remained too powerless to act.

“If a government is unable to provide security, then there will never be a proper economic or social development. The humanitarian efforts are important, but we will never solve this crisis by ourselves: We need political will. Also, the on-going war between terrorist groups and the coalition led by the U.S. has caused deaths of civilians and terror among the society,” Alexander said.

She said Caritas has been mainly working with the country’s over 2 million internally displaced persons.

“[Caritas] opened a small office in Hargeisa, Somaliland, to provide both, education support to poor children, and food and nutritional assistance to drought affected people,” Alexander said.

Somaliland is the northernmost portion of Somalia which is self-governing. Unlike the rest of Somalia, which was previously Italian-ruled, Somaliland was ruled by the British in the colonial era.

It declared independence in 1991 after the fall of the Barre regime, but it remains unrecognized by the international community. Despite its quasi-legal status, it is the most stable and safest part of Somalia.

Alexander said from this base, Caritas was carrying out projects such as offering emergency assistance for the drought and conflict-related emergencies, like the Oct. 14 bombing attack on Mogadishu by Al-Shabaab.

“We also have an education project for selected children from two IDP camps in Hargeisa, where we pay for their education and logistic support to get them to school,” she said.

“Furthermore, in the same area, we provide medical assistance for poor people in Daami that cannot afford to go to the hospital or pay for the treatment. Then, together with a local partner, BREC, we have a school in Baidoa for girls and boys living in Aboore IDP camp. And finally, a fishing school managed by Perigeo NGO in Puntland,” she explained.

On March 6, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) convened an event in London to draw urgent attention to the humanitarian crisis in Somalia and the need for a swift and substantial response.

“The importance of further strengthening links between relief, recovery and development efforts was highlighted as vital to building Somalia’s resilience to extreme shocks and breaking the link between drought and humanitarian crisis in Somalia,” said a report from the OCHA.

They also agreed on the need to rebuild Somalia’s broken institutions by creating “stronger partnerships between international organizations and national NGOs,” crucial to developing better aid delivery.

Alexander said the troubles in Somalia are enough to break even the most committed of those involved in humanitarian aid, but what keeps her going is her faith in God.

“One must remember how faithful the Lord is, and how great his love is,” she said.",https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/03/21/catholic-charity-says-world-cannot-forget-somalia-crisis/

The ongoing cholera outbreak in Somalia started in December 2017. As of 18 March 2018, a total of 1613 cholera cases, including nine deaths (case fatality rate = 0.6%), have been reported from four regions: Hiraan, Banadir, Lower Juba and Middle Shabelle.

The outbreak started in Beletweyne, Hiraan Region; it spread to Banadir Region in early January 2018, to Lower Juba in early February 2018, and to Middle Shabelle in early February 2018. Of the 66 stool samples tested in 2018, 19 were positive for Vibrio cholerae serogroup 01 serotype Ogawa. Banadir Region is one of the regions with the highest concentration of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Lower Juba has experienced cholera outbreaks in the past; on the border with Kenya and the region has many people who have been displaced by conflict in Middle Juba. Middle Shabelle has also previously had cholera outbreaks. Access to safe water and sanitation is limited in all of the affected regions.

Public health response

The Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from WHO and partners, has implemented the following ongoing response measures:

Established weekly meetings between the MoH and Health Cluster partners.



Strengthened surveillance and case investigations, where security permits.



Trained and deployed community health volunteers to provide basic patient care in affected communities.



Conducted training for national, state and regional level integrated rapid response teams.



Dispatched cholera and diarrhoeal disease kits to local response partners and hospitals.



Trained evaluators for systematic monitoring of cholera treatment centres to assess capacity and quality of care and recommend reinforcement where necessary.



Developed and implemented cholera case management sessions with the support of the Global Cholera Task Force partners.



Distributed hygiene kits to inaccessible areas through community health volunteers and different non-governmental organizations.



Carried out social mobilization and community education activities by State and Regional Government authorities.



Prepared and disseminated Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials on acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera prevention.



Implemented oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaigns. From 11 through 18 February 2018, an OCV campaign was conducted in Hudur district and Afmadow district. The second OCV has taken place from 11 through 18 March 2018.

WHO risk assessment

Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.

Cholera is endemic in Somalia and continuous transmission was reported in the last few years. The last outbreak, which occurred in 2017, was one of the largest cholera epidemics the country has experienced: 78 000 cases, including 1159 deaths (case fatality ratio = 1.5%) were reported from 16 regions. The outbreak reached its peak in April 2017 and gradually declined from June until August 2017, and only few sporadic suspected cases were recorded between October and November 2017.

Despite the control and prevention measures implemented during the last large cholera outbreak in 2017, the risk of the current outbreak is considered high at the national level because of the following:

Only 16% of the at-risk population was vaccinated during last year’s OCV campaign, which is too low to provide population-level immunity;

There are large population movements in the affected areas due to drought, conflict and floods;

The regions affected have the highest concentration of IDPs where access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) is limited;

Funding for cholera control and treatment measures will continue through to 2018, which include activities related to WASH and OCV campaigns. The lack of longer-term funding, however, remains a concern as the seasonal recurrence patterns require more predictable financing for more effective prevention and mitigation.

At the regional and global levels, the level of risk was assessed by WHO to be low.

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.

WHO advice

WHO recommends improving access to safe water and sanitation to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcing surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to appropriate case management should be improved in the affected areas to decrease mortality. The use of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread should also be considered.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Somalia based on the information available.

In most parts of Somalia, Jilaal (January–March) season dry weather conditions persisted in February 2018, characterized by mostly dry winds and elevated temperatures. Few stations such as Qulenjeed (Awdal), Daraweyn (W. Galbeed) and Beletweyn (Hiran) recorded some rainfall (Map 1 and table 1). According to FSNAU field reports, there has been little rainfall in parts of Togwajaale, Gabiley and Lughaya in northwest, Bakool (Hudur, Wajid and Elbarde) and M. Shabelle (Adenyabal,

Cadale, Mahaday). Shebelle river level is very low and it has nearly dried up around Sablale, in the lower catchments of the river, leaving brackish water which is not suitable for human and animal use.

Satellite derived rainfall estimates (RFE) confirms prevalence of dry weather conditions across the country during the month of February (Map 2-5). According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) land surface temperatures (LST) for February remained elevated in West Golis, Northern Inland Pastoral (NIP) and in parts of Addun,

Hiran agropastoral, Cowpea belt, Southern rainfed maize and Juba pastoral livelihood zones.

Vegetation cover measured through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for February indicates continued deterioration of pasture and vegetation conditions especially in parts of Guban,

Golis of Sanaag, Allula District in Bari region in northern parts of the country. In southern Somalia, Middle and Lower Shabelle, Bay, Bakool, Gedo, Middle Juba and Lower Juba show small to large decreases in vegetation cover compared to average. Large decrease of vegetation is evident in parts in Cowpea Belt, Southern Rained, and Juba Pastoral livelihoods (Map 10).

Consistent with seasonal trends, during the current Jilaal dry season, poor pasture and inadequate water availability has been reported in most parts of the country due to prevailing dry weather conditions and high evaporation rates. Increased water prices from permanent water sources have been reported in Addun, Coastal Deeh, NIP and Hiran Agropastoral livelihood zones.

Opportunistic livestock migration towards more favorable permanent water sources is evident across the country.

Further deterioration in pasture and water conditions, consequent increase in water prices, increased livestock migration and continued reduction in Shablle river levels are expected until the start of Gu (AprilJune) rains in April, especially in areas that have been highlighted above. These adverse impacts are expected to be more pronounced in areas that have experienced poor 2017 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall.",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-climate-update-january-2018-monthly-rainfall-and-ndvi-issued-march-26-2018

PEOPLE TARGETED 4.7M

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS (JAN-JUN 2018) 717M (US$)

The 2017 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) received about 68 per cent of the funds requested, which corresponds to more than one billion, out of the USD 1.5 billion requirements. However, significant resources are still required to continue famine prevention efforts in 2018. Building on the achievements from last year’s response, this document outlines the main humanitarian needs that persist in 2018, and plans for the response by clusters and humanitarian actors in the first half of 2018 (January-June), to efficiently respond to the ongoing crisis.

SCALE OF THE CRISIS

In January 2018, the Somalia Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) launched the 2018 HRP for Somalia, requesting US$1.5 billion to deliver assistance to 5.4 million of the most vulnerable people in the country. The HRP highlights the need for continued highly targeted famine prevention efforts.

Jointly with the HRP, the Drought Impact Needs Assessment (DINA) and Recovery and Resilience Framework (RRF) were launched by the Government, with the support of the United Nations, World Bank and European Union, to support Somalia’s recovery from the protracted drought and build medium- to long-term resilience and disaster preparedness.

Humanitarian and development actors have agreed on collective outcomes to be achieved by 2020, to reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities and increase resilience, to ensure that future droughts, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to global climate change, do not turn into crises.

Famine was averted in Somalia in 2017 due to early and sustained large-scale action by government, civil society, private sector, diaspora and humanitarian actors and donors.

Seasonal improvement in food security and income during the Deyr season (October-December) were also a contributing factor. Despite the localized relief, the food security situation may deteriorate again with forecasted average to below average Gu (April-June) rains, and continued armed conflict in significant portions of the country. The drought, spanning over four consecutive rainy seasons, has destroyed livelihoods, induced mass displacement and exhausted resilience and coping mechanisms of people across the country. The impacts of the drought, compounded by underlying vulnerabilities due to years of conflict and marginalization, mean that seasonal improvements are fragile and rapid deterioration of the situation continues to be a real threat in many areas, unless significant humanitarian assistance is sustained. Timely investment of resources continues to be crucial to ensure that famine will be kept at bay again in 2018.

Overall improvements in food security and malnutrition, but resilience exhausted. Although the FSNAU post-Deyr seasonal assessment for February-June 2018 indicates a slight improvement in the food security situation compared to 2017, substantive recovery in Somalia will require a sustained period of favorable agricultural seasons and improved stability, which remains unlikely given ongoing insecurity.

Projections for February to June 2018 show that, of the 5.4 million people estimated to be in need, nearly half a million are assessed to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and a further 2.2 million are categorized as being in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).

Several critical geographic priorities remain, with population groups classified as Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4), in central and north, particularly in the disputed regions of Sool and Sanaag, where military tensions between Somaliland and Puntland have reignited and extending into the central regions of Galmudug state. Furthermore, an estimated one million children under-five are also projected to be malnourished in 2018, and in need of urgent life-saving assistance. Although the risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) has decreased, four below average rainy seasons have eroded households’ livelihoods and coping mechanisms, increasing their vulnerability to shocks. With a forecast for a fifth below average rainfall between April and June, it is important that partners focus their work on the protection and restoration of livelihoods, as well as the promotion of basic services to build resilience to these recurrent and ever deepening shocks.

Climate outlook for 2018. After four consecutive poor rainy seasons, the forecast for the 2018 Gu season indicates average to below average Gu rains in most parts of Somalia.

A potential fifth poor rainy season in Somalia will worsen the availability of pasture and water, crop cultivation, livestock reproduction and access to agricultural employment. Water and food prices are also expected to be adversely impacted throughout the country. Moreover, due to the drought, the Shabelle river has run dry in the Jilaal for the third consecutive season south of Jowhar, reducing irrigation potential in the major crop producing areas of the Shabelle basin.

Displacement towards urban centres have diminished but not stopped. There are currently some 2.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia, over one million of whom left their homes in 2017 alone, as a result of the drought, conflict or continued lack of access for humanitarian actors to deliver assistance in their areas of origin. Of those displaced, nearly 40 per cent are in need of humanitarian assistance.

With their livelihoods withering away, many rural Somalis have had few options but to migrate to urban areas to seek humanitarian assistance and services, where they may face discrimination and marginalization. Baidoa and Mogadishu have seen a surge in IDPs arriving from rural areas throughout 2017, particularly from hard-to-reach areas in southern and central Somalia that are controlled by the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab group. Although drought-related displacement declined towards the end of 2017, there is little evidence showing that IDP returns have started or are imminent. The displacement trend has shown a slight increase in January 2018, and is likely to remain a concern in 2018.

Protection concerns and risks remain high for Somalis.

Millions, and in particular children, are affected by protection violations or exposed to risks, which are both a root cause and a grave consequence of the complex crisis in Somalia.

In 2018, 3.6 million Somalis are estimated to be in need of protection interventions, requiring a collective response to address the key protection risks identified, such as exclusion, displacement and direct harm caused by conflict, including gender-based violence and family separation. The detrimental trend of forced evictions of IDPs was highlighted in December 2017, when approximately 4,000 families, or about 24,000 individuals were forcefully evicted from more than 20 informal settlements on the outskirts of the capital of Mogadishu. These evictions represent potential human rights violations and undermine the government’s commitment to find durable solutions for the internally displaced.",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/london-conference-high-level-event-humanitarian-situation-somalia-6-march-2018

Areas in northern and central pastoral parts of the country are experiencing a deterioration in the humanitarian situation as they face high levels of food insecurity.

Somaliland authorities, through the National Disaster Preparedness and Food Authority, declared a drought emergency on 31 January calling for urgent humanitarian assistance in areas facing acute food crisis. In Puntland, on 27 February, the Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA) issued an appeal for urgent humanitarian assistance for over 600,000 drought-affected people. This appeal follows an earlier warning by HADMA on 15 February, regarding the worsening impact of the drought conditions. Priority needs include food, water, health and nutrition assistance.

In these areas, with the majority of people (62 per cent) in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), the need for assistance remains high and urgent, particularly among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and those in rural livelihoods zones. Pastoralists in northern and central regions lost a large percentage of livestock in 2017, and the recovery of herds to pre-crisis levels will require several consecutive favourable seasons.

The post-Deyr analysis by the FAO-managed Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), projects that the expected deterioration of the current poor pasture and water shortages during the dry Jilaal (January – March) season will almost certainly adversely affect livestock reproduction, access to agricultural employment, and water and food prices. Several areas face acute humanitarian needs, mainly those with numerous population groups classified as Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4). In particular, Galmudug and regions of Sool and Sanaag in the north face large basic food gaps. The situation in Sool and Sanaag has been compounded by renewed military tension between Somaliland and Puntland.

The drought, spanning four consecutive below-average rainy seasons, has eroded households’ livelihoods and coping mechanisms, caused mass displacement, and exhausted the resilience of many families across the country. Recovery for the most vulnerable populations will be extremely challenging and slow. Due to these underlying vulnerabilities, seasonal improvements are fragile, with a likely rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation in many areas, unless the assistance levels seen in 2017 are sustained.

Nearly half a million people in Somalia are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and a further 2.2 million are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and are in urgent need of life-saving assistance as their situation will deteriorate by June 2018. Pastoralists are amongst the hardest hit by drought, but crop-dependent areas will feel the impact much earlier than livestock zones. Hotspots, especially where crop failure and livestock deaths are being reported, need to be prioritized for assistance.

The current forecast is for an average to below-average rainfall during the Gu (April – June) rainy season, when most of Somalia’s staple food is grown. According to the latest Climate Outlook, the 2018 Gu season will result in depressed rains in many parts of the country.

This might further exacerbate the existing drought conditions in some areas, as well as aggravate the situation of people in Crisis and Emergency.",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/humanitarian-bulletin-somalia-february-2018
14,somalia,"Access to water is a basic human need, and achieving full coverage remains a challenge in many areas of Somalia. For this reason, and in view of the persistent drought across the Horn of Africa region, there is need for the Somali government, humanitarian and development partners to work together towards a common aim and a sustainable long term solution. Key to this is planning and implementation of interventions for groundwater development, guided by high quality and up to date data/information on the current status of existing water points, and on the potential of major aquifers for further development.

SWALIM initiated a suite of tools and a methodological approach for updating and managing water sources data – the Somalia Water Sources Information Management System (SWIMS). Through SWIMS, data from field partners supplemented by SWALIM’s surveys is assembled in one national database, analysed and communicated through different forums, among them the water sources live map: livemap.faoswalim.org

Between 26th and 28th February 2018 SWALIM participated in a workshop organised by the WASH Cluster and Yme/GSA for partners with expertise in data management and experience in drilling/water source exploitation. The objective of the workshop was to share experiences, challenges, innovations and reforms, and to identify best practices and develop roadmap for groundwater source mapping in Somalia. Senior technical staff from the Federal Government Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MoEWR) including the Director for Water, Director for Planning, and the senior advisor to the Minister - Dr Abdullahi Elmi Mohamed of the Somali Centre for Water and Environment, Stockholm - participated in the workshop. SWALIM played a key role in data provision and analysis to identify priority intervention areas for drought response. The outcome of the workshop was a commitment to improve coverage and quality of data in South and Central Somalia.

SWALIM remains committed to providing technical support to the MoEWR in groundwater studies, monitoring and analysis, with the aim of developing sustainable solutions to water scarcity across the country.

MOGADISHU, Somalia — Three explosions over four days in or near the Somalian capital have left a trail of carnage, killing nearly 20 people and injuring dozens of others, as Islamist militants unleashed a wave of attacks on the country.

On Sunday, a car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint near the Interior Ministry on a road leading to the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu. At least three people, in addition to the bomber, were killed, a police chief said.

The blast sent a plume of black smoke billowing above the skyline.

The police chief, Gen. Bashir Mohamed Jama, said that five other people had been injured in the blast and that the authorities had thwarted two other suicide bombing attacks on Sunday morning.

The Shabab, an Islamist extremist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had killed 13 members of the security forces, although that could not be independently verified.

The group, which has been behind bombings and other attacks in Mogadishu, aims to topple Somalia’s Western-backed federal government.

Earlier on Sunday, another car bomb exploded in Siinka Dheer, outside Mogadishu, but the toll was not immediately clear. Some reports said that one person had been killed, along with the driver.

Mogadishu’s mayor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, also known as Yariisow, condemned the attacks, saying, “These terror acts will not stop us.”

Dr. Abdulkadir Adan, from Mogadishu’s only emergency services unit, said, “Our vehicles and rescue teams immediately reached the Sayid checkpoint to rescue civilian injured at the scene.”

Mohamed Abdulle, a resident of Mogadishu, said in a phone interview on Sunday, “I personally saw and counted the deaths of three people; they were civilians.” He added, “I could also see many motorbikes and cars, which were completely burned and destroyed by the blast.”

The explosions occurred days after a bomb went off outside the Weheliye Hotel in the city, killing at least 14 people, mostly young entrepreneurs, and injuring at least 10 others on Thursday afternoon, according to the police and rescue services.

Abdiasis Ali Ibrahim, the spokesman for the internal security minister, confirmed the death toll to the state-run Radio Mogadishu. The Shabab also claimed responsibility for that attack.

The second car bomb on Sunday was detonated at a checkpoint after soldiers stopped a suspicious vehicle, a senior police captain, Mohamed Hussein, told The Associated Press. Those who died included two soldiers, he said, while many of the nearly 10 people wounded were rickshaw drivers.

Officer Mohamed Abdi told The A.P. that the earlier explosion that day had occurred after soldiers inspected another “suspicious” car that was stuck on a road in the Siinka Dheer area.

Somalia sustained one of its deadliest attacks in October, when a double truck bombing killed 512 people. The attack came as the United States, under President Trump, has made a renewed push to defeat the Shabab, which has terrorized Somalia and elsewhere in East Africa for years, killing civilians across borders, worsening famine and destabilizing a broad stretch of the region.

Last year, the country’s president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared war on the militant group even as he offered amnesty to its fighters, whom he referred to as “brainwashed youth.” But the wave of attacks has continued.

American forces have stepped up efforts against the Shabab, with the military carrying out about 30 airstrikes in Somalia last year, twice as many as in 2016.

In 2017, the Pentagon presented the White House with an operational plan that envisioned at least two more years of combat against Islamist militants there, with the United States military handing over the country’s security to Somalia’s forces. But officials have said that Somali forces are not yet ready.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/africa/somalia-bombing-mogadishu-shabab.html

The much publicised security fence on the Kenya-Somalia border has temporarily stopped to allow further negations between the two states.

This was revealed on Friday by Mandera Governor Ali Roba and his Gedo counterpart Mohamed A. Mohamed from Somalia.

BORDER WALL

While on a meet-the-people tour in the border towns of Mandera and Bulahawa, they said the two countries have agreed to temporarily stop the project that would separate the two towns.

According to the two, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo will soon meet to agree on a few “thorny issues” before the project proceeds.

Governor Roba said the decision was reached to quell the rising tension among people who live near the border.

“There is a lot of negative propaganda particularly on the Somalia side with respect to border security programme but we are here to confirm that all that is false,” said Mr Roba.

He said locals on the Somalia side of the border have been made to believe that the fence would lead to their eviction and the demolition of their houses.

TALKS

The Mandera governor said consultations have been ongoing for the past two-and-a-half years over the security programme initiated by the Kenyan government.

The construction has been slow since its inception in 2015 because the local community has to be involved at every stage.

“We are here as neighbouring governors to inform the public that the project has been halted so that a solution for the houses lying directly on the border can be found,” he said.

This, he said, was agreed on during a meeting last week attended by North Eastern Regional Coordinator Mohamud Saleh in Mandera Town.

“I can confirm the contractor has been asked to demobilise temporarily pending engagement by the two national governments to discuss a solution in an amicable way,” he said.

AGREE

Gedo Governor Mohamed said Presidents Kenyatta and Farmajo had already talked on the phone and agreed to meet soon.

“Our message here is that the construction stops until the two national governments come together to agree on some issues on the table,” he said.

According to Governor Mohamed, issues to be discussed include the reason for the project, its effects on daily activities and the fate of the homes that would be affected.

Mr Mohamed wants the Kenyan government to consider the social interaction of the communities along the border before separating them with a wall.

“The people living here have a long history of depending on one another and separating them needs negotiations to solve the problem,” he said.

Sixty-four homes have been marked for demolition along the border to allow the completion of the project, which is supervised by the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) engineering department.

SECURITY

Kenya announced it would build a security wall to prevent Al-Shabaab militants from getting into the country, following the deadly April 2, 2015 attack at Garissa University College that left 148 people dead. Most of those killed were students.

The project was later changed to a wire fencing with a parallel trench. Eight kilometres have been completed.

However, the residents on the Somalia side of the border opposed the project and demanded to be compensated for their houses that are in the no man’s land. They have been marked for demolition.

They also asked the Kenyan Government to accept those who have Kenyan ID cards to settle in Mandera.

Some demands that the Kenyan Government is reluctant to implement include allowing students from Somalia to learn freely in Mandera.",https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/mandera/Work-on-Kenya-Somalia-border-wall-suspended/1183298-4365052-6no6kuz/

All three terrorists share a Somali connection. Of course these incidents are rare, and represent a small fraction of the population of young European Somalis.

Nonetheless, in recent years there has been a spate of attacks involving young Europeans of Somali origin, putting this community, who constitute one of the largest refugee Muslim communities in Europe, firmly in the spotlight.

For the past few years we have been researching this generation of young Somalis in Europe, many of whom have disengaged from the varied indigenous Islam of their parents’ generation, and began a distinct journey to diaspora Somali Islam, connecting the young Somali in Helsinki, Oslo and London.

We have also investigated why a small number of them – a so-called ""generation jihad"" - have adopted a far less tolerant and more radical Salafi form of Islam, entirely alien to their parents' generation, and culture, and sometimes, functioning as a stepping stone to violence.

Somalis are some of Europe’s oldest and youngest African migrants. Following the outbreak of civil war in 1991, which triggered significant migration, the country was known as the world’s ""most failed state,"" though in recent years it has transited into a ""fragile state.""

Now, Somali communities can be found crowded in urban pockets in cities like Oslo, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Leicester and Malmo. The UK is home to the oldest and largest Somali diaspora outside Africa.

Somalis are some of the UK’s oldest and newest migrants; a small population arrived in the 19th century from the British-Somaliland protectorate to work as seamen in port cities such as Cardiff, Liverpool and London’s Docklands; later they were joined by refugees from the civil war. In the UK, the 2011 census recorded just over 101,000 people of Somalis living in the UK.

Note that this only records individuals actually born in Somalia. ""Somali"" is not given a separate ethnic checkbox in most censuses, as those British citizens of Turkish or Pakistani origins have as an option. Somalis in the UK, as elsewhere in Europe, generally come under the umbrella ""Black African"" category, which makes it difficult to estimate the numbers of European-born Somalis. But the truer figure of Somalis in the UK is believed to be close to 250,000.

Somalis are unusually mobile across national borders in Europe, and their intra-European mobility is particularly directed towards the UK. Thousands of people from Somalia have come to the UK from other EU member states as EU nationals from, for example, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. Estimates suggest 20,000 Somalis have arrived from the Netherlands alone. Studies show that between one third and a half of the entire Dutch Somali community has moved to the UK. Smaller numbers have come from Nordic countries, including 4,000 from Denmark.

Elsewhere in Europe, the history of Somali immigration is a more recent phenomenon. There were only 49 Somalis in Finland in 1990; today there are over 16,000, the largest non-white minority population in the country. In 1984 just 87 Somalis were registered in Norway, today the number is close to 30,000 – but again this only records first generation Somalis, the true figure is likely to be much higher.

Across Scandinavia this picture is repeated: Sweden has 57,000 Somalis, the second highest population of Somalis in Europe. In Denmark, the population is at 18,000, and The Netherlands is home to 34,000 Somalis.

The majority of young Somalis came to Europe as children or were born there, though Somalis do continue arriving on Europe’s shores, most through the infamously dangerous migrant trail from Libya to Italy.

Since 9/11, there has been a fraught conversation in Europe around issues of ""shared values,"" citizenship and belonging around people of a Muslim background. The ""war on terror"" led to a binary divide in Europe between good vs bad migrant, and moderate vs radical Muslim.

And second-generation Somalis found themselves to be on the wrong sides of these binaries - in particular, second-generation Somalis.

In negotiating these binary divides, Somalis are not alone. Radicalization is a phenomenon that has affected all Muslim communities.

Key triggers include marginalization, stigmatization, lack of integration and poor school performance, and the pervasiveness of internet radicalization, especially propaganda videos on Facebook and YouTube.

But what does set Somalis apart is that their native country is home to al-Shabaab, arguably Africa’s most potent terrorist group. For the last few years a number of young ethnic Somalis have embraced jihad; some have returned to Europe; a number have died in fighting for al-Shabaab in Somalia.

Another experience that also sets Somalis apart from other Muslims in Europe is that they are a refugee community whose members are visibly Muslim and black, and already amongst the most vilified migrant communities in Europe.

From Norway, UK, Finland to the Netherlands a negative collective perception precedes Somalis. Somalis are framed as a troublesome group at the intersection of European fears over immigration and security, and young second-generation Somalis are coming of age in this atmosphere of fear and suspicion against them.

Somali lives in Europe are often already framed through a problematizing lens. As researchers we have encountered questions from journalists, politicians and social services such as, ""What is it about Somalis?""

European newspapers are peppered with negative collective stereotypes of Somalis. They are represented as ""violent criminals,"" ""oppressed veil-clad women,” ""benefit cheats"" and ""terrorists.""

It hasn’t helped that despite the relatively few incidents, jihadi extremists from the Somali community ‘win’ a high profile. The ""Terror Twins"", two gifted young Somali girls born in Manchester whose brother joined ISIS in Syria and whom he secretly recruited to join, were the subject of intense media coverage and speculation.

To understand the specific triggers that have driven Europeans of Somali origin to terrorism, it’s worth examining some of the key features of their biographies. Here, we present two profiles, based on interviews we carried out.

Mohamed was 8 years old when he arrived as a refugee from Mogadishu to a housing project in north London. Enrolled at a public school, he was immediately the target of bullies, teased for his poor English, and got into fights. By the time he left for high school, he had toughened up and began to take on the bullies.

Soon enough he won ""respect"" by joining a gang. Tutored by older Somali youth he began to sell cannabis before moving on to harder drugs such as crack and cocaine. He began carrying a knife to defend himself - gang turf wars are not uncommon. One day in the autumn of 2013 he was attacked by rival gang and repeatedly stabbed.

When he came out of hospital he took his spot again, but began to change his tone and attitude. He became tired of the constant run-ins with police, guilty for causing his mother pain, and one day he met a friend, Ahmed, a Somali boy with a similar history who told him he had found a new path through Islam. Ahmed convinced Mohamed to attend a small Islamic prayer circle ran by a neighborhood imam. That imam was not connected to the local Somali-oriented mosque but was instead a Salafi preacher known to the UK security services.

Mohamed dropped his old life. He became an informal preacher on the streets of London. He stopped the occasional beer, cannabis joints and young women. He handed out leaflets chastising British and Western foreign policy in the Muslim world. He gradually became more restless and angry critical of his fellow Brits.

Mohammed’s new identity was a form of protection against British society where he didn’t feel accepted; he chose instead to assert his Islamic identity. He began to consider how he could help his fellow Muslims abroad. He wanted to study the Quran in Egypt, but he thought it preferable to go to Somalia or Syria, where he could freely practice his newfound hardline Islamic identity. But Mohamed has never left London; he is still here, working as an Islamic teacher.

Like Mohamed, Ibrahim, who is composite character based on several different interviews, also had challenges integrating. Ibrahim was born to Somali parents in the Netherlands who decided to move their family to Leicester in England at the age of 12. He struggled to fit in. He was Dutch and Somali, a confusing mix for local kids and he had to learn English.

During his teens he did not care much about his Muslim identity, but he became friends with other young Muslims and that piqued his interest. He started to attend a prayer group and became part of an online Islamist community. Soon enough he became involved with a radical group, and was monitored by the security services.

He traveled to Kenya, and then onto Somalia with several friends. His cover was his ambition to work as a humanitarian volunteer but his mission was to join al-Shabaab, which has close links with Al-Qaeda. Suddenly he disappeared; his parents made enquiries, and he eventually turned up in neighboring Kenya.

He failed to be recruited by al-Shabaab and returned to the UK, where he was questioned by the security services and released. He has now come to regret his journey and is making efforts to get a job.

Are Somalis more prone than other immigrant Muslim groups towards radicalization? In many cases jihadi recruiters are aware of Somali youth’s fragile sense of integration and tend to target this weak spot.

As recent arrivals to Europe, their stories are different to postcolonial Muslim migrants who arrived after 1945, or to Moroccans and Turks who came as Europe's ""guest workers"" in the 1970s.

Another complication for Somalis is that they are black – and have faced racism within and outside the Muslim community. Most mosques tend to be run by Muslims of Indian sub-continent or Middle Eastern background, but when Somalis began to arrive in large numbers in the 1990s, they faced a double block to integration and communal life.

A group of Muslim refugees pray at the Palazzo Condo, a hostel for refugees in Satriano, Italy. Feb. 15, 2016 Bloomberg

The story of Somali radicalization is about failures at the heart of integration. Across Europe young Somalis struggle to become Dutch, Finnish or British.

Though ideology is important to some young Somalis who get radicalized, usually this is overstated – not least by the popular media - at the at the expense of harder questions about issues of unemployment, alienation and discrimination. Somalis remain largely cut-off from the labour market in many European countries. In particular, the lack of Somali women participating in the Labour market hampers their integration.

European states have responded with a plethora of security responses. In the Netherlands, Somalis have been deported back into the middle of a civil war and in the UK, those Somali-born nationals who have been involved in radical activities or who have been suspected of belonging to terror groups have been stripped of their British passports.

However, thesa security responses have done little to dissuade young Somalis becoming radicalized.

An anti-radicalization strategy without an integration strategy won’t stop more young Europeans of Somali descent dying for jihad.

The UAE began construction of the base last year, under an agreement with officials in Somaliland, a northern region of Somalia that self-declared independence from the latter in 1991 following a civil war.

Earlier this month, the UAE said it would train Somaliland security forces, including the police and the military, as part of the deal.

The UAE is simultaneously investing in developing the port itself, which is strategically located close to Yemen, where UAE troops have been fighting as part of a Saudi-led military coalition against Houthi rebels since 2015.

DP World, the world's fourth-largest port operator based in Dubai, said in 2016 it would invest as much as $442m to develop the Berbera port. The deal also includes the government of Ethiopia, which took a 19 percent stake in the port.

Osman's statements come after Somalia's parliament voted to ban DP World from operating in the country and rejected the development venture.

Somaliland, however, said the vote would not affect the agreement.

DP World has been facing several problems in its contracts in the region. Last month, neighbouring Djibouti terminated its deal with the company to run a container terminal.

23,somalia,"MOGADISHU, Somalia - The political crisis in Somalia is deepening after MPs announced that the deadline for an impeachment motion against Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari lapsed, Garowe Online reports.

After a late night meeting the Villa Hargeisa, the Speaker’s residence in the Presidential Palace in Mogadishu, 120 lawmakers released a statement nullifying the motion after the 10-day deadline set for the vote expired March 28.

This came after the Senate Committee has announced mediation talks and efforts to resolve the current political stalemate between rival legislators within the Lower House of the Federal Parliament have failed.

The MPs have claimed that the proposed no-confidence motion against the Speaker fell short the required two-thirds majority of the Lower House which is 184, as a result, it is null and void, urging the speaker to resume work.

Meanwhile, the opposition Parliamentarians allied to the office of the Somali PM Hassan Ali Khaire insist that the voting for the controversial anti-speaker motion will take place next Saturday, on 31st March.

Jawari who has been the Speaker of Parliament since 2012 is accused of being violating the constitution and an impediment in the Parliament procedures.

The speaker's camp blamed PM Khaire for being responsible the current standoff and plotting the motion as several of his cabinet members, who are also MPs are among the signatures.

They warned that President Farmajo and his PM will take the responsibility for the dire consequences that will result from the ongoing political deadlock which could lead to the ""collapse"" of the National Institutions.

Somalia is currently facing political woes and disagreements between the Executive and Legislative branches of the government that were not expected especially at this critical time the country is beset by insecurity.

When she returned to search for him, she found only a grave. He was among the 260,000 Somalis who perished.

“You can never forget leaving your child to die,” she says, wiping away tears at the memory seven years later. “It is a hell that does not end.”

This time, the drought has been harsher. Three seasons of rains have failed, instead of two. But none of Mohamed’s other children have died - and the overall death toll, although unknown, is far lower. The United Nations has documented just over 1,000 deaths, mostly from drinking dirty water.

Why?

Earlier donor intervention, less interference by a weakened Islamist insurgency, a stronger Somali government and greater access for aid workers have been crucial.

Another reason is that aid agencies are shifting from giving out food to cash - a less wasteful form of aid that donors such as Canada, Europe and Australia have embraced, although the United States still has restrictions on food aid.

The U.S. Congress will debate a move toward cash-based aid this year when lawmakers vote on a new Farm Bill. Christopher Barrett, an expert on food aid at Cornell University, is one of many scholars, politicians and aid agencies demanding reform.

“A conservative estimate is that we sacrifice roughly 40,000 children’s lives annually because of antiquated food aid policies,” he told Congress in November.

FROM FOOD TO CASH

In 2011, a few donors gave out cash in Somalia, but the World Food Programme only gave out food. It was often hijacked by warlords or pirates, or rotted under tarpaulins as trucks sat at roadblocks.

Starving families had to trek for days through the desert to reach distribution points. Their route became so littered with children’s corpses it was called “the Road of Death”.

Now, more than 70 percent of WFP aid in Somalia is cash, much of it distributed via mobile phones. More than 50 other charities are also giving out cash: each month Mohamed receives $65 from the Italian aid group Coopi to spend as she wants: milk, medicine, food or school fees.

Cash has many advantages over food aid if markets are functioning. It’s invisible, so less likely to be stolen. It’s mobile so families can move or stay put.

WFP said it gave out $134 million directly to Somali families to spend at local shops last year.

“We ... basically gave confidence to the market to stay active,” said Laurent Bukera, head of WFP Somalia.

And money is more efficient than bags of food: in Somalia, cash aid means 80 cents in every $1 goes directly to the family, rather than 60 cents from food aid, said Calum McLean, the cash expert at the European Union’s humanitarian aid department.

Cash might have saved little Abdirahman.

“I could have stayed in my village if I had had cash. There was some food in the markets. It was expensive, but if you had money, there was food to buy,” Mohamed said sadly.

GLOBAL SHIFT

Aid groups have been experimenting with cash for two decades but McLean says the idea took off five years ago as the Syrian civil war propelled millions of refugees into countries with solid banking systems.

Donors have adapted. Six years ago, five percent of the EU’s humanitarian aid budget was cash distributions. Today, it is more than a third.

Most of the initial cost lies in setting up the database and the distribution system. After that, adding more recipients is cheap, McLean said. Amounts can be easily adjusted depending on the level of need or funding.

“Cash distributions also becomes cheaper the larger scale you do it,” he said.

Most U.S. international food assistance is delivered by USAID’s Food for Peace Office, which had a budget of $3.6 billion in 2017.

Just under half those funds came through U.S. Farm Bill Title II appropriations, which stipulate that most food must be bought from American farmers. The U.S. Cargo Preference Act requires that half of this be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels.

Despite these restrictions, Food for Peace increased cash and voucher programs from 3 percent of the budget in 2011 to 20 percent last year.

But sourcing food aid in the United States is expensive and wasteful, said Barrett, who oversaw a study that found buying grain close to an emergency was half the price and 14 weeks faster. Arguments that food aid supported U.S. farmers or mariners were largely false, he said.

HOW IT WORKS

Aid groups use different systems to distribute cash, but most assess families, then register them in a biometric database, usually via fingerprints. Cash is distributed using bank cards or mobile phones or as vouchers.

Some charities place no restrictions on the cash; others, like WFP, stipulate it can only be spent at certain shops with registered shopkeepers.

In Dollow, the dusty town on the Ethiopian border where Mohamed lives with her surviving children, families say the cash has transformed their lives.

Gacalo Aden Hashi, a young mother whose name means “sweetheart”, remembers trudging past two dead children in 2011 on her way to get help. A third was alive but dying, she said, and her weakened family had to press on.

When she arrived at the camp, men were stealing food aid to give to their families, she said.

“Men were punching each other in line every time at food distributions,” she said. “Sometimes you would be sitting and suddenly your food would be taken by some strong young man.”

Now, she says, no one can steal her money - Coopi uses a system that requires a PIN to withdraw money. Most of her cash goes on food but with a group of other women she saved enough to open a small stall.

“The cash may end, but this business will not,” she said.

PROBLEMS PERSIST

Cash won’t work everywhere. In South Sudan, where famine briefly hit two counties last year, the civil war shut markets, forcing aid agencies to bring in food by plane and truck.

Sending cash to areas hit by earthquakes would drive up prices. But in a drought, where livelihoods have collapsed but infrastructure is intact, cash transfers are ideal, experts say.

Some problems remain. There’s often little co-ordination among donors - for instance, there are seven separate databases in Somalia, said McLean, and monthly stipends can vary widely.

In Uganda, authorities are investigating reports of fraud after the government used its own biometric registration system for refugees.

And if there’s no clean water or health service available, then refugees can’t spend money buying water or medicine.

But most scholars agree that switching to more cash aid would save more lives, a 2016 briefing paper by the Congressional Research Service concluded.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-aid/a-child-dies-a-child-lives-why-somalia-drought-is-not-another-famine-idUSKBN1GZ24I
25,somalia,"OTTAWA, Ontario — Former Canadian freelance journalist Amanda Lindhout says she has crippling flashbacks and sometimes wakes up screaming due to her kidnapping ordeal in Somalia.

At a sentencing hearing Wednesday for hostage-taker Ali Omar Ader, a tearful Lindhout said the sexual assault, beatings and emotional trauma she suffered in captivity filled her with pain and self-loathing.

Lindhout and Australian photographer Nigel Brennan were seized near Mogadishu in August 2008. Both were released in November 2009 in exchange for a ransom payment. Her story was published in the best-selling book “A House in the Sky.”

Ader, a 40-year-old Somalian national, faces up to life in prison after being convicted of hostage-taking late last year.

Ontario Superior Court Justice Robert Smith ruled that Ader was a “willing participant” in the kidnapping
