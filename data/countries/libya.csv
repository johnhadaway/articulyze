Tunis/Brussels, 8 May 2018

The surprise electoral defeat of one Libyan leader and the hospitalisation of a rival show the error of relying solely on individuals to achieve national reconciliation in Libya. All sides in Libya’s conflict should focus instead on making institutions more representative and improving governance.

I. Overview

Seven years after the uprising that toppled Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi, Libya remains in turmoil. In the last month, two surprise developments have roiled Libyan politics anew. Each demonstrates how misguided it is to depend entirely on individuals to resolve the conflict ongoing since 2014. Excessive focus on personalities, in fact, can obstruct rather than promote peace efforts.

The first event was the 8 April election of Khaled Mishri as president of the Tripoli-based High State Council, a consultative body established under the 2015 Libyan Political Agreement. He succeeded Abderrahman Swehli, who had headed the State Council since its creation in 2016. Mishri is a member of the Justice and Construction Party, which is close to the Muslim Brotherhood; his affiliation is likely to arouse the suspicion of eastern Libyans who dislike Islamists. Any friction could scuttle or delay the implementation or amendment of the 2015 agreement, which will require a deal between the State Council and its political rival, the Tobruk-based House of Representatives. The Tobruk legislators have yet to officially recognise the agreement’s legality.

The second development was the mid-April hospitalisation (in France) of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, general commander of the Libyan National Army, a coalition that controls most of eastern Libya. Nominally, Haftar answers to the House of Representatives, but he has his own power base, and is a key actor in negotiations to reunite Libya. He appeared well enough upon his return to Benghazi on 26 April, stopping to address his supporters, but it remains unclear why he was hospitalised. According to independent sources close to the coalition, Haftar had a stroke, and also suffers from a chronic illness. Whether his poor health will allow him to continue leading his men or force him to step down is an open question.

Until these unexpected events, Haftar and Swehli were two of four personalities considered indispensable to the project of reuniting Libya. The other two are Faiez Serraj, the head of the Presidency Council (which heads the internationally recognised government in Tripoli), and Aghela Saleh, president of the House of Representatives. Most international efforts to implement the Libyan Political Agreement focused on securing an understanding among these four men, each of whom has proven he can be a spoiler.

Swehli’s ouster and Haftar’s ill health should serve as reminders that a lasting peace agreement cannot be predicated on “dividing the cake” among a few individuals. As long as one person or faction reaps all the benefits of power, others will mobilise against them. This dynamic has been a constant feature of Libyan politics since 2014. It fosters a cycle of counter-narratives and revenge attacks that undermines chances of bridging the country’s rifts.

Efforts to reconcile Libyans should instead aim to ensure the inclusivity and representativeness of existing political institutions, take into account the needs of their constituents, and improve their ability to deliver services. As it stands, these institutions mainly serve the interests of the handful of men who lead them.",Libya’s Unhealthy Focus on Personalities,https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-s-unhealthy-focus-personalities
1,libya,"International humanitarian organization, Doctors without borders says it is concerned about the fate of hundreds of migrants and refugees, including women and children being held in a dangerously overcrowded detention centre in Libya.

The organization says many have been held for more than five months in the port city of Zuwara, some 100 kilometers in western Libya.

Head of MSF’s emergencies desk, Karline Kleijer said “the situation is critical”.

We strongly urge all international agencies with a presence in Libya, representatives from countries of origin and the Libyan authorities to do everything they can to find a solution for these people over the next few days.

The group says these people are kept in inhumane conditions without adequate food or water, adding that more than 500 people have been detained in the past two weeks alone, far exceeding the centre’s capacity.

On May 1, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) airlifted 88 people in need of international protection out of Zuwara. They were taken to a detention centre in Tripoli with a view to identifying the most vulnerable cases for potential evacuation abroad.

The Libyan authorities have transferred some people to other detention centres in an attempt to reduce the extreme overcrowding and the International Organization for Migration has initiated a process of “voluntary humanitarian return” for some detainees. However, hundreds of people remain trapped inside the detention centre in Zuwara with no solution in sight.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, managed to deliver this week urgently needed assistance to hundreds of displaced Libyan families in the town of Murzuk, in southern Libya. Humanitarian help is desperately needed in this region of Libya where recent deadly clashes between armed groups in and around the city of Sabha (some 760 km south of Tripoli) have forced an estimated 1,900 Libyan families to flee their homes.

A UNHCR emergency aid convoy left the Libyan capital Tripoli on 4 April. The convoy, consisting of seven trucks loaded with basic aid items was able to enter Sabha the following day where we distributed humanitarian assistance to 850 displaced families. Access to Murzuq and Oubari further south was initially blocked due to security reasons, and the aid had to wait in Sabha.

However, earlier this week, the local population began using the main roads from Sabha to Murzuk. This gave UNHCR a window of opportunity to urgently deliver core relief items to the city of Murzuk where on Wednesday (18 April) 370 displaced families finally received much needed aid.

The displaced Libyan population in the south badly needs adequate shelter and basic household items including hygiene kits, sleeping mats, mattresses and kitchen sets. To make matters worse, humanitarian access to this part of Libya has been restricted for weeks and the situation remains extremely volatile. Many have sought refuge in local schools, hospitals and other public buildings.

In Libya, currently more than 184,000 internally displaced people are in need of humanitarian assistance as well as 368,000 people who have recently returned to their homes. UNHCR continues to advocate on their behalf and to provide relief until they can find durable solutions, including returning home on a voluntary basis and in conditions of dignity and safety.

To respond to the needs of more than half a million Libyans uprooted by the conflict, UNHCR has increased its capacity and resources by 300 percent in recent months.

3,libya,"N’Djamena – On 28 April, 56 Chadian men – including 17 unaccompanied children – were assisted by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, after an operation conducted two days earlier by police forces at the Libyan border.

The operation targeted a network of traffickers transporting individuals to Libya, and led to the arrest of several criminals suspected of migrant trafficking. The 56 persons on board the two vehicles which were transporting them were found in bad physical condition, and were immediately transferred to the IOM sub-office in Faya, 300 kilometres from the Libyan border.

The 17 children were taken care of by the Chadian Red Cross, and the 39 adults received assistance (food and emergency shelter) from IOM. Individuals with serious health conditions (dehydration) were immediately referred to the nearest health centre. In coordination with the local authorities, IOM is now seeking to provide safe travel conditions to all those who wish to return home.

“When we were stopped by the police, we didn’t understand what was happening,” said Mahamet, a Chadian man rescued during the operation. “We didn’t know where we were. When we arrived at the IOM office, the situation was explained to us. We didn’t even know that our own security could be in danger when continuing this journey. When I left home, I didn’t know how difficult this would be. We were so thirsty and hungry, having sat in the blazing sun for hours. I cannot wait to return home. This has been a horrible experience.”

IOM Chad provided the emergency assistance with the financial support of US Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) but additional funds should be mobilized to respond to the increasing migratory pressure in the country.

“In recent weeks, more and more vulnerable migrants like this group are being referred to IOM Chad as movements through Chad are continuously increasing, and migrants often find themselves in life-threatening situations when crossing the desert unprepared,” said Anne Kathrin Schaefer, Chief of Mission of IOM Chad. “While IOM Chad is ready to support, our means and resources are extremely limited and we cannot cope with the increasing demands for humanitarian assistance.”

Recent migration trends in Chad and the security situation in the Lake Chad basin region have increased the pressure on local actors and international agencies such as IOM who do not have the required means to efficiently manage migration flows towards North Africa. In 2018, two Flow Monitoring Points (FMP) were put in place by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) teams in Zouarke and Faya, two areas considered as the key transit points for migration flows towards Niger and Libya. Data collected in these two new FMPs as well as the existing one in Kalait will provide more accurate information on movements towards and from Chad.

In addition, the Tibesti Region in northern Chad, at the border with Libya, continues to attract sub-Saharan workers particularly due to the presence of gold mines considered by some people as an opportunity to make some money before continuing their journey up to Libya. Victims of trafficking were reported by the local authorities who indicated that some of the people transported by traffickers paid by “recruiters” were forced to work in the mines without payment to fully reimburse transportation and “placement” fees.

Financial support to Chad is therefore urgently needed to ensure a global approach to migration management, as well as the dignity and protection of returning migrants and migrants in transit countries.

4,libya,"ROME (Reuters) - Nigerian migrants who survived a deadly sea crossing last year filed a lawsuit against Italy for violating their rights by supporting Libya’s efforts to return them to North Africa, their lawyers said on Tuesday.

Seventeen plaintiffs petitioned the European Court of Human Rights last week, Violeta Moreno-Lax, a legal advisor for the Global Legal Action Network, told reporters. She was among four lawyers and several humanitarian groups involved in the case.

The migrants say Italy violated multiple articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including that people not be subjected to torture, held in slavery, or have their lives put in danger.

The United Nations, rights groups and news organizations say migrants face these conditions in Libya.

This is the first lawsuit to be filed against Italy for its decision to back the Libyan Coast Guard. The country lost a case in the same court in 2012 for directly handing over migrants intercepted at sea to Libyan authorities.

The legal process can take up to three years but should the migrants win they can be awarded damages, and Italy would be forced to abandon its policy of equipping, training and coordinating the Libyan Coast Guard, Moreno-Lax said.

“Using the Libyan Coast Guard as a proxy to turn back migrant boats is just a new way of camouflaging (Italy’s) strategy of fighting irregular migration in the Mediterranean by trapping them in what the Italian Foreign Ministry itself has qualified as ‘the hell’ of Libya,” Moreno-Lax said.

The lawsuit highlights a stand-off between humanitarian groups seeking to save lives on the open seas and Italian authorities backed by the European Union who are trying to stop people from making the dangerous crossing in the first place.

A spokesman for Italy’s Interior Ministry, which has spearheaded the policy, had no immediate comment.

Libyan naval spokesman Ayoub Qassem said the coast guard does its job within the terms agreed with Italy.

“Regarding the abuse and violations against the migrants, these are all considered as individual acts ... We can’t say Libyan state institutions commit these acts,” Qassem said.

SEA CROSSINGS DOWN

Italy has supplied Libya with seven refurbished vessels so far, and three more have been promised, while the EU has trained about 190 Libyan coastguards.

Italy is also coordinating communications with the Libyan Coast Guard about possible boats in distress, according to court documents filed recently in Sicily.

Between 2014 and 2017, more than 600,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores, but crossings have fallen dramatically since Italy and Libya signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at stemming the migration flow in February of last year.

During the first five months of this year, arrivals from Libya fell more than 80 percent versus last year to 6,700 during, official data show. Over the same period, the Libyan Coast Guard intercepted almost 6,000 migrants and refugees. In 2017, the Libyans turned back almost 19,000.

Two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were intercepted and returned to Libya. They said they were held for two months in a detention center where they were subjected to beatings and extortion, and where even basic food and healthcare was not provided, before returning to Nigeria with the International Organization for Migration.

All the plaintiffs were rescued at sea on Nov. 6 as at least 20 migrants drowned when a part of their rubber boat deflated.

German humanitarian ship Sea Watch 3 rescued 59 people that day and collected the body of a small child, all of whom were brought to Italy.

The Libyan naval vessel, which had been donated by Italy and was operated mainly by a crew trained by the EU, returned 47 to Libya. In a video shot by Sea Watch, the Libyans are seen beating the migrants they intercepted with a rope, and the vessel then speeds off with a man clinging to the side.

Among the survivors returned to Libya, two were subsequently sold to a smuggler and tortured with electricity in an attempt to extort money from their families, said Charles Heller, co-founder of the Forensic Oceanography project, which prepared a report to support the lawsuit.",Nigerian migrants sue Italy for aiding Libyan coast guard,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-italy/nigerian-migrants-sue-italy-for-aiding-libyan-coast-guard-idUSKBN1I9206

“The humanitarian situation in Libya is critical, not only for refugees and displaced people … but as a whole,” said Amin Awad, director of the Middle East and North Africa Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

“Public services, health, education and other services are not available, and there are almost none in many areas,” he added.

The UN official stressed that “most of the Libyan people today are in need of humanitarian aid because of the deteriorating living conditions and the lack of services.

“Definitely in the last seven months, we have seen progress on the ground. Still fragile progress, still limited progress, but the trend compared to the past I believe is rather encouraging and needs to be further supported.

Seventeen Nigerians who survived the 2017 migrant boat sinking have sued Italy who they believe connived with Libya to have them tortured and dehumanized in detention camps, the AP reports.

On November 6, 2017, a boat carrying 130 migrants, most of them Nigerian, sank off the coast of Libya.

The Libyan coast guard perched aboard the Italian-provided Ras Jadir vessel, arrived the scene first to rescue the drowning migrants.

The German aid group Sea Watch 3 also responded with dinghies and rescued some 59 people.

An estimated 20 people drowned on the day. Most of them Nigerians.

Legal and human rights organisations who are backing the Nigerians on the case, told a press conference that the Italians used EU funds to train and equip the Libyan coast guard to patrol its coasts and bring migrants back.

Italy defends itself

The Nigerians also allege that the Italians gave tacit approval to the slavery, torture and other degrading and inhuman treatment unleashed on them by Libyans.

The AP reports that Italy has defended its support of the Libyan coast guard.

Italian officials say the policy has saved lives and slowed to a trickle the number of migrants who risk their lives paying Libyan-based smugglers to ferry them to Europe aboard flimsy dinghies.

6,731 migrants have arrived Italy so far from Libya in 2018, 84 percent down from 2017 and 78 percent down from the year before, according to interior ministry figures.

But human rights groups say that under its policy, Italy is shirking its international responsibilities to rescue migrants at sea and bring them to safety.

Nigeria has been evacuating most of its citizens from Libya in the wake of the migrant scandal which exposed how Nigerians and citizens of other African countries were often beaten and kept in detention camps in Libya; with little or no food.

8,libya,"But General Hifter’s ascent has been called into question with news that the 75-year-old commander had been airlifted to a hospital in Paris, where French news media reported that he was being treated for a stroke. After initial denials, his aides privately conceded on Thursday that he had undergone emergency medical treatment. But they offered no specifics about his condition or his whereabouts.

The mystery plunged Libya’s chaotic politics into greater-than-usual levels of speculation. If restoring some order to eastern Libya after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi depended on the force of General Hifter’s personality, there were fears of a descent into violent feuding if he were suddenly out of the picture.

“There was a time last year when Hifter was the man of the hour — people were speculating he could make it to Tripoli,” said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of “The Burning Shores: Inside the Battle for the New Libya.” “Then things cooled off a bit, and cracks appeared in his coalition. And now nobody’s sure what will come next.”

Foreign Friends

Amid the competing militias ranging in post-Qaddafi Libya, General Hifter rose to power with the help of foreign firepower and a canny ability to play allies off one another. Warplanes deployed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt pummeled his enemies and helped him capture oil terminals. French paramilitaries fought on his front lines in Benghazi, where three were killed in 2016. Saudi Arabia provided funding.

And to the discomfort of American officials, Russian special forces commandos last year delivered ammunition and intelligence to General Hifter from their bases in western Egypt, a former American intelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.

For much of his life, General Hifter was tied to the United States.

In the late 1980s, as a senior Libyan army officer living in exile in Chad, he led a C.I.A.-backed effort to oust Colonel Qaddafi. The plot failed and General Hifter ended up in suburban Virginia, where he lived for two decades, eventually becoming a naturalized American citizen, the former official said.

But after he returned to Libya in 2011 with brash ambitions of seizing power, American officials kept him at arms length.

Since 2015, American policy has backed the rival United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, a notoriously weak administration, which barely controls a single district of the capital but which remains the main Western hope for a political solution in Libya. The unity government’s prime minister, Fayez Serraj, met with President Trump in the White House in December.

In the past year, though, as General Hifter’s troops racked up major victories — advancing across Benghazi and seizing Libya’s biggest oil terminal — European leaders started to openly court him.

Last summer, he traveled to Paris at the invitation of President Emmanuel Macron, met Italy’s defense minister in Rome, and welcomed the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to his fortified hilltop headquarters outside Benghazi.

General Hifter presents himself to the West as an unflinching warrior against political Islam in the mold of Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is a former general. Critics say that approach strengthens his enemies, though, by forcing moderate and extremist Islamist groups together.

Although the septuagenarian commander has styled himself as a great military leader, with a fondness for pomp and titles, experts say his true skill is in forging alliances. His Libyan National Army is, in fact, a coalition of militias and regular army units.

Since last year he has used those skills to extend his influence into the deserts of southern Libya, a vast and largely lawless area where he has forged a number of tribal alliances, and which in recent years has become the main focus of American counterterrorism efforts. The United States has carried out nine missile strikes in southern Libya, mostly targeting Islamic State militants, since Mr. Trump took office.

But even before his recent health problems, Libya experts warned that General Hifter may not have been as strong as he pretended, and that the forces that helped him rise to prominence in the east could also be his undoing.

A Shaky Coalition

In January, twin car bombings killed 35 people as outside a mosque in eastern Benghazi. Islamist militants were suspected. Hours later, one of General Hifter’s top commanders dragged 10 blindfolded Islamist prisoners onto a street and, as a camera recorded his actions, shot each one in the head with a rifle.

The commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli, was already wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for his alleged role in previous summary executions. But when General Hifter detained Mr. Werfalli, promising to bring him to a military trial, armed supporters burned tires in the streets and shut down major roads.

General Hifter was forced to back down. The commander of the Benghazi special forces brigade, Wanis Bukhamada, defused the protests by promising that Mr. Werfalli would not be sent to the international court. “This is a matter for the Libyan courts,” he said. Libyan courts, such as they are, have yet to take up the case.

That was the second challenge to General Hifter’s authority. In November, a tribal commander, Faraj Gaaim, was detained after he demanded on television that General Hifter step down.

Tribal opponents grumble that General Hifter’s army is dominated by his Furjan clan, and that his sons act as his enforcers. For Benghazi residents, the complaint is that the religious militants who helped him seize Benghazi are now exerting a disproportionate influence on daily life in the city.

In the past year hard-line preachers have taken over many mosques, and conservative officials have shut down music concerts and tried to stop women from traveling while unaccompanied.

“It’s like a bargain with the devil,” said Naseim Omeish, 25, a development official. “They get control of the mosques so they can consolidate their power. But that can go wrong.”

A Reluctant Democrat

Western efforts to bring General Hifter to the negotiating table have come to naught. In Paris last summer, he signed an agreement with Tripoli to hold elections by the end of 2018, but that now seems a distant possibility.

In interviews, General Hifter has shown little enthusiasm for a free vote. “Today’s Libya is not ripe for democracy,” he told the French magazine Jeune Afrique last month. “Perhaps future generations will succeed.”

Many critics, especially in western Libya, see that as further proof that he is little more than a reconstituted version of Colonel Qaddafi, relishing power for power’s sake and riding roughshod over basic freedoms and human rights. A United Nations report published this week highlighted torture, arbitrary detention and other abuses at jails run by General Hifter, as well as at those run by rival militias in the west.

Supporters say that, after seven years of chaos, a Qaddafi- or Sisi-style strongman may be exactly what Libya needs. “Believe me, I lost my faith in elections,” said Amal Bugaighis, a lawyer and civil society activist in Benghazi. “Maybe in five or ten years time. But for now we need someone strong in charge.”

In recent months, General Hifter participated in talks with military officials from western Libya, mediated by Egypt, over proposals to forge a united national army.

But that is now on hold, as all eyes in Libya turn to the French hospital where he is undergoing treatment. A wild range of rumors circulated in Libya on Thursday, ranging from accounts that he was recovering well from his treatment, to those suggesting he had in fact died.

His spokesman said in a tweet on Wednesday that “all the news” about General Hifter’s health was false. “Marshal Hifter is in excellent health, and he is following his daily general command duties,” the spokesman said.

Were General Hifter to become incapacitated, one strong possibility is that the coalition that he so carefully assembled to take control of Benghazi would come apart at the seams, riven by strains and lacking a natural successor, said Mr. Wehrey, the analyst.

“For all Hifter’s faults, he was the glue binding it all together,” he said. “There’s no comparable figure to fill his shoes.”","A Libyan Strongman Looks to Washington, but a Health Crisis Looms",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/middleeast/libya-hifter-benghazi.html

Libyan National Army Commander Khalifa Haftar





TRIPOLI, Libya

Khalifa Haftar, commander of Libyan forces backed by the Tobruk-based parliament, has announced the launch of a military offensive to capture Libya's northeastern city of Derna.

Derna was captured by the Shura Council of Mujahideen after the expulsion of Daesh from the city in 2014.

In a speech delivered late Monday at the Tobruk parliament to mark the fourth anniversary of the Al-Karama military offensive, Haftar said: ""We declare zero-hour to liberate the city of Derna.""

""I gave strict instructions to my forces to protect civilians… and abide by international humanitarian law,"" the general affirmed.

Four years ago, Haftar’s forces surrounded the city of Derna in a bid to capture it from the Shura Council of Mujahideen, which is described as ""terrorists"" by pro-Haftar forces -- a designation dismissed by the council.

""Peace efforts in Derna have reached a deadlock after more than three years,"" Haftar added.

Haftar went on to attribute the deadlock to ""terrorist gangs"" in the city, affirming that ""they aim to separate the city from the [rest of the] country”.

The Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna was formed in December 2014 with a view to confronting pro-Haftar forces, who, since then, have imposed a blockade on the city.

CAIRO – 1 May 2018: The International Quartet Committee on Libya praised on Monday the important security dialogue facilitated by the Egyptian government amid its continuing diplomatic efforts to settle the Libyan crisis.The Quartet held its fourth meeting at the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo to discuss the developments in Libya since its last meeting in New York in September 2017 and reviewed the coming steps for the country’s democratic transition.The meeting was chaired by Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary general of the Arab League, and involved former president of Burundi Pierre Buyoya, the African Union high representative for Mali and the Sahel; Federica Mogherini, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy and the special representative of the UN secretary-general and head of the UN support mission in Libya Ghassan Salame.The Quartet welcomed the decision by the Libyan Supreme Court that effectively validated the decision taken by the Constitutional Drafting Assembly in July 2017, to establish a broad-based consensus among all Libyan stakeholders towards holding a constitutional referendum.The Quartet further emphasized the importance of holding parliamentary and presidential elections in accordance with the requisite legal framework that must be enacted and approved for this purpose, including a constitutional framework and electoral law. They recognized the important preparatory efforts of the Presidency Council and the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC), in particular through the registration of eligible voters, and welcomed the high number of new registered voters in this process. The Quartet noted that there are plans to hold elections before the end of the year in line with the UN Action Plan for Libya.The Quartet expressed its willingness to coordinate its efforts to provide support, including through the deployment of electoral assistance or observer missions, to allow for the conduct of free, fair and credible elections.The Quartet emphasized the continued need to comprehensively address the security challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons, by armed groups outside of State authority, and by smuggling and trafficking networks. They stressed the importance of a united Libyan military operating under civilian oversight and a unified chain of command that is capable of consolidating peace and security throughout the country.Since the ouster of Libyan long-time leader Muammar Ghaddafi more than six years ago, the war-torn country draws wide international and regional attention, causing a serious threat on the national security of North Africa and Europe.Libya, which is struggling to get through the critical political situation that it has been experiencing since 2011, is not only trying to unify its army, but is longing to revive its political functions by conducting presidential and legislative elections.Egypt has hosted several meetings to bring the Libyan conflicted factions to the negotiations table to resolve the Libyan crisis and amend the Skhirat agreement, which aims at ending Libya’s civil war.The major obstacle in the face of any international or Arab participation in ending the crisis in Libya is the lack of a Libyan partner that would support any involvement. Since 2014, there are two major factions on the ground, one led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army, who now controls the eastern side of Libya and works in cooperation with the government of the House of Representatives, known as the Tobruk government. The other is led by Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the UN-backed Libyan Government of National Accord.Therefore, there is no official side recognized by all parties in Libya, but there are two opposing factions, roughly equivalent in terms of power, competing for legitimacy. Nonetheless, neither side appears to be able to tip the scales of this conflict in its favor.Policymakers in Egypt believe that Libya should have a unified body representing all sides in the war-torn country. However, this requires the elimination of terrorist groups that are plaguing the country and standing in the way of any regional or international attempt for reconciliation.The Egyptian state is aware that any intervention in Libyan affairs will enrage the Libyan people due to religious and national sensitivities.Therefore, Egypt called for a meeting in August 2014 to discuss the formation of a coalition force with the United States and other Arab nations. The final recommendation of the meeting, held in Cairo, did not suggest the formation of any Arab or international military intervention in Libya, but it called for the immediate cessation of all armed operations in order to support the political process in Libya.In December 2015, the Skhirat Agreement was signed by major parties in the Libyan conflict under the supervision of UN envoy Martin Kobler in the city of Skhirat, Morocco. The agreement recommends a peaceful transition of power and the establishment of a national unity government. However, the agreement failed to achieve the desired stability on the ground because it lacked consensus.Egypt’s officials held several meetings with their Libyan counterparts as well as members in Tobruk’s House of Representatives to resolve the Libyan crisis and amend the Skhirat agreement.In December 2016, Cairo hosted a conference attended by Libyan officials and representatives from the country’s numerous factions, where they issued five proposed amendments to the agreement. The conference concluded with a decision to amend the eighth article of the Skhirat agreement that outlined the jurisdiction of the Libyan army chief commander.Negotiations to unify the Libyan military were held as a part of Egypt’s initiative that kicked off in July 2017 to unify the military institutions. The first meeting aimed at creating a framework for the initiative while the second and third meetings were held in Cairo from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2, 2017, to follow up on the results of the first meeting.The fourth meeting was held from Dec. 6 to 9 to restructure the Libyan army.Egyptian Officials met again with Libyan military forces in Cairo on Feb. 21, 2018 in order to continue the discussions. The meetings delved into the methods used to unify and restructure the Libyan military forces after a long split that resulted from the outbreak of the Libyan revolution in 2011.The sixth round of the negotiation on the unification of the Libyan military establishment was held on March 23 in Cairo.In a press release issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the Libyan factions convening in Cairo agreed to resume with their talks in an attempt to complete the establishment of the four technical committees that the Libyan factions agreed on forming during the previous rounds of talks as an initial step towards the consolidation of the military establishment of Libya.The meeting also concluded with reaffirming the participant’s keenness to move ahead with unifying the Libyan army whose top priority is to maintain and preserve Libya’s national security and peace and stand firm against foreign interferences.Members of the Security Council welcomed recent efforts to strengthen an inclusive political dialogue among all Libyans, supported by Libya’s neighbors, international partners and regional organizations within the framework of the Libyan Political Agreement endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2259.",Int'l diplomatic attempts continue to end Libyan crisis,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/2/49065/Int-l-diplomatic-attempts-continue-to-end-Libyan-crisis
12,libya,"1 CONTEXT

The political and security situation in Libya continues to be deeply divided, as three authorities including the Tripoli based UN-backed Government of National Accord, vie for political legitimacy, control of territory, resources and infrastructure. Armed conflict and political instability have impacted the lives of more than three million people across the country, displacing hundreds of thousands and disrupting people’s access to basic services, including fuel and electrical power, as well as severely constraining life-saving protection and humanitarian assistance.

The protection crisis in Libya is characterised by violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, restricted access to safety and freedom of movement, forced displacement, severity and pervasiveness of gender-based violence. All parties to the conflict have committed breaches of international law including torture, unlawful killings, indiscriminate attacks, abductions, kidnapping, disappearances and the forceful displacement of people. The number of people with mental health and psychosocial problems increased substantially as a result of the conflict, including severe psychological distress for the conflict affected population, as well as the contamination from explosive hazards affecting human security and access.

Due to the volatile security and access limitations, the majority of international humanitarian actors continue their involvement in Libya with remote management work modality through national and local actors as well as key official stakeholders.",Libya Protection Sector Strategy 2018-2019,https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-protection-sector-strategy-2018-2019

This factsheet is the product of a protection monitoring partnership, funded by ECHO, implemented by ACTED and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC), and facilitated by REACH, that aims to inform protection programming in Libya. Each month, the partners visit selected sites of displacement near Tripoli and Benghazi to collect data related to the humanitarian needs of populations of concern, primarily IDPs and returnees.

In March 2018, with data collection support from the Kafaa Development Foundation, the partners visited three camps and two non-camp displacement sites in the mantikas of Tripoli and Al-Jifarah. Interviews were conducted with members of 106 households (HHs) and 22 community-level key informants (KIs – such KIs can include government employees, community representatives and other local authorities). Data collection tools were designed both to elicit overall information about the humanitarian situation at each site and to identify specific protection-related needs that warranted follow-up or referral to external services. Households were purposively sampled to ensure that the most vulnerable cases could be connected with services. Thus, all information in this factsheet should be considered indicative only.

14,libya,"A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner detained over alleged links with al Qaeda has worked as an advisor in the Libyan oil industry, The National reports.

Omar Deghayes, born in Libya, fled the country in 1986 and settled in the UK. In the early 2000s, he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and was arrested in Pakistan in 2002. Deghayes spent five years at Guantanamo Bay and was released in 2007 without charge.

Deghayes was director of legal affairs at the Libyan oil ministry, and according to his LinkedIn profile, he is legal consultant at the National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya.

NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla has told an analyst that Deghayes did not advise the company and was not paid by the NOC.

“Omar Deghayes was employed by the previous Ministry of Oil. He returned to the UK after that. He is not paid by NOC, nor does he advise anybody at NOC,” Sanalla said in a message sent to Claudia Gazzini, senior analyst for Libya at the International Crisis Group, and seen by The National.

Deghayes told The National in a written statement that the Libyan company was aware of his background.

Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, a civil war between feuding factions has crippled Libya’s oil industry. Before the war, Libyan production was 1.6 million bpd. The North African oil producer has recently managed to lift and stabilize its production at around 1 million bpd, but risks still persist with rival factions fighting for control and suddenly disrupting oil facilities’ operations and oil export terminals.

Libya was initially exempt from the OPEC production cuts together with Nigeria because of the violence in the two countries that had substantially reduced their oil production. At the meeting at which OPEC extended the pact until the end of 2018, Libya and Nigeria agreed to stick to an unofficial collective cap of 2.8 million bpd of oil production.

QRCS's humanitarian actions include providing support in disaster preparedness, disaster response, risk reduction, and disaster recovery. To mitigate the impact of disasters and improve the livelihoods of affected populations, QRCS provides medical services, healthcare, and social development to local communities. It is also active at the humanitarian advocacy front. With the help of a vast network of trained, committed staff and volunteers, QRCS aspires to improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity.
