0,libya,"RABAT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The UN-brokered agreement signed by Libyan parties in the Moroccan city of Skhirat remains the only genuine and practical process to end crisis in Libya, the Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said Monday.

The Moroccan foreign minister's statement came after holding separate meetings with the speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives Aqilah Saleh and the head of Libya High Council of State Khalid Al-Mishri in Rabat.

Bourita told the press after the meetings that Morocco has a ""clear and consistent"" stance which consists in supporting Libya, the political process in this country and the dialogue between the various parties.

Morocco has worked to put all stakeholders in the best position possible to reach the Skhirat agreement, Bourita said, noting that this agreement, which constitutes a common basis for all Libyans, could be adapted, if necessary, to current circumstances.

He urged the Libyan stakeholders to speed up the process of the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement to allow the Libyan people to choose their legitimate institutions through free and fair elections.

Bourita also called on all Libyan parties to show wisdom and to ensure that the interests of the Libyan people and Libya prevail over any other considerations, noting that Libyans and all Libya's friendly countries need a stable Libya able to play its key role within the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Africa and the Arab world.

The visiting Libyan officials met also with the speaker of the Moroccan house of representatives Habib El Malki.",Morocco hails UN-brokered deal as genuine process to end Libya crisis - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/24/c_137131934.htm
1,libya,"The Presidential Council said it was carrying out an investigation into corruption charges against a number of its government ministers.

The spokesman for the Head of the Presidential Council Fayez Al-Sirraj, Mohammed El Sallak, tweeted Sunday that Al-Sirraj was following the corruption allegations against his cabinet ministers and ordered a probe into the charges in order to take the needed legal measures.

Former Libyan consul in Egypt, Adel al-Hassi, has made some claims of corruption and fraud against finance minister, Osama Hamad, vice head of the PC, Fathi Al-Mijibri, and foreign minister Mohammed Sayala, saying they asked him to order a pay check of 15000 dollars per month for Saleh Daghim – the father of House of Representatives member Ziyad Daghim – as payment for his salaries.

The consul said Daghim’s father is in bad health conditions and is not working in the consulate.

Al-Hassi accused also former Vice President of the Presidential Council Ali al-Qatrani of falsifying papers to claim ownership on land owned by the Libyan state in Egypt.

According to al-Hassi the land is worth more than 850 million USD$ and was intended for the brother of Ali al-Qatrani, Mohammed al-Qatrani.

Meanwhile 34 members of parliament have urged the Attorney General to set up an investigation into these claims. They also demanded removal of the involved MPs’ parliamentary immunity.

However, HoR member Daghim found the call for lifting immunity cynical saying “Do we have an attorney general in the legitimate bodies-controlled area or do they mean that who is living in fear in the city of militias,” referring to Tripoli.

“All those who called for investigating me are involved in dubious issues like appointing their relatives in embassies and ministries as well as other official bodies, not to mention those who profit off the letters of credit.” Daghim remarked.

He added that the fact that the signing 34 HoR members are mostly from western Libya is another proof for regionalism in the country.",Libya Presidential Council to probe corruption cases against ministers,https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/libya-presidential-council-probe-corruption-cases-against-ministers
2,libya,"President Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton, formerly U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush, and one of the original Neocons, recently remarked that he sees Libya as a model for a North Korea nukes deal. According to Bolton, the 2003 deal that helped bring Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in from the cold, is an example of a successful dismantling of a nuclear weapons program, and may be useful in the current efforts to get North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to deliver 'verifiable' progress.

Conventional wisdom holds that the Libya Deal, while it seemed to start out well, ultimately damaged U.S. credibility with countries like Iran and North Korea, in negotiating a curtailment of their nuclear programs. For Gaddafi’s abandonment by the U.S. during the Arab Spring, and his bloody end after being dragged, delirious, out of a drainage pipe, showed that only by retaining and developing nuclear weapons capacity could a U.S. adversary ward off the United States’ natural inclination to regime change. But neither Bolton’s interpretation, nor the conventional wisdom reflect the reality of why the Libya deal is - or is not - a model for dealings with North Korea.

First, Libya had no nukes to speak of. As Gordon Gray, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, tweeted on April 30, “Libya hardly had a nuclear weapons program. It had crates with centrifuges it didn’t know want to do with. U.S. transport planes could land and carry the entire ‘program’ away.” Libya’s value in the early years of the Bush administration was as a prop, to make it seem that the Iraq invasion was having positive collateral effects, i.e., Gaddafi was so scared of being ‘next’ in line after Saddam Hussain, that he gave up something of value. At the time, most of the Neocons scoffed at the Libya deal as ‘not drastic enough.’ Both sides, the U.S., and Gaddafi, had interest in claiming that Libya’s nuclear program was more substantial than it was.

Within two years of the deal, Gaddafi took to complaining, incessantly, that he gave up nuclear weapons and got nothing much in return. This, while some of his closest aides confessed they “never expected such a gift” from the United States, which included weapons sales, upgrades to Libya's lagging oil industry, and collaboration in efforts to deliver Gaddafi's Islamist enemies back to him for torture, under the ""extraordinary rendition"" program -- which gave Gaddafi an unprecedented view into the dark corners of U.S. counter-terror operations, and gave Gaddafi a lever, in the same way that former French President Nicolas Sarkozy's suspected acceptance of campaign donations from Gaddafi, tied France to Libya in an uncomfortable embrace.

The West's greed in putting short term gains above long term interests, were what doomed both Gaddafi, and the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011 -- for without safeguards, Gaddafi quickly reverted to his typical manipulative behavior, striking shady deals with Western governments and companies, undermining U.S. interests across Africa, and obstructing confidence building measures. By the time the Arab Spring broke out in late 2010, Gaddafi had worn out his welcome. By credibly threatening to flatten Benghazi, Gaddafi made it easy for the United States to turn on him.

The leaderships of North Korea and Iran have used Libya as a rhetorical point themselves, but the lesson they most likely took, was not a warning but an insight: The United States can be manipulated, because its attention span is short term. And that interests of individual politicians can be manipulated into doing things that may serve their own political purposes, but are not the interests of the United States as a whole. So, Libya is instructive for the U.S.' adversaries -- just not in the ways that the public is used to hearing.

Conversely, the Libya case should be a warning for the United States to take a longer term, strategic view; to base decisions on hard intelligence and sophisticated strategy, and to anticipate traps; that expertise and nuance matters. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, like Gaddafi, is someone whose existence is predicated on the need to think a few steps ahead -- all with the knowledge that U.S. public support is fickle, and that U.S. presidents come and go. President Trump could conceivably later be credited with applying unconventional approach to ""shake things up"" on the Peninsula, but Presidents' incentives to weigh short term political personal interests above that of the country, and the temptation to see Kim Jong Un's game as single, rather than 'multi-level', should be cause for concern, as Van Jackson argues in a thought provoking piece in Politico.",The 2003 Libya Deal's Unconventional Warning For North Korea Talks,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethanchorin/2018/05/04/the-2003-libya-deals-unconventional-warning-for-north-korea-talks/
3,libya,"The European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, on Monday said the situation in Libya is improving, citing recent calls for elections and an increase in migrants voluntarily returning to their home countries.

Mogherini, who is attending a quartet meeting in Cairo which includes UN Special Representative for Libya Ghassan Salame, High Representative of the African Union for Mali and the Sahel, Pierre Buyoya and Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said that more than 16,000 migrants have returned voluntarily to their home countries after being held in detention centers in Libya.

“Definitely in the last seven months, we have seen progress on the ground. Still fragile progress, still limited progress, but the trend compared to the past I believe is rather encouraging and needs to be further supported. I believe this is partially due to the fact that we managed to overcome possible divisions of our organizations and we coordinated different strengths of work”, Mogherini said.

Mogherini also said, the EU is committed to addressing the situation of African citizens detained in Libya.

“We committed ourselves to work together, to address the dramatic situation of African citizens detained, in the detention centers in Libya. In only two months we managed to have assisted voluntary returns meaning saving, and having safe returns voluntary, for more than 16,000 people, which is something that is quite remarkable, more than what was done in all previous years”, she added.",Mogherini: Libya’s crisis is on the way for solution,https://www.libyanexpress.com/mogherini-libyas-crisis-is-on-the-way-for-solution/
4,libya,"Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) and Qatar Red Crescent Society (QRCS) have signed an $8 million funding agreement to address the humanitarian and medical needs of more than 623,000 beneficiaries in Libya.

The agreement was signed by Misfer Hamad Al-Shahwani, Director of Development Projects at QFFD, and Rashid Saad Al-Mohannadi, Director of Relief and International Development at QRCS.

According to H.E. Sheikh Mohamed bin Nasser bin Jassim Al Thani, Ambassador of Qatar to Libya, this donation builds upon the continuous Qatari humanitarian endeavors in Libya since 2016. It is part of a larger $10 million initiative announced by the State of Qatar to help improve the conditions in the war-torn country, through diverse humanitarian operations in cooperation with the Libyan Red Crescent.

Following the signing ceremony, Mr. Al-Shahwani stated, “This joint work is aimed at meeting the humanitarian needs of the affected communities, in the fields of food security, water and sanitation, and nonfood aid. Also, it is planned to throw out a lifeline to hospitals and health centers, operate mobile clinics, and launch capacity-building programs for medical professionals”.

Mr. Al-Mohannadi, said, “I would like to thank QFFD for this generous support to QRCS’s ongoing relief work in Libya. With these funds, we will be able to expand our intervention to take in more and more beneficiaries. Our ultimate goal is to alleviate their suffering in such a protracted ordeal, while respecting their dignity”.

Under the agreement, a relief action plan will be implemented in southern cities of Libya, covering the following domains:",Qatar provides 8 million dollars in humanitarian aids to Libya,http://www.libyanexpress.com/qatar-provides-8-million-dollars-in-humanitarian-aids-to-libya/
5,libya,"“I heard directly from the Chinese that the Libyan model did not inspire confidence in Pyongyang,” said Antony J. Blinken, a deputy secretary of state under Mr. Obama. “I would be very concerned that the combination of Libya and then Trump tearing up the Iran agreement sends exactly the wrong message to Kim Jong-un and undermines whatever hope exists for negotiations.”

Mr. Bolton raised the Libya example in weekend interviews on “Face the Nation” on CBS and “Fox News Sunday,” his first television appearances since becoming national security adviser early this month.

“We have very much in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004,” he said on Fox. “There are obviously differences. The Libyan program was much smaller, but that was basically the agreement that we made.”

The most important comparison, he said, would be testing North Korea to see if it had genuinely made an unqualified determination to abandon its nuclear weapons. “It would be a manifestation of the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons,” Mr. Bolton said on CBS. “Doesn’t have to be the same as Libya, but it’s got to be something concrete and tangible. It may be that Kim Jong-un has some ideas and we should hear him out.”

In the history of the atomic age, only four countries have voluntarily given up nuclear weapons. South Africa ended its secret nuclear program in 1989, destroying a half-dozen bombs. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan all gave up the nuclear weapons that were stationed on their territory after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and they became independent nations.

But Ukraine has found reason for second-guessing. The Budapest Memorandum that sealed its denuclearization in 1994 included promises by the United States, Britain and Russia to respect the country’s sovereignty and borders. But in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and supported Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Given that, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament said at the time that “now there’s a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake” in giving up its weapons.

Others like Brazil and Taiwan sought nuclear weapons but abandoned the efforts short of building bombs. Iran was not known to have weapons but did have a nuclear program that seemed intended to develop them when it signed an agreement with Mr. Obama’s administration in 2015 to give up its program — the same agreement Mr. Trump has excoriated and threatened to rip up by May 12.

Similarly, Libya did not have nuclear weapons but had a program to develop them when it changed course in 2003. Colonel Qaddafi initiated secret negotiations with the Bush administration and the British to dismantle his program in exchange for easing international sanctions.

The decision reflected years of effort to end the country’s isolation. But the key agreement came just days after Iraq’s deposed leader, Saddam Hussein, was found in a spider hole in Iraq after an American invasion that had been justified as an effort to rid a dangerous regime of weapons of mass destruction. Colonel Qaddafi signaled that he did not intend to suffer the same fate.

Robert Joseph, the national security aide who brokered the deal for Mr. Bush with the support of Mr. Bolton, said on Sunday that his former colleague was right to look to Libya. “I do think John’s onto something here,” he said.

“Look, Libya is not North Korea,” he added. “The Libyan program was far more advanced than we had thought it was, but it’s far less advanced than where North Korea is today. No question, Libya does not represent the sort of military threat that North Korea does. The two situations are different.

“But you’re not saying we’re going to do everything just like we did with Libya,” he added. “What you’re doing is you’re drawing lessons from that experience. If you don’t do that, we’re going to end up right where we’ve ended up before multiple times over the last 25 years, which is failure.”

Among the lessons of Libya that apply to North Korea, he said, echoing Mr. Bolton’s comment, is the need for a genuine decision by Mr. Kim to completely give up his program, not just hedge. Another is to use all the tools available, including intelligence, economic leverage, diplomacy and threat of force. Another is to insist on complete “anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors to all potential nuclear sites.

But other specialists find the situations so different that the comparison is unhelpful. “Libya hardly had a nuclear weapons program,” said Robert J. Einhorn, a special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control in Mr. Obama’s State Department and now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. “It had crates with centrifuge parts it didn’t know what to do with. U.S. transport planes could land and carry the entire ‘program’ away.”

By contrast, said Mr. Einhorn, “North Korea has nuclear weapons. We don’t know how many. It has nuclear production facilities. We don’t know where they all are. Verifying what they have and dismantling all of it would take years.”

Colonel Qaddafi’s violent end was not directly related to the 2003 deal. Nearly eight years after his agreement with Mr. Bush, the Libyan dictator was confronted with a popular uprising as part of the Arab Spring 2011. He vowed to crush his opponents, including civilians, prompting Mr. Obama and European allies to intervene to stop him.

The Obama administration at the time denied any connection between the intervention and the previous nuclear disarmament. But Mr. Joseph said Mr. Obama should have given more thought to the consequences. “They made the decision to intervene without a day-after plan or any sense of what nonproliferation message that would send,” he said.

North Korea has made this connection before. In 2011, North Korea’s official news agency carried comments by a Foreign Ministry official calling the earlier nuclear bargain with Libya “an invasion tactic to disarm the country,” in effect a bait-and-switch. “The Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson,” the ministry official said.

MSF is highly concerned about the fate of around 800 migrants and refugees held in a dangerously overcrowded detention centre in the port city of Zuwara, Libya around 100 kilometres west of Tripoli. Some of the men, women and children inside have been detained in inhumane conditions for more than five months without adequate food or water.

“The situation is critical,” says Karline Kleijer, head of MSF’s emergencies desk. “We strongly urge all international agencies with a presence in Libya, representatives from countries of origin and the Libyan authorities to do everything they can to find a solution for these people over the next few days.”

On Tuesday 1 May, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) airlifted 88 people in need of international protection out of Zuwara and took them to a detention centre in Tripoli with a view to identifying the most vulnerable cases for potential evacuation abroad. The Libyan authorities have transferred some people to other detention centres in an attempt to reduce the extreme overcrowding and the International Organization for Migration has initiated a process of “voluntary humanitarian return” for some detainees. However, hundreds of people remain trapped inside the detention centre in Zuwara with no solution in sight.

The situation deteriorates further as each day passes, with an increasing number of refugees and migrants arbitrarily detained. Since the start of the MSF emergency team’s intervention on 18 April, there have been more than 500 people newly detained in a facility that was already overcrowded. At present, the Zuwara detention centre is four times over capacity with floor space so limited that it is barely possible for people to lie down.

A large number of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in Zuwara have already endured alarming levels of violence and exploitation in Libya and during harrowing journeys from their home countries. Some of the people brought to the detention centre were malnourished on arrival having been held captive by smuggling networks in the area.

The medical center said 23 people have been killed and 91 others injured in tribal fightings over the past three months.

This picture of devastation is what victory looks like for Gen. Khalifa Hifter, the military strongman whose forces routed the last Islamist militias from Benghazi in December.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, managed to deliver this week urgently needed assistance to hundreds of displaced Libyan families in the town of Murzuk, in southern Libya. Humanitarian help is desperately needed in this region of Libya where recent deadly clashes between armed groups in and around the city of Sabha (some 760 km south of Tripoli) have forced an estimated 1,900 Libyan families to flee their homes.

A UNHCR emergency aid convoy left the Libyan capital Tripoli on 4 April. The convoy, consisting of seven trucks loaded with basic aid items was able to enter Sabha the following day where we distributed humanitarian assistance to 850 displaced families. Access to Murzuq and Oubari further south was initially blocked due to security reasons, and the aid had to wait in Sabha.

However, earlier this week, the local population began using the main roads from Sabha to Murzuk. This gave UNHCR a window of opportunity to urgently deliver core relief items to the city of Murzuk where on Wednesday (18 April) 370 displaced families finally received much needed aid.

The displaced Libyan population in the south badly needs adequate shelter and basic household items including hygiene kits, sleeping mats, mattresses and kitchen sets. To make matters worse, humanitarian access to this part of Libya has been restricted for weeks and the situation remains extremely volatile. Many have sought refuge in local schools, hospitals and other public buildings.

In Libya, currently more than 184,000 internally displaced people are in need of humanitarian assistance as well as 368,000 people who have recently returned to their homes. UNHCR continues to advocate on their behalf and to provide relief until they can find durable solutions, including returning home on a voluntary basis and in conditions of dignity and safety.

To respond to the needs of more than half a million Libyans uprooted by the conflict, UNHCR has increased its capacity and resources by 300 percent in recent months.

16,libya,"AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK, MAY 3, 2018—Hundreds of migrants and refugees are being held in a dangerously overcrowded detention center in Libya, without adequate food or water and in inhumane conditions, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned today.

Roughly 800 migrant and refugee men, women, and children are detained in the detention center in the port city of Zuwara, many of whom have been held for more than five months. The situation is deteriorating daily as more refugees and migrants are arbitrarily detained, including more than 500 people in the last 15 days alone. The number held far exceeds the center's capacity, with floor space so limited it is barely possible to lie down.

""The situation is critical,"" said Karline Kleijer, MSF emergency program manager. ""We strongly urge all international agencies with a presence in Libya, representatives from the countries of origin, and the Libyan authorities to do everything they can to find a solution for these people over the next few days.""

Since April 18, an MSF emergency team has provided health care to the detainees in the center.

On May 1, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR airlifted 88 people in need of international protection from Zuwara to another detention center in Tripoli in order to identify the most vulnerable individuals for potential evacuation abroad. The Libyan authorities have transferred some people to other detention centers in an attempt to reduce the extreme overcrowding, and the International Organization for Migration has started a process of ""voluntary humanitarian return"" for some detainees. However, there is no solution in sight for many of the estimated 800 people who remain in the detention center in Zuwara.

A large number of refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers in Zuwara have already endured alarming levels of violence and exploitation in Libya and during harrowing journeys from their home countries. Many are from eastern or western African countries, but some are from as far away as southern Asia. Some were malnourished on their arrival to the center as they had been held captive by smuggling networks in the area.

17,libya,"The Libyan coastguard on Sunday (6 May) prevented a rescue ship belonging to two NGOs from approaching a boat in distress carrying migrants, an AFP photographer witnessed.

The Aquarius, chartered by SOS-Mediterranée and Doctors Without Borders (MSF), was informed by the Italian coastguard of the presence of an overloaded boat off the coast of Tripoli, reported the photographer on board the NGO boat.

But Rome also alerted the Libyan coastguard which took charge of coordinating the rescue operation and banned the NGO ship from approaching, also ordering it to move away when migrants jumped into the water to avoid being picked up by the Libyans.

The Libyan navy later announced it had rescued more than 300 migrants in three separate operations, reporting one dead and three missing.

The two victims were with 114 other migrants including 21 women and four children, said a Libyan navy spokesman, General Ayoub Kacem, although he declined to say whether they had been aboard the boat seen by the Aquarius.

And he warned that tensions between the Libyan coastguard and the NGO boats could worsen over coming days if they continued to approach stricken boats.

The Libyan coastguard has previously accused NGOs of causing panic and confusion by their presence during rescues as the migrants all surge to reach the charter boats to avoid being returned to Libya.

But Italian deputy Riccadro Magi, who was present on board the Astral, a boat chartered by the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, earlier Sunday when it rescued 105 migrants, accused the Libyans of being heavy-handed.

“The Libyans act as pirates in international waters demanding that they be recognised as an authority. They act outside the law and they do so with the means provided by the Italian government,” he said on Twitter.

On Saturday, the Libyan coastguard also forced the Astral and another ship to move away from a boat carrying 38 migrants.

Last November, German charity group Sea Watch said lives had been needlessly lost because of a Libyan coastguard being trained and financed by the European Union.

According to the NGO, the Libyans began “beating and threatening” the migrants on the stricken boat, provoking panic that caused some to fall overboard.",Libyan coastguard prevents NGO boat from rescuing migrants,https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/libyan-coastguard-prevents-ngo-boat-from-rescuing-migrants/

The political and security situation in Libya continues to be deeply divided, as three authorities including the Tripoli based UN-backed Government of National Accord, vie for political legitimacy, control of territory, resources and infrastructure. Armed conflict and political instability have impacted the lives of more than three million people across the country, displacing hundreds of thousands and disrupting people’s access to basic services, including fuel and electrical power, as well as severely constraining life-saving protection and humanitarian assistance.

The protection crisis in Libya is characterised by violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, restricted access to safety and freedom of movement, forced displacement, severity and pervasiveness of gender-based violence. All parties to the conflict have committed breaches of international law including torture, unlawful killings, indiscriminate attacks, abductions, kidnapping, disappearances and the forceful displacement of people. The number of people with mental health and psychosocial problems increased substantially as a result of the conflict, including severe psychological distress for the conflict affected population, as well as the contamination from explosive hazards affecting human security and access.

Due to the volatile security and access limitations, the majority of international humanitarian actors continue their involvement in Libya with remote management work modality through national and local actors as well as key official stakeholders.",Libya Protection Sector Strategy 2018-2019,https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-protection-sector-strategy-2018-2019
19,libya,"The Head of the High Council of State, Khalid Al-Mishri, met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR) Aqilah Saleh in Morocco's Rabat on Monday.

According to informed sources, the HoR and HCS agreed on reshuffle the Presidential Council to become ""one head and two deputies"" plus selecting a separate prime minister and a mechanism to appoint sovereign posts' incumbents, in addition to issuing a law by the HoR for the constitution referendum.

Saleh told reporters Monday that the meeting was motivating and would be materialized on the ground by some needed action.

""We both knew that we need to breathe a new life in the 2015-brokered Libyan Political Agreement (LPA.)"" Saleh added.

""It was a positive and friendly meeting,"" said the HoR member, Salim Egnan, who was in Rabat with the delegation.

Egnan said the two parties saw it necessary for the HoR-HCS dialogue commission to continue its work to reach agreement on points of dispute, adding that it is time to form 5+5 committee as per the LPA.

""No names were nominated for any posts in the meeting as LPA still needs to be included by the HoR in the constitutional declaration."" He remarked.

Both of Saleh and Al-Mishri arrived in Morocco this week upon an invitation by the Moroccan Parliament's President for an attempt to break Libya's political stalemate.","Heads of Libyan legislative, advisory bodies meet in Morocco to break political impasse",https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/heads-libyan-legislative-advisory-bodies-meet-morocco-break-political-impasse

According to reports, at least 12 people were killed and seven wounded when terrorists attacked the High National Election Commission on Wednesday.

In the statement, Mr. Guterres also underscored the UN’s commitment to the implementation of the Action Plan for Libya.

The plan, which was endorsed by the Security Council last October, aims to bring about peace and stability in the country and end a protracted crisis that has caused immense suffering and contributed to instability beyond the Libya’s borders.

Violence between rival groups has plagued the oil-rich North African nation since shortly after the 2011 overthrow of former leader Muammar Gaddafi, leading to a humanitarian and economic crisis.

The Action Plan contains seven main priorities, beginning with reinvigorating an inclusive political process by building on recent positive developments. Other priorities include strengthening national security; supporting migrants; and securing predictable support for humanitarian assistance.

The statement added that the UN Special Representative for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, is working very closely with all parties towards the plan’s full implementation.",UN chief denounces terror attack on electoral commission HQ in Libyan capital,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008852
