Since 2014, newspapers have been unable to restart production due mainly to a lack of funding and resources.

“Previously, the Press Support Committee would provide support to the media, even private media. We used to print around 130 private newspapers a day but when the machine stopped working, we did not find the necessary support to fix it, purchase spare parts, import paper and zinc, because of course Libya is undoubtedly in a crisis. The political divide also plays a role in impacting the sector. With two governments, as you know, budgets are on hold for a lot of state institutions “ said Head of Libyan press support committee, Mahmoud Abuhasheima.

We used to print around 130 private newspapers a day but when the machine stopped working, we did not find the necessary support to fix it, purchase spare parts, import paper and zinc, because of course Libya is undoubtedly in a crisis.

Libya has been hit by difficulties in its economic, political and security affairs, in the years following the popular uprising which deposed former leader Muammar Gaddafi and ended four decades of one-man rule.

As a result, close to 600 local private and state-owned newspapers were forced to shut down and only 15 of the newspapers that are still running can afford to print sporadic copies.

While a newspaper is sold for just half a Libyan dinar ($0.38), the cost of printing a single copy can reach 5 Libyan dinars ($3.7).

Some newspapers have moved offices to neighbouring Tunisia. The English language privately-owned ‘Libya Herald’ now operates out of the capital Tunis, publishing its daily digest only on the internet.

The editor-in-chief of ‘Libya’ newspaper, Emad Al-Allam, says lack of funding is the main obstacle facing newspapers but adds that there is also a level of state negligence.

Since 2014, Libya’s main printing press has shut down. The printing press’s capacity used to produce 45,000 copies a year, according to Mahmoud Abuhasheima, head of the Libyan Press Support Committee.

Its machines have turned yellow from accumulated dust, and the last newspaper copy is still jammed inside the machine with faded ink.

The editor-in-chief of ‘February’ newspaper, Alhady Al-Qarqouty, says the “sharp polarisation” in the country is another hurdle holding back the press.

He adds that the polarisation has curtailed press freedom and has made many journalists reluctant about continuing to work in the profession.

Libya descended into chaos after the overthrow and killing of Gaddafi, with two competing governments backed by militias scrambling for control of the oil-producing country.

Highlights

Over the past weeks, clashes between armed groups in the southern region of Libya have resulted in the displacement of thousands of civilians to safer areas in Sabha (850 families), Ubari (307 families) and Murzuq (413 families). Following a rapid needs assessment and in coordination with authorities and partners, UNHCR has started the distribution of sleeping mats, kitchen sets, hygiene kits, and other non-food items (NFIs) to respond to the humanitarian needs of over 1,500 displaced families (IDPs) currently displaced in the southern region. The humanitarian aid was dispatched in seven trucks from Tripoli.

UNHCR Response

UNHCR’s strategy to support IDPs aims at strengthening advocacy and at promoting access to rights, basic services and solutions for IDPs throughout Libya. As the lead agency for the protection of IDPs, UNHCR has increased its capacity and expanded its partnerships in order to conduct protection monitoring, identify needs and guide effective responses. UNHCR continues to provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs and returnees, including basic assistance in the form of NFIs and cash-based interventions (CBIs).

On 4 April, UNHCR visited the Tawergha IDP community in Tarhuna (65 km southwest of Tripoli). The city currently hosts between 4,000 and 4,500 IDP families (over 20,000 individuals) from Sirte, Benghazi, Misrata, Tawergha, and Mashasha. UNHCR visited Tawergha settlements in the city and also consulted the host community to assess the most pressing needs. Access to clean water and sanitation issues are major concerns for both IDPs and the host community.

UNHCR conducted focus group discussions and identified potential water and sanitation solutions in order to improve living conditions, benefitting both host community and IDP populations.

On 2 April, UNHCR visited returnee communities in Kikla, in the Nafusa Mountains (130 km southwest of Tripoli), for the second time in 2018. Over 1,600 families have voluntarily returned to Kikla since mid-2015 and are in urgent need of shelter and clean water. UNHCR conducted focus group discussions and identified future interventions with the community. A follow up mission to identify quick impact projects to support hospitals and public infrastructure took place during the same week.

UNHCR’s support to host communities, IDPs and returnees in Benghazi continues in coordination with the local authorities. Benghazi is currently hosting over 32,000 IDPs and 174,000 returnees. New quick impact projects are being implemented over the coming weeks to make infrastructural improvements and support persons with specific needs. UNHCR is providing persons of concern with 400 assistive devices, such as crutches and wheelchairs, with the objective of supporting the local social security system. Water tanks, solar street lights and waste management items are also being delivered to enhance the community’s infrastructural capacities.

UNHCR and UNFPA continue to distribute assistance to displaced women and girls in Libya. After conducting an assessment, a distribution of 8,500 dignity kits is taking place in over 16 locations including Tripoli, Misrata, Sabha, Nafusa Mountains, Bani Walid, Janzour, Ubari and Murzaq. These kits are meant to provide an immediate relief in sites where access to clean water and sanitation is difficult.",UNHCR Flash Update Libya (31 Mar. – 6 Apr. 2018) [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/unhcr-flash-update-libya-31-mar-6-apr-2018-enar

TRIPOLI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- British Middle East minister on Monday held talks in the Libyan capital Tripoli with Libyan officials on illegal immigration and economic cooperation between the two countries.

Alistair Burt, Britain's minister for Middle East and North Africa, held meetings with the UN-backed Prime Minister, Fayez Serraj, and the ministers of foreign affairs, justice and interior.

Burt told a joint press conference with the Libyan Foreign Minister, Mohammed Sayala, that his visit comes within the framework of supporting political and economic relations, as well as discussing solutions to illegal immigration.

""We recognize the importance and seriousness of illegal immigration. The recent meeting between the United Nations, the European Union, and the African Union was keen to examine the problems of the flow of migrants from their countries to Libya, and to convince the migrants about the great risk of leaving their countries, and to return voluntarily to their countries of origin,"" Burt said.

He revealed that Britain has allocated 75 million British pounds (105.96 million U.S. dollars) to support anti-illegal immigration programs in Libya, as well as 170 million pounds spent more than two years until now on crisis management in Mediterranean countries.

""During our meetings with officials and civil society organizations, we have seen determination to save their country and improve the living conditions of citizens,"" Burt said, noting that Britain is willing to implement stability programs and contribute to a number of economic projects to support Libya's economy.",UK and Libya discuss illegal immigration and economic cooperation - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/10/c_137098822.htm

4,libya,"Seven years ago today, NATO began its “humanitarian bombing” of Libya. While “humanitarian bombing” is an oxymoron, many believe that a country is not truly advancing human rights if it’s not bombing another back to the Stone Age.

As an initial matter, it must be said that while the UN had authorized a NATO fly-zone over Libya to protect civilians – all civilians, by the way – there was never authorization for the full-scale invasion which was carried out and which quickly became aimed at regime change. Therefore, the NATO operation which actually took place was illegal.

What’s more, the Libyan invasion did more to undermine human rights than it did to protect them. According to Amnesty International’s most recent report on Libya, there are now three rival governments vying for power in the country along with various militias, smugglers and other sundry armed groups. As Amnesty International explains, all participants in the armed conflict in Libya “carried out indiscriminate attacks in heavily populated areas leading to deaths of civilians and unlawful killings. Armed groups arrested and indefinitely detained thousands of people. Torture and other ill-treatment was widespread in prisons under the control of armed groups, militias and state officials.” And, to top it all off, slaves are being sold in public markets in Libya – something not seen in the world for over a century.

And this is the aftermath of an intervention which, we were told, was supposed to improve human rights in Libya. Indeed, the intervention was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and Susan Rice – three self-described warriors for human and women’s rights. Instead, they became three ushers of the Apocalypse. In addition, Italy and France, which also helped lead the charge for invasion, had their own reasons for intervening in Libya. For his part, French President Nicolas Sarkozy appeared to be singularly focused on killing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who allegedly gave him €50 million for his presidential campaign – a claim which was just coming to light and to which Gaddafi was the chief witness.

While Gaddafi certainly was no saint, he was a much better leader for his country than many of those the West supports, such as the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, the death squad state of Colombia or the coup government in Honduras. Indeed, Muammar Gaddafi, at the urging of his son, Saif, was attempting to democratize Libya at the time of the invasion, and the pair were willingly accepting the help of the US’s National Democratic Institute to do so!

In addition, Gaddafi had taken Libya from being the least prosperous country in Africa to the being the most prosperous by the time of the NATO operation. Thus, as one commentator explains, before the intervention, “Libya had the highest GDP per capita and life expectancy on the continent. Less people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands.”

Moreover, one of the main reasons, we were told, that NATO needed to intervene in 2011 was to save Benghazi from imminent harm from the government forces of Gaddafi. However, Hillary Clinton’s own internal emails show that her team recognized that any humanitarian problems confronting Benghazi had passed by the time of the NATO bombing. For example, Clinton’s assistant, Huma Abedin, in an email dated February 21, 2011 – that is, just a mere four days after the initial anti-government protests broke out in Libya – explains that the Gaddafi forces no longer controlled Benghazi and that the mood in the city was indeed “celebratory” by that time. Then, on March 2, just over two weeks before the bombing began, Harriet Spanos of USAID sent an email describing “[s]ecurity reports” which “confirm that Benghazi has been calm over the past couple of days.”

Read more

Indeed, as explained to me by Khaled Kaim, Gaddafi’s last foreign minister, who I recently met in Venezuela, he personally urged US representatives at the UN Security Council to hold off the planned bombing raid for one hour so that UN observers on the ground could confirm his claim that Benghazi was not under threat. Of course, his pleas were ignored. Kaim’s warnings that the impending invasion of Libya would only unleash more chaos and terror on the world were also disregarded.

Meanwhile, Benghazi is now the site of a grave humanitarian crisis and a hotbed for terrorists post-intervention. Again, Amnesty International writes that “[a] number of mass graves were uncovered in Benghazi between February and October [2017]. On at least four occasions, groups of bodies were found in different parts of the city with their hands bound behind their backs, and in some cases blindfolded with signs of torture and execution-style killing.”

In addition, during the early part of 2017, one armed faction laid siege to an apartment complex in the Ganfouda area of Benghazi, “cutting off all supplies to the area, including food and water, and had trapped civilians and wounded fighters [of another faction] without access to medical care and other basic services.” And, when the same faction broke the siege by launching an armed assault on this area, it engaged in “indiscriminate” killings, with fighters from the faction posing for photos with the dead bodies.

And yet, where are the self-proclaimed defenders of human rights for Libya and Benghazi now? Where are their cries for humanitarian intervention? Of course, all of those responsible for this absolute disaster have moved on and remain silent about the tragedy they have wrought in that country.

Of course, the intervention in Libya was not truly about human rights, just as other similar Western interventions in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have not been about either human rights or even fighting terror. And indeed, these interventions have only undermined human rights and further spread terror. In the case of Libya, the predictable havoc unleashed there has spread to neighboring states such as Niger, Tunisia, Mali, Chad and Cameroon. In addition, the refugee crisis created by the chaos unleashed by the NATO intervention in Libya is undermining the stability of all of Europe.

One can only conclude from this that the West, and especially the United States, is hell-bent on spreading instability throughout the world, despite its pretending to accomplish the very opposite. Indeed, the US continues to bomb Libya periodically in an effort to at least contain the very forces of chaos it helped unleash there.

In chaos, Western countries and their transnational corporations see opportunity for more domination and more profits. As with Little Finger in Game of Thrones, they see chaos not as a pit, but as a ladder. In the case of countries like Libya, the West goes in and bombs it to oblivion and then brings in companies which charge that country to rebuild it. And the West is not shy about this grisly strategy for money-making.

Indeed, as the New York Times explained in an article just after the NATO operation ended with the brutal killing of Gaddafi – an article accompanied by a photo of an oil terminal in Misurata, Libya, on fire and with black smoke billowing out – “Western security, construction and infrastructure companies that see profit-making opportunities receding in Iraq and Afghanistan have turned their sights on Libya… Entrepreneurs are abuzz about the business potential of a country with huge needs and the oil to pay for them, plus the competitive advantage of Libyan gratitude toward the United States and its NATO partners.

""A week before Colonel Qaddafi’s death on Oct. 20, a delegation from 80 French companies arrived in Tripoli to meet officials of the Transitional National Council, the interim government. Last week, the new British defense minister, Philip Hammond, urged British companies to “pack their suitcases” and head to Tripoli.”

But what is good for such corporations is not good for the rest of us. Simply put, the world cannot afford another war which wreaks havoc on entire regions of the globe, ushering in massive human misery and environmental destruction in its wake. As King Pyrrhus might have said, another “victory” like the one in Libya may be the undoing of us.

Many migrants and refugees who brave the journey to Libya end up in detention. (Keystone)

As Switzerland receives a first group of vulnerable refugees from Libyan detention centres, we take a look at the international response to Libya's migrant crisis.

At the end of last year, CNN reports of detained Africans being sold in Libyan slave markets sent shock waves around the world. It also prompted the European Union and International Organization for Migration (IOM) to step up evacuating migrants from Libya, “because,” says IOM media officer for West and Central Africa Florence Kim, “the EU and African Union decided that we could not leave 20,000 people in detention centres in Libya.”

Also in December, Switzerland announced that it has agreed to take up to 80 vulnerable refugees as part of an emergency plan by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to evacuate thousands of people from detention centres in Libya. Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga described this as an “urgent humanitarian measure”, saying it was justified because of the catastrophic situation in Libya.

A first group of refugees arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday, according to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM).

The group consists mainly of women classified as ""vulnerable"" along with women with children and unaccompanied minors. They were first evacuated to Niger before being flown to Switzerland, a SEM spokeswoman told swissinfo.ch

Some other European countries have also agreed to take refugees as part of this operation. UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel told swissinfo.ch that over 1,300 people have been evacuated so far, of whom 312 have gone to Italy, a few to Romania and the rest to Niger for resettlement processing.

Torture and abuse

In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have braved the journey across Africa to Libya, some intending to stay, but many hoping to reach Europe. “Nearly half a million have made the crossing in the last three years; over 10,000 have died in the attempt,” says an Amnesty International report published in December last year. “A further half a million, maybe more, are currently stranded in Libya.”

Of those stuck in Libya, it was estimated that at the end of last year 20,000 refugees and migrants were being held in detention centres run by the DCIM, a division of the Libyan Interior Ministry set up to tackle migration flows into Libya. Thousands more were being held in unofficial detention centres run by militias and criminal gangs, according to the Amnesty report. In both cases, it said, “people are unlawfully detained in inhuman conditions and subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual violence.” Amnesty accused European governments of complicity in this situation.

The IOM says that since the joint operation was scaled up at the end of last year, 17,000 people have left the detention centres in Libya, of whom 11,000 have returned home on a voluntary basis. There remain only around 3,500 people in official detention centres. No doubt there are more people in places of captivity held by militias, but access is a problem, according to Florence Kim of the IOM.

Refugees and migrants

What counts in the Libyan detention centres is whether you are deemed to be an economic migrant or a refugee. Screening of refugees is done by the UNHCR, while voluntary repatriation of migrants is handled by the IOM.

Asked about the criteria for classification as a refugee, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel says that they include “victims of torture, people with medical problems, single women, unaccompanied children and people with disabilities”. “But,” he adds, “I have to say that today in Libya almost everyone is vulnerable, so vulnerability alone is not the criteria. We have to look at whether those people are refugees or migrants. Refugees should not be forced to go home, because they are going to be exposed to persecution or risk.”

Asked how the IOM can be sure its repatriation scheme is really voluntary, Kim said the organisation makes sure that people “know they have a choice, that there is no psychological pressure on them, but at the same time we also know that it’s one of the only life-saving options that they have”.

She says some 80% of people returned home were detained in Libya. The majority of those who go back are from West African countries such as Nigeria, The Gambia, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Their profile depends on the country. “If you take Ivory Coast, 70% to 80% are male aged 18-30, mostly literate,” Kim told swissinfo.ch. “And then from Nigeria you have a lot more women than from other countries of origin, and among those women maybe 80-90% are victims of trafficking.” There are also many unaccompanied minors.

An innovative aspect of the voluntary repatriation programme is reintegration support, whereby the IOM works not only with the individual but also with the community of origin. “You are a returnee. We don’t leave you alone with your reintegration project, we try to put you with other people,” says Kim. “Let’s say we are going to help you build a poultry farm, you are maybe going to be managing that with other returnees. We also try to include potential migrants.” She says this is also designed to avoid tension within the home community.

Coming to Switzerland

Asked about the arrival of the first group of refugees in Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) would say only that they are mostly vulnerable single women who have been evacuated from Libya to Niger. The statement did not give any numbers.

A SEM spokesperson nevertheless told swissinfo.ch that the federal government has been negotiating with the cantons to place the refugees. According to Swiss practice, the refugees will stay in the care of federal authorities for only a few days, before being sent to the cantons for resettlement, according to agreed quotas.

Switzerland is expected to take more refugees currently in temporary centres in Niger, where a mission from SEM has been to conduct its own screening. And the UNHCR is still looking for more host countries for refugees. “We are asking Switzerland and also other European countries and countries outside Europe to take more because we really need to make sure that we evacuate as many people as possible from Niger,” Cochetel told swissinfo.ch.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL -- Even with denuclearization likely on the agenda of an expected summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the two countries still have very different ideas of how the process should look.

The North Koreans confirmed through back-channel communications with the Americans that Kim is willing to discuss denuclearization, U.S. officials said Sunday. This news marked the first mention by either side of bilateral discussion about the summit. Trump said on Monday that he expects to meet with Kim in May or early June.

Yet optimism in Washington remains scant. Foreign-policy hawk John Bolton, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, started as Trump's new national security adviser on Monday. Bolton has long advocated a solution to the North Korea problem that resembles the end of Libya's nuclear program: ensuring complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization before easing sanctions or normalizing diplomatic relations.

In 2003, following secret negotiations with the U.S. and U.K., Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi declared that his country would give up all weapons of mass destruction. Tripoli agreed to submit to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, disclose all activities related to nuclear development, and destroy all ballistic missiles capable of traveling 300km or more. Gadhafi sought to keep his country from becoming isolated by economic and military pressure from parties including the U.S.

But Pyongyang sees this not as a model, but a failure to avoid repeating, pointing to Gadhafi's death in 2011 at the hands of NATO-supported rebels.

""The tragic situation"" of Libya and Saddam Hussein's fall in Iraq shows the consequences of ""putting down arms by temptation and atrocious military threat and blackmail of the U.S.,"" the Rodong Sinmun, a mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party, declared last October.

Kim expressed interest in returning to China-chaired six-party talks in a meeting last month with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The talks -- which also involved the U.S., Russia, Japan and South Korea -- were launched in 2003 to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program, but stalled after the last round in 2008.

Many analysts see the North's sudden interest in returning to the framework as an effort to head off a U.S.-led Libya-style approach by bringing in Beijing, improving prospects for a more gradual denuclearization.

At any rate, denuclearization will likely prove more complicated in North Korea, which has nearly completed its nuclear weapons development, than in a Libya that was only in the early stages of testing. Some in the South Korean government are beginning to argue that the process will need to be gradual and include easing economic sanctions. Seoul hopes to secure a joint statement on denuclearization when President Moon Jae-in meets with Kim on April 27.

The few other examples of countries that have given up nuclear arms include Ukraine, which inherited an arsenal from the Soviet Union after the communist superpower fell. The country signed agreements with global powers including the U.S. and Russia under which it would hand over its weapons to Moscow in return for security assurances and economic support.

This is similar to the endgame sought by North Korea, which looks to guarantee the survival of Kim's government in exchange for phasing out its nuclear program.

South Africa, on the other hand, moved to give up its nuclear weapons on its own after President F.W. de Klerk took office in 1989. He explained that the rationales behind the program -- the government's isolation from the international community due to the institutionalized racial discrimination known as apartheid, and the threat from communist troops in neighboring countries during the Cold War -- no longer applied.",US and North Korea seek different paths to denuclearization,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/North-Korea-crisis-2/US-and-North-Korea-seek-different-paths-to-denuclearization

9,libya,"For over 14 years, Libyan citizen Omar Khalifa Mohammed Abu Bakr was imprisoned without due process by the U.S. at Guantánamo Bay. He was never charged with, let alone convicted of, any crimes. After suffering years of torture and mistreatment, Khalifa was released to Senegal in 2016.

His release was the by-product of a deal negotiated by his attorneys with the U.S. government. Khalifa’s lawyer, CUNY School of Law professor Ramzi Kassem, told the Intercept that the agreement expressly guaranteed that the Libyan would have the right to permanently settle in Senegal and rebuild his life there, rather than be returned to war-torn Libya. In addition to the deteriorating security situation in his home country, Khalifa’s status as a former Guantánamo detainee as well as his tribal background meant that being sent back to his country of origin would mean an almost certain death sentence.

At the time, Senegalese officials made clear that neither they nor the Pentagon viewed Khalifa (and another Libyan detainee released from Guantánamo at the same time to Senegal) as a threat. “These are simply men who we must help because they are African sons who have been tested for years,” Minister of Justice Sidiki Kaba said. “It is important, under the conditions of American law, that these detainees be able to have access to humanitarian asylum.” He added that “the two were not known to be jihadists.”

The official statement from the government of Senegal announced at the time that “the Government of the Republic of Senegal granted today humanitarian asylum to two Libyan nationals, including one disabled, detained without trial for 14 years, even though no charge is held against them.” It added: “This asylum, granted in accordance with the relevant conventions of international humanitarian law, is also part of the tradition of Senegalese hospitality and Islamic solidarity with two African brothers who have expressed the wish to be resettled in Senegal after their enlargement.”

When Khalifa was released, the Miami Herald’s Carol Rosenberg detailed how disabled he was: “Khalifa has no right leg below the knee from a 1998 landmine accident in Afghanistan, and a left leg held together by metal pins from a 1995 construction site accident in Sudan, according to his attorney. Khalifa is blind in his left eye.” The Pentagon Board that found Kahlifa suitable for release said he has a “significantly compromised health condition” and a history of “mediating concerns raised between other detainees and guard staff.”

But last week, the U.S. State Department appears to have abandoned its commitments when releasing Khalifa. A handwritten note in Arabic, delivered to him on Wednesday by Senegalese authorities, informed him that his two years of permitted residency in the country had expired and that he would be deported to Libya on April 3rd.

In addition to putting his life at risk, the letter directly contravened assurances given to him by State Department officials when he was released from Guantánamo, promising that he would be allowed to stay in Senegal permanently and not be returned to Libya under any circumstances. Those promises were made as part of a negotiation between Khalifa’s lawyers and the now-defunct State Department office tasked with closing the detention camp.

Other detainees have resisted being sent to various countries for fear of what would happen to them as ex-Guantánamo detainees. For that reason, lawyers for the detainees have carefully negotiated conditions to secure their safety upon their release.

Another Libyan Guantánamo detainee who was also released to Senegal at the same as Khalifa, Salem Abdul Salem Ghereby, received a similar notice last week informing him of his impending deportation. Both men now face an uncertain but very dangerous future upon their return to Libya.

Speaking to The Intercept, Kassem, Khalifa’s lawyer, said that without immediate intervention on the part of the U.S. State Department to uphold its commitments by halting his deportation from Senegal, Khalifa faces the prospect of imminent death in Libya.

“My client and I relied on U.S. government’s assurances two years ago that Mr. Khalifa’s resettlement in Senegal would be permanent and that he would face no risk of a forced repatriation to imprisonment and torture in Libya,” Kassem said. “But now, the U.S. State Department is nowhere to be found. Irrespective of who sits in the White House today, the United States should honor its promises. For Mr. Khalifa, this is a matter of life or death.”

State Department and Senegalese officials did not immediately respond to request for comment about the case.

In the two years since Khalifa’s release from Guantánamo, he has managed to rebuild some semblance of a normal life in Senegal. Despite crippling physical ailments and psychological trauma suffered as a result of his detention, Khalifa became engaged to a Senegalese woman and had begun making plans to settle and work in the country for the long-term.

Meanwhile, Libya has descended into even greater chaos following its 2011 revolution and a subsequent NATO military intervention against the government of Moammar Gaddafi. Today, the country is under the control of an array of divided armed groups, political factions and tribes that are often in conflict with one another. Were Khalifa to be returned to any of the two major airports in the country, both of which are presently in the hands of hostile tribes and political factions, he would likely be immediately detained, subjected to torture, and even executed.

If Khalifa were to fly to Tripoli, the factions in control of the capital would assume he were an Islamist by virtue of his due-process-free detention by the U.S., and would thus regard him as a threat. But his other option, Misrata, is controlled by a tribe that he says is adverse to his, putting him in at least as much danger upon his return.

Khalifa says that the apparent betrayal by the U.S. government of its promises to him upon release from Guantánamo has put him in an impossible position. Two Libyan government officials who met with him in Senegal to discuss his pending repatriation conceded that it would be impossible to guarantee his safety in Libya, telling him during a meeting that they “couldn’t even guarantee their own safety in Libya, let alone his.”

After already spending a decade and a half of his life imprisoned by the U.S. government without charge, Khalifa now faces the prospect of being abruptly uprooted from his new life and sent to a near-certain death in Libya.

In a statement to The Intercept, Khalifa said: “If the U.S. government told me two years ago that I would remain in Senegal temporarily, only to be sent to Libya after two years, regardless of the situation in Libya, I would have refused resettlement in Senegal. I would have even chosen to remain at Guantánamo over torture and death in a dungeon in Libya.”

He added: “I have grown to love Senegal and its people. The Senegalese friends I have made here invite me to their weddings and festivities. I have learned about the different Islamic practices people follow here, including Sufism. I expected to marry here and to make my life in Senegal—that is still what I want.”","Guaranteed Safety by the U.S., Former Guantánamo Detainee Now Faces Deportation to War-Torn Libya and Likely Death",https://theintercept.com/2018/03/31/guaranteed-safety-by-the-u-s-former-guantanamo-detainee-now-faces-deportation-to-war-torn-libya-and-likely-death/
10,libya,"A visiting British minister on Monday offered his country's ""technical expertise and practical support"" to help curb illegal immigration through Libya, a hub for African migrants bound for Europe.

""We discussed how we can help and support those who are working in such a difficult area and give them the benefit of both technical expertise and practical support from the United Kingdom,"" said Alistair Burt, minister of state for the Middle East.

He singled out efforts to monitor ""the whole routes that migrants take from sub-Saharan Africa"" to Libya.

Such efforts would involve ""giving information to those who seek to travel on the route to tell them that there might be at risk of exploitation... and to intercept them on the route to persuade them to go back and to give them repatriation packages"", Burt said.

""What must be stopped is the trafficking and the migration of people that is exploited and provides the opportunity of significant amounts of money for criminal gangs,"" said Burt, who held talks with Libya's unity government head Fayez al-Sarraj and the UN envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame.

Libya has descended into chaos since the fall of Moammar Gaddafi's regime in a 2011 revolt, and it has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants trying to reach Europe by sea.

11,libya,"8 March 2018, Tunis, Tripoli – WHO delivered lifesaving anti-retroviral (ARVs) medicines for people living with HIV to the Benghazi Centre for Immunology and Infectious Diseases with support from the European Union.

Life for people living with HIV in Benghazi has been further aggravated by the 7-year-old conflict, which has led to the gradual collapse of the health system limiting access to life-saving ARVs. The Benghazi Centre for Immunology and Infectious Diseases has witnessed one death as a result. Furthermore, 7 patients have been admitted to the intensive care unit with active HIV/AIDS and its complications due to the shortages of ARVs.

Most families of people living with HIV struggle to afford the cost of treatment. In Benghazi, more than 400 people living with HIV, including children, receive treatment at the Centre.

WHO has recently provided the Centre with ARVs sufficient for more than 400 patients to cover the treatment for a period of one year, including pediatric preparations. This is not the first shipment, WHO Libya provided the Centre with 2 shipments in the previous year.

“In 2018, more than 400 registered people living with HIV did not receive their treatment due to the acute shortage of the life-saving ARV drugs. This is a clear indication of the critical situation these individuals are going through,” said Dr Jaffar Hussain, WHO Representative in Libya. “WHO will continue to support life-saving interventions in Libya to alleviate the suffering of the people of Libya and extend its gratitude to European Union for its support to health services in Libya”

“We are working in partnership with the Ministry of health and the Benghazi Centre for Immunology and Infectious Diseases to ensure that the shipment of medicines and supplies, which will benefit over 400 people, are delivered to Benghazi,” said Dr Hussein.

12,libya,"Tripoli, Libya - Libyans mourned Sunday after the discovery of the bodies of three small children from the same family kidnapped in 2015 on their way to school near the capital.

Investigators said that based on the confession of one of their kidnappers, the children's decomposed bodies were found on Saturday buried in a forest south of the town of Sorman.

An armed group kidnapped the three, aged between five and 12, on their way to school in Sorman, 70 kilometres (45 miles) west of Libya's capital Tripoli.

Their mother and a driver were with the children at the time of the attack, in which the driver was shot and wounded.

The kidnappers had demanded a ransom from the Shershari family but negotiations failed and the children were killed a month later, investigators said.

They said the family had heard nothing of the children's fate until one of the suspected kidnappers was arrested in March.

The municipality in Sorman declared three days of mourning after the discovery of the children's bodies, and most schools remained closed on Sunday.

""All Libyans are shocked and horrified by this atrocious crime,"" said Fayez al-Sarraj, head of Libya's internationally-recognised unity government.

He vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Libya has been wracked by chaos since a 2011 uprising that toppled and killed its long-time dictator Moamer Kadhafi, with two rival authorities vying for control.

Kidnappers, jihadists and people-traffickers have taken advantage of the turmoil to gain a foothold in the North African country.

Max Ferrari is a journalist and politician. He is a former parliamentary journalist, a war correspondent in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, and director of a TV channel. He is an expert in geopolitics and energy policy. Twitter: @MaxFerrari

He who laughs last laughs better, according to an Italian proverb that applies very well to the case of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president who joined the war in Libya to eliminate Muammar Qaddafi and a few months later also helped to bring down Silvio Berlusconi. That culminated in a famous meeting between Sarkozy and Angela Merkel at which the two used sarcasm toward Italy and laughed at Berlusconi by undermining his credibility.Quite a few, therefore, smiled in Milan and Rome when the French police detained Sarkozy for questioning over allegations that he was paid 50 million euros by the Libyan regime to finance his 2007 presidential campaign.No one in Italy ever believed the French fairytale narrative of the “humanitarian” war in Libya, which France said was “necessary to bring democracy.” Everyone knew that one of Paris’s objectives was to replace the Italians in the near monopoly of exploitation of the Libyan gas and oil fields, and to eliminate Rome’s residual influence in the Mediterranean area.Berlusconi was against the war, but he was worn down by a press campaign orchestrated by the left that accused him of having paid a 17-year-old Moroccan dancer for sex (he was convicted by a court, and later acquitted on appeal) and of being too friendly with “Arab tyrants” such as Qaddafi. The premier surrendered to international pressure and the Italian left.The only Italian party that was vehemently opposed to the war in Libya was the Northern League, which said Italy was not a French colony and the war would destabilize Africa and the Mediterranean and bring millions of illegal migrants into Italy — as indeed happened. Libya was the leading oil supplier and the third-biggest gas supplier to Italy and it was clear to everyone that throwing the country into chaos would not be in Rome’s interest, but anyone who wrote about it was immediately accused of being a “friend of the tyrant.”Then, in January 2016, “Foreign Policy Journal” began to shed light on the role of Barack Obama in the Libyan crisis, and that of his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. One of the 3,000 Clinton emails released by the State Department revealed an international plot to overthrow Qaddafi in order to obtain access to Libyan oil. The email, titled “France’s client and Qaddafi’s gold,” was sent to Clinton by her unofficial adviser Sydney Blumenthal.Even more explicit and full of indiscretions and twists is the book “Sarkozy-Qaddafi, the Secret Story,” published in France at the end of 2017, which gave rise to the police investigation that led to Sarkozy. Journalists Fabrice Arfi and Karl Laske reconstruct the love-hate story between Sarkozy and Qaddafi in 400 pages full of documents, talk about tens of millions of dollars, suitcases full of money transported from Tripoli to Paris, mysteriously disappeared audio recordings, and the strong links between Sarkozy and Qatar.The final chapter of the book is straightforward: “The war in Libya was started on the basis of false information and ends with a mystery: Who killed Qaddafi?” The authors suggest the French track and list various sources: First the Italian newspaper “Corriere della Sera,” which wrote: “In Western diplomatic circles in Libya the most widespread theory is that, if some secret services are involved, then it is certainly the French ... the fact that Paris wanted to eliminate the colonel was an open secret.” Former Libyan minister Mahmoud Jibril also claims: “It was a foreign agent who killed Qaddafi,” and Rami El-Obeidi, coordinator of the external information services of the National Transitional Council, tells the authors that “it was French agents who killed Qaddafi.”We will never know the full truth, but one thing is now certain: Sarkozy’s “democratic war” was a huge and disastrous lie that harmed both Arab countries and Europe.","Sarkozy, Qaddafi and the myth of Libya’s ‘humanitarian’ war",http://www.arabnews.com/node/1270861

Libya is not Saif

Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam, is seeking to run for Presidency in Libya’s 2018 elections. Although he’s wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of crimes against humanity, he wants to “save Libya” and “restore peace and stability.” Most would immediately scoff at how outright ridiculous such a proposition is, seeing as this is the same man who, before the Arab Spring, envisioned that “rivers of blood [would] flow through all the streets of Libya.” Why is there even a chance of Colonel Gaddafi’s golden boy returning to power?

Who is Saif al-Islam?

Before the 2011 uprisings, Saif was seen as a reformist who opposed the Jamahiriyah regime. As tensions began to grow, he instituted himself as the mediator between his father’s concrete repression, and the progressive liberal world. His links went beyond politics; he invited scholars like Francis Fukuyama to speak at Tripoli, and in return attended elite gatherings like the World Economic Forum.

Moreover, he received a PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE) in 2008, with a dissertation that focused on the role of civil society and developing global governance. He also donated approximately €15 million to LSE from his own charity, the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. It was later found out that his thesis was largely plagiarised, and after facing heavy criticism, the Director of the University, Howard Davies, resigned.

Diplomacy was also an area of command for Saif; he led negotiations in abandoning Libya’s weapons of mass destruction in early 2003, and kept intimate ties with British royalty and France’s political class. With a £10m mansion in London, he became a perfectly juxtaposed figure in Colonel Gaddafi’s rule that budding revolutionaries could find hope in. There were actually small pockets of demonstrators during his trial, chanting “Zintan, Zintan, free Saif-al Islam”; the first incident of its kind since the end of the revolution.

In reality, Saif’s reformist character is, to some degree, part of his father’s elaborate ploy for anti-resistance crowd management. In the early days of the 2011 protests, Colonel Gaddafi used his son’s development work as part of a media campaign to advertise what his regime had done for Libyan citizens, pushing everyone to turn a blind eye to the volatility and chaos that his regime was inciting.

Why would he be elected?

Today, there are several accounts of why Libyans would be in favour of Saif’s presidency. For those who benefitted from his father’s regime and were subsequently pushed to the socio-economic and political periphery of the country after his death, the return of Gaddafi rule would mean their “return to the circle of privilege and influence”. It could also mean the return of thousands of Gaddafi supporters from Egypt and Tunisia, who, out of fear of legal retaliation and questioning, remain in exile. In addition, most Gaddafi supporters within the country reside in areas that are inaccessible to journalists, and again, stay silent out of fear of the ruling militias. Outside Libya, foreign support could come from Western businesses who were dealing with the old regime and would approve of Saif’s return.

In general, there is a sense of nostalgia among some Libyans for the old regime in light of Libya’s continuous political and humanitarian crisis. Alongside economic decline where the national currency is plummeting and prices are spiking, the Libyan government is struggling to maintain a monopoly of force within its borders, creating a deleterious security situation. Various factions still vie for control over different regions and often use ruthless violence, kidnappings, and ransom. People are afraid to leave their homes as the possibility of returning safely is indefinite; “the roads are dangerous, there is no governance, and there is no orderly economy“. Although citizens recognize how Gaddafi’s era was terrible and repressive, they long for the greater personal security of his regime; Saif is offering to bring them exactly that.

Can he legally run for office?

Although the ICC has yet to get a hold of him, Saif was arrested in November of 2011 by Libyan rebel group Abubakr al-Siddiq, in the south of the country. He was then transported to another group in the small city of Zintan, where he spent the next 7 years, and where he is believed to be held now as militiamen refuse to hand him to the authorities. In July of 2015, he was put on trial by a Libyan court in Tripoli, and sentenced to death for crimes against the Libyan people. These charges come after his hawkishness during the Arab uprisings as well as his role in ordering airstrikes against peaceful demonstrators.

How is a wanted man legally allowed to run for president? The “Political Isolation” law passed in 2013, preventing all Gaddafi-era officials from holding office, was revoked in 2015 after criticisms from NGOs and politicians for being undemocratic and sweeping. This gives Saif al-Islam, a Libyan citizen, the right to run. The situation challenges the very definition and ideals of democracy itself; would Libya’s elections be free and fair if supporters who truly want Saif as their constituent are silenced? Would intolerance towards those citizens create further hindrance in reconciling the fragmented nation? Despite Libya’s draft constitution of 2011 ruling out any candidate with a criminal record, the demand for a new draft amidst tensions surrounding the upcoming elections and the existing instability in the country make the regulation of such a standard unpromising.

Saif will apparently be running to represent the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya, a party formed in 2016, dedicated to freeing the country from the “control of terrorist organizations”. His “reform agenda” so far reflects the pre-Arab Spring intention; to transition to a constitutional democracy and strengthen the parliament. Planning to release details of his campaign platform soon, his spokesman insists that he is not a “military man” like his father, and hopes for a “modern” and “open-minded” Libya which rejects violence. Everyone who watched his widely broadcasted speech in February 2011, in which he wagged his fingers at Libyans, called them “rats”, and warned that they would “kill one another in the streets”, knows how absurd this claim is.

There are far more significant obstacles to achieving peaceful and transparent elections in Libya than permitting a merciless dictator’s son to contend for the presidency. With freedom of speech and association repressed, arbitrary detainment and harassment of journalists, and other grave human rights violations, the chance of another Gaddafi rule brings to light the desperate need for Libya to address its legal environment. Gaddafi’s son belongs to his father’s autocratic time; as such he cannot possibly be the democratic savior that he claims Libya needs. As Mohammed al-Darrat, member of the Libyan House of Representative put it, “if Saif al-Islam wants to return to power, what was the point of the revolution?”

20,libya,"Brussels, Geneva, Tripoli, Dakar – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, announced today (13/03) that it has assisted 10,171 migrants to return home safely from Libya with support from the European Union, African Union, and the Libyan Government since the scale up of Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) from the country started on 28 November last year. Another 5,200 migrants have returned with the support of African Union member states in the same period. Some 23,302 migrants have returned through IOM’s VHR programme since January 2017.

“We are continuing to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, while increasing efforts to reach stranded migrants outside of detention,” said Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission.

“Since the expansion of our VHR operation, the number of migrants in official detention centres have dropped from an estimated 20,000 people in October 2017 to 4,000 people today, a five-fold decrease. IOM in Libya is also working with the authorities to register migrants, provide lifesaving assistance in the form of health care and essential aid items, psychosocial support, improve consular services and projects promoting community stabilization,” said Belbeisi.

Nearly half of voluntary humanitarian returns carried out by IOM from Libya are part of a larger EU-IOM initiative to protect and assist migrants in need not only in Libya but in 26 countries along the Central Mediterranean Route. This includes crucial support for reintegration of returnees in countries of origin.

Launched in December 2016, with additional funding from Germany and Italy through the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), the EU-IOM Joint Initiative on Migrant Protection and Reintegration is active in Libya and countries in North Africa, the Sahel and Lake Chad region, and the Horn of Africa.

Together with its partners, IOM has been scaling up activities in countries of origin to meet the surge in returns from Libya and ensure that returning migrants receive appropriate assistance upon arrival as well as longer-term support to adjust to life and re-establish themselves in their communities. Reintegration assistance is also available through the programme for those assisted to return from European Union member states.

IOM Regional Director for the EU, Eugenio Ambrosi, said that the huge protection needs and the scale of returns in the last few months under the VHR operation have overtaken initial planning and pose some additional challenges for countries of origin. He cautioned that the reintegration process is complex and requires time.

“We are embarking on a completely new approach to reintegration and we believe in it. It will take some time to build, and in cooperation with authorities in countries of origin and the local communities, we are already seeing promising developments,” said Ambrosi.

“The Joint Initiative, in partnership with the governments of countries of origin and the African Union, aims to make sure that the migration process is safer, and that returning migrants can get back to their countries of origin safely and re-establish their lives without the feeling that they are a burden for their communities and families,” said IOM Regional Director for West Africa, Richard Danziger.

He cautioned, however, that many returnees from Libya are traumatized after having suffered unspeakable abuses, and so their immediate medical and psychosocial needs have taken priority.

The new, integrated approach to reintegration combines support for returning migrants and their home communities. It aims to mitigate possible tensions at home for returnees by involving local communities in the reintegration process and raising awareness to address potential stigma of return. For this reason, capacity building, systems strengthening, social, psychosocial, and community-based aspects are being built into the programme.

Monitoring and evaluation of reintegration activities are also part of the programme’s approach to measure impact and identify good practices to build on.

Under Joint Initiative activities starting from May 2017, 23,500 migrants have received immediate post-arrival and reception assistance after voluntarily returning home from Libya and other countries.

Approximately 16,000 migrants have been assisted with general reintegration support such as referrals and counselling sessions, with options for trainings and job fairs in the pipeline.

Over 5,000 people have received additional reintegration support, including help for individuals to set up a small business with groups of returnees or in partnership with their community. Their projects can be participatory and community-based projects, as well as collective and individual initiatives.

IOM believes that this innovative approach also has the potential to complement local development, particularly in how it is designed to respond to the socio-economic priorities identified by local authorities, migrants and their communities.

“The initiatives we are undertaking with the EU and our African partners represent a new chapter in migration cooperation. It is the first time that substantial funding has been invested to support the priorities and capacity of partner countries to manage return and reintegration and to make migration itself a safer and informed process,” said Ambrosi.

""I am not ashamed to be back home. People can talk and say what they want. I am now back in my country and have found a job,” said Gaspard, who had left Côte d’Ivoire in search of work. After a terrible experience in Libya, he decided to return home with help from IOM through the Joint initiative programme. See the stories of more returnees here.

Background Information

While the VHR programme is not new and IOM has been supporting migrants to return since 2006, the scale-up was launched on November 28th, 2017 when the African Union, European Union and the United Nations came together at the AU-EU Summit in Abidjan to respond to reports of slavery and migrant abuse in Libya.

A tripartite AU-EU-UN taskforce was established with the objective of saving and protecting lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and, in particular, inside Libya, as well as to accelerate the assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin and the resettlement of those in need of international protection for a period of six months (ending 30th May 2018).

The immediate focus of the Task Force was the voluntary repatriation, within six weeks, of at least 15,000 migrants identified in Government-controlled detention centers through the European Union Trust Fund. The joint work of the task force has been instrumental in addressing a number of challenges faced in the evacuation of migrants including: timely issuance of exit visas, granting landing rights to non-Libyan airlines and provision of documentation/consular services for migrants to enable their return.

The EU Trust Fund is backing the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration management through the development of rights-based, development-focused, and return and sustainable reintegration policies and processes.

21,libya,"Tunis, 23 March 2018 – The Government of Libya and the United Nations discussed new way forward to support Libya in a round of consultations on the United Nations Strategic Framework (UNSF) for the period 2019-2020 and Country Programme Documents of UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.

The Strategic Framework constitutes a renewed partnership between the UN and the Government of Libya, and aims to work towards a more sustainable path to development, prosperity, peace, and security. The Framework, which pledges to “leave no one behind,” focuses particularly on benefiting youth, women and the most affected groups by improving respect for human rights, advancing gender equality, empowering women and youth, strengthening the rule of law, eradicating poverty, building institutions, and advancing economic development.

Opening the consultative workshop, HE Taher Jehaimi, Minister of Planning, said: “The new Framework is a qualitative leap in terms of content coming as a result of a broad consultation process that was based on technical assessments in several economic, social and service areas, with the participation of many international and Libyan competences and expertise. It provides further evidence of the gradual improvement of the situation in Libya towards a new stage of more stability at the institutional and security levels, a stage that the government is working to be followed by steps towards economic recovery.”

This new strategic planning framework for cooperation provides a basis for increased collaboration, coherence and effectiveness of UN support in Libya. Under the framework, the UN in Libya commits to foster community resilience and preserve institutions in support of the peacebuilding process. The UNSF also aims at decreasing humanitarian aid dependency by developing the capacity of state institutions (public health, community security, mine action, education, etc.) to respond to the crisis.

During her remarks, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Ms. Maria Ribeiro highlighted that the main objective of the UN is to support the Government of Libya, to realize its national priorities: “The UNSF demonstrates the commitment of the UN to work towards a more integrated approach and enhanced humanitarian, development and peace nexus that will support Libya in responding to the humanitarian crisis while working towards sustainable development, guided by the UN Secretary General. We treat humanitarian response, sustainable development and sustaining peace as three sides of the same triangle”.

The second day of the workshop was dedicated to the presentation and discussion on the new Country Programme Documents of three UN agencies: UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.

UNDP Libya's Country Program Document aims at supporting Libya in the consolidation of effective, inclusive and accountable government institutions, as well as enhancing citizens access to public services and economic opportunities. Through it first country programme for Libya, UNFPA will support the government in building strong and resilient health and social systems for its sustainable and inclusive development to improve the health and well-being of women and youth throughout Libya, focusing on the most vulnerable. The new country programme of UNICEF will provide an engagement framework for the implementation of multi-sectoral programmes for children in water, sanitation, child protection, education, health and nutrition. UNICEF will work with the government to ensure that the revision of policies, strategies and budgets are based on sound evidence, and are child centered and child friendly.","The United Nations and the Government of Libya undertake national consultations on strategic framework for 2019-2020 and UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF country programme documents",https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/united-nations-and-government-libya-undertake-national-consultations-strategic

THE Nigerians who cross the Sahara on their way to Europe were exploited by all kinds of people: in Nigeria in Benin by the agent, in Sahara, on the way to Agadez, by Bedouins and Berbers who extorted money from them.

In Libya, they were sold as slaves usually because they could not pay the asking price which had doubled since they left Benin or for any capricious reason by the racketeers.

Many thousands die in the Mediterranean Sea while crossing Italy or Greece. When rescued; they sought asylum. Many ended up in immigrant camps, with little food and water. Some escaped or are helped to escape for a fee to get to Europe, the Promised Land. Those who did regard their ordeal as a success. Some soon settled down, marry, work; send money home to parents, build houses, in Benin and elsewhere, etc.

All these economic migrant adventurers claim that the reason for leaving was there were no opportunities in Nigeria for them to work.

There is some evidence to support this: for example, 6 million Nigerian were refused university places in five years. Nigeria has massive graduate unemployment even among the few who go to university. There is no viable scheme for skill acquisition and no political will to engage the unemployed beyond slogans.

Frustrations make them fall into the hands of racketeers – African and European, which make them prey to the recruiter (huntsmen) and racketeers.

We in effect have a self-perpetuating myth because the inadequacy of Government, business, and family to respond at all levels. The upshot is the inability to manage ambition, even when these ambitious are irresponsible and unrealistic.

Europe’s hunger for cheap labour, cheap sex, stories which Europeans tell back home about opportunities in Nigeria/African encourage the traffic; expatriate salaries in Africa compared to local salaries merely exacerbate a bad situation.

Some feel that if Europeans can earn such huge salaries in Africa, why should Africans not have such differential pay in Europe? Even legitimate services – an expatriate doctor or engineer – earns well above his Nigerian counterpart in Nigeria. When the Nigerian doctor or engineer works in Europe the Nigeria has no such luck: in fact, his pay, some claim, is usually less.

Victor was sold as a slave, rescued in Libya, deported to Nigeria. CNN traced him back to Benin where his story originally began and thus informing CNN’s story of how the trade is conducted.

The CNN does not tell us how or by whom Victor was rescued. When slaves are sold it is usually for life but Victor is able to escape. Large swarth of Southern Sudan is occupied by Nigerians – at last count – over 1.5 million – usually people on their way to Mecca who failed to do so. There are Nigerians in almost all the countries in Africa. But they are not slaves.

Long before the CNN exposé, Nigerian women have been recruited and trafficked, mainly by people from East European countries – Serbia, Montenegro, Chek, Slovakia, and Russia. Others are Italian, Dutch traffickers who use a different route – the women fly into these countries and join an elaborate network of prostitution, menial labour during which they pay off their recruiters, sometimes with promises that the Nigerians arrange for their sisters, and relatives and friends as new fodder for the system. Hundreds are enterprising, work hard, pay off their debts, marry locally, and send money home. Benin is full of houses built by women who live overseas.

Back to Victor: he is vocal in captivity – and returns to Nigeria. If CNN can find him, so can many other organizations. What has happened to Victor and other returnees in Nigeria? Our security service presumably has debriefed them. If so how come no arrest of the traffickers in Benin and elsewhere despite the boast of Edo State Attorney General.

There are Nigerian’s who are enamored to NGOs. Why is there not one trying to help returnees?

Government response has so far been short of any coherent policy and woefully inadequate. An old adage is don’t give fish to a person: rather teach him how to fish.

If a CNN reporter can identify the traffickers in Nigeria, so can our security forces – why not persecute and jail them for their activities? The usual panacea of job training, counseling, etc. should be employed in Nigeria for Victor and his ilk. What is the ministry of Nigeria Foreign Affairs doing in Libya? We always had a robust security service system in Libya and Niger and Chad? What happened? Is there no Consular Service in Libya?

However, we should ask the Bleeding Hearts of the United States and Europe, who broke Libya? The traffickers started operating fully, after the West removed the most effective Government in Libya since 1966. They orchestrated the destruction of Gadhafi without replacing him with an effective Government – a feat they repeated in Egypt and Iraq and Iran. Western interests in these areas are different and opposed to the progressive interests of the people of the area.

The West must own the vessel they broke in Libya in as much the same way as they must own that broken in Egypt and the rest of the Maghreb.

Why does Libya want slaves? Don’t they have enough workers? The CNN does not tell us this because it would explain why a widespread practice of two or three auctions is held daily in Libya.

Victor wants to be a designer but there are technical colleges in Nigeria – why didn’t he go there? What was his qualification which made him unable to get a job? Many of the returnees have claimed that they saved N1.5 million which they spent on the Libyan adventure.

According to CNN, there is international complicity in the trafficking of slaves. The arrival of these economic migrants is one of the feedstock for the far right movement and the isolation politics in Europe.

The world response when CNN aired this programme operation of slavery was against the West. This was massive. The reaction in Nigeria was tepid and even indifferent.

The West moved to repatriate 15,000 instead of the miserable 1000 per month.

CNN traced those repatriated – CNN comes to Nigeria, to an unsavoury neighbourhood where they men Pusherman, Eveke and an army of traffickers – selling hopes through trafficking human beings. The pusherman Eveke arranged for them to go to Auchi the North of Edo State. The programme now introduced the possibility that women were or might be abused – Eveke – knows and tell them – gives them condoms. The arrangement was that you pay nothing at the beginning; payment was to be made in Libya. In my more cynical mood, I would have doubted several aspects of this arrangement. The CNN did not find one female in camp in Libya. Eveke’s “introduction” of condoms may have been to sex up the story by CNN.

Thus a customer presumably carried the money and contraception during the trip.

The Edo Attorney General condemned the traffic, threatened prosecution and imprisonment but gratuitously added that the causes of human trafficking had “deep cultural roots, which must be exposed and pulled out”. Really!! Mr. A.G. what could this possibly mean?

We are told that Victor was responsible for his mother and three siblings – Victor was of an indeterminable age anywhere between 26 and 36 years old. He had, he claimed, returned to poverty which was worse than slavery. He hoped to go to Europe again through Libya

Victor is responsible for mother including a baby and 3 siblings but have no father. Victor looks like 30 years old, what was his CV and what did he do to collect N1.5million plus the other money that was lost to rescue him?","Victor, CNN, Libya and slavery (2)",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/victor-cnn-libya-slavery-2/
