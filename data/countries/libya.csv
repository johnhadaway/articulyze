CAIRO – 1 May 2018: The International Quartet Committee on Libya praised on Monday the important security dialogue facilitated by the Egyptian government amid its continuing diplomatic efforts to settle the Libyan crisis.The Quartet held its fourth meeting at the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo to discuss the developments in Libya since its last meeting in New York in September 2017 and reviewed the coming steps for the country’s democratic transition.The meeting was chaired by Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary general of the Arab League, and involved former president of Burundi Pierre Buyoya, the African Union high representative for Mali and the Sahel; Federica Mogherini, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy and the special representative of the UN secretary-general and head of the UN support mission in Libya Ghassan Salame.The Quartet welcomed the decision by the Libyan Supreme Court that effectively validated the decision taken by the Constitutional Drafting Assembly in July 2017, to establish a broad-based consensus among all Libyan stakeholders towards holding a constitutional referendum.The Quartet further emphasized the importance of holding parliamentary and presidential elections in accordance with the requisite legal framework that must be enacted and approved for this purpose, including a constitutional framework and electoral law. They recognized the important preparatory efforts of the Presidency Council and the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC), in particular through the registration of eligible voters, and welcomed the high number of new registered voters in this process. The Quartet noted that there are plans to hold elections before the end of the year in line with the UN Action Plan for Libya.The Quartet expressed its willingness to coordinate its efforts to provide support, including through the deployment of electoral assistance or observer missions, to allow for the conduct of free, fair and credible elections.The Quartet emphasized the continued need to comprehensively address the security challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons, by armed groups outside of State authority, and by smuggling and trafficking networks. They stressed the importance of a united Libyan military operating under civilian oversight and a unified chain of command that is capable of consolidating peace and security throughout the country.Since the ouster of Libyan long-time leader Muammar Ghaddafi more than six years ago, the war-torn country draws wide international and regional attention, causing a serious threat on the national security of North Africa and Europe.Libya, which is struggling to get through the critical political situation that it has been experiencing since 2011, is not only trying to unify its army, but is longing to revive its political functions by conducting presidential and legislative elections.Egypt has hosted several meetings to bring the Libyan conflicted factions to the negotiations table to resolve the Libyan crisis and amend the Skhirat agreement, which aims at ending Libya’s civil war.The major obstacle in the face of any international or Arab participation in ending the crisis in Libya is the lack of a Libyan partner that would support any involvement. Since 2014, there are two major factions on the ground, one led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army, who now controls the eastern side of Libya and works in cooperation with the government of the House of Representatives, known as the Tobruk government. The other is led by Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the UN-backed Libyan Government of National Accord.Therefore, there is no official side recognized by all parties in Libya, but there are two opposing factions, roughly equivalent in terms of power, competing for legitimacy. Nonetheless, neither side appears to be able to tip the scales of this conflict in its favor.Policymakers in Egypt believe that Libya should have a unified body representing all sides in the war-torn country. However, this requires the elimination of terrorist groups that are plaguing the country and standing in the way of any regional or international attempt for reconciliation.The Egyptian state is aware that any intervention in Libyan affairs will enrage the Libyan people due to religious and national sensitivities.Therefore, Egypt called for a meeting in August 2014 to discuss the formation of a coalition force with the United States and other Arab nations. The final recommendation of the meeting, held in Cairo, did not suggest the formation of any Arab or international military intervention in Libya, but it called for the immediate cessation of all armed operations in order to support the political process in Libya.In December 2015, the Skhirat Agreement was signed by major parties in the Libyan conflict under the supervision of UN envoy Martin Kobler in the city of Skhirat, Morocco. The agreement recommends a peaceful transition of power and the establishment of a national unity government. However, the agreement failed to achieve the desired stability on the ground because it lacked consensus.Egypt’s officials held several meetings with their Libyan counterparts as well as members in Tobruk’s House of Representatives to resolve the Libyan crisis and amend the Skhirat agreement.In December 2016, Cairo hosted a conference attended by Libyan officials and representatives from the country’s numerous factions, where they issued five proposed amendments to the agreement. The conference concluded with a decision to amend the eighth article of the Skhirat agreement that outlined the jurisdiction of the Libyan army chief commander.Negotiations to unify the Libyan military were held as a part of Egypt’s initiative that kicked off in July 2017 to unify the military institutions. The first meeting aimed at creating a framework for the initiative while the second and third meetings were held in Cairo from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2, 2017, to follow up on the results of the first meeting.The fourth meeting was held from Dec. 6 to 9 to restructure the Libyan army.Egyptian Officials met again with Libyan military forces in Cairo on Feb. 21, 2018 in order to continue the discussions. The meetings delved into the methods used to unify and restructure the Libyan military forces after a long split that resulted from the outbreak of the Libyan revolution in 2011.The sixth round of the negotiation on the unification of the Libyan military establishment was held on March 23 in Cairo.In a press release issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the Libyan factions convening in Cairo agreed to resume with their talks in an attempt to complete the establishment of the four technical committees that the Libyan factions agreed on forming during the previous rounds of talks as an initial step towards the consolidation of the military establishment of Libya.The meeting also concluded with reaffirming the participant’s keenness to move ahead with unifying the Libyan army whose top priority is to maintain and preserve Libya’s national security and peace and stand firm against foreign interferences.Members of the Security Council welcomed recent efforts to strengthen an inclusive political dialogue among all Libyans, supported by Libya’s neighbors, international partners and regional organizations within the framework of the Libyan Political Agreement endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2259.",Int'l diplomatic attempts continue to end Libyan crisis,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/2/49065/Int-l-diplomatic-attempts-continue-to-end-Libyan-crisis

“A billion dollars could be lost a year if the crisis lingers longer.” Sanallah said.

On the sidelines of the Libyan-Italian Forum, Sanallah said Al-Feel oilfield has been shut since February 23, thus making Libya lose 6 million dollars a day all over security issues and so-called Petroleum Facilities Guard personnel, NOC media office reported.

“The efforts of the oil industry personnel paid off over the recent years and Libya has been lately producing about a million bpd despite lack of security.” Sanallah added.

He also shed light on the plane crash at Sharara oilfield, saying roads are still not secure and blocked since last January “that’s why we had to use planes for supplying the workers with goods and other basic needs.”

2,libya,"A former Guantanamo Bay inmate detained because of his alleged links with Al Qaeda worked as an adviser for Libya’s oil sector.

Omar Deghayes, who campaigns on behalf of people still detained in the US detention centre, was director of legal affairs at Libya's Ministry of Oil and Gas and claimed to be a legal consultant for the National Oil Corporation, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The NOC did not respond to a request for comment but chairman Mustafa Sanalla told an analyst that Mr Deghayes did not advise them and was not paid by the NOC.

""Omar Deghayes was employed by the previous Ministry of Oil. He returned to the UK after that. He is not paid by NOC, nor does he advise anybody at NOC,"" according to Mr Sanalla in a message seen by The National.

Mr Deghayes spent five years in the detention camp after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. He had earlier fled Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban after the 2001 US-led invasion.

The Libyan-born lawyer, 48, was freed in 2007 but left partially sighted after he said his eye was gouged by a camp guard.

Influence in the NOC is significant since the divided country’s economy hinges almost entirely on the oil sector, according to analysts.

Most of Libya’s oil resources lie in the east of the country, but former dictator Muammar Qaddafi moved the company’s headquarters to Tripoli. Benghazi, in the east of the country, now wants greater influence.

Rival factions based in Tripoli and the east have vied for power over the past four years, with some groups in the east making unsuccessful attempts to sell oil independently of Tripoli.

Libya’s oil production, which was crippled by conflict and blockades after 2013, partially recovered and last year reached more than one million barrels per day in 2017. Last month, the NOC was involved in discussions with BP and ENI over their planned return to Libya for oil exploration, according to a company statement.

Mr Deghayes would have been closely aligned to previous Libyan administrations, but he was no longer part of constituency that the NOC would have to please, said Claudia Gazzini, senior analyst for Libya at the International Crisis Group who received the message from Mr Sanalla.

The company was aware of his background, Mr Deghayes said on Saturday. “Guantanamo is not something that shames me,” he wrote to The National. “Proud to have been a political prisoner … Draw your own conclusions why.”

All sides in the divided country are aware of the need to ensure that the NOC can continue to operate unfettered by political feuding because of its economic importance to Libya, said Alison Pargeter, an independent Libya expert.

“As with so many things in Libya, therefore, neither side is strong enough to dominate fully, meaning that there is an uneasy balance between the competing powers over control of the energy sector.

“This has enabled the NOC to go about its business and, importantly, to retain its independence.”

Ian Walker, the managing director of London-based Middle East consultants MEC International, said the NOC’s day-to-day operations were run professionally but questions remained about transparency.

Mr Deghayes fled the country in 1986 after his father, a trade unionist, died in prison under the Qaddafi regime.

He settled in southern England and studied law before travelling to Afghanistan. He was detained in Pakistan after the downfall of the Taliban and was sent to the notorious detention centre in Cuba.

Mr Deghayes was released without charge in 2007 and was one of 17 detainees paid a total of £20 million by the UK government.

He last week won an apology from a British newspaper for suggesting that he used some of the money to pay his nephews to attend a gym where they had been radicalised. Two of the three nephews who travelled to Syria were later killed. In its apology, the Daily Telegraph newspaper accepted that Mr Deghayes was not responsible for his nephews travelling to Syria and agreed to pay damages and costs.

Following his release from Guantanamo, Mr Deghayes was immediately held after Spain launched an aborted prosecution claiming that he was part of an Al Qaida cell in the country. He was allegedly part of a group that helped send recruits to terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.

He was accused by the US of having direct links to Abu Qatada, a radical preacher described as Al Qaeda’s “spiritual ambassador” in Europe, according to the Sunday Times in 2007.

The US said that he was “jihadi veteran” of the Bosnian war and was an associate of a leader of a dozen suicide bombers who killed 33 people in Casablanca, Morocco, in 2003.

His legal team claimed that Mr Deghayes was a victim of a US smear campaign and described the allegations against him as “absolute drivel”. They pointed out he was never charged with any offence before his release from Guantanamo.

Mr Deghayes is head of the legal section of the Guantanamo Justice Centre, founded by former prisoners to help those still inside and those that have been released.

“One of the many stigmas that are still carried by those who have been released is being constantly referred to as 'terrorists suspects' and yet none of the men who have been released have ever been charged with a crime nor were they convicted of any offence,” the group notes. “Trying to re-build a life with these kinds of stigmas is extremely difficult.”",Former Guantanamo prisoner advised Libyan oil industry,https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/former-guantanamo-prisoner-advised-libyan-oil-industry-1.728037

The political and security situation in Libya continues to be deeply divided, as three authorities including the Tripoli based UN-backed Government of National Accord, vie for political legitimacy, control of territory, resources and infrastructure. Armed conflict and political instability have impacted the lives of more than three million people across the country, displacing hundreds of thousands and disrupting people’s access to basic services, including fuel and electrical power, as well as severely constraining life-saving protection and humanitarian assistance.

The protection crisis in Libya is characterised by violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, restricted access to safety and freedom of movement, forced displacement, severity and pervasiveness of gender-based violence. All parties to the conflict have committed breaches of international law including torture, unlawful killings, indiscriminate attacks, abductions, kidnapping, disappearances and the forceful displacement of people. The number of people with mental health and psychosocial problems increased substantially as a result of the conflict, including severe psychological distress for the conflict affected population, as well as the contamination from explosive hazards affecting human security and access.

Due to the volatile security and access limitations, the majority of international humanitarian actors continue their involvement in Libya with remote management work modality through national and local actors as well as key official stakeholders.",Libya Protection Sector Strategy 2018-2019,https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-protection-sector-strategy-2018-2019

But Rome also alerted the Libyan coastguard which took charge of coordinating the rescue operation and banned the NGO ship from approaching, also ordering it to move away when migrants jumped into the water to avoid being picked up by the Libyans.

The Libyan navy later announced it had rescued more than 300 migrants in three separate operations, reporting one dead and three missing.

The two victims were with 114 other migrants including 21 women and four children, said a Libyan navy spokesman, General Ayoub Kacem, although he declined to say whether they had been aboard the boat seen by the Aquarius.

And he warned that tensions between the Libyan coastguard and the NGO boats could worsen over coming days if they continued to approach stricken boats.

The Libyan coastguard has previously accused NGOs of causing panic and confusion by their presence during rescues as the migrants all surge to reach the charter boats to avoid being returned to Libya.

But Italian deputy Riccadro Magi, who was present on board the Astral, a boat chartered by the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, earlier Sunday when it rescued 105 migrants, accused the Libyans of being heavy-handed.

“The Libyans act as pirates in international waters demanding that they be recognised as an authority. They act outside the law and they do so with the means provided by the Italian government,” he said on Twitter.

On Saturday, the Libyan coastguard also forced the Astral and another ship to move away from a boat carrying 38 migrants.

Last November, German charity group Sea Watch said lives had been needlessly lost because of a Libyan coastguard being trained and financed by the European Union.

6,libya,"AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK, MAY 3, 2018—Hundreds of migrants and refugees are being held in a dangerously overcrowded detention center in Libya, without adequate food or water and in inhumane conditions, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned today.

Roughly 800 migrant and refugee men, women, and children are detained in the detention center in the port city of Zuwara, many of whom have been held for more than five months. The situation is deteriorating daily as more refugees and migrants are arbitrarily detained, including more than 500 people in the last 15 days alone. The number held far exceeds the center's capacity, with floor space so limited it is barely possible to lie down.

""The situation is critical,"" said Karline Kleijer, MSF emergency program manager. ""We strongly urge all international agencies with a presence in Libya, representatives from the countries of origin, and the Libyan authorities to do everything they can to find a solution for these people over the next few days.""

Since April 18, an MSF emergency team has provided health care to the detainees in the center.

On May 1, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR airlifted 88 people in need of international protection from Zuwara to another detention center in Tripoli in order to identify the most vulnerable individuals for potential evacuation abroad. The Libyan authorities have transferred some people to other detention centers in an attempt to reduce the extreme overcrowding, and the International Organization for Migration has started a process of ""voluntary humanitarian return"" for some detainees. However, there is no solution in sight for many of the estimated 800 people who remain in the detention center in Zuwara.

A large number of refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers in Zuwara have already endured alarming levels of violence and exploitation in Libya and during harrowing journeys from their home countries. Many are from eastern or western African countries, but some are from as far away as southern Asia. Some were malnourished on their arrival to the center as they had been held captive by smuggling networks in the area.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, managed to deliver this week urgently needed assistance to hundreds of displaced Libyan families in the town of Murzuk, in southern Libya. Humanitarian help is desperately needed in this region of Libya where recent deadly clashes between armed groups in and around the city of Sabha (some 760 km south of Tripoli) have forced an estimated 1,900 Libyan families to flee their homes.

A UNHCR emergency aid convoy left the Libyan capital Tripoli on 4 April. The convoy, consisting of seven trucks loaded with basic aid items was able to enter Sabha the following day where we distributed humanitarian assistance to 850 displaced families. Access to Murzuq and Oubari further south was initially blocked due to security reasons, and the aid had to wait in Sabha.

However, earlier this week, the local population began using the main roads from Sabha to Murzuk. This gave UNHCR a window of opportunity to urgently deliver core relief items to the city of Murzuk where on Wednesday (18 April) 370 displaced families finally received much needed aid.

The displaced Libyan population in the south badly needs adequate shelter and basic household items including hygiene kits, sleeping mats, mattresses and kitchen sets. To make matters worse, humanitarian access to this part of Libya has been restricted for weeks and the situation remains extremely volatile. Many have sought refuge in local schools, hospitals and other public buildings.

In Libya, currently more than 184,000 internally displaced people are in need of humanitarian assistance as well as 368,000 people who have recently returned to their homes. UNHCR continues to advocate on their behalf and to provide relief until they can find durable solutions, including returning home on a voluntary basis and in conditions of dignity and safety.

To respond to the needs of more than half a million Libyans uprooted by the conflict, UNHCR has increased its capacity and resources by 300 percent in recent months.

Our ultimate goal is to alleviate their suffering in such a protracted ordeal, while respecting their dignity"".

Under the agreement, a relief action plan will be implemented in southern cities of Libya, covering the following domains:

Health care: This involves (a) training 180 physicians, nurses, and midwives; (b) providing three major hospitals and three health centers with medicines, equipment, and medical consumables; and (c) deploying mobile medical convoys to three underserved districts. Food aid: Food packages will be distributed to 4,000 households, containing rice, pasta, canned tuna, sugar, and other food staples. Water and sanitation: This aspect involves digging water wells and installing pumps and power generators for three cities, with an overall population of 100,000 people. Shelter: Nonfood items will be distributed to 4,000 households. These include mattresses, adults' and kids' blankets, and rugs.

Another two supplementary schemes will be pursued, one to procure medical supplies for Misurata Central Hospital, and the other to support the Azzaytuna University in Tarhuna with academic equipment, educational materials for labs, an e-library, lab renovation, and voltage regulators.

They stressed the importance of a united Libyan military operating under civilian oversight and a unified chain of command that is capable of consolidating peace and security throughout the country.Since the ouster of Libyan long-time leader Muammar Ghaddafi more than six years ago, the war-torn country draws wide international and regional attention, causing a serious threat on the national security of North Africa and Europe.Libya, which is struggling to get through the critical political situation that it has been experiencing since 2011, is not only trying to unify its army, but is longing to revive its political functions by conducting presidential and legislative elections.Egypt has hosted several meetings to bring the Libyan conflicted factions to the negotiations table to resolve the Libyan crisis and amend the Skhirat agreement, which aims at ending Libya’s civil war.The major obstacle in the face of any international or Arab participation in ending the crisis in Libya is the lack of a Libyan partner that would support any involvement. Since 2014, there are two major factions on the ground, one led by Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army, who now controls the eastern side of Libya and works in cooperation with the government of the House of Representatives, known as the Tobruk government. The other is led by Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the UN-backed Libyan Government of National Accord.Therefore, there is no official side recognized by all parties in Libya, but there are two opposing factions, roughly equivalent in terms of power, competing for legitimacy. Nonetheless, neither side appears to be able to tip the scales of this conflict in its favor.",Libya's Haftar announces launch of operation to liberate Derna,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/49526/Libya-s-Haftar-announces-launch-of-operation-to-liberate-Derna

“The humanitarian situation in Libya is critical, not only for refugees and displaced people … but as a whole,” said Amin Awad, director of the Middle East and North Africa Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

“Public services, health, education and other services are not available, and there are almost none in many areas,” he added.

A recent UNHCR report revealed that 1.1 million people in Libya need humanitarian aid, including 165,478 internally displaced persons since 2011 and 341,354 returnees. A further 100,000 people are Asylum seekers.

The UN official stressed that “most of the Libyan people today are in need of humanitarian aid because of the deteriorating living conditions and the lack of services. This has prompted many of them to leave their villages to other areas.”",United Nations: 1.1 million people in Libya in need of humanitarian aids,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180413-united-nations-1-1-million-people-in-libya-in-need-of-humanitarian-aids/
14,libya,"A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner detained over alleged links with al Qaeda has worked as an advisor in the Libyan oil industry, The National reports.

Omar Deghayes, born in Libya, fled the country in 1986 and settled in the UK. In the early 2000s, he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and was arrested in Pakistan in 2002. Deghayes spent five years at Guantanamo Bay and was released in 2007 without charge.

Deghayes was director of legal affairs at the Libyan oil ministry, and according to his LinkedIn profile, he is legal consultant at the National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya.

NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla has told an analyst that Deghayes did not advise the company and was not paid by the NOC.

“Omar Deghayes was employed by the previous Ministry of Oil. He returned to the UK after that. He is not paid by NOC, nor does he advise anybody at NOC,” Sanalla said in a message sent to Claudia Gazzini, senior analyst for Libya at the International Crisis Group, and seen by The National.

Deghayes told The National in a written statement that the Libyan company was aware of his background.

Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, a civil war between feuding factions has crippled Libya’s oil industry. Before the war, Libyan production was 1.6 million bpd. The North African oil producer has recently managed to lift and stabilize its production at around 1 million bpd, but risks still persist with rival factions fighting for control and suddenly disrupting oil facilities’ operations and oil export terminals.

Libya was initially exempt from the OPEC production cuts together with Nigeria because of the violence in the two countries that had substantially reduced their oil production. At the meeting at which OPEC extended the pact until the end of 2018, Libya and Nigeria agreed to stick to an unofficial collective cap of 2.8 million bpd of oil production.
