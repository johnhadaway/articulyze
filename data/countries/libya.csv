It represents a unique opportunity for all Libyans to contribute to fostering stability, advancing national reconciliation and shaping the future of their country.

The NCP does not seek to replace the other pillars of the UN action plan (the electoral, constitutional and Libyan Political Agreement amendment process), but to reinforce them and ensure that the approach taken is in line with the will of the Libyan people. The outcomes of the consultative process will form the foundation of the National Conference. The NCP also seeks to complement the ongoing outreach efforts led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Ghassan Salamé, and the UN Support Mission in Libya.

“The launch of the NCP represents new dynamism in the search for a solution to the crisis in Libya.” said David Harland, HD’s Executive Director. “This is an opportunity for all Libyans to propose solutions and reflect on the future they want for their children.”

The two first NCP public consultations took place today in Benghazi and Zwara. These sessions will be followed by additional public consultations in other locations throughout the country and abroad in the coming months.

Mr Ghassan Salamé conveyed his congratulations to the Libyan citizens who participated in today’s public consultations, as well as his gratitude towards HD for supporting the NCP.

HD would like to thank Libyan authorities for their co-operation and calls on all Libyans to actively participate in the NCP either physically or electronically.

1,libya,"As Libya continues to reel under the brunt of division that left it with three governments, namely the Government of National Accord (GNC), the interim Libyan government and the rescue government formed by the General National Congress, it remains unclear when elections will next be held in the country. To identify the most important challenges facing the High National Elections Commission (HNEC), which was formed to complete the electoral process called for by UN envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame, Al-Monitor interviewed elections commission head Emad al-Sayeh on April 1, the day Libya closed registration of overseas voters. Sayeh explained the challenges facing the commission and showed how political differences, division and the multiplicity of governments could affect the electoral process in Libya.

Salame had called for presidential and parliamentary elections and a constitutional referendum by the end of this year in order to unify the ruling institutions in Libya.

The text of the phone interview follows:

Al-Monitor: Would it be better to hold the legislative or the presidential elections first? Why?

Sayeh: I think it would be better to hold the parliamentary elections first so that the executive power could keep preparing for the presidential elections. Holding the parliamentary elections first will ensure the continuation of the current government, which is helping the HNEC prepare for the presidential elections.

Al-Monitor: Are there any foreign or internal parties obstructing the elections?

Sayeh: There are countries that have interests in Libya. And while there are countries that support the holding of the elections, others just don’t. International interference is linked to interests, and it certainly affects the electoral process in Libya.

Al-Monitor: What are the main challenges facing the HNEC?

Sayeh: Lack of funding is the main challenge facing the HNEC. We have considerable difficulty obtaining the necessary funds for the elections to be held this year. Without funding, the HNEC’s plans will not be implemented. The presidential council of the internationally recognized GNC finances the HNEC. But this council includes several members, each of whom has a different viewpoint on the electoral process in Libya. This very divergence of views within the council obstructs the funding process.

Al-Monitor: What measures have been taken by the HNEC to fight electoral fraud?

Sayeh: For the HNEC, accepting the electoral results is an important factor, so we must protect the electoral process against any appeals by fighting electoral fraud. We are seeking to resort to technological means in the polling mechanism in order to limit human interference.

Al-Monitor: Why did you say that refraining from holding the elections would eventually lead to splits?

Sayeh: That’s true. Not holding the elections would only lead to deeper division in Libya. Political splits would surface at all levels. If the Libyan elections are not held this year, then the Libyan political scene in 2019 would witness political divisions and splits.

Al-Monitor: But splits could surface and armed confrontations could erupt as soon as political parties object to the results of the elections to be held.

Sayeh: The international community and the United Nations must oblige all parties to accept the results, and whoever has an objection in this regard must resort to the judiciary.

Al-Monitor: Have any local or international bodies declared their desire to monitor the elections? Are you facing problems in this regard?

Sayeh: Parliament has not issued an electoral law yet. Once we have an electoral law, we will invite all international institutions to monitor the process and we will start accepting requests from local organizations wishing to do so. The local organizations suffer from poor performance and lack of expertise, so the role of the international organizations would be to train these organizations. But the HNEC has no objection to any monitoring, and we will take all the necessary measures to ensure that the elections are transparent.

Al-Monitor: Do you think that the participation of the military elements in the Libyan armed forces led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter in the voting process would raise doubts about the neutrality of the elections, especially as these members will be responsible for establishing security during the elections?

Sayeh: Such argument would prevent any statesman from participating in the electoral process. It is an exclusionary argument. Every Libyan citizen has the right to vote regardless of the job they have. And it is only when military men wish to run in the elections that they must resign.

Al-Monitor: Is there a timetable for the constitutional referendum and the presidential and parliamentary elections?

Sayeh: There is no timetable because no law has been issued yet, but as a commission we want the electoral law to be issued in September so we get enough time to prepare for the electoral process.

Al-Monitor: Is there some kind of coordination between the HNEC and the conflicting Libyan parties, such as the GNC, the interim Libyan government, the Libyan armed forces and the parliament?

Sayeh: There is high-level coordination with the GNC, and there is constant communication with its Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. There is also coordination with the interim government, the Libyan armed forces and the parliament.

Al-Monitor: Does the political dispute in Libya affect the work of the HNEC?

Sayeh: It definitely does. And the most important result of this dispute is the weak funding plaguing the HNEC, especially considering that it is an independent institution.

Al-Monitor: How do the elections affect the current situation?

Sayeh: All the Libyan parties outside the authorities support the political elections. The Libyan community needs the elections, and the evidence is the high number of people who registered on the electoral roll. Libyan citizens feel these elections are a way out of the Libyan crisis.

Al-Monitor: Did you expect 2,432,502 domestic voters and 6,267 overseas voters to register on the electoral roll?

Sayeh: We did not expect such a strong turnout. We were expecting only half a million, but this is an indication that Libyans are ready to strongly take part in the electoral process as voters and candidates.

Al-Monitor: What guarantees are in place to ensure the integrity of the elections abroad?

Sayeh: The Libyan community abroad is limited, and only about 6,000 voters have registered on the current electoral roll, but the HNEC’s duty is to secure a voting mechanism across the Libyan embassies. We will be applying the same mechanisms both at home and abroad in order to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.",Can holding elections help ease divisions in Libya?,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/hnec-head-emad-sayeh-interview-libya-parliamentary-elections.html

Highlights

Over the past weeks, clashes between armed groups in the southern region of Libya have resulted in the displacement of thousands of civilians to safer areas in Sabha (850 families), Ubari (307 families) and Murzuq (413 families). Following a rapid needs assessment and in coordination with authorities and partners, UNHCR has started the distribution of sleeping mats, kitchen sets, hygiene kits, and other non-food items (NFIs) to respond to the humanitarian needs of over 1,500 displaced families (IDPs) currently displaced in the southern region. The humanitarian aid was dispatched in seven trucks from Tripoli.

UNHCR Response

UNHCR’s strategy to support IDPs aims at strengthening advocacy and at promoting access to rights, basic services and solutions for IDPs throughout Libya. As the lead agency for the protection of IDPs, UNHCR has increased its capacity and expanded its partnerships in order to conduct protection monitoring, identify needs and guide effective responses. UNHCR continues to provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs and returnees, including basic assistance in the form of NFIs and cash-based interventions (CBIs).

On 4 April, UNHCR visited the Tawergha IDP community in Tarhuna (65 km southwest of Tripoli). The city currently hosts between 4,000 and 4,500 IDP families (over 20,000 individuals) from Sirte, Benghazi, Misrata, Tawergha, and Mashasha. UNHCR visited Tawergha settlements in the city and also consulted the host community to assess the most pressing needs. Access to clean water and sanitation issues are major concerns for both IDPs and the host community.

UNHCR conducted focus group discussions and identified potential water and sanitation solutions in order to improve living conditions, benefitting both host community and IDP populations.

On 2 April, UNHCR visited returnee communities in Kikla, in the Nafusa Mountains (130 km southwest of Tripoli), for the second time in 2018. Over 1,600 families have voluntarily returned to Kikla since mid-2015 and are in urgent need of shelter and clean water. UNHCR conducted focus group discussions and identified future interventions with the community. A follow up mission to identify quick impact projects to support hospitals and public infrastructure took place during the same week.

UNHCR’s support to host communities, IDPs and returnees in Benghazi continues in coordination with the local authorities. Benghazi is currently hosting over 32,000 IDPs and 174,000 returnees. New quick impact projects are being implemented over the coming weeks to make infrastructural improvements and support persons with specific needs. UNHCR is providing persons of concern with 400 assistive devices, such as crutches and wheelchairs, with the objective of supporting the local social security system. Water tanks, solar street lights and waste management items are also being delivered to enhance the community’s infrastructural capacities.

UNHCR and UNFPA continue to distribute assistance to displaced women and girls in Libya. After conducting an assessment, a distribution of 8,500 dignity kits is taking place in over 16 locations including Tripoli, Misrata, Sabha, Nafusa Mountains, Bani Walid, Janzour, Ubari and Murzaq. These kits are meant to provide an immediate relief in sites where access to clean water and sanitation is difficult.",UNHCR Flash Update Libya (31 Mar. – 6 Apr. 2018) [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/unhcr-flash-update-libya-31-mar-6-apr-2018-enar
3,libya,"The first runner-up in the 2017 presidential elections voiced tough demands for the investigation into the former French head of state, who is suspected of taking money from the Libyan government for his campaign.

The leader of France's populist National Front, Marine Le Pen, responded on Twitter to the probe against Nikolas Sarkozy, who allegedly took money from Libya’s longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi for his 2007 election campaign.

“Justice should wade through seriously. The case is not only about electoral campaign financing, it also concerns the war, elimination of the country, destabilizing of the state, followed by a mass migration wave,” Le Pen tweeted.

""La justice doit aller au bout et avec sérieux. Cette affaire n'est pas seulement une question de financement électoral, elle toucherait aussi à une guerre, à l'élimination d'un chef d’État, à la déstabilisation d'un pays suivie par une vague migratoire massive."" #ClassiqueMatin — Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) 21 марта 2018 г.

The politician, who ran for president in 2012 in 2017 but came in third and then second place, condemned the joint military operation by the NATO and the EU in Libya during her first campaign and demanded that France should leave the alliance.

France’s ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, who was detained in Nantre two days ago, remains under judicial supervision, according to the reports of the French news outlet Le Monde. He is charged with ""passive bribery, illegal election campaign financing and the concealment of Libyan public funds."" He reportedly took about 50 million euro from the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ahead of the 2007 presidential elections. However, Nicolas Sarkozy denied the charges brought against him, according to reports. Most recently, the former French president denounced the lack of ""physical evidence"" in his case, as cited by local media.

""I've been living the hell of this slander since March 11, 2011, when Gaddafi first made the allegations,"" Sarkozy reportedly told judges in remarks published by the Figaro.

In 2011 Gaddafi ‘s son publicly claimed the French president should admit he took money from the Libyan government. A criminal case was opened in 2012, but the investigation had been suspended until 2017, when the judge brought preliminary charges against the former president, stating that prosecutors had enough evidence to start the criminal process.

It’s not the first time he has faced charges of illegal campaign financing. Earlier, French police investigated allegations that billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, a principal shareholder of L'Oréal, made illegal payments. Later, the charges were dropped.

During his reign, Sarkozy supported the Western military campaign in Libya despite his prior cozy relationship with the country’s controversial leader. Gaddafi was captured and killed during the war in October 2011 after a French missile struck his vehicle and rule of the country is contested by rival factions.","Le Pen: Sarkozy is Guilty… of Destroying Libya, Creating Refugee Crisis",https://sputniknews.com/europe/201803221062782818-france-expresident-sarkozy-libya-money-gaddafi-money-bribery-investigation-lepen/

5,libya,"The few remaining print newspapers in Libya are largely unable to publish print versions, as years of instability have taken a toll on the industry. This has forced hundreds of newspapers out of business.

Since 2014, newspapers have been unable to restart production due mainly to a lack of funding and resources.

“Previously, the Press Support Committee would provide support to the media, even private media. We used to print around 130 private newspapers a day but when the machine stopped working, we did not find the necessary support to fix it, purchase spare parts, import paper and zinc, because of course Libya is undoubtedly in a crisis. The political divide also plays a role in impacting the sector. With two governments, as you know, budgets are on hold for a lot of state institutions “ said Head of Libyan press support committee, Mahmoud Abuhasheima.

We used to print around 130 private newspapers a day but when the machine stopped working, we did not find the necessary support to fix it, purchase spare parts, import paper and zinc, because of course Libya is undoubtedly in a crisis.

Libya has been hit by difficulties in its economic, political and security affairs, in the years following the popular uprising which deposed former leader Muammar Gaddafi and ended four decades of one-man rule.

As a result, close to 600 local private and state-owned newspapers were forced to shut down and only 15 of the newspapers that are still running can afford to print sporadic copies.

While a newspaper is sold for just half a Libyan dinar ($0.38), the cost of printing a single copy can reach 5 Libyan dinars ($3.7).

Some newspapers have moved offices to neighbouring Tunisia. The English language privately-owned ‘Libya Herald’ now operates out of the capital Tunis, publishing its daily digest only on the internet.

The editor-in-chief of ‘Libya’ newspaper, Emad Al-Allam, says lack of funding is the main obstacle facing newspapers but adds that there is also a level of state negligence.

Since 2014, Libya’s main printing press has shut down. The printing press’s capacity used to produce 45,000 copies a year, according to Mahmoud Abuhasheima, head of the Libyan Press Support Committee.

Its machines have turned yellow from accumulated dust, and the last newspaper copy is still jammed inside the machine with faded ink.

The editor-in-chief of ‘February’ newspaper, Alhady Al-Qarqouty, says the “sharp polarisation” in the country is another hurdle holding back the press.

He adds that the polarisation has curtailed press freedom and has made many journalists reluctant about continuing to work in the profession.

Libya descended into chaos after the overthrow and killing of Gaddafi, with two competing governments backed by militias scrambling for control of the oil-producing country.

6,libya,"Brussels, Geneva, Tripoli, Dakar – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, announced today (13/03) that it has assisted 10,171 migrants to return home safely from Libya with support from the European Union, African Union, and the Libyan Government since the scale up of Voluntary Humanitarian Return (VHR) from the country started on 28 November last year. Another 5,200 migrants have returned with the support of African Union member states in the same period. Some 23,302 migrants have returned through IOM’s VHR programme since January 2017.

“We are continuing to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, while increasing efforts to reach stranded migrants outside of detention,” said Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission.

“Since the expansion of our VHR operation, the number of migrants in official detention centres have dropped from an estimated 20,000 people in October 2017 to 4,000 people today, a five-fold decrease. IOM in Libya is also working with the authorities to register migrants, provide lifesaving assistance in the form of health care and essential aid items, psychosocial support, improve consular services and projects promoting community stabilization,” said Belbeisi.

Nearly half of voluntary humanitarian returns carried out by IOM from Libya are part of a larger EU-IOM initiative to protect and assist migrants in need not only in Libya but in 26 countries along the Central Mediterranean Route. This includes crucial support for reintegration of returnees in countries of origin.

Launched in December 2016, with additional funding from Germany and Italy through the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), the EU-IOM Joint Initiative on Migrant Protection and Reintegration is active in Libya and countries in North Africa, the Sahel and Lake Chad region, and the Horn of Africa.

Together with its partners, IOM has been scaling up activities in countries of origin to meet the surge in returns from Libya and ensure that returning migrants receive appropriate assistance upon arrival as well as longer-term support to adjust to life and re-establish themselves in their communities. Reintegration assistance is also available through the programme for those assisted to return from European Union member states.

IOM Regional Director for the EU, Eugenio Ambrosi, said that the huge protection needs and the scale of returns in the last few months under the VHR operation have overtaken initial planning and pose some additional challenges for countries of origin. He cautioned that the reintegration process is complex and requires time.

“We are embarking on a completely new approach to reintegration and we believe in it. It will take some time to build, and in cooperation with authorities in countries of origin and the local communities, we are already seeing promising developments,” said Ambrosi.

“The Joint Initiative, in partnership with the governments of countries of origin and the African Union, aims to make sure that the migration process is safer, and that returning migrants can get back to their countries of origin safely and re-establish their lives without the feeling that they are a burden for their communities and families,” said IOM Regional Director for West Africa, Richard Danziger.

He cautioned, however, that many returnees from Libya are traumatized after having suffered unspeakable abuses, and so their immediate medical and psychosocial needs have taken priority.

The new, integrated approach to reintegration combines support for returning migrants and their home communities. It aims to mitigate possible tensions at home for returnees by involving local communities in the reintegration process and raising awareness to address potential stigma of return. For this reason, capacity building, systems strengthening, social, psychosocial, and community-based aspects are being built into the programme.

Monitoring and evaluation of reintegration activities are also part of the programme’s approach to measure impact and identify good practices to build on.

Under Joint Initiative activities starting from May 2017, 23,500 migrants have received immediate post-arrival and reception assistance after voluntarily returning home from Libya and other countries.

Approximately 16,000 migrants have been assisted with general reintegration support such as referrals and counselling sessions, with options for trainings and job fairs in the pipeline.

Over 5,000 people have received additional reintegration support, including help for individuals to set up a small business with groups of returnees or in partnership with their community. Their projects can be participatory and community-based projects, as well as collective and individual initiatives.

IOM believes that this innovative approach also has the potential to complement local development, particularly in how it is designed to respond to the socio-economic priorities identified by local authorities, migrants and their communities.

“The initiatives we are undertaking with the EU and our African partners represent a new chapter in migration cooperation. It is the first time that substantial funding has been invested to support the priorities and capacity of partner countries to manage return and reintegration and to make migration itself a safer and informed process,” said Ambrosi.

""I am not ashamed to be back home. People can talk and say what they want. I am now back in my country and have found a job,” said Gaspard, who had left Côte d’Ivoire in search of work. After a terrible experience in Libya, he decided to return home with help from IOM through the Joint initiative programme. See the stories of more returnees here.

Background Information

While the VHR programme is not new and IOM has been supporting migrants to return since 2006, the scale-up was launched on November 28th, 2017 when the African Union, European Union and the United Nations came together at the AU-EU Summit in Abidjan to respond to reports of slavery and migrant abuse in Libya.

A tripartite AU-EU-UN taskforce was established with the objective of saving and protecting lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and, in particular, inside Libya, as well as to accelerate the assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin and the resettlement of those in need of international protection for a period of six months (ending 30th May 2018).

The immediate focus of the Task Force was the voluntary repatriation, within six weeks, of at least 15,000 migrants identified in Government-controlled detention centers through the European Union Trust Fund. The joint work of the task force has been instrumental in addressing a number of challenges faced in the evacuation of migrants including: timely issuance of exit visas, granting landing rights to non-Libyan airlines and provision of documentation/consular services for migrants to enable their return.

The EU Trust Fund is backing the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration management through the development of rights-based, development-focused, and return and sustainable reintegration policies and processes.

7,libya,"Since the ousting and subsequent killing of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya’s oil production has remained below capacity. With the lingering effects of civil war, the country which is a member of OPEC has struggled to boost oil production in its major oil fields. Despite registering an increased average output of 828,000 barrels daily in 2017, Libya has failed to attain the production levels realized during Gaddafi’s reign.

Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa with an estimated 47.1 billion barrels in reserves. The country has also been ranked 9th in the world In terms of existing oil reserves. Despite this, Nigeria is currently the leading producer of oil in Africa.

Back in the 1970’s, Libya was producing 3 million barrels of oil per day. This identified Libya as a key supplier of sweet crude oil to Europe. At the time of Gaddafi’s death, the country’s crude production sank to about 1.6 million barrels of oil per day. Currently, Libya is struggling to maintain a production level of 1 million barrels per day.

Build Up to Reduced Oil Production in Libya

Much of the slowdown in daily oil production in Libya relates to the aftermath of the 2011 rebel uprising backed by NATO. With Gaddafi toppled, the fragmentation of power in the country and the use of oil production facilities as bargaining chips created an adverse environment for oil production.

With the lawlessness and instability that ensued after Gaddafi’s fall, the nation experienced an shutdown in oil production. Outages in the giant Sharara and El Feel oil fields have weighed on oil production and exports ever since.

Activities by rebel groups also played a big role in derailing oil production in Libya. With the fragmentation of power, different armed groups cut off production in major oil fields and ports.

According to Reuters, the haphazard shutdown of oil wells led to reduced oil pressure resulting in further outages.

Current Instability Issues Hampering Oil Production

While the security situation has improved somewhat since 2016, oil production in Libya continues to face challenges.

The combination of financial/economic headwinds, armed groups seeking the release of jailed members and political developments are some of the current factors affecting oil production. With dwindling oil revenues and limited authority over armed groups, the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli lacks the capacity to prevent illegal shutdowns and finance operations related to production.

In this regard, rebel groups within and outside the capital still have the ability to shut down production remotely or at the terminals. For instance armed groups near the western town of Zintan have occasionally disrupted production at the Sharara oil field by cutting off the pipeline leading to the Mediterranean coast. Related: The World’s Most Expensive Power Project

Financial constraints faced by the government and the National Oil Corporation (NOC) have also contributed to a slowdown in oil production. While the NOC is grappling with a delayed reimbursement of funds, financial constraints have made it difficult for the government to pay the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG).

As recent as February 2018, a protest by the PFG at the El Feel oil field culminated in another production outage. The NOC evacuated its workers and closed the facility when a group of the PFG stormed the administration blocks and threatened workers in addition to vandalising records and firing in the air.

Political tensions in the eastern part of Libya continue to derail production in the region that holds most of the country’s oil wealth. Armed factions in the region are opposing the government’s distribution of oil income and are unlikely to give up their armed struggle in the near future.

The Way Forward

Ultimately, oil production growth in Libya can’t be achieved unless interregional relations and security improve.

The NOC has already expressed the intention of boosting Libya’s oil production to 2.2 million barrels per day by 2023. At the moment, it is unlikely that it can do so without the help of foreign oil companies.

Mixed enthusiasm among oil companies suggests that Libya is still a long way from reaching its ambitious production target and might have to do a lot more to woo the oil majors.

8,libya,"For over 14 years, Libyan citizen Omar Khalifa Mohammed Abu Bakr was imprisoned without due process by the U.S. at Guantánamo Bay. He was never charged with, let alone convicted of, any crimes. After suffering years of torture and mistreatment, Khalifa was released to Senegal in 2016.

His release was the by-product of a deal negotiated by his attorneys with the U.S. government. Khalifa’s lawyer, CUNY School of Law professor Ramzi Kassem, told the Intercept that the agreement expressly guaranteed that the Libyan would have the right to permanently settle in Senegal and rebuild his life there, rather than be returned to war-torn Libya. In addition to the deteriorating security situation in his home country, Khalifa’s status as a former Guantánamo detainee as well as his tribal background meant that being sent back to his country of origin would mean an almost certain death sentence.

At the time, Senegalese officials made clear that neither they nor the Pentagon viewed Khalifa (and another Libyan detainee released from Guantánamo at the same time to Senegal) as a threat. “These are simply men who we must help because they are African sons who have been tested for years,” Minister of Justice Sidiki Kaba said. “It is important, under the conditions of American law, that these detainees be able to have access to humanitarian asylum.” He added that “the two were not known to be jihadists.”

The official statement from the government of Senegal announced at the time that “the Government of the Republic of Senegal granted today humanitarian asylum to two Libyan nationals, including one disabled, detained without trial for 14 years, even though no charge is held against them.” It added: “This asylum, granted in accordance with the relevant conventions of international humanitarian law, is also part of the tradition of Senegalese hospitality and Islamic solidarity with two African brothers who have expressed the wish to be resettled in Senegal after their enlargement.”

When Khalifa was released, the Miami Herald’s Carol Rosenberg detailed how disabled he was: “Khalifa has no right leg below the knee from a 1998 landmine accident in Afghanistan, and a left leg held together by metal pins from a 1995 construction site accident in Sudan, according to his attorney. Khalifa is blind in his left eye.” The Pentagon Board that found Kahlifa suitable for release said he has a “significantly compromised health condition” and a history of “mediating concerns raised between other detainees and guard staff.”

But last week, the U.S. State Department appears to have abandoned its commitments when releasing Khalifa. A handwritten note in Arabic, delivered to him on Wednesday by Senegalese authorities, informed him that his two years of permitted residency in the country had expired and that he would be deported to Libya on April 3rd.

In addition to putting his life at risk, the letter directly contravened assurances given to him by State Department officials when he was released from Guantánamo, promising that he would be allowed to stay in Senegal permanently and not be returned to Libya under any circumstances. Those promises were made as part of a negotiation between Khalifa’s lawyers and the now-defunct State Department office tasked with closing the detention camp.

Other detainees have resisted being sent to various countries for fear of what would happen to them as ex-Guantánamo detainees. For that reason, lawyers for the detainees have carefully negotiated conditions to secure their safety upon their release.

Another Libyan Guantánamo detainee who was also released to Senegal at the same as Khalifa, Salem Abdul Salem Ghereby, received a similar notice last week informing him of his impending deportation. Both men now face an uncertain but very dangerous future upon their return to Libya.

Speaking to The Intercept, Kassem, Khalifa’s lawyer, said that without immediate intervention on the part of the U.S. State Department to uphold its commitments by halting his deportation from Senegal, Khalifa faces the prospect of imminent death in Libya.

“My client and I relied on U.S. government’s assurances two years ago that Mr. Khalifa’s resettlement in Senegal would be permanent and that he would face no risk of a forced repatriation to imprisonment and torture in Libya,” Kassem said. “But now, the U.S. State Department is nowhere to be found. Irrespective of who sits in the White House today, the United States should honor its promises. For Mr. Khalifa, this is a matter of life or death.”

State Department and Senegalese officials did not immediately respond to request for comment about the case.

In the two years since Khalifa’s release from Guantánamo, he has managed to rebuild some semblance of a normal life in Senegal. Despite crippling physical ailments and psychological trauma suffered as a result of his detention, Khalifa became engaged to a Senegalese woman and had begun making plans to settle and work in the country for the long-term.

Meanwhile, Libya has descended into even greater chaos following its 2011 revolution and a subsequent NATO military intervention against the government of Moammar Gaddafi. Today, the country is under the control of an array of divided armed groups, political factions and tribes that are often in conflict with one another. Were Khalifa to be returned to any of the two major airports in the country, both of which are presently in the hands of hostile tribes and political factions, he would likely be immediately detained, subjected to torture, and even executed.

If Khalifa were to fly to Tripoli, the factions in control of the capital would assume he were an Islamist by virtue of his due-process-free detention by the U.S., and would thus regard him as a threat. But his other option, Misrata, is controlled by a tribe that he says is adverse to his, putting him in at least as much danger upon his return.

Khalifa says that the apparent betrayal by the U.S. government of its promises to him upon release from Guantánamo has put him in an impossible position. Two Libyan government officials who met with him in Senegal to discuss his pending repatriation conceded that it would be impossible to guarantee his safety in Libya, telling him during a meeting that they “couldn’t even guarantee their own safety in Libya, let alone his.”

After already spending a decade and a half of his life imprisoned by the U.S. government without charge, Khalifa now faces the prospect of being abruptly uprooted from his new life and sent to a near-certain death in Libya.

In a statement to The Intercept, Khalifa said: “If the U.S. government told me two years ago that I would remain in Senegal temporarily, only to be sent to Libya after two years, regardless of the situation in Libya, I would have refused resettlement in Senegal. I would have even chosen to remain at Guantánamo over torture and death in a dungeon in Libya.”

He added: “I have grown to love Senegal and its people. The Senegalese friends I have made here invite me to their weddings and festivities. I have learned about the different Islamic practices people follow here, including Sufism. I expected to marry here and to make my life in Senegal—that is still what I want.”","Guaranteed Safety by the U.S., Former Guantánamo Detainee Now Faces Deportation to War-Torn Libya and Likely Death",https://theintercept.com/2018/03/31/guaranteed-safety-by-the-u-s-former-guantanamo-detainee-now-faces-deportation-to-war-torn-libya-and-likely-death/

Many migrants and refugees who brave the journey to Libya end up in detention. (Keystone)

As Switzerland receives a first group of vulnerable refugees from Libyan detention centres, we take a look at the international response to Libya's migrant crisis.

At the end of last year, CNN reports of detained Africans being sold in Libyan slave markets sent shock waves around the world. It also prompted the European Union and International Organization for Migration (IOM) to step up evacuating migrants from Libya, “because,” says IOM media officer for West and Central Africa Florence Kim, “the EU and African Union decided that we could not leave 20,000 people in detention centres in Libya.”

Also in December, Switzerland announced that it has agreed to take up to 80 vulnerable refugees as part of an emergency plan by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to evacuate thousands of people from detention centres in Libya. Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga described this as an “urgent humanitarian measure”, saying it was justified because of the catastrophic situation in Libya.

A first group of refugees arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday, according to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM).

The group consists mainly of women classified as ""vulnerable"" along with women with children and unaccompanied minors. They were first evacuated to Niger before being flown to Switzerland, a SEM spokeswoman told swissinfo.ch

Some other European countries have also agreed to take refugees as part of this operation. UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel told swissinfo.ch that over 1,300 people have been evacuated so far, of whom 312 have gone to Italy, a few to Romania and the rest to Niger for resettlement processing.

Torture and abuse

In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have braved the journey across Africa to Libya, some intending to stay, but many hoping to reach Europe. “Nearly half a million have made the crossing in the last three years; over 10,000 have died in the attempt,” says an Amnesty International report published in December last year. “A further half a million, maybe more, are currently stranded in Libya.”

Of those stuck in Libya, it was estimated that at the end of last year 20,000 refugees and migrants were being held in detention centres run by the DCIM, a division of the Libyan Interior Ministry set up to tackle migration flows into Libya. Thousands more were being held in unofficial detention centres run by militias and criminal gangs, according to the Amnesty report. In both cases, it said, “people are unlawfully detained in inhuman conditions and subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual violence.” Amnesty accused European governments of complicity in this situation.

The IOM says that since the joint operation was scaled up at the end of last year, 17,000 people have left the detention centres in Libya, of whom 11,000 have returned home on a voluntary basis. There remain only around 3,500 people in official detention centres. No doubt there are more people in places of captivity held by militias, but access is a problem, according to Florence Kim of the IOM.

Refugees and migrants

What counts in the Libyan detention centres is whether you are deemed to be an economic migrant or a refugee. Screening of refugees is done by the UNHCR, while voluntary repatriation of migrants is handled by the IOM.

Asked about the criteria for classification as a refugee, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel says that they include “victims of torture, people with medical problems, single women, unaccompanied children and people with disabilities”. “But,” he adds, “I have to say that today in Libya almost everyone is vulnerable, so vulnerability alone is not the criteria. We have to look at whether those people are refugees or migrants. Refugees should not be forced to go home, because they are going to be exposed to persecution or risk.”

Asked how the IOM can be sure its repatriation scheme is really voluntary, Kim said the organisation makes sure that people “know they have a choice, that there is no psychological pressure on them, but at the same time we also know that it’s one of the only life-saving options that they have”.

She says some 80% of people returned home were detained in Libya. The majority of those who go back are from West African countries such as Nigeria, The Gambia, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Their profile depends on the country. “If you take Ivory Coast, 70% to 80% are male aged 18-30, mostly literate,” Kim told swissinfo.ch. “And then from Nigeria you have a lot more women than from other countries of origin, and among those women maybe 80-90% are victims of trafficking.” There are also many unaccompanied minors.

An innovative aspect of the voluntary repatriation programme is reintegration support, whereby the IOM works not only with the individual but also with the community of origin. “You are a returnee. We don’t leave you alone with your reintegration project, we try to put you with other people,” says Kim. “Let’s say we are going to help you build a poultry farm, you are maybe going to be managing that with other returnees. We also try to include potential migrants.” She says this is also designed to avoid tension within the home community.

Coming to Switzerland

Asked about the arrival of the first group of refugees in Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) would say only that they are mostly vulnerable single women who have been evacuated from Libya to Niger. The statement did not give any numbers.

A SEM spokesperson nevertheless told swissinfo.ch that the federal government has been negotiating with the cantons to place the refugees. According to Swiss practice, the refugees will stay in the care of federal authorities for only a few days, before being sent to the cantons for resettlement, according to agreed quotas.

Switzerland is expected to take more refugees currently in temporary centres in Niger, where a mission from SEM has been to conduct its own screening. And the UNHCR is still looking for more host countries for refugees. “We are asking Switzerland and also other European countries and countries outside Europe to take more because we really need to make sure that we evacuate as many people as possible from Niger,” Cochetel told swissinfo.ch.

12,libya,"TRIPOLI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan UN-backed government said on Monday that the court ruling on Saadi Gaddafi, son of late leader Muammar Gaddafi, was made with no interference from the government.

""The case of Saadi, son of Gaddafi, was handled by the Libyan judiciary and it has the jurisdiction to rule in this regard,"" Mohamed Al-Sallak, spokesman of the Libyan UN-backed government, told a press conference in the capital Tripoli.

""The Presidency Council (of the government) is working on the principle of separation of powers. The judiciary is completely independent from the executive authority,"" he noted.

On April 3, the Libyan northern Tripoli court acquitted Saadi of murder of the late football player Bashir al-Rayani, according to the Ministry of Justice.

But the court sentenced Saadi to one year in prison and fined him 500 dinars (400 U.S. dollars) for drinking and possession of alcohol.

The court also suspended the sentence for 5 years from the date of the verdict without criminal charges.

Saadi Gaddafi first appeared before the Tripoli appeals court in May 2015 on charges of involvement in the killing of al-Rayani in late 2005.

In September 2011, Saadi fled to Niger shortly before the fall of his father's regime.

Niger first granted him asylum for ""humanitarian reasons,"" but handed Saadi over to Libya in 2014, according to the Libyan authorities.

Interpol issued a red note against Saadi in 2011 after the Transitional Council, which was formed shortly after the 2011 uprising broke out against the Gaddafi regime, accused him of ""taking over property by force and intimidation"" when serving as the president of the Libyan Football Federation.

15,libya,"Seven years ago today, NATO began its “humanitarian bombing” of Libya. While “humanitarian bombing” is an oxymoron, many believe that a country is not truly advancing human rights if it’s not bombing another back to the Stone Age.

As an initial matter, it must be said that while the UN had authorized a NATO fly-zone over Libya to protect civilians – all civilians, by the way – there was never authorization for the full-scale invasion which was carried out and which quickly became aimed at regime change. Therefore, the NATO operation which actually took place was illegal.

What’s more, the Libyan invasion did more to undermine human rights than it did to protect them. According to Amnesty International’s most recent report on Libya, there are now three rival governments vying for power in the country along with various militias, smugglers and other sundry armed groups. As Amnesty International explains, all participants in the armed conflict in Libya “carried out indiscriminate attacks in heavily populated areas leading to deaths of civilians and unlawful killings. Armed groups arrested and indefinitely detained thousands of people. Torture and other ill-treatment was widespread in prisons under the control of armed groups, militias and state officials.” And, to top it all off, slaves are being sold in public markets in Libya – something not seen in the world for over a century.

And this is the aftermath of an intervention which, we were told, was supposed to improve human rights in Libya. Indeed, the intervention was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and Susan Rice – three self-described warriors for human and women’s rights. Instead, they became three ushers of the Apocalypse. In addition, Italy and France, which also helped lead the charge for invasion, had their own reasons for intervening in Libya. For his part, French President Nicolas Sarkozy appeared to be singularly focused on killing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who allegedly gave him €50 million for his presidential campaign – a claim which was just coming to light and to which Gaddafi was the chief witness.

While Gaddafi certainly was no saint, he was a much better leader for his country than many of those the West supports, such as the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, the death squad state of Colombia or the coup government in Honduras. Indeed, Muammar Gaddafi, at the urging of his son, Saif, was attempting to democratize Libya at the time of the invasion, and the pair were willingly accepting the help of the US’s National Democratic Institute to do so!

In addition, Gaddafi had taken Libya from being the least prosperous country in Africa to the being the most prosperous by the time of the NATO operation. Thus, as one commentator explains, before the intervention, “Libya had the highest GDP per capita and life expectancy on the continent. Less people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands.”

Moreover, one of the main reasons, we were told, that NATO needed to intervene in 2011 was to save Benghazi from imminent harm from the government forces of Gaddafi. However, Hillary Clinton’s own internal emails show that her team recognized that any humanitarian problems confronting Benghazi had passed by the time of the NATO bombing. For example, Clinton’s assistant, Huma Abedin, in an email dated February 21, 2011 – that is, just a mere four days after the initial anti-government protests broke out in Libya – explains that the Gaddafi forces no longer controlled Benghazi and that the mood in the city was indeed “celebratory” by that time. Then, on March 2, just over two weeks before the bombing began, Harriet Spanos of USAID sent an email describing “[s]ecurity reports” which “confirm that Benghazi has been calm over the past couple of days.”

Indeed, as explained to me by Khaled Kaim, Gaddafi’s last foreign minister, who I recently met in Venezuela, he personally urged US representatives at the UN Security Council to hold off the planned bombing raid for one hour so that UN observers on the ground could confirm his claim that Benghazi was not under threat. Of course, his pleas were ignored. Kaim’s warnings that the impending invasion of Libya would only unleash more chaos and terror on the world were also disregarded.

Meanwhile, Benghazi is now the site of a grave humanitarian crisis and a hotbed for terrorists post-intervention. Again, Amnesty International writes that “[a] number of mass graves were uncovered in Benghazi between February and October [2017]. On at least four occasions, groups of bodies were found in different parts of the city with their hands bound behind their backs, and in some cases blindfolded with signs of torture and execution-style killing.”

In addition, during the early part of 2017, one armed faction laid siege to an apartment complex in the Ganfouda area of Benghazi, “cutting off all supplies to the area, including food and water, and had trapped civilians and wounded fighters [of another faction] without access to medical care and other basic services.” And, when the same faction broke the siege by launching an armed assault on this area, it engaged in “indiscriminate” killings, with fighters from the faction posing for photos with the dead bodies.

And yet, where are the self-proclaimed defenders of human rights for Libya and Benghazi now? Where are their cries for humanitarian intervention? Of course, all of those responsible for this absolute disaster have moved on and remain silent about the tragedy they have wrought in that country.

Of course, the intervention in Libya was not truly about human rights, just as other similar Western interventions in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have not been about either human rights or even fighting terror. And indeed, these interventions have only undermined human rights and further spread terror. In the case of Libya, the predictable havoc unleashed there has spread to neighboring states such as Niger, Tunisia, Mali, Chad and Cameroon. In addition, the refugee crisis created by the chaos unleashed by the NATO intervention in Libya is undermining the stability of all of Europe.

One can only conclude from this that the West, and especially the United States, is hell-bent on spreading instability throughout the world, despite its pretending to accomplish the very opposite. Indeed, the US continues to bomb Libya periodically in an effort to at least contain the very forces of chaos it helped unleash there.

In chaos, Western countries and their transnational corporations see opportunity for more domination and more profits. As with Little Finger in Game of Thrones, they see chaos not as a pit, but as a ladder. In the case of countries like Libya, the West goes in and bombs it to oblivion and then brings in companies which charge that country to rebuild it. And the West is not shy about this grisly strategy for money-making.

Indeed, as the New York Times explained in an article just after the NATO operation ended with the brutal killing of Gaddafi – an article accompanied by a photo of an oil terminal in Misurata, Libya, on fire and with black smoke billowing out – “Western security, construction and infrastructure companies that see profit-making opportunities receding in Iraq and Afghanistan have turned their sights on Libya… Entrepreneurs are abuzz about the business potential of a country with huge needs and the oil to pay for them, plus the competitive advantage of Libyan gratitude toward the United States and its NATO partners.

""A week before Colonel Qaddafi’s death on Oct. 20, a delegation from 80 French companies arrived in Tripoli to meet officials of the Transitional National Council, the interim government. Last week, the new British defense minister, Philip Hammond, urged British companies to “pack their suitcases” and head to Tripoli.”

But what is good for such corporations is not good for the rest of us. Simply put, the world cannot afford another war which wreaks havoc on entire regions of the globe, ushering in massive human misery and environmental destruction in its wake. As King Pyrrhus might have said, another “victory” like the one in Libya may be the undoing of us.

16,libya,"The move raised eyebrows among some Latin America specialists, who contended that it constituted a major snub of an important region by a president already held in low regard there, and wasted a chance to assert the United States’ leadership as China looks to broaden its role in the region.

“Trump’s dropping out of the Lima summit is an appalling demonstration of disrespect for Latin America,” said Richard E. Feinberg, a senior Latin America fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor at the University of California San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.

“This has to be seen in the context of a president who has been ranting and railing against Latin America continually for the last several years,” Mr. Feinberg added. “They’re his bête noire. They’re his scapegoat for everything that’s wrong in America, from immigration to narcotics to alleged loss of jobs from trade.”

Mr. Trump was to have traveled to Lima on Friday, and then on to Bogotá for meetings with President Juan Manuel Santos, who is now scheduled to meet with Mr. Pence on the sidelines of the gathering in Peru.

Mr. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., last year when he ordered missile strikes in Syria in response to a chemical attack by government forces. And in 2011, President Barack Obama went ahead with a trip to Brazil while American forces were striking Libya. But White House officials argued that Mr. Trump felt strongly about remaining on United States soil as the situation in Syria unfolded.

The decision appeared to have taken even some senior White House officials by surprise. Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was unaware of the president’s new plans when he told a conservative radio host on Tuesday morning that he would be traveling with Mr. Trump to Latin America this week. He said Mr. Trump would be able to “compartmentalize.”

There were plenty of reasons for Mr. Trump to dread the trip to South America, which promised to include considerable behind-the-scenes friction and little of the flattering pomp and ceremony that he relishes — and to which he was treated during visits last year to Saudi Arabia and China.

The president’s approval rating in Latin America is extraordinarily low, and leaders there have been insulted by his anti-immigrant talk and alarmed by his threats to use military force in Venezuela. The White House had already scaled back Mr. Trump’s trip, trimming what was initially intended as a five-day visit to one that involved fewer than three days on the ground.

Mr. Trump had planned to use that brief time to seek consensus on how to handle the crisis in Venezuela and press his case for better trade deals with Latin American nations. The president’s advisers had played down expectations for major advances during the trip, including saying it was unlikely to produce any breakthroughs on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

They had left open the question of whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, with whom he has had a stormy relationship. The two have clashed on the phone over Mr. Trump’s promises to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and the latest such altercation led them to cancel a tentatively planned visit by Mr. Peña Nieto to the White House in March.

More recently, Mr. Peña Nieto has taken umbrage at Mr. Trump’s decision last week to send National Guard troops to patrol the southern border.

Mr. Obama used the last Summit of the Americas — which brings together 35 countries every three years — to burnish the United States’ image in the hemisphere, holding a historic meeting with President Raúl Castro of Cuba as he pushed to normalize relations with Havana for the first time in a half-century. Mr. Trump has moved to reverse that policy, and critics said his absence in Lima would have broad consequences.

“Skipping the Summit of the Americas sends a terrible message about U.S. disengagement in our hemisphere, compounding negative message of Trump’s Cuba, NAFTA and immigration policies,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, who served as a deputy national security adviser in Mr. Obama’s White House, wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Rhodes said that the United States would have to work with partners in the hemisphere to address the crisis in Venezuela, and that sitting out the summit meeting “just made that harder.”","Trump Cancels Trip to Latin America, Citing Crisis in Syria",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-cancels-trip-latin-america-crisis-syria.html

The aim of Sandstorm is to tell the sprawling life story Gaddafi and Libya’s evolution under his reign, in the style that fact-based drama Narcos did to Pablo Escobar. Gaddafi rose from being the penniless son of an illiterate Bedouin goat herder to the young leader of Libya after King Idris was deposed in a bloodless coup. Among the many things he did was rearrange the relationship that oil rich Middle Eastern countries held with global petroleum corporations, often antagonizing his Saudi Arabian and Iranian neighbors.

With the resulting riches, Gaddafi transformed into a corrupt tyrant who ruled with an iron fist, and remained a study in contradictions through his life. Initially an idealist who was embraced by the CIA and KGB and industrialists like Armand Hammer and Gianni Agnelli, he ultimately became the vilified “mad dog of the Middle East” — as Ronald Reagan called him — a terrorist believed to be behind the bombing of Pan AM flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people in 1988. Gaddafi, who was accused of torturing and disappearing dissidents to fortify his rule, was ultimately hunted down and killed in undignified fashion by his own countrymen.

19,libya,"Tunis, 23 March 2018 – The Government of Libya and the United Nations discussed new way forward to support Libya in a round of consultations on the United Nations Strategic Framework (UNSF) for the period 2019-2020 and Country Programme Documents of UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.

The Strategic Framework constitutes a renewed partnership between the UN and the Government of Libya, and aims to work towards a more sustainable path to development, prosperity, peace, and security. The Framework, which pledges to “leave no one behind,” focuses particularly on benefiting youth, women and the most affected groups by improving respect for human rights, advancing gender equality, empowering women and youth, strengthening the rule of law, eradicating poverty, building institutions, and advancing economic development.

Opening the consultative workshop, HE Taher Jehaimi, Minister of Planning, said: “The new Framework is a qualitative leap in terms of content coming as a result of a broad consultation process that was based on technical assessments in several economic, social and service areas, with the participation of many international and Libyan competences and expertise. It provides further evidence of the gradual improvement of the situation in Libya towards a new stage of more stability at the institutional and security levels, a stage that the government is working to be followed by steps towards economic recovery.”

This new strategic planning framework for cooperation provides a basis for increased collaboration, coherence and effectiveness of UN support in Libya. Under the framework, the UN in Libya commits to foster community resilience and preserve institutions in support of the peacebuilding process. The UNSF also aims at decreasing humanitarian aid dependency by developing the capacity of state institutions (public health, community security, mine action, education, etc.) to respond to the crisis.

During her remarks, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Ms. Maria Ribeiro highlighted that the main objective of the UN is to support the Government of Libya, to realize its national priorities: “The UNSF demonstrates the commitment of the UN to work towards a more integrated approach and enhanced humanitarian, development and peace nexus that will support Libya in responding to the humanitarian crisis while working towards sustainable development, guided by the UN Secretary General. We treat humanitarian response, sustainable development and sustaining peace as three sides of the same triangle”.

The second day of the workshop was dedicated to the presentation and discussion on the new Country Programme Documents of three UN agencies: UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.

UNDP Libya's Country Program Document aims at supporting Libya in the consolidation of effective, inclusive and accountable government institutions, as well as enhancing citizens access to public services and economic opportunities. Through it first country programme for Libya, UNFPA will support the government in building strong and resilient health and social systems for its sustainable and inclusive development to improve the health and well-being of women and youth throughout Libya, focusing on the most vulnerable. The new country programme of UNICEF will provide an engagement framework for the implementation of multi-sectoral programmes for children in water, sanitation, child protection, education, health and nutrition. UNICEF will work with the government to ensure that the revision of policies, strategies and budgets are based on sound evidence, and are child centered and child friendly.","The United Nations and the Government of Libya undertake national consultations on strategic framework for 2019-2020 and UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF country programme documents",https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/united-nations-and-government-libya-undertake-national-consultations-strategic

""We discussed how we can help and support those who are working in such a difficult area and give them the benefit of both technical expertise and practical support from the United Kingdom,"" said Alistair Burt, minister of state for the Middle East.

He singled out efforts to monitor ""the whole routes that migrants take from sub-Saharan Africa"" to Libya.

Such efforts would involve ""giving information to those who seek to travel on the route to tell them that there might be at risk of exploitation... and to intercept them on the route to persuade them to go back and to give them repatriation packages"", Burt said.

""What must be stopped is the trafficking and the migration of people that is exploited and provides the opportunity of significant amounts of money for criminal gangs,"" said Burt, who held talks with Libya's unity government head Fayez al-Sarraj and the UN envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame.

Libya has descended into chaos since the fall of Moammar Gaddafi's regime in a 2011 revolt, and it has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants trying to reach Europe by sea.

21,libya,"An ambitious process of consulting the Libyan people is under way.

Libya has been riven by a plethora of problems ever since Muammar Gaddafi was removed.

Central authority has broken down and the country has a myriad of militias with a multitude of tribal loyalties.

Add to that the outside players - the foreign powers with their own interests in Libya - and you have a recipe for chaos. Several rounds of peace talks have resulted in little.

Libya is divided with two governments, one in the west and the other in the east. But a new UN-backed consultative aims to break the stalemate.

From oil revenues to powers of future government and disarming militias, Libyans are having their say on the major issues that divide them, in public consultations organised by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue.

It is hoped this process could pave the way for elections by the end of this year.

But can a consensus be reached? And what impact are foreign powers having on the process?

Max Ferrari is a journalist and politician. He is a former parliamentary journalist, a war correspondent in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, and director of a TV channel. He is an expert in geopolitics and energy policy. Twitter: @MaxFerrari

He who laughs last laughs better, according to an Italian proverb that applies very well to the case of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president who joined the war in Libya to eliminate Muammar Qaddafi and a few months later also helped to bring down Silvio Berlusconi. That culminated in a famous meeting between Sarkozy and Angela Merkel at which the two used sarcasm toward Italy and laughed at Berlusconi by undermining his credibility.Quite a few, therefore, smiled in Milan and Rome when the French police detained Sarkozy for questioning over allegations that he was paid 50 million euros by the Libyan regime to finance his 2007 presidential campaign.No one in Italy ever believed the French fairytale narrative of the “humanitarian” war in Libya, which France said was “necessary to bring democracy.” Everyone knew that one of Paris’s objectives was to replace the Italians in the near monopoly of exploitation of the Libyan gas and oil fields, and to eliminate Rome’s residual influence in the Mediterranean area.Berlusconi was against the war, but he was worn down by a press campaign orchestrated by the left that accused him of having paid a 17-year-old Moroccan dancer for sex (he was convicted by a court, and later acquitted on appeal) and of being too friendly with “Arab tyrants” such as Qaddafi. The premier surrendered to international pressure and the Italian left.The only Italian party that was vehemently opposed to the war in Libya was the Northern League, which said Italy was not a French colony and the war would destabilize Africa and the Mediterranean and bring millions of illegal migrants into Italy — as indeed happened. Libya was the leading oil supplier and the third-biggest gas supplier to Italy and it was clear to everyone that throwing the country into chaos would not be in Rome’s interest, but anyone who wrote about it was immediately accused of being a “friend of the tyrant.”Then, in January 2016, “Foreign Policy Journal” began to shed light on the role of Barack Obama in the Libyan crisis, and that of his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. One of the 3,000 Clinton emails released by the State Department revealed an international plot to overthrow Qaddafi in order to obtain access to Libyan oil. The email, titled “France’s client and Qaddafi’s gold,” was sent to Clinton by her unofficial adviser Sydney Blumenthal.Even more explicit and full of indiscretions and twists is the book “Sarkozy-Qaddafi, the Secret Story,” published in France at the end of 2017, which gave rise to the police investigation that led to Sarkozy. Journalists Fabrice Arfi and Karl Laske reconstruct the love-hate story between Sarkozy and Qaddafi in 400 pages full of documents, talk about tens of millions of dollars, suitcases full of money transported from Tripoli to Paris, mysteriously disappeared audio recordings, and the strong links between Sarkozy and Qatar.The final chapter of the book is straightforward: “The war in Libya was started on the basis of false information and ends with a mystery: Who killed Qaddafi?” The authors suggest the French track and list various sources: First the Italian newspaper “Corriere della Sera,” which wrote: “In Western diplomatic circles in Libya the most widespread theory is that, if some secret services are involved, then it is certainly the French ... the fact that Paris wanted to eliminate the colonel was an open secret.” Former Libyan minister Mahmoud Jibril also claims: “It was a foreign agent who killed Qaddafi,” and Rami El-Obeidi, coordinator of the external information services of the National Transitional Council, tells the authors that “it was French agents who killed Qaddafi.”We will never know the full truth, but one thing is now certain: Sarkozy’s “democratic war” was a huge and disastrous lie that harmed both Arab countries and Europe.","Sarkozy, Qaddafi and the myth of Libya’s ‘humanitarian’ war",http://www.arabnews.com/node/1270861
23,libya,"The British minister of state for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, met Monday with the Libyan Presidential Council’s Head Fayez Al-Sirraj, interior minister and foreign minister of the Tripoli government, and discussed joint cooperation and expertise provision to Libya in limiting the flow of illegal immigrants and the UK’s assistance in line with the European Union and African Union’s help.

Burt said that the UK efforts would include giving information to those who seek to travel on the route to tell them that there might be at risk of exploitation and to intercept them on the route to persuade them to go back so they receive repatriation packages.

“What must be stopped is the trafficking and the migration of people that is exploited and provides the opportunity of significant amounts of money for criminal gangs.” He explained.

Burt renewed also his country’s efforts for national reconciliation in Libya so the suffering of the people can be alleviated, pointing out that the UK believes Libyans can hold the constitutional referendum and elections with a great degree of transparency.

He also added in a joint presser with the foreign minister Mohammed Sayala that the UK will provide Libya with 5 million pounds as part of its commitment to combat illegal immigration, saying his country is ready to have join economic projects with Libya to boost its economy.",Britain offers technical expertise to Libya to curb illegal immigration,https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/britain-offers-technical-expertise-libya-curb-illegal-immigration
