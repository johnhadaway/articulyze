After one year on the job, the Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer speaks about the huge disparities he sees, aid worker security and his personal commitment to Afghanistan.

While the number of mine casualties is on the rise, funding for mine action in Afghanistan dropped by 65 per cent over the past five years.

ACBAR’s Twinning Program successfully teams up international and national NGOs to build capacities to the benefit of both counterparts.

“It is a very tough place for aid agencies”

The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, took up his function one year ago. Now, the top humanitarian official talks about his first 12 months in country, discussions in donor capitals, changes in the security environment, Twitter and what UN and NGOs can expect from him in the future. The interview was edited for length and clarity.

OCHA: What stands out about Afghanistan to you after one year?

Toby Lanzer: One striking issue are the disparities between life in Kabul, a few other urban centres and the rest of the country. Sitting in the heart of Kabul, working closely with senior Government officials, the international and NGO community, I am exposed to the vision and plan to create a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. But there is a gap between that and what the average citizen of the country lives every day. And there is an even greater gap between this vision and the plan and what people feel who were struck by violence, displaced by conflict or forced to return to this country.

That is why humanitarian action remains so necessary, so relevant and yet amongst senior officials, including myself, often understated. We are all so focused on the future – peace, stability and prosperity – that sometimes not enough attention is paid to the suffering of today. It has taken me a long time to understand that because I sit in the middle of the green zone. In my first year here, I managed to visit almost 20 provinces, increasingly by road, to connect with the girls and the women, the boys and the men of this country. And what they tell me is “Yes, slowly things are getting better, but we are suffering”

What has been your main challenge as Humanitarian Coordinator?

Amongst my different interlocutors [including from the development and political portfolio] much of the conversation is about the search for a political resolution – peace – and nothing is more important for the tomorrow of this country. The thing is that today, there are people going hungry. The hardest thing for me was to understand the scale and the depth of suffering because much of my time was focused on the development agenda, on peace, on elections. But the humanitarian agenda in Afghanistan is as important and will benefit from more of my attention in my second year here.

With all the strategic plans and frameworks that you are involved in that aim at improving the situation in Afghanistan, what do you want to achieve personally? How far do you want to go with and for the people of Afghanistan?

Far! I will always try my hardest in settings where I think there is hope and where I think there is a national capacity to manage situations. And clearly there is [in Afghanistan] and there is a plan to put in place a system that will enable the government to meet its responsibility. And so, I am willing to invest a lot of my energy, my time and to use my networks to draw attention to the good things that are happening in Afghanistan.

The past year was marked by a record high number of civilian casualties, several high-profile attacks including one on a NGO compound in Jalalabad. In your view, what has changed for the humanitarian community – for UN and NGOs?

I am not sure I would separate the two. It is important to remember that as terrible as the 31 May explosion was, and as awful as the January attacks were, these are just three incidents in a long list of tragedies that have befallen the people of this country, including the NGOs. Look at what happened to MSF in 2015 [when the hospital in Kunduz was bombed] or what happened to ICRC in February 2017 [when 6 staff members were killed and 2 abducted]. The security environment has become more complex with more players. This evolution complicates the setting and the extent to which we are safe. And every time we are less safe, we lose contact with communities. And every time we lose contact with communities and elders, we become less safe. [Afghanistan] is a very tough place for aid agencies to work. One of the hardest in which I have been.

What do you do to help the UN Agencies and NGOs to stay and deliver?

The humanitarian imperative demands that NGOs and UN Agencies are as close to suffering communities as possible. To enable that, we need to have conversations with all parties to the conflict. Those conversations are a major component of what I do. Managing risk as opposed to avoiding risk is a major part of what I do. Enabling UN Agencies to drive along roads as opposed to travelling by helicopter is something I promote to connect us to communities and reduce costs. Both of which I hope to enable us to provide more assistance to the people who need it most.

You toured the European capitals, meeting politicians and donors at the highest levels. Is Afghanistan on their radar? Are you rattling at a closed door?

I knocked on the door, it is open and I will be walking through it more frequently. That said, everyone in Afghanistan needs to recognize that Afghanistan is one of a dozen countries where humanitarian needs are high. Donor capitals are stretched. The case we make must be compassionate, yet compelling and concerted. Our messaging is getting better, but we are not there yet.

I never have worked in a country before where there is so much development financing in the absence of peace. That is a good thing, but we need to leverage the interest of development donors to gain at the same time a bit more compassion for the suffering today.

You are active on Twitter. Why do you tweet and what message do you want to share with your more than 20,000 Followers? I mix Tweets on humanitarian, development and cultural issues. I am really into positive messaging, to show a side of Afghanistan that is not only negative. I tweet pictures of people I meet, children, mountains or jewelry – things that lets people identify themselves with Afghanistan. I use two hashtags that I came up with: #AfghanistanCan and #BeautifulAFG.

I do not know exactly what it is, but I am picking up more followers and getting lots of interaction in the past few weeks.

You have said that for the first year, you will listen and learn. What can we expect for your second year? And what will you tell the humanitarian partners?

I will continue listening more than I talk. One cannot learn enough about this country in one year and my commitment is multi-year, like the Humanitarian Response Plan. I will keep listening but I will be saying a few more things, too.

What will you be telling the humanitarian community?

A handful of NGOs here deserve enormous credit for being close to communities in rural areas and saving lives. I will do everything I can to help them to stay, protect and deliver and to enable a few more NGOs to replicate that very good practice.

Anything else you want to add and share with the readers?

I never liked the word resilience and I don’t use it here [in Afghanistan]. I have no place to talk about resilience where everyone is more resilient than I could ever hope to be. I admire the strength, the pride, the commitment of the people of Afghanistan to survive the 40th year of violence. Amid this misery, listening to a father who says “I want my girl to go to school” proves to me that there is real hope for this country and this hope lies within the strength of its people.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 74 | 1 March – 31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-74-1-march-31-march-2018
1,afghanistan,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continued to remain grave in 2017 despite a reduction in needs at the mid-year mark from 9.3 million to 7.4 million. By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar province which registered a 310 percent increase in the numbers of internally displaced over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) and coalition forces’ escalating campaign to defeat non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the eastern region. Soaring suicide attacks and airstrikes – which increased by 50 percent and 68 percent respectively on 2016 – as well as more targeted NSAG assaults on military checkpoints and infrastructure also contributed to rising trauma cases.

Although overall civilian casualties decreased by 9 percent, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured). As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 percent of all civilian casualties. Unlike in 2016, however, when ground engagements comprised the largest proportion of deaths and injuries, combined improvised explosive device (IED) tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – accounted for 40 percent (4,151) of the total, highlighting the dangers posed to the population by NSAGs who, under increasing military pressure in the regions, are now resorting to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 included the forced closure of healthcare facilities by NSAGs as part of efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants, and which denied up to 1.4 million people (65 percent of them female) from access to essential services at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed or inactive due to the conflict according to the Ministry of Education. In order to address these issues and facilitate the creation of a protective environment in which Afghans are safe and free to go about their lives without fear of violence or harm, the protection cluster, in consultation with the HCT and ICCT, is developing a protection strategy in early 2018 to promote measures which support the reduction of civilian casualties and increase compliance with International Humanitarian Law / International Human Rights Law. These include the development of action plans and related advocacy to support the implementation of the National Policy on Civilian Casualty Prevention and Mitigation and the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, both recently endorsed by the government.

Despite initial projections of 1 million returns from Pakistan in 2017, an improved protection environment saw the arrival of just 156,140 Afghans in 2017 (98,140 undocumented returnees and 58,000 registered refugees). The decision of the Federal Cabinet of Pakistan in January 2018 to nevertheless issue the first ever 30-day extension of Proof of Registration cards to 1.4 million Afghan refugees prompted fears that a mass return was possible, if not imminent, and led to the development of an inter-cluster contingency plan to support 700,000 returnees with immediate humanitarian assistance totaling USD 198 million. Despite the Cabinet’s subsequent extension of PoR cards to 30 June 2018, the situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities. Partners on both sides of the border are currently monitoring the protection space for any signs of deterioration. While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, the tendency for existing returnee populations to settle in and around Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province – when combined with the significant numbers of internally displaced – has led to a doubling of the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66). As of November, more than 750,000 displaced populations lived in informal settlements in Nangarhar province, up from 429,000 in February, two thirds of which are concentrated in the two districts of Behsud and Sukhrod.

While natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected (a 20 percent reduction), the arrival of the La Niña weather effect at the end of 2017 has led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping season, leaving as many as 1 million people at risk of exposure to drought. In response, the ICCT has developed a contingency plan to provide emergency assistance (both in-kind and in cash) – totaling USD 110.4 million – to the most vulnerable households living across the 20 worst affected provinces.

Overall in 2017, humanitarian partners delivered life-saving assistance to 4.1 million people affected by conflict and natural disasters, sudden population movement and the effects of decades of underdevelopment and chronic poverty.

Humanitarian assistance was primarily delivered through medical care to the war wounded; emergency survival supplies of food, water and shelter to displaced and returnee populations, including multi-purpose cash grants (of which USD 35.9 million was disbursed) and sectoral support such as cash for food and cash for rent. As in previous years, humanitarian resources were also dedicated towards gapfilling for the provision of basic services, including healthcare and nutrition, with funds primarily targeted towards the 9 million people – approximately 40 percent of the population – affected by insufficient coverage of nationally-led systems or living in conflict-affected white areas.

Overall, the HRP received USD 320.7 million in committed funds representing 78 percent of overall requirements, making it the second highest funded HRP globally. As in previous years, the well-defined parameters of the plan, which focused on the provision of life-saving assistance, continued to resonate with donors who recognise the ongoing need for immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to be provided to populations for whom no alternative lifeline exists. The dedicated use of the 2nd CHF allocation 2017 to improve humanitarian response in hard to reach areas also helped to address existing imbalances in assistance provided to crisis-affected populations living in government and nongovernment held areas, the latter of which have typically been underserved in Afghanistan. During the year, humanitarian partners implemented programmes in almost 50 percent of all hard to reach districts (100) reaching more than 240,000 people in the process with emergency relief and protection assistance.

Despite these successes, a number of challenges remained.

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016 – when an unprecedented 675,000 were forced to flee their home – challenges with the existing IDP petition system led to some delays in the provision of emergency assistance and concerns that alternative models of IDP identification may be required in the future. At the same time, continued internal displacement, combined with ongoing returnee influxes, have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people residing in informal settlements, reinforcing the need for durable solutions which support reintegration, including the allocation of land and adequate housing and for which finalisation of an Executive Decree is still pending.

Indeed, with both short and long-term objectives now being pursued in parallel, Afghanistan is a defining example of the humanitarian-development nexus. Moving forward, it will therefore be a test of the humanitarian community’s ability to work in close cooperation with all relevant actors (including the UN, NGOs, development partners, the World Bank and donors), and with the government at both national and regional levels, to define collective outcomes and integrated responses, through multi-year joint planning which reduce needs, vulnerability and risk while at the same time building resilience.","Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 Year-End Report of Financing, Achievements and Response Challenges (January - December 2017)",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2017-year-end-report-financing

About 6,800 people have been newly displaced in Kachin State since early April when fighting broke out between the Myanmar Army and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Clashes have displaced people from locations in 6 different townships across Kachin State. Thousands have arrived in urban areas where displaced people are sheltering in local churches, existing IDP camps, or with host families and receiving aid from union, state and local authorities, CSOs, national and international NGOs, as well as private donors. Access to some conflict-affected areas remains difficult for both international and national humanitarian organizations.

India on Monday reached out to Afghanistan to secure the release of the six of its nationals abducted on Sunday in Baghlan province. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj called her Afghan counterpart and sought assistance to find the men who were taken away by unidentified kidnappers.

“External Affairs Minister requested all possible support in securing the release of abducted Indians and in response, Afghan Foreign Minister Salahuddiin Rabbani assured all help,” said a source elaborating on the conversation between the two Foreign Ministers. Mr. Rabbani was in Dhaka to attend a ministerial meeting of the OIC when the conversation took place and on his return to Kabul, he followed up the conversation with a meeting with Indian ambassador Vinay Kumar.

Expresses grief

“At the outset, Foreign Minister Rabbani expressed grief and sorrow over the abduction of Indian engineers in Baghlan province and said the Afghan security forces will not spare any efforts to protect the physical safety and secure the release of these engineers. He also mentioned, efforts have been initiated through the community elders to help secure their release,” a press release issued by the Afghan Foreign Ministry said following the meeting between the Indian envoy and the Afghan foreign minister.

Though the identity of the abductors remain uncertain, sections of the Afghan media have reported that the Indians were kidnapped by the men of Taliban commander Qari Nooruddin. This information is yet to receive official confirmation. The latest hostage crisis began after six Indians and an Afghan employee of energy major KEC, were taken away on Sunday from near the Khawaja Alwan substation of Pul-E-Khumri city of Baghlan province.

4,afghanistan,"Assault on religious ceremony in April was intended to break a stalemate with the Taliban

Rockets and heavy machine guns fired from Afghan government helicopters killed and wounded at least 107 boys and men attending a religious ceremony near the northern city of Kunduz last month, according to a UN report.

Villagers in the Dasht-e Archi district of Kunduz province said that dozens of people, including many children, had been killed in the 2 April attack, prompting the UN to launch an investigation.

The UN report published on Monday underlined the risks of a new strategy, developed with US advisers, which has seen a significant increase in Afghan airpower, with helicopters equipped with rockets and attack aircraft deployed to try to break a stalemate with the Taliban.

“A key finding of this report is that the government used rockets and heavy machine gun fire on a religious gathering, resulting in high numbers of child casualties,” the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said.

According to the report, at least 36 people, including 30 children, were killed and 71 wounded, leading to questions “as to the government’s respect of the rules of precaution and proportionality under international humanitarian law”.

Investigators verified 107 victims but had received lists from various sources indicating more than 200 casualties, the report said. There were serious concerns about the incident that required further investigation, but the UN report said it was not in a position to determine whether the attack amounted to a violation of international law.



Last month, the Afghan government said the attack was intended to hit members of a senior leadership group based in the Pakistani city of Quetta, who it said were in the area.

It also targeted members of a Taliban “Red Unit”, or special forces group, that was planning an attack on Kunduz city, which has been overrun by insurgent forces twice since 2015.

According to the UN report, based on interviews with over 90 witnesses, the helicopters swooped down, firing rockets and .50-calibre machine guns into a crowd attending a so-called dastar bandi ceremony in Dasht-e Archi. The ceremony celebrates boys who have learned the Koran by heart.

It said as many as 12 rockets may have been fired at the ceremony held in a field about the size of a football pitch that was adjacent to a madrassa.

The helicopters continued to attack as people fled towards nearby roads and houses but the UN could not verify allegations that they had deliberately targeted civilians and could not determine the civilian status of each person killed or injured.

In the wake of the attack, the government acknowledged that civilians had been killed and President Ashraf Ghanī ordered an investigation but so far no results have been made public.

The UN had expressed concern over the high number of casualties from air attacks even before the Dasht-e Archi incident, with 67 deaths and 75 injuries in the first three months to the end of March.

In October 2015, 42 people were killed in a US airstrike on a hospital in Kunduz city run by the medical aid group Médecins Sans Frontières.","Afghan helicopter raid killed or injured over 100, says UN report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/afghan-rockets-killed-up-to-107-at-religious-event-says-un-report

6,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

Navy Secretary Richard Spencer told reporters on May 2 regarding Navy aviation mishaps just hours after the WC-130 crash. Bullshit.

Indeed, aviation mishaps increased by a whopping 40% between fiscal 2013 and 2017.

Aviation mishaps currently kill more troops than Afghanistan. As T&P’s Paul Szoldra observed back last month, Class A aviation mishaps claimed the lived of 47 service members between April 2017 and April 2018; that’s 50% more than the 31 troops who died while serving in Afghanistan under Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.

Paul Grosklags insisted that “each one of those mishaps will have a unique cause, so there’s not a universal panacea” — a claim lawmakers quickly rebuked. “I don’t buy that ― that it is merely just individual incidences,” Rep. Mike Turner, Republican from Ohio and chairman of the HASC subcommittee on tactical air and land forces, responded to Grosklags. “If you have vehicular accidents that occur at a particular intersection repeatedly, they each have their own story. But, at times, there is something wrong with the intersection.”

White and Spencers’ lines mesh nicely with Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ March 2017 guidance, which suggests DoD spinmasters “be cautious about publicly telegraphing readiness shortfalls” in the name of operational security: “While it can be tempting during budget season to publicly highlight readiness problems, we have to remember that our adversaries watch the news too.”

Does OPSEC really trump acknowledging and addressing systemic aviation issues?

8,afghanistan,"KABUL (Pajhwok): A new survey shows the extreme poverty line in Afghanistan has gone 21 percent up compared to what the parity had been a decade ago. The survey records a 23 percent surge in literacy rate in the war-ravaged nation during the period.

Conducted by the Central Statistics Organization (CSO), the survey released on Sunday in Kabul indicated a 40 percent improvement in healthcare services for expected mothers during the past 10 years.

The SCO conducts surveys once in two years about people’s livelihood in Afghanistan in financial cooperation with the European Union, the World Food Program and the World Bank .

Prof. Hasibullah Moahid, CSO deputy head, announced the result of the sixth survey on people’s livelihood in Afghanistan. He said the organization surveyed 21,000 families or 156,000 people in all provinces of the country.

He said the level of poverty increased from 38 percent in 2012 to 54.5 percent in 2016.



The figure for poverty threshold in 2016 in Afghanistan was spending below 2,064 afghanis a month.

Moahid said the poverty ratio used to increase in winter compared other seasons and reduce in summer.

He added 13 percent of Afghans lived without having own houses. More than 70 percent of urban populations lived in poor neighborhoods or in inappropriate houses, he said. He said 44 percent of people lived in congested apartments or more than three persons per room.

Food safety

The survey shows that four among 10 people have no food safety.

According to the survey, eating less than 2,100 calories a day means the lack of food security.

Workforce

The survey says a major part of the country’s economy is disorganized, informal and illegal with livelihood being financed based on informal work, low wages, child labor, migration for work and hard labor.

It shows a little more than half of the country’s workforce is engaged but around two million people are jobless across the country.

Most of the workforce is associated with agriculture and the least of them are working in areas of electricity, liquefied gas and water, the survey notes.

Except factories and industry, men’s partnership is higher in all other areas compared to women, the survey finds.

It says women’s partnership in industry is 64 percent, in agriculture 33 percent and in private, social and local services their share is 10 percent and in finance, insurance and entrepreneurship is four percent, in business two percent and in constructions, mines and transport is less than one percent.

However, women have no role in in electricity, gas and water sectors.

The survey shows agriculture is the main income source for 28 percent of Afghans. On average, 38 percent of people own 2.5 acres of land, with access to irrigation water. A shortage of water is the main challenge to the country.

Access to potable water

Without providing information about reasons for shrinking access to potable water, Prof. Haseebullah Mowahid said the reduction was not at a high level.

Improving literacy rate

According to the survey, three of 10 youth and elders could read and write in 2007, compared to five out of 10 in 2016.

The literacy rate among men has increased from 40 percent to 68 percent and among women from 20 percent to 39 percent, compared 10 years ago.

Mother health

The survey shows pregnant women’s situation before and after delivery has improved (at least one visit).

Population

The report says 48 percent of the population is below 15 years of age. On average, a family has 7.7 members. Half of families have nine or more members.

The age of marriage is soaring; more than four percent of women aged between 20 and 34 years said they married before 15 years of age. More than 28 percent of women married before reaching 18.

More than eight percent of married women are living with polygamous husbands, reveals the study. The country’s population was estimated 29.2 million in 2016 -- 51 percent men and 49 percent women.

Economy Minister Mustafa Mastor hailed the survey results, saying the statistics suggested Afghanistan was not in a good situation. The findings indicate an alert for the Ministry of Economy.

The study would help the government draw up more accurate programmes in line with people’s requirements to resolve the current problems being faced by the country, he said.

He added $80 billion had been spent on alleviating poverty in the country during the last one and half a decade. Insecurity, instability and election crisis are the main reasons behind the backwardness of the country.

Mastor hoped the situation in Afghanistan would improve as a result of efforts being made by the government.

10,afghanistan,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The continued deepening and geographic spread of the con-flict, unrelenting displacement and exposure to repetitive shocks intensified humanitarian needs throughout the year. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to the protracted crisis, escalating emergen-cies, closure of health care services, shattered resilience, nat-ural disasters and cross border migration.

Armed Conflict

The intensification of the conflict, combined with a surge in sectarian violence, led to extremely high numbers of war wounded on both sides of the conflict. Although overall civilian casualties decreased by nine per cent from last year, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured), with 231,489 people receiving trauma services of some kind. As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 per cent of all civilian casualties. Combined improvised explosive device tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – ac-counted for 40 per cent (4,151) of the total, in contrast to 2016 when ground engagements comprised the largest pro-portion of deaths and injuries. Non-state armed groups (NSAGs), under increasing military pressure in the regions, re-sorted to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Natural Disasters

Natural disasters are a recurring phenomenon in Afghanistan affecting on average one quarter of a million people per year. In 2017, natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected. Although this was a 20 per cent reduction from 2016, avalanches, snowfall and flooding caused significant damage to homes and livelihoods in 22 out of 34 provinces.

The La Niña weather effect led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping sea-son, leaving as many as one million people at risk of exposure to drought. Each year the country incurs agricultural losses of approximately $280 million due to natural disasters, and it has been estimated that a severe (once in a lifetime) drought could raise this to $3 billion.

Internal Displacements

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016, displacement continued to have an impact on the demographic composition of large parts of the country. In some areas, particularly those where the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) is present, people have taken it upon them-selves to pre-emptively leave before being forced to do so.

By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar Province which registered a 310 per cent increase in the numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defence Security Forces and coalition forces’ campaign to defeat NSAGs in the Eastern Region.

Cross Border Influxes

With exposure to protection risks on both sides of the border, 156,140 Afghans returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan, as well as approximately 395,000 Afghans returned from Iran, during 2017. The situation of Afghans in Pakistan remained precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities, whilst families returning to Afghanistan were almost entirely dependent on ex-tended family networks and internationally funded assistance upon arrival.

While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, returnee families had limited ability to return home or to their ancestral places of origin. They were left with little choice but to occupy the vast and growing number of informal settlements which populate Afghanistan’s urban landscape. As in 2016, Afghan families returning from Pakistan tended to settle in and around Jalalabad City in Nangarhar Province which, when combined with the significant numbers of IDPs doubled the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66), resulting in overcrowded conditions with increased food insecurity and decreased access to water and sanitation facilities.

Security and access constraints

2017 bore witness to violations of international human rights law with deliberate attacks on civilians and public facilities, including aid workers and schools and medical facilities frequently reported. Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 were the forced closure of at least 147 healthcare facilities by NSAGs. Their efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants denied access to essential services to up to 1.4 million people (65 per cent female) at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed/inactive due to conflict.

Following years of growing insecurity in Afghanistan, many aid agencies adopted coping strategies that either ‘bunkerise’ or ‘localize’ their operations. This led to ‘access inertia’ in the humanitarian response, with agencies avoiding the risks associated with working in insecure and contested districts, resulting in a lack of assessment and response for those communities.",Afghanistan Common Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-common-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

12,afghanistan,"The launch of the electronic National Identity Cards’ (e-NIC) roll-out process by President Ashraf Ghani met with mixed reaction from parliament members as they had a tough discussion over the matter at a Saturday session.



A number of MPs said they back Ghani’s move over the distribution of e-NIC while others strongly rejected the process and called it “illegitimate”.



The arguments between the MPs continued with a number of them in heated disagreement.

Based on the president's legislative decree, the ethnicity information will be included in the electronic identity cards, but a number of residents of the country do not accept this. They say ethnicity information should not be written on the ID cards.



A number of MPs said e-NIC roll out based on the president decree is incorrect, adding it will create a new crisis in the country.



They said e-NIC roll out, without reaching a national consensus, shows the president’s “tyranny and autocracy”.



The MPs said they will not take e-NIC based on Ghani’s decree.

“A small and specific circle in the presidential palace today has taken Afghanistan people as hostage and is putting the country into a crisis,” MP Jafar Mahdavi said.



“Electronic identity cards distributed in the presidential palace, should remain there. They should not be issued out of the palace, otherwise people will react negatively,"" MP Zahir Saadat said.



“As long as the process is not legitimate, electronic identity cards being issued is illegal and will deepen the crisis,” MP Abdul Qayyum Sajjadi said.

Some other MPs however welcomed electronic IDs’ distribution process saying that opposing e-NIC roll out is against the national interests.

“We as Afghans who live in Afghanistan should stay united as brothers and work together,” MP Munawar Shah Baduri said.

“Anyone who lives in Afghanistan is Afghan,” MP Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost said.



Last Thursday President Ashraf Ghani officially launched electronic IDs roll out where parliament speaker Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi also was standing by the side of the president. A number of MPs also criticized Ibrahimi’s presence on the roll-out day.

Ibrahimi, however, said taking his electronic identity card was his right and now one has the right to question him about this.

“You do not have the right to ask me why you appeared there and why not. This was my right and I went and got my electronic identity card,” Ibrahimi said.



Arguments on electronic ID cards worsened as some MPs were set to fight one another.

14,afghanistan,"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani inaugurated the long-delayed distribution of electronic national ID cards Thursday, hailing it as an important step toward securing national elections, but his governing partner warned that the move could instead trigger a political and ethnic crisis.

While Ghani was rolling out the cards at a ceremony in his palace, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah declared at a news conference that the disputed design of the ID card “has not received the needed legitimacy and support from the Afghan people.” Such a “one-sided decision,” he said, can only lead to “more problems.”

The main point of contention has been the use of the word “Afghan” on the cards to refer to all Afghan citizens. The word was historically synonymous with Pash­tuns, the country’s largest ethnic group. Other groups, especially the second-most-numerous Tajiks, have objected that using “Afghan” would politically benefit Pashtuns.

The debut of the IDs, which was held up for several years by ethnic disputes and technical problems, came just six months ahead of scheduled parliamentary elections. A presidential contest is due to follow next year. Ghani is expected to run for reelection, and it is unclear whether Abdullah will back his rival or run against him for a second time.

The pre-election period has been plagued by other problems, including insurgent violence and low turnout for ID-card registration, that have left many Afghans worried that credible and safe elections cannot be held this year. Fraud marred the past two elections, and the 2014 contest between Ghani and Abdullah was so discredited that the two finally agreed to share power.

In the past month, two insurgent bombing episodes rocked the capital and took more than 75 lives. On April 22, a suicide bomber on foot detonated in a crowd of people waiting to apply for their ID cards, killing 57 and wounding scores. On Monday, two back-to-back suicide bombings in a ­high-security zone killed 25, including nine Afghan journalists who had rushed to the scene.

With concerns growing over election security and political stability, experts are debating whether it would be worse to have another high-risk, fraud-marred election or none at all. The consensus appears to be that it would be worse to have no elections because that would leave the power-sharing executive and the legislature in a state of legal limbo and foster public disenchantment.

Still, the high-level rift over the electronic ID cards has sabotaged hopes that the creation of a foolproof voting document would lead to more credible results — and help resolve protracted fights over the size of each ethnic group, by allowing people to choose among 15 groups to identify them on their cards.

The creation of a fair, inclusive and biometrically secure card was one of the first tasks set out by the national unity government, brokered by the United States after the 2014 contest collapsed. But three years and many delays later, the fight over what information should be on the card is ongoing.

Now the contradictory positions taken by Ghani, a Pashtun, and Abdullah, who is half-Pashtun and half-Tajik but is allied with a Tajik-based party, seem likely to exacerbate the feuding that has long divided the country into regional fiefdoms led by ethnic strongmen and has prevented a more modern democratic party system from taking root.

The disagreement is also likely to further discourage people from registering, even in urban centers that in theory are safer than rural regions under insurgent control. In the first two weeks that applications for voter IDs were open last month, a little more than half a million people signed up, while the potential number of eligible voters is estimated at more than 12 million.

“This . . . may turn into an ethnic crisis, and it will be a big opportunity for those who are playing ethnic cards,” said Najib Mahmoud, a scholar of law and political science. Such a development, he said, “would be a disaster for the country.”

Stay up to date on Portland news and politics. Looking for fun? Here are the best Things to Do in Portland today.

Good morning, Portland.

Let's start this week off right with some Childish Gambino realness.

Childish Gambino (aka Donald Glover) dropped this music video for his new single ""This Is America"" while he was busy hosting Saturday Night Live. (Dude's got a lot going on.) I've already watched this incredibly metaphorical, expressive, and explosive video five times and find a new detail each go-round. Here's what other humans are saying about it.



Here's what else you may have missed over the weekend:

Democratic Unrest: An explosion at an Afghanistan mosque killed at least 14 civilians who were registering to vote on Sunday. The bombing is the sixth known attack on a voter registration center since country officials made in-person registration a requirement last month.

In Other Tragic Election News: Vladmir Putin takes the oath of office for his fourth six-year term at the helm of Russia. Sigh.

Melania Explains it All: Melania Trump is expected to reveal her ""formal platform"" as the country's first lady this morning, more than a year into her first ladyship. In the past, she's hinted at wanting to curb online bullying, but being married to perhaps the biggest online bully hasn't done much to help her cause. TBH, this would be a great moment for Melania to announce her divorce.

EARTH CRACKS: Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted, and cracks in the Earth's crust have spilled lava and toxic gases through a Big Island neighborhood. As of Sunday night, at least 10 earth cracks (EARTH CRACKS!) were reported in the east side neighborhood and at least 26 homes had been destroyed. Surprising no one, this disaster has produced the most apocalyptic video footage.

Incredible footage shows the lava flow during this morning's fissure eruption on the east side of Hawaii's Big Island.



More than 1,800 residents have been evacuated from their homes. https://t.co/W5FHFgVrEP pic.twitter.com/vRykMZW7tF — ABC News (@ABC) May 7, 2018

Whitewashed Delight: Multiple African American University of Florida graduates who danced in celebration after receiving their diplomas were aggressively yanked off stage this weekend during a commencement ceremony. It's being seen as a racist attempt to mute well-deserved joy in Black Americans.

Tenant Turmoil: Members of a Southeast Portland apartment complex called Holgate Manor rallied this weekend to remind the city they'd like to keep their home. A developer has offered tenants a hefty sum to move out of the apartments, but for many longtime residents, it's not a realistic ask. Tenants are instead asking the city to buy the property from the new developer to retain their community and financial stability.

Cop School: An out-of-state consultant group visited Portland to teach police officers deescalation tactics to use when encountering someone in the midst of a mental health crisis. It's a type of training many community members believe is long overdue. A nice reminder from one of the instructors: ""If someone is in crisis, raising your gun and pointing it and barking orders is sometimes the worst thing you can do."" Hopefully someone took notes.

Gentrified Goats: The Belmont Goats are looking for a new home—their third since being booted from, well, Belmont. Sidebar: As a new-again Portlander, I'm still traumatized by the fact their original home is now a bougie apartment complex called ""The Goat Blocks."" What the hell, guys? Want to host 'em? Turns out it's pretty easy to be a goat landlord.
