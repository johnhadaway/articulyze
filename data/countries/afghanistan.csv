0,afghanistan,"The Russian government’s inability to comprehend that peace is not on the US’s agenda and means that the crisis will continue to build until war is upon us.

As I wrote two weeks ago, the Syrian crisis is only in its beginning stages. The assault on Syrian military positions Sunday night, apparently a US/Israeli operation, is evidence that the crisis continues to develop.

There are four mutually reinforcing causes of the crisis:

Israel’s ability to use the US government to eliminate foes in the Middle East that are obstacles to Israel’s expansion. Israel has Syria and Iran targeted, because the two governments supply the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, which has twice driven Israel out of Israel’s attempted occupation of southern Lebanon, whose water resources Israel covets. The neoconservative ideology of US world hegemony, which fits well with Israel’s Middle East agenda, a fit made even stronger by the strong neoconservative alliance with Israel. The US military/security complex’s need for justification for its massive budget and power. The inability of the Russian government to understand the first three reasons.

From the way the Russian government speaks, the Russians believe that Washington’s military actions in the Middle East for the past 17 years dating from the US invasion of Afghanistan, a still unresolved war, have to do with fighting terrorism. The Russians keep expressing the view that Russia and the US should join in a common effort to fight terrorism. Apparently, the Russian government does not understand that terrorism is Washington’s creation. The long wars with unfavorable outcomes that were the results of Washington’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq led to Washington recruiting and supplying terrorists to overthrow Libya and Syria. Clearly, Washington is not going to fight against the weapon it created with which to achieve its agenda.

“The Russians keep expressing the view that Russia and the US should join in a common effort to fight terrorism. Apparently, the Russian government does not understand that terrorism is Washington’s creation.”

The Russian government’s confusion about Washington’s relationship to terrorism is the fourth cause of the ongoing Syrian crisis. Washington was caught completely off guard in 2015 by Russia’s surprise intervention in Syria on the side of the Syrian government against Washington’s jihadist “rebels.” Russia was in complete control and could have ended the war in 2016. Instead, apparently hoping to appease Washington and show a reasonable face to Europe, the Russian government announced in March 2016 a premature victory and withdrawal. This mistake was repeated, and each time Russia made this mistake gave Washington opportunity to introduce its own troops and aircraft, to resupply and train its jihadist mercenaries, and to organize Israeli, Saudi, French, and British participation in the military assaults on Syria. Now the problem is that US troops are mixed in with the jihadist mercenaries, making it difficult for the Syrian/Russian alliance to clear Syrian territory of foreign invaders without killing Americans, something the Russians and Syrians have so far avoided doing. The Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov, now accuses Washington of trying to partition Syria, but it was Russian indecisiveness that led to Syria’s partition.

The inability of the Russian government to comprehend the US/Israeli/neoconservative alliance and what this means for the Middle East, together with the indecisiveness of the Russian government about supplying Syria with the S-300 air defense system, has enabled the crisis to escalate with last night’s as of yet unclaimed attack on Syrian military positions with what appears to have been “bunker buster” bombs, an escalation.

The attacks last night killed Iranians, and the next attack might kill Russian military personnel. At some point the Russian government might tire of its humiliation, in which case Israeli and US aircraft will begin falling from the sky and attacks on “rebel” positions will claim US lives.

The Russian government’s inability to comprehend that peace is not the Israeli/American agenda and that neither in the US nor Israel is there any good will on which Russia can build an agreement to bring peace to Syria and the Middle East means the crisis will continue to build until war is upon us.

The explosive-laden vehicle targeted an Afghan National Army base in Nadali District, Mohammad Radmanish, deputy spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, told CNN. A woman was among the civilians killed, he said.

After one year on the job, the Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer speaks about the huge disparities he sees, aid worker security and his personal commitment to Afghanistan.

While the number of mine casualties is on the rise, funding for mine action in Afghanistan dropped by 65 per cent over the past five years.

ACBAR’s Twinning Program successfully teams up international and national NGOs to build capacities to the benefit of both counterparts.

Lack of basic services in three informal settlements in Nangarhar is exacerbated with new conflict displacements and arrivals from Pakistan

“It is a very tough place for aid agencies”

The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, took up his function one year ago. Now, the top humanitarian official talks about his first 12 months in country, discussions in donor capitals, changes in the security environment, Twitter and what UN and NGOs can expect from him in the future. The interview was edited for length and clarity.

OCHA: What stands out about Afghanistan to you after one year?

Toby Lanzer: One striking issue are the disparities between life in Kabul, a few other urban centres and the rest of the country. Sitting in the heart of Kabul, working closely with senior Government officials, the international and NGO community, I am exposed to the vision and plan to create a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. But there is a gap between that and what the average citizen of the country lives every day. And there is an even greater gap between this vision and the plan and what people feel who were struck by violence, displaced by conflict or forced to return to this country.

That is why humanitarian action remains so necessary, so relevant and yet amongst senior officials, including myself, often understated. We are all so focused on the future – peace, stability and prosperity – that sometimes not enough attention is paid to the suffering of today. It has taken me a long time to understand that because I sit in the middle of the green zone. In my first year here, I managed to visit almost 20 provinces, increasingly by road, to connect with the girls and the women, the boys and the men of this country. And what they tell me is “Yes, slowly things are getting better, but we are suffering”

What has been your main challenge as Humanitarian Coordinator?

Amongst my different interlocutors [including from the development and political portfolio] much of the conversation is about the search for a political resolution – peace – and nothing is more important for the tomorrow of this country. The thing is that today, there are people going hungry. The hardest thing for me was to understand the scale and the depth of suffering because much of my time was focused on the development agenda, on peace, on elections. But the humanitarian agenda in Afghanistan is as important and will benefit from more of my attention in my second year here.

With all the strategic plans and frameworks that you are involved in that aim at improving the situation in Afghanistan, what do you want to achieve personally? How far do you want to go with and for the people of Afghanistan?

Far! I will always try my hardest in settings where I think there is hope and where I think there is a national capacity to manage situations. And clearly there is [in Afghanistan] and there is a plan to put in place a system that will enable the government to meet its responsibility. And so, I am willing to invest a lot of my energy, my time and to use my networks to draw attention to the good things that are happening in Afghanistan.

The past year was marked by a record high number of civilian casualties, several high-profile attacks including one on a NGO compound in Jalalabad. In your view, what has changed for the humanitarian community – for UN and NGOs?

I am not sure I would separate the two. It is important to remember that as terrible as the 31 May explosion was, and as awful as the January attacks were, these are just three incidents in a long list of tragedies that have befallen the people of this country, including the NGOs. Look at what happened to MSF in 2015 [when the hospital in Kunduz was bombed] or what happened to ICRC in February 2017 [when 6 staff members were killed and 2 abducted]. The security environment has become more complex with more players. This evolution complicates the setting and the extent to which we are safe. And every time we are less safe, we lose contact with communities. And every time we lose contact with communities and elders, we become less safe. [Afghanistan] is a very tough place for aid agencies to work. One of the hardest in which I have been.

What do you do to help the UN Agencies and NGOs to stay and deliver?

The humanitarian imperative demands that NGOs and UN Agencies are as close to suffering communities as possible. To enable that, we need to have conversations with all parties to the conflict. Those conversations are a major component of what I do. Managing risk as opposed to avoiding risk is a major part of what I do. Enabling UN Agencies to drive along roads as opposed to travelling by helicopter is something I promote to connect us to communities and reduce costs. Both of which I hope to enable us to provide more assistance to the people who need it most.

You toured the European capitals, meeting politicians and donors at the highest levels. Is Afghanistan on their radar? Are you rattling at a closed door?

I knocked on the door, it is open and I will be walking through it more frequently. That said, everyone in Afghanistan needs to recognize that Afghanistan is one of a dozen countries where humanitarian needs are high. Donor capitals are stretched. The case we make must be compassionate, yet compelling and concerted. Our messaging is getting better, but we are not there yet.

I never have worked in a country before where there is so much development financing in the absence of peace. That is a good thing, but we need to leverage the interest of development donors to gain at the same time a bit more compassion for the suffering today.

You are active on Twitter. Why do you tweet and what message do you want to share with your more than 20,000 Followers? I mix Tweets on humanitarian, development and cultural issues. I am really into positive messaging, to show a side of Afghanistan that is not only negative. I tweet pictures of people I meet, children, mountains or jewelry – things that lets people identify themselves with Afghanistan. I use two hashtags that I came up with: #AfghanistanCan and #BeautifulAFG.

I do not know exactly what it is, but I am picking up more followers and getting lots of interaction in the past few weeks.

You have said that for the first year, you will listen and learn. What can we expect for your second year? And what will you tell the humanitarian partners?

I will continue listening more than I talk. One cannot learn enough about this country in one year and my commitment is multi-year, like the Humanitarian Response Plan. I will keep listening but I will be saying a few more things, too.

What will you be telling the humanitarian community?

A handful of NGOs here deserve enormous credit for being close to communities in rural areas and saving lives. I will do everything I can to help them to stay, protect and deliver and to enable a few more NGOs to replicate that very good practice.

Anything else you want to add and share with the readers?

I never liked the word resilience and I don’t use it here [in Afghanistan]. I have no place to talk about resilience where everyone is more resilient than I could ever hope to be. I admire the strength, the pride, the commitment of the people of Afghanistan to survive the 40th year of violence. Amid this misery, listening to a father who says “I want my girl to go to school” proves to me that there is real hope for this country and this hope lies within the strength of its people.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 74 | 1 March – 31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-74-1-march-31-march-2018

The present Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) was prepared on the basis of the financing decision ECHO/WWD/BUD/2018/01000 (Worldwide Decision) and the related General Guidelines for Operational Priorities on Humanitarian Aid (Operational Priorities). The purpose of the HIP and its annex is to serve as a communication tool for DG ECHO's partners and to assist them in the preparation of their proposals. The provisions of the Worldwide Decision and the General Conditions of the Agreement with the European Commission shall take precedence over the provisions in this document.

0. MAJOR CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE HIP

In view of the expanding conflict, the lack of effective government commitment and the paucity of appropriate proposals, it will not be possible to conduct an effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programme in Afghanistan. As such the DRR objectives in Afghanistan will no longer be directly pursued and the EUR 1 000 000 allocated to this activity will be de-committed from this HIP.

1. CONTEXT

This Humanitarian Implementation Plan covers Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia. It is intended to address the needs of vulnerable populations affected by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and its consequences on neighbouring countries. It also includes provisions to improve capacities to prevent and respond to the effects of natural disasters and climate change.

In Afghanistan, the conflict between Government forces and non-state armed groups has intensified. According to a mid-year report from the United Nations, the number of civilians killed and injured during the first six months of 2017 persisted at the same record high levels as last year but with a worsening toll from suicide attacks, and a greater impact on women and children. In the same period, 173 409 people fled their homes due to the conflict, bringing the total number of displaced people to 1.7 million.

Forced displacement is reported in 29 out of 34 provinces and 58 per cent of all displaced people are girls and boys under 18. Most of the displaced people have moved to the cities, where social services are struggling to cope, leading to increased vulnerability and suffering. There is a mounting access problem for relief agencies and incidents have occurred where they have been directly targeted. DG ECHO's Integrated Analysis Framework (IAF) for 2016-17 identified extreme humanitarian needs in Afghanistan.

The vulnerability of the population affected by the crisis is assessed to be very high. At 7.8, Afghanistan holds one of the highest INFORM (Inform For Risk Management) scores, as well as one of the lowest and downward trending INFORM ‘coping capacity’ scores.

In view of the current increasing trend in the conflict and the lack of any credible peace process, the humanitarian outlook remains bleak, with needs that are expected to increase. Furthermore, the same conflict and instability is making it equally difficult for development programmes to achieve their objectives, notably to help the Government to provide a socio-economic environment that persuades Afghans to stay and build a future in Afghanistan.","Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia (Version 2 -16/03/2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/world/humanitarian-implementation-plan-hip-afghanistan-pakistan-iran-and-central-asia-version
8,afghanistan,"Russia and Iran are ""propping up the terrorist networks that are killing innocent people"" in Afghanistan, the U.S. ambassador to NATO said Friday.

“Russia is not helping at all. ... Iran is not helping at all,” Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S.-backed outlet. “We hear this when we’re in Afghanistan, and we hear from the military leaders. They talk about the enablers — those who have the money and the capacity to be helpful but instead are really propping up the terrorist networks that are killing innocent people.”

U.S. officials have aired suspicions that Russia has been arming the Taliban over the past year, which Russia has denied.

Hutchison’s more-explicit rebuke comes as both sides contemplate their strategy for Afghanistan, 17 years after the United States first invaded in pursuit of Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda. Russia recently called for members of a security bloc that it leads with China to take an expanded role in the country, while representatives from the NATO alliance vowed Friday to continue backing the central government in Kabul.

“There should be no doubt about NATO's position: NATO will continue to provide the support that the Afghan Government has requested so we can help Afghanistan fully provide for its own security,” the top diplomats from every NATO member state said in a joint statement Friday.

Western officials chiefly focused on Pakistan when discussing the danger of Afghanistan’s neighbors undermining Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s efforts to negotiate a lasting peace. President Trump’s national security team developed a new strategy the region that prioritizes pressuring Pakistan to deprive terrorists of the safe havens that they use to launch cross-border attacks in Afghanistan.

But the NATO statement on Afghanistan also contained a challenge to Russia and Iran.

“We echo President Ghani's call on regional actors to cooperate more closely on fighting terrorism and to support the Afghan government's peace and reconciliation efforts,"" it said. ""In this regard, we also encourage Iran and Russia to contribute to regional stability by fully supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.”

Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has pointedly declined to dispute reports that Russia is arming the Taliban. Nicholson also protested in April “the overt legitimacy lent to the Taliban by the Russians.” More recently, Afghan forces have reported that Iranian commanders are participating in Taliban attacks.

Russian officials have hinted that they may take a larger role in Afghanistan, in the name of fighting terrorism. “We must redouble our efforts to preclude the proliferation of conflicts from Afghanistan and to promote a political settlement of the Afghan crisis,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.

Hutchison, a former Texas senator Trump appointed as the U.S. representative at NATO last year, said there’s a simple way for Russia to help.

“We call on Russia, Iran, and Pakistan to do more, and we call on places like India and China who could do more and have not gotten as involved as we think they could by — number one — saying to Pakistan: 'You have a chance to come in with the international community and be [involved in] a positive effort,’” she said. “‘We need to rally all of the capabilities that we have to stop terrorism in Afghanistan, which is then exported to many other countries around there. We want to stop it for the Afghan people and for all of the countries that would be invaded by terrorists.’”","US ambassador to NATO: Russia, Iran back Afghan terrorism",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/us-ambassador-to-nato-russia-iran-back-afghan-terrorism
9,afghanistan,"This post has been updated.

More U.S. military service members have died in aircraft mishaps over the past year than have died while serving in Afghanistan under the Operation Freedom’s Sentinel mission.

That terrible sentence makes me think there is a definite crisis in military aviation. It should give Pentagon leaders pause that a junior soldier can be more confident of their safety downrange, receiving imminent danger pay, than sitting in the back of a helicopter stateside.

Pentagon leaders, apparently, disagree.

“I would reject ‘wave’ and ‘crisis,’” Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., director the Joint Staff, told reporters Thursday at the Pentagon when asked about the recent, well, wave of air incidents that have killed 14 service members since the beginning of March.

“Those are that mishaps that occurred,” McKenzie continued. “We are going to look at each one in turn. Each one is tragic. We regret each one. I’m certainly not prepared to say it’s a wave of mishaps or some form of crisis.”

If this isn’t a crisis or a wave, I’d like to know what is:

That’s 47 service members dead, in just one year. Over that same time period, 31 service members died in Afghanistan.

What the hell is going on?

The American-led international mission in Kabul announced the casualties but did not identify the troops, pending notification of their next of kin. Several Afghan soldiers were also killed in what the American military deemed a “combat operation.”

Roughly 14,000 American troops are spread across Afghanistan in a war that is now in its 17th year. The forces are split between training the Afghan military to fight the Taliban and hunting terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State’s affiliate in the country, which is known as the Khorasan group.

12,afghanistan,"Much has been said of President Donald Trump’s transactional style of doing business with other parties. The president’s critics allege that his form of negotiating is crass as it lacks the moral foundation that allows for principle-driven leadership and deal making. Yet, it is Trump’s transactional approach to dealing with others that is likely to prove a welcome change in Washington’s relations with Pakistan. Since 9/11 Pakistan has played a double game with Washington, pledging assistance, intelligence and logistical support in the fight against al-Qaida and Taliban in exchange for billions in yearly aid from Washington.

Amid these symbolic actions of support for Washington, Islamabad has for years secretly lent intelligence and financing to Taliban and other terrorist organisations, providing them safe harbour on Pakistani soil. The Trump administration has been right to confront Pakistan about this behaviour through public criticism and withholding of aid, until Islamabad makes progress to cut off assistance to Taliban and other terror entities.

Problems persist. As recently as April 8 Alice Wells, US principal deputy assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, stated that the US has yet to observe meaningful and “irreversible steps” to curb terror financing and support by Pakistani authorities. Why has Pakistan made a habit of double-crossing the US? Pakistan views Afghanistan through the lens of its paranoia over archenemy, India, and aims to enlarge its sphere of influence in Afghanistan at the expense of New Delhi.

To Pakistan, Afghanistan’s historical ties to India make it a long term partner of New Delhi, and this concern is exacerbated by the fact that Afghanistan enjoys international support amid the War on Terror. Pakistan’s fears are further fuelled by America’s warming ties with India. During the administration of George W Bush the US forgave India for breaking out of the non-proliferation treaty and subsequently signed a civilian nuclear deal with New Delhi, promising long term cooperation. Since then, the US has denied Pakistan a similar deal. Islamabad took this to mean that Washington did not believe it was a worthy strategic partner, a sharp contrast with Washington’s commitment to New Delhi.

Pakistan was quick to conclude that Afghanistan was becoming an ally of both India and the US, a development that was posed as a strategic threat. This helped contribute to Pakistan’s decision to have it both ways in the War on Terror, allowing the US to use its roads to deliver supplies into Afghanistan while providing refuge and intelligence to Taliban and al-Qaida. It bears saying that relations between Washington and Islamabad were further strained with the US discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011.

With the aim of changing Pakistan’s behaviour, Trump would be well served to apply further pressure and revisit some of the country’s past requests of the US, dangling a few carrots in the process.

Want a trade deal with the US? Cease all logistical and intelligence support to both Afghan and Pakistani Taliban.

For over 17 years, Pakistan has been an unreliable partner of the US. Trump has leverage over Islamabad in many areas and his new approach is a welcome development.

13,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

“The independent media is a cornerstone of democracy,” Pompeo said. “Despite today’s attack, the vibrant media landscape that has developed in Afghanistan will endure, in large part due to those journalists and media professionals who tragically died in today’s attack, but whose courageous and steadfast work helped lay the foundation for Afghanistan’s thriving and resilient independent media.”

Nine journalists died in Kabul, reportedly targeted by a suicide bomber who struck as they gathered at the scene of another terrorist attack. A tenth, a reporter for the BBC, was murdered while working in eastern Afghanistan, “making [Monday] the deadliest day for media workers in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban,” according to the Guardian .

“The international community’s commitment to the Afghan people and a lasting peace in Afghanistan will not be shaken by such attacks,” Pompeo said.

The Kabul bombings were claimed by an offshoot of ISIS, just days after the Taliban announced a new spring offensive against the central government.

That belligerence comes at a novel time for U.S. policymakers. President Trump is contemplating a withdrawal from Afghanistan — at least, reportedly, he has discussed the matter with libertarian-leaning Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. That would reverse his administration’s current policy of an indefinite commitment to the country that is paired with an enhanced focus on forcing Pakistan to crack down on terrorist havens that provide a launchpad for attacks on neighboring Afghanistan.

“The president told me over and over again, in general, we’re getting the hell out of there,” Paul told the Washington Post . “I think the president’s instincts and inclination are to resolve the Afghan conflict.”

At the same time, a bipartisan group of Senate foreign policy leaders have unveiled legislation that would authorize Trump to make war on ISIS and its affiliates. If passed, that bill would put his authority to target ISIS in Afghanistan — especially following the latest suicide bombings — and elsewhere on firmer footing.

“The United States, along with our Afghan and international partners, is committed to defeating ISIS in Afghanistan, which has claimed responsibility for this attack,” Pompeo said. “We stand with the people, the independent media, and government of Afghanistan and remain committed to supporting the Afghan people’s efforts to achieve peace, security, and democracy for their country.""

But U.S. officials aren’t the only ones talking about ISIS in Afghanistan.

Russia has also aired the possibility of taking on a larger role in the country, saying that the emergence of ISIS on its periphery poses a new terrorist threat. “We must redouble our efforts to preclude the proliferation of conflicts from Afghanistan and to promote a political settlement of the Afghan crisis,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week.

That raises the possibility of Afghanistan rising in significance as a theater of competition between Russia and the United States, despite the stated focus on terrorism.

“Russia is not helping at all,” Kay Bailey Hutchison, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Friday. “We hear this when we’re in Afghanistan, and we hear from the military leaders. They talk about the enablers — those who have the money and the capacity to be helpful but instead are really propping up the terrorist networks that are killing innocent people.”",Mike Pompeo believes Afghanistan's nascent journalism will endure after 10 reporters killed,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mike-pompeo-believes-afghanistans-nascent-journalism-will-endure-after-10-reporters-killed

NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with John Sopko, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, about the latest report on Afghanistan reconstruction. Despite the record amount of coalition munitions dropped, the security situation continues to deteriorate and civilian deaths from coalition munitions are at a record high.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

We're going to take a closer look at one of President Trump's foreign policy challenges - the involvement of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. A new report sent to Congress yesterday by a government watchdog paints a grim picture of the situation. It came out just after twin bombings in Kabul this weekend that killed dozens of people and two months after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford said, quote, ""momentum is going to favor the Afghan forces."" John Sopko is special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. They put out this new report. He joins us now. Welcome to the program.

JOHN SOPKO: It's a pleasure to be here.

CORNISH: So looking at your report, the conclusion is the opposite of what we're hearing from General Dunford, right? You say that the Afghan army and police together have 36,000 fewer personnel than they did last year. And that it's the result of desertions and casualties. What is that a signal of, and why is that a concern to you?

SOPKO: Well, I think the concern is that they can't sustain the fight. The Afghans are doing the bulk of the fight now. And if casualties go up, if desertions go up, then that's a problem on how they can sustain it.

CORNISH: We should say that the Afghan government, in reply to your report, they say that they have enough forces and that morale is high. What's your response to that?

SOPKO: I don't have any data on the morale. There's a lot of background information that we don't have or because it's classified we can't discuss, but I hope the morale is good. I mean, some of the units are excellent, but there is this overall trend, which causes us some concern.

CORNISH: I ask because is there a world where this is a smaller but more committed and competent force?

SOPKO: In some areas, it is. Their air force is smaller and very competent. It's improved dramatically. Their special forces units are growing. So those are positive points to focus on.

CORNISH: At the same time, you're seeing an increase in Taliban control over the population. What do you think is going on there?

SOPKO: Overall, it's still a bit of a stalemate, and I think what's going on is we do have a new strategy. It was announced by the president. But it hasn't fully taken effect. And we have to give it time to take effect. It's in the early stages of this new strategy, and part of that is efforts to get Pakistan to cooperate, deploying security brigades to try to get to training at the lower level, increasing a number of special forces, Afghan special forces.

CORNISH: John Sopko, we've spoken to you a lot over the years, and you sound borderline optimistic in this conversation.

SOPKO: Well, I - maybe I'm just an optimistic person because what else is the alternative? But I'm cautiously optimistic because I go to Afghanistan on a regular basis, and I get an opportunity to meet people. I was sitting down with the president of Afghanistan discussing his anti-corruption strategy. And around that room with President Ghani were a number of his top advisers. And these are young, bright, exuberant patriots, Afghan patriots, who are trying to do their best. And I kind of view them as sort of the canary in the coal mine. When the youth of Afghanistan no longer supports our efforts and the Afghan government's efforts, then I think we've got a problem. Now, at same time, I'm worried the insurgents hate the media because a free press is the future of Afghanistan. The insurgents hate a free election. And so the last two major attacks have been on those two institutions. But hopefully, if we keep supporting the Afghan government with a free election and a free and independent press, I'm more optimistic.

CORNISH: John Sopko, thank you for speaking with us.

SOPKO: Thank you. It was a pleasure.

CORNISH: John Sopko is special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.

18,afghanistan,"Poor rangeland conditions and below-average water availability will limit seasonal improvements

Key Messages

Below-average precipitation throughout most of the country during the October 2017 – May 2018 wet season has led to very low snowpack in most hydrological basins. Low irrigation water availability is likely to have an adverse impact on yields for winter wheat and other main season and second season staples (barley, maize, and others), particularly in downstream areas in regions with limited rainfall. Preliminary 2018 production estimates for wheat indicate a likely harvest of 3.5 MMT, nearly 20 percent below last year’s final production estimate and 27 percent below the five-year average.

The poor performance of the wet season and above-average temperatures have exacerbated dry rangeland conditions in many areas, particularly in Badghis Province and parts of Faryab, Jawzjan, Sari Pul, Kunduz, and Baghlan Provinces. Pastoralists and agropastoralists in these areas will likely attempt to migrate to areas with better pasture and water availability or sell livestock at below-average prices. Although sheep prices in major markets monitored have remained stable, field reports indicate significant declines in selling prices in some local markets, including in Badghis.

Nearly 70,000 people have been displaced by conflict in 2018 through April 15th, which has been particularly intense in northern, northeastern, and eastern regions. Approximately 1,240,000 people have been displaced since January 2016. Although the rate of new displacement in 2018 has been lower than during the previous two years, conflict remains widespread and further displacement is likely. The provinces hosting the greatest numbers of newly displaced people in 2018 are Kunduz (~13,900) and Faryab (~9,700). Most newly displaced people have received assistance from humanitarian partners.","Afghanistan Food Security Outlook Update, April 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-food-security-outlook-update-april-2018

More than 5,000 people are estimated to be newly displaced since early April in Kachin State following heavy fighting between the Myanmar Military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Affected areas include Tanai, Hpakant, Momauk, Mogaung, Injangyang and Chipwi townships, as well as the Laiza area. Fighting has subsided in some areas but is reportedly ongoing in Injangyang and Chipwi as of 29 April. There are reports of civilians that are unable to leave the conflict-affected areas of Tania, Hpakant and Injingyang townships. People fleeing the fighting are now sheltering in local churches, existing displacement sites, or staying with host families where they have received initial humanitarian assistance from the Government and local organizations.

PHILIPPINES

A series of armed clashes have been reported between government armed forces and the NPA , the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines. 68 families are displaced and currently staying in three evacuation centers, after fighting in Negros Occidental, on 16 April. On 19 April in Compostela Valley on Mindanao, approximately 400 people were displaced during another firefight. On 21 April nine familes were displaced after fighting in Leyte province. Local government authorities have provided assistance to those displaced and affected.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

The results of a mobile Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (mVAM) conducted by WFP in late March 2018 indicate that 14 per cent of 1,534 households contacted in affected areas had been displaced in the wake of the 7.5M earthquake that struck the country’s highlands region on 26 February 2018. The mVAM further showed that households in nine of 31 Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people. Recovery efforts should prioritize re-establishment of food gardens to minimize detrimental effects on food security.

In Kunduz Province, more than 1,400 people have been displaced to the provincial capital due to the ongoing drought, where they requested humanitarian assistance. The nearly 2,900 people who were displaced from Badghis Province to Hirat City, Hirat, two weeks ago due to the drought received food rations, emergency shelter and household items. The drought has reached vast parts of the country and could put one million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the coming months.

20,afghanistan,"Mattis Addresses Issues in Syria, Afghanistan, Korea

The situation in Syria is the “most complex security situation, fighting situation” he has experienced in his four decades of military service, Defense Secretary James N. Mattis said yesterday.

In a wide-ranging half-hour discussion with Pentagon reporters, Mattis discussed the situations in Syria and Afghanistan, as well as the Korean Peninsula.

He said he was to discuss the way forward in Syria later in the day with the United Nations special envoy for Syria.

“I’m meeting with Staffan de Mitura [to] see where the Geneva process is and what we can do to assist,” Mattis said. “And obviously, it’s mostly a diplomatic effort in Geneva, but it has a military element, which says we don’t allow ISIS to come back in the midst of all this.”

The United States, Mattis said, is working with all the countries in the region that are “engaged in trying to make stability a reality.”

Mattis met today with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“What we don’t want to do, now that we are on the cusp of winning on the battlefield in terms of taking down the physical caliphate, the geographic caliphate, we do not want to simply pull out before the diplomats have won the peace,” he said. “So you win the fight, and then you win the peace.”

Nearly all the nations in the region are concerned about Iranian activities, he said.

Taliban on ‘Back Foot’

The Taliban and ISIS in Afghanistan are continuing to target civilians, Mattis said. “You can break them apart in terms of what organization they’re part of, but their goal is to destabilize the elected government,” he said.

The Taliban were put on their “back foot” by strikes against their financial networks, the continued U.S. presence in Afghanistan, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani saying his government was willing to negotiate with the Taliban, Mattis said.

“We anticipated that they would do their best to try to bring bombs right into Kabul,” he said, pointing out the Taliban has targeted voting or voter registration locations, where crowds of innocent people gather.

“The Taliban realize the danger of the people being allowed to vote,” he said, noting that citizens have risked their own safety to protest the Taliban in a number of demonstrations throughout the country.

The United States, Mattis said, will continue to “fight and protect the innocent people.”

Strengthened Alliance

Mattis said he spent at least an hour on the phone April 28 with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo. He said the call was part of the broader collaboration and constant consultation between the United States and South Korea, as developments unfold on the Korean Peninsula.

Mattis said it is “pretty calm” on both the North and South Korean side, with no indicators or warnings of an increased military readiness in the North.

The U.S.-South Korea alliance remains strong, he said, noting recent developments have strengthened the alliance even further. In a statement April 28, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White said the leaders discussed the results of the inter-Korea summit. Both leaders, the statement said, expressed their “serious commitment to a diplomatic resolution that achieves complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.”

21,afghanistan,"After two decades in Pakistan, 35-year-old Durkhane is finally back in her native Afghanistan – but she has nowhere to go.

Sitting on a plastic chair here at a UN-run reception centre in the dusty border town of Spin Boldak in Kandahar Province, Durkhane is among almost one million Afghans who have returned from Pakistan over the last three years. They’re coming home to a country mired in conflict, where aid for basic needs, jobs, and support for reintegration are in short supply.

Long a safe haven for Afghans fleeing instability, Pakistan has made it increasingly clear that the nearly 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees on its soil, as well as an estimated one million undocumented Afghans like Durkhane, are not welcome. Pakistan has set a 30 June deadline before identity cards allowing registered refugees to legally stay in the country will expire – the latest in a series of short-term extensions that has put Afghans and aid groups on edge.

Kern Hendricks/IRIN Durkhane, 35, sits with her daughters in a border reception centre for Afghan returnees who have just arrived from Pakistan. Returning Afghans are screened and offered short-term aid, but are largely left on their own when they leave.

Returnees like Durkhane face an uncertain future. Durkhane’s family is from Kajaki District in neighbouring Helmand Province, an area contested by the Taliban and frequently hit by airstrikes. She said she doesn’t know if it’s safe to go back to Kajaki.

“We are worried about it, but what to do? We know that in Afghanistan, no place is secure,” she said.

Each week, new violence makes headlines, as the Taliban and forces aligned to so-called Islamic State battle each other and the besieged government for control. This week, IS-claimed bombings in Kabul killed at least 25 people, while an attack on a military convoy here in Kandahar killed 11 children studying at a nearby school. Last year, more than 10,000 civilians were killed or injured in conflict, while half a million were displaced throughout the country, according to UN figures.

Yet Afghan refugees continue to cross the border from Pakistan. UN agencies are preparing a contingency aid plan for 700,000 returnees this year, on top of some 400,000 people predicted to return from Iran, which is also deporting Afghans in large numbers.

The Afghan government says it’s trying to help the returnees, but so far it has resettled only a few thousand people over three years. Both local and international humanitarian agencies say they’re overstretched as it is, and they fear a mass influx will add to the instability. And rights groups say neither the government nor donors have tackled the returnees’ most pressing long-term needs: jobs, schools, and a secure place to live.

Afghans return from Pakistan and Iran through four main border crossings. More than 600,000 Afghans returned home from either country in 2017. Authorities and aid groups in Afghanistan are bracing for higher numbers this year.

Moving deadlines, growing uncertainty

A spike in expulsions from Pakistan in 2016 offers a blueprint for what could come this year. Pakistani authorities drove out more than 600,000 Afghans in what Human Rights Watch called “a toxic combination of deportation threats and police abuses”. Afghanistan struggled to absorb the sudden influx, and the UN launched a $152-million emergency appeal to cope.

Last year, total returns from Pakistan fell to about 157,000. But Pakistan has cranked up its rhetoric around sending refugees back to US-supported Afghanistan – a reaction, some analysts suggest, to US President Donald Trump’s January threat to cut aid after he accused Pakistan of harbouring militants.

So far, Pakistan has pushed back its deadline for Afghan refugees three times since January; past extensions have been for at least six months and often longer. Ahead of the current 30 June cut-off, about 11,000 people have returned – mostly undocumented Afghans who say they fear deportation, harassment, or worsening job prospects in Pakistan.

Aid groups say the situation for Afghans in Pakistan is volatile. “The situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities,” a recent UN update of aid programmes in Afghanistan stated.

Returnees enter Afghanistan mainly through border crossings like Spin Boldak, where the government and the International Organization for Migration run a reception centre. Here, undocumented returnees are screened, and the most vulnerable are offered short-term help: medical services, food, money for transport, and a night’s accommodation. But after that, returnees are largely left on their own.

Kern Hendricks/IRIN Men cross the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan at the busy Spin Boldak border post in Kandahar Province. The crossing is one of two major border checkpoints Afghan returnees from Pakistan use to re-enter the country.

Anwar Jan, 45, sat with his family at the reception centre. He has lived most of his adult life across the border in Quetta, working as a day labourer. But escalating harassment by Pakistani authorities convinced him it was finally time to leave.

“We were refugees without identification cards,” he said. “The police would arrest us, and it was too difficult for us. The situation in Afghanistan is better than in Pakistan for us. No one will arrest us without a reason here.”

But Jan and his family face obstacles as they try to rebuild their lives. Jobs are scarce, and many Afghans return to find their ancestral homes caught behind a shifting frontline.

“Most [returnees] are from districts where security is a big challenge,” said Fahim Safi, the IOM representative in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces, home to the two main border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

A January survey of returned Afghans by the Norwegian Refugee Council found that violence forced seven out of 10 people interviewed to flee again after they returned home.

A growing number move to crowded informal settlements that have multiplied across the country over the last five years, bolstered by displacement and the ongoing injection of new returnees.

See: As conflict spreads, chronic displacement becomes a powderkeg in Afghanistan

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations is responsible for helping returning Afghans reintegrate. Some, like Jan and Durkhane, have spent more time abroad than in the country of their birth. But a plan to provide land for vulnerable returnees in Jan’s home district of Panjwai, near Kandahar City, has floundered.

Nationwide, only 7,000 returned families have received land from the government agency in the past three years, according to Hafiz Ahmad Miakhel, a ministry spokesman. “The procedure of providing land has taken time,” he said.

Rights groups say the absence of any large-scale government land programme for returnees stands in the way of reintegration.

“It remains possibly the most serious concern for returnees – both land and housing in general,” said Patricia Gossman, Human Rights Watch’s senior researcher on Afghanistan.

Kern Hendricks/IRIN Young men wait for work on the Afghan side of the Spin Boldak border crossing. Day labourers eke out a living packing trucks and helping families move their belongings into vehicles after crossing the border.

Going back

With little long-term support from the government or aid agencies, many returnees here head to urban centres like Kandahar City, about 100 kilometres from the Pakistan border over barren desert land.

Families of Afghan returnees cluster together on the outskirts of the city, living in rented mud-brick homes lodged between large warehouses and petrol pumps. Most of the families had lived in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, and arrived one after the other in recent years as the pressure to leave intensified.

“There is so much land in Afghanistan that hundreds of thousands of returnees could live there,” said Mullah Nek Muhammad, a malik, or leader of the group. “But [authorities] haven’t given us even a square metre so far.”

Already, he said, many newly returned Afghans from his area are thinking of packing up and heading back across the border to Pakistan – despite the threat of harassment and deportation. A close relative recently made the reverse journey, he said: “He spent two, three months here. There was no work; he sold all his possessions and moved back to Karachi.”

Patte Mohammad Khan makes less than a dollar a day driving a three-wheeler, he said – barely enough to cover his monthly rent. He says he left Pakistan because of constant harassment; he doesn’t plan to return.

Kern Hendricks/IRIN Mullah Nek Muhammad, left, sits with Patte Mohammad Khan, centre, and Abdullah Hakim, right, at a home on the outskirts of Kandahar City. Khan says he struggles to earn enough money: “We will die of hunger in our home country,” he says.

But with five hungry children he often can’t afford to feed, it’s hard not to think about the life he left behind.

“If I tell the truth, our life was better in Pakistan,” he said.

Army Spec. Gabriel D. Conde, 22, was killed in Afghanistan by gunfire April 30, U.S. military officials said. (U.S. Army)

A U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan was hit by gunfire in a district east of Kabul while deployed as part of the Pentagon’s counterterrorism mission, U.S. military officials said Tuesday.

Army Spec. Gabriel D. Conde, 22, was an airborne-qualified infantryman with the 25th Infantry Division’s 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and was killed in Kapisa province’s Tagab district, the Pentagon announced. He had been in Afghanistan since September on his first deployment from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska.

Conde joined the Army in 2015 in Loveland, Colo., and was assigned to Army units in Alaska after going through basic training. His death marked the second U.S. combat death in Afghanistan this year.

U.S. military officials would not clarify on Tuesday Conde’s exact role while deployed, but he was part of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, in which the U.S. military targets terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The Pentagon primarily does that through the use of Special Operations troops, but it also uses conventional infantry soldiers such as Conde to bolster security.

Conde was killed in an operation in which another U.S. service member was wounded and medically evacuated to Bagram Airfield north of Kabul for medical treatment in a military hospital.

The death occurred during a bloody day in Afghanistan in which 31 people, including 10 journalists, were killed in twin bombings targeting civilians in Kabul, and a suicide bombing targeted a military convoy in Kandahar province, wounding eight Romanian service members and killing numerous children who were nearby, coalition military officials said.",U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan was part of Pentagon’s counterterrorism mission,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/05/01/u-s-soldier-killed-in-afghanistan-was-part-of-pentagons-counterterrorism-mission/

Return from Pakistan

A total of 1,150 undocumented Afghans spontaneously returned or were deported from Pakistan through the Turkham (Nangarhar) and Spin Boldak (Kandahar) border crossings from 22—28 April 2018, according to the Border Monitoring Team of the Directorate of Refugees and Repatriation (DoRR). Of the total returnees, 1,118 were spontaneous returnees and 32 were deported. This number marks a 40% increase compared to the previous week (824). The total number of undocumented Afghan returnees from Pakistan since 01 January 2018 is now 10,954. IOM provided post-arrival assistance to 96% of undocumented Afghan returnees from Pakistan (1,102 individuals), including 840 individuals in poor families, 254 individuals in single parent families and 5 special case. The assistance provided includes meals, accommodation, basic medical screening, Non-Food Items (NFIs), onward transportation cash grants and referral services, as well as support from partners.

Increased Returns from Iran

Over the past year, the Iranian currency has been devalued by 30% against the US Dollar against the threat of additional sanctions, consequently decreasing the economic opportunities for Afghans in Iran. In addition, in the first four months of 2018, over 30,000 Afghans have arrived in Eastern Turkey as a result of ongoing instability in Afghanistan.

Over 7,000 have already been deported by Turkish authorities on special charter flights back to Kabul (IOM Afghanistan is not assisting this caseload and does not have information on the profile of these deportees). Anecdotal evidence collected from Afghan returnees at the Islam Qala border crossing show increasingly challenges for Afghans in Iran. The above factors are contributing to a dramatic rise in the number of returning Afghans from Iran. As of April 2018, over 220,000 Afghans have returned from Iran, this is a rise from the same period in 2017 of more than 100,000 people.

Situation Overview

IOM is responding to a substantial increase in the return of undocumented Afghans from Pakistan and Iran. Since 01 January 2018, over 234,396 undocumented Afghans have returned due to diverse push factors, including deteriorating protection space in Pakistan and Iran. Most of those returning have lived outside of Afghanistan for decades, and will need support from the government and humanitarian actors both on arrival and as they seek to reintegrate. As the rate of return is influenced by a number of political, security and other related factors both in Afghanistan and neighboring countries, another surge in returns could occur at any time. The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan together with UN counterparts have now extended Proof of Registration cards for 1.4m Afghan refugees in Pakistan to 30 June 2018 and have begun the issuance of Afghan Citizenship Cards on 16 February for more than 850,000 undocumented Afghans. IOM is working to scale up its support to returnees in coordination with the Government of Afghanistan and other humanitarian partners in line with the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).

Return from Iran

A total of 20,501 undocumented Afghans spontaneously returned or were deported from Iran through the Milak (Nimroz) and Herat (Islam Qala) border crossings between 22—28 Apr 2018, 12 % more than in the previous week. Of the total deported undocumented Afghans, 5,071 individuals were deported through Islam Qala (Herat) and 5,140 were deported through Milak (Nimroz). Of those who spontaneously returned, 8,851 returned through Islam Qala (Herat) and 1,439 through Milak (Nimroz). Out of the total deportees, 595 individuals (6%) were deported with family members whereas 9,616 (94%) were deported as individuals. This brings the total number of undocumented returnees from Iran since 01 January 2018 to 223,442.

A total of 75,643 people have been displaced by conflict since the beginning of the year, according to OCHA’s Displacement Tracking System (DTS), up by nearly 3,000 people compared to the previous week.

Displacement Alerts(see map)

Following displacement alerts are shared based on initial information from authorities or partners on the ground. Numbers can change as more information becomes available.

Central, Capital & South-Eastern Region: Around 2,100 people reportedly arrived in Urgun district and 400 in Sharan, Paktika, from three districts within the province, due to armed clashes and drought. More than 600 people reportedly arrived in Kabul from Baghlan, Kapisa, Kunduz, Logar and Nangarhar provinces. In Pul-e-Alam, Logar, approximately 1,000 displaced people arrived from Chaparhar district, Nangarhar.

Northern & North-Eastern Region: An offensive of an armed group in Baharak district, Badakhshan, reportedly displaced 1,400 people to the district centre. In Sar-e-Pul province, an estimated 700 people fled their homes in Sayad district to the provincial capital Sar-e-Pul due to fighting.

Eastern Region: More than 1,400 people were displaced from Chaparhar, Dehbala, Khogyani and Surkhrod districts, Nangarhar, and Dangam and Chawkay districts, Kunar, according to provincial authorities. The reasons for the displacements were threats and intimidation by NSAGs.

Western Region: About 700 people arrived in Qala-e-Naw City, Badghis, from four districts within the province due to the drought, according to ANDMA. Equally due to the drought and depleted food stocks, approximately 3,500 people reportedly arrived in Hirat City, Hirat, from Ghor and Badghis provinces.

Natural Disasters and Drought

Flash floods heavily affected four villages in Chahab district, Takhar, according to authorities. First reports indicate that around 50 houses were damaged or destroyed. OCHA is coordinating a joint needs assessment.

In Kunduz province, more than 1,400 people from six villages in Khanabad district have been displaced due to the drought to Kunduz City and requested assistance from DoRR.

Authorities in Hilmand Province estimate that nearly 50,000 people could be affected the loss of crops and livestock and forced to displace in the near future.

The nearly 2,900 people who were displaced two weeks ago from Badghis to Hirat due to the drought received food rations, NFIs and emergency shelter from humanitarian partners.

Returns to Afghanistan

From 22 to 28 April, a total of 21,337 Afghan citizens returned to their home country.

According to IOM, 1,150 people returned spontaneously from Pakistan and 32 more were deported. From Iran, 10,290 people returned on their own and 10,211 were deported. The returns from Iran in April were markedly higher than compared to the same month a year ago, notably due to fewer work opportunities in Iran caused by the devaluation of the Iranian currency and increased pressure on migrants in Iran.

According to UNHCR, 836 refugees were repatriated and assisted in the same reporting period, 807 of them returned from Pakistan and 29 from Iran.

Security Incidents and Humanitarian Access

Humanitarian access to Tirkinkot, Uruzgan, is hampered due to insecurity and checkpoints manned by members of armed groups along the highway connecting the city with Kandahar.

In Logar Province, members of armed groups reportedly destroyed several mobile communication stations causing a widespread network outage.

Cluster Updates

Partners of the Health Cluster in the Eastern Region provided consultations for some 7,000 returnees from Pakistan or IDPs and vaccinated more than 1,000 children.

The Sub-Cluster Gender Based Violence (GBV) led by UNFPA reached more than 5,700 people with GBV-services, including 13 survivors of sexual assault.

Ongoing Response Activities(see page 2 for details)

During the past week, nearly 27,700 displaced people, returnees, refugees and members of vulnerable host families received some form of humanitarian assistance.

Distributions and activities were reported to OCHA from Badghis, Balkh, Farah, Ghazni, Jawzjan, Kabul, Khost, Kunar, Kunduz, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar and Sar-e-Pul provinces.

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continued to remain grave in 2017 despite a reduction in needs at the mid-year mark from 9.3 million to 7.4 million. By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar province which registered a 310 percent increase in the numbers of internally displaced over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) and coalition forces’ escalating campaign to defeat non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the eastern region. Soaring suicide attacks and airstrikes – which increased by 50 percent and 68 percent respectively on 2016 – as well as more targeted NSAG assaults on military checkpoints and infrastructure also contributed to rising trauma cases.

Although overall civilian casualties decreased by 9 percent, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured). As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 percent of all civilian casualties. Unlike in 2016, however, when ground engagements comprised the largest proportion of deaths and injuries, combined improvised explosive device (IED) tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – accounted for 40 percent (4,151) of the total, highlighting the dangers posed to the population by NSAGs who, under increasing military pressure in the regions, are now resorting to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 included the forced closure of healthcare facilities by NSAGs as part of efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants, and which denied up to 1.4 million people (65 percent of them female) from access to essential services at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed or inactive due to the conflict according to the Ministry of Education. In order to address these issues and facilitate the creation of a protective environment in which Afghans are safe and free to go about their lives without fear of violence or harm, the protection cluster, in consultation with the HCT and ICCT, is developing a protection strategy in early 2018 to promote measures which support the reduction of civilian casualties and increase compliance with International Humanitarian Law / International Human Rights Law. These include the development of action plans and related advocacy to support the implementation of the National Policy on Civilian Casualty Prevention and Mitigation and the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, both recently endorsed by the government.

Despite initial projections of 1 million returns from Pakistan in 2017, an improved protection environment saw the arrival of just 156,140 Afghans in 2017 (98,140 undocumented returnees and 58,000 registered refugees). The decision of the Federal Cabinet of Pakistan in January 2018 to nevertheless issue the first ever 30-day extension of Proof of Registration cards to 1.4 million Afghan refugees prompted fears that a mass return was possible, if not imminent, and led to the development of an inter-cluster contingency plan to support 700,000 returnees with immediate humanitarian assistance totaling USD 198 million. Despite the Cabinet’s subsequent extension of PoR cards to 30 June 2018, the situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities. Partners on both sides of the border are currently monitoring the protection space for any signs of deterioration. While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, the tendency for existing returnee populations to settle in and around Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province – when combined with the significant numbers of internally displaced – has led to a doubling of the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66). As of November, more than 750,000 displaced populations lived in informal settlements in Nangarhar province, up from 429,000 in February, two thirds of which are concentrated in the two districts of Behsud and Sukhrod.

While natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected (a 20 percent reduction), the arrival of the La Niña weather effect at the end of 2017 has led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping season, leaving as many as 1 million people at risk of exposure to drought. In response, the ICCT has developed a contingency plan to provide emergency assistance (both in-kind and in cash) – totaling USD 110.4 million – to the most vulnerable households living across the 20 worst affected provinces.

Overall in 2017, humanitarian partners delivered life-saving assistance to 4.1 million people affected by conflict and natural disasters, sudden population movement and the effects of decades of underdevelopment and chronic poverty.

Humanitarian assistance was primarily delivered through medical care to the war wounded; emergency survival supplies of food, water and shelter to displaced and returnee populations, including multi-purpose cash grants (of which USD 35.9 million was disbursed) and sectoral support such as cash for food and cash for rent. As in previous years, humanitarian resources were also dedicated towards gapfilling for the provision of basic services, including healthcare and nutrition, with funds primarily targeted towards the 9 million people – approximately 40 percent of the population – affected by insufficient coverage of nationally-led systems or living in conflict-affected white areas.

Overall, the HRP received USD 320.7 million in committed funds representing 78 percent of overall requirements, making it the second highest funded HRP globally. As in previous years, the well-defined parameters of the plan, which focused on the provision of life-saving assistance, continued to resonate with donors who recognise the ongoing need for immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to be provided to populations for whom no alternative lifeline exists. The dedicated use of the 2nd CHF allocation 2017 to improve humanitarian response in hard to reach areas also helped to address existing imbalances in assistance provided to crisis-affected populations living in government and nongovernment held areas, the latter of which have typically been underserved in Afghanistan. During the year, humanitarian partners implemented programmes in almost 50 percent of all hard to reach districts (100) reaching more than 240,000 people in the process with emergency relief and protection assistance.

Despite these successes, a number of challenges remained.

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016 – when an unprecedented 675,000 were forced to flee their home – challenges with the existing IDP petition system led to some delays in the provision of emergency assistance and concerns that alternative models of IDP identification may be required in the future. At the same time, continued internal displacement, combined with ongoing returnee influxes, have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people residing in informal settlements, reinforcing the need for durable solutions which support reintegration, including the allocation of land and adequate housing and for which finalisation of an Executive Decree is still pending.

Indeed, with both short and long-term objectives now being pursued in parallel, Afghanistan is a defining example of the humanitarian-development nexus. Moving forward, it will therefore be a test of the humanitarian community’s ability to work in close cooperation with all relevant actors (including the UN, NGOs, development partners, the World Bank and donors), and with the government at both national and regional levels, to define collective outcomes and integrated responses, through multi-year joint planning which reduce needs, vulnerability and risk while at the same time building resilience.","Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 Year-End Report of Financing, Achievements and Response Challenges (January - December 2017)",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2017-year-end-report-financing
