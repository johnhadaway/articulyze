0,afghanistan,"The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan has expressed hope that Washington and Moscow will overcome their differences to work together in defeating a resilient Islamist insurgency.

Army General John Nicholson, the longest-serving commander in the longest war in U.S. history, recently told local U.S.-funded media that, although he was aware of allegations that Russia had provided limited assistance to the Taliban militant group, he could not independently verify the claims. Days after a Congress-mandated report shed light on a losing battle for the war-torn nation, Nicholson said he would welcome assistance from Russia in stabilizing Afghanistan.

""We're seeing small-scale support being rendered to the Taliban. I've had weapons delivered to my headquarters from governors in the north who said that this was provided by the Russians to the Taliban,"" Nicholson told Gandhara, a subsidiary of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. ""Of course, this is difficult to establish with great certainty. The main thing is that we have a shared interest with Russia in Afghanistan. We both shared an interest in countering the terrorists who threaten our country, threaten Russia, and threaten Central Asia.

""We have a shared interest in defeating Daesh (ISIS), we have a shared interest in counternarcotics, we have a shared interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan. And what we hope to do is to be able to work with Russia and all of the nations in the region to achieve these outcomes in Afghanistan,"" he added.

The U.S. initially got involved in Afghanistan in the 1970s as part of a covert CIA operation to back Islamist mujahideen rebels against a Soviet-backed government. The Soviet Union was forced to abandon its socialist satellite state in 1989, shortly before Moscow's own communist system would collapse at home and across Europe. Afghanistan was plunged into a civil war for the next decade, with the ultraconservative Pakistan-backed Taliban taking mostly defeating the rival Northern Alliance, which was backed by Russia, India, the U.S. and others, by the turn of the 21st century.

The 9/11 attacks, however, drew a full-scale, U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The Taliban had refused to forfeit Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and was overthrown by December of that year. Two full U.S. administrations later, the Taliban remains a powerful force in the country, claiming entire districts and steadily growing. The Islamic State militant group (ISIS) is also present and regularly claims deadly attacks, often targeting civilians.

On Tuesday, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) issued its latest quarterly report on the status of U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan. The watchdog, which was founded in 2008 by order of Congress, found that insurgents had claimed more control over districts than any previous point since November 2015, when it began recording such data. It also found that the number of Afghan security forces had dropped by nearly 36,000 in January 2018 compared to January of 2017—a 10.6 percent decrease—and that security incidents were on the rise.

Last week, the Afghan capital of Kabul was struck by two deadly suicide bombings claimed by ISIS. The collective toll of these attacks was nearly 100. The first such attack targeted locals registering to vote in elections set to take place in October, the same month that the U.S. military intervention enters an unprecedented 17th year. The second suicide attack targeted journalists.

Russia has been deeply critical of the U.S.'s role in Afghanistan, accusing it of mishandling the conflict and fostering further unrest. At last week's gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his country's regional military bases provided support to countries affected by the crisis, but that the conflict would ultimately require a political solution.

""Afghanistan is another flashpoint in the Middle East. The situation continues to deteriorate. The more than fifteen-year presence of the United States and NATO in this Islamic republic has not led to the normalization of the situation,"" Shoigu said.","U.S. Military Should 'Work with Russia' in Afghanistan, Top Commander Says",http://www.newsweek.com/us-military-should-work-russia-afghanistan-top-commander-says-909642

“It is a very tough place for aid agencies”

The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, took up his function one year ago. Now, the top humanitarian official talks about his first 12 months in country, discussions in donor capitals, changes in the security environment, Twitter and what UN and NGOs can expect from him in the future. The interview was edited for length and clarity.

OCHA: What stands out about Afghanistan to you after one year?

Toby Lanzer: One striking issue are the disparities between life in Kabul, a few other urban centres and the rest of the country. Sitting in the heart of Kabul, working closely with senior Government officials, the international and NGO community, I am exposed to the vision and plan to create a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. But there is a gap between that and what the average citizen of the country lives every day. And there is an even greater gap between this vision and the plan and what people feel who were struck by violence, displaced by conflict or forced to return to this country.

That is why humanitarian action remains so necessary, so relevant and yet amongst senior officials, including myself, often understated. We are all so focused on the future – peace, stability and prosperity – that sometimes not enough attention is paid to the suffering of today. It has taken me a long time to understand that because I sit in the middle of the green zone. In my first year here, I managed to visit almost 20 provinces, increasingly by road, to connect with the girls and the women, the boys and the men of this country. And what they tell me is “Yes, slowly things are getting better, but we are suffering”

What has been your main challenge as Humanitarian Coordinator?

Amongst my different interlocutors [including from the development and political portfolio] much of the conversation is about the search for a political resolution – peace – and nothing is more important for the tomorrow of this country. The thing is that today, there are people going hungry. The hardest thing for me was to understand the scale and the depth of suffering because much of my time was focused on the development agenda, on peace, on elections. But the humanitarian agenda in Afghanistan is as important and will benefit from more of my attention in my second year here.

With all the strategic plans and frameworks that you are involved in that aim at improving the situation in Afghanistan, what do you want to achieve personally? How far do you want to go with and for the people of Afghanistan?

Far! I will always try my hardest in settings where I think there is hope and where I think there is a national capacity to manage situations. And clearly there is [in Afghanistan] and there is a plan to put in place a system that will enable the government to meet its responsibility. And so, I am willing to invest a lot of my energy, my time and to use my networks to draw attention to the good things that are happening in Afghanistan.

The past year was marked by a record high number of civilian casualties, several high-profile attacks including one on a NGO compound in Jalalabad. In your view, what has changed for the humanitarian community – for UN and NGOs?

I am not sure I would separate the two. It is important to remember that as terrible as the 31 May explosion was, and as awful as the January attacks were, these are just three incidents in a long list of tragedies that have befallen the people of this country, including the NGOs. Look at what happened to MSF in 2015 [when the hospital in Kunduz was bombed] or what happened to ICRC in February 2017 [when 6 staff members were killed and 2 abducted]. The security environment has become more complex with more players. This evolution complicates the setting and the extent to which we are safe. And every time we are less safe, we lose contact with communities. And every time we lose contact with communities and elders, we become less safe. [Afghanistan] is a very tough place for aid agencies to work. One of the hardest in which I have been.

What do you do to help the UN Agencies and NGOs to stay and deliver?

The humanitarian imperative demands that NGOs and UN Agencies are as close to suffering communities as possible. To enable that, we need to have conversations with all parties to the conflict. Those conversations are a major component of what I do. Managing risk as opposed to avoiding risk is a major part of what I do. Enabling UN Agencies to drive along roads as opposed to travelling by helicopter is something I promote to connect us to communities and reduce costs. Both of which I hope to enable us to provide more assistance to the people who need it most.

You toured the European capitals, meeting politicians and donors at the highest levels. Is Afghanistan on their radar? Are you rattling at a closed door?

I knocked on the door, it is open and I will be walking through it more frequently. That said, everyone in Afghanistan needs to recognize that Afghanistan is one of a dozen countries where humanitarian needs are high. Donor capitals are stretched. The case we make must be compassionate, yet compelling and concerted. Our messaging is getting better, but we are not there yet.

I never have worked in a country before where there is so much development financing in the absence of peace. That is a good thing, but we need to leverage the interest of development donors to gain at the same time a bit more compassion for the suffering today.

You are active on Twitter. Why do you tweet and what message do you want to share with your more than 20,000 Followers? I mix Tweets on humanitarian, development and cultural issues. I am really into positive messaging, to show a side of Afghanistan that is not only negative. I tweet pictures of people I meet, children, mountains or jewelry – things that lets people identify themselves with Afghanistan. I use two hashtags that I came up with: #AfghanistanCan and #BeautifulAFG.

I do not know exactly what it is, but I am picking up more followers and getting lots of interaction in the past few weeks.

You have said that for the first year, you will listen and learn. What can we expect for your second year? And what will you tell the humanitarian partners?

I will continue listening more than I talk. One cannot learn enough about this country in one year and my commitment is multi-year, like the Humanitarian Response Plan. I will keep listening but I will be saying a few more things, too.

What will you be telling the humanitarian community?

A handful of NGOs here deserve enormous credit for being close to communities in rural areas and saving lives. I will do everything I can to help them to stay, protect and deliver and to enable a few more NGOs to replicate that very good practice.

Anything else you want to add and share with the readers?

I never liked the word resilience and I don’t use it here [in Afghanistan]. I have no place to talk about resilience where everyone is more resilient than I could ever hope to be. I admire the strength, the pride, the commitment of the people of Afghanistan to survive the 40th year of violence. Amid this misery, listening to a father who says “I want my girl to go to school” proves to me that there is real hope for this country and this hope lies within the strength of its people.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 74 | 1 March – 31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-74-1-march-31-march-2018
3,afghanistan,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The continued deepening and geographic spread of the con-flict, unrelenting displacement and exposure to repetitive shocks intensified humanitarian needs throughout the year. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to the protracted crisis, escalating emergen-cies, closure of health care services, shattered resilience, nat-ural disasters and cross border migration.

Armed Conflict

The intensification of the conflict, combined with a surge in sectarian violence, led to extremely high numbers of war wounded on both sides of the conflict. Although overall civilian casualties decreased by nine per cent from last year, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured), with 231,489 people receiving trauma services of some kind. As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 per cent of all civilian casualties. Combined improvised explosive device tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – ac-counted for 40 per cent (4,151) of the total, in contrast to 2016 when ground engagements comprised the largest pro-portion of deaths and injuries. Non-state armed groups (NSAGs), under increasing military pressure in the regions, re-sorted to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Natural Disasters

Natural disasters are a recurring phenomenon in Afghanistan affecting on average one quarter of a million people per year. In 2017, natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected. Although this was a 20 per cent reduction from 2016, avalanches, snowfall and flooding caused significant damage to homes and livelihoods in 22 out of 34 provinces.

The La Niña weather effect led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping sea-son, leaving as many as one million people at risk of exposure to drought. Each year the country incurs agricultural losses of approximately $280 million due to natural disasters, and it has been estimated that a severe (once in a lifetime) drought could raise this to $3 billion.

Internal Displacements

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016, displacement continued to have an impact on the demographic composition of large parts of the country. In some areas, particularly those where the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) is present, people have taken it upon them-selves to pre-emptively leave before being forced to do so.

By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar Province which registered a 310 per cent increase in the numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defence Security Forces and coalition forces’ campaign to defeat NSAGs in the Eastern Region.

Cross Border Influxes

With exposure to protection risks on both sides of the border, 156,140 Afghans returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan, as well as approximately 395,000 Afghans returned from Iran, during 2017. The situation of Afghans in Pakistan remained precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities, whilst families returning to Afghanistan were almost entirely dependent on ex-tended family networks and internationally funded assistance upon arrival.

While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, returnee families had limited ability to return home or to their ancestral places of origin. They were left with little choice but to occupy the vast and growing number of informal settlements which populate Afghanistan’s urban landscape. As in 2016, Afghan families returning from Pakistan tended to settle in and around Jalalabad City in Nangarhar Province which, when combined with the significant numbers of IDPs doubled the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66), resulting in overcrowded conditions with increased food insecurity and decreased access to water and sanitation facilities.

Security and access constraints

2017 bore witness to violations of international human rights law with deliberate attacks on civilians and public facilities, including aid workers and schools and medical facilities frequently reported. Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 were the forced closure of at least 147 healthcare facilities by NSAGs. Their efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants denied access to essential services to up to 1.4 million people (65 per cent female) at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed/inactive due to conflict.

Following years of growing insecurity in Afghanistan, many aid agencies adopted coping strategies that either ‘bunkerise’ or ‘localize’ their operations. This led to ‘access inertia’ in the humanitarian response, with agencies avoiding the risks associated with working in insecure and contested districts, resulting in a lack of assessment and response for those communities.",Afghanistan Common Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-common-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

5,afghanistan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities will deport close to 600 illegal Afghan migrants in eastern Turkey back to Kabul this weekend, the interior ministry said on Saturday.

The Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey through Iran due to “ongoing terrorist activities and economic troubles” in Afghanistan, the ministry said, and security forces had handed the migrants over to provincial immigration authorities.

It said deportation procedures had been completed for 591 migrants in the eastern province of Erzurum and that charter flights to Kabul would be arranged on Saturday and Sunday to send the migrants back.

“Following the completion of deportation procedures for illegal migrants in our other provinces, deportations will speed up and continue in the coming days,” the ministry said in a statement.

Rights groups have criticised Turkey for deporting migrants back to conflict-torn countries, including Afghanistan, saying it was putting their lives at risk.

This week the Hurriyet newspaper reported that several thousand Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey in recent months and had walked for days from the border to reach Erzurum.

Afghanistan has been ravaged by militant attacks this year, and the government has made promises to tighten security in the wake of an attack in central Kabul that killed around 100 people in January.

The attacks have undermined support for President Ashraf Ghani, who offered in February to hold peace talks with Taliban insurgents fighting to drive out international forces and reimpose their version of strict Islamic law.

The Taliban have so far shown little sign of accepting the offer of talks with the Western-backed government, which they consider an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime, although they have offered to talk to the United States.",Turkey to deport nearly 600 Afghan migrants - interior ministry,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-afghanistan/turkey-to-deport-nearly-600-afghan-migrants-interior-ministry-idUSKBN1HE0DX

A bombing inside a mosque in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, Afghan officials said.

The blast took place during afternoon prayers at the mosque in the city of Khost, the capital of the province of the same name. The mosque was also being used as a voter registration center for parliamentary elections set for October, marking the latest in a series of attacks on election-related facilities.

The explosion is believed to be caused by explosives planted in the mosque, rather than by a suicide bomber, a spokesman for the provincial police told Reuters.

There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and ISIS are suspected as those groups have a history of targeting democratic elections. The Associated Press notes that while ISIS has gained more ground in Afghanistan in recent years, the terror group does not have a confirmed presence in Khost.

The parliamentary elections planned for October would be the first held in Afghanistan since 2014, but repeated attacks have delayed voter registration. Local media reports this is the seventh attack on an election-related site since registration started in mid-May.

Milaha Hassan, an election commissioner, told The New York Times that only 1.2 million people are registered to vote out of 14 million who are believed to be eligible. The government's credibility and that of its Western allies hangs in the balance as the violence threatens to undermine the upcoming parliamentary vote, which has already been put off three years.

Last month, a suicide bomber killed at least 60 people and wounded more than 100 others who were registering to vote in the Afghan capital, Kabul. ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack.

A number of MPs said they back Ghani’s move over the distribution of e-NIC while others strongly rejected the process and called it “illegitimate”.



The arguments between the MPs continued with a number of them in heated disagreement.

Based on the president's legislative decree, the ethnicity information will be included in the electronic identity cards, but a number of residents of the country do not accept this. They say ethnicity information should not be written on the ID cards.



A number of MPs said e-NIC roll out based on the president decree is incorrect, adding it will create a new crisis in the country.



They said e-NIC roll out, without reaching a national consensus, shows the president’s “tyranny and autocracy”.



The MPs said they will not take e-NIC based on Ghani’s decree.

“A small and specific circle in the presidential palace today has taken Afghanistan people as hostage and is putting the country into a crisis,” MP Jafar Mahdavi said.



“Electronic identity cards distributed in the presidential palace, should remain there. They should not be issued out of the palace, otherwise people will react negatively,"" MP Zahir Saadat said.



“As long as the process is not legitimate, electronic identity cards being issued is illegal and will deepen the crisis,” MP Abdul Qayyum Sajjadi said.

Some other MPs however welcomed electronic IDs’ distribution process saying that opposing e-NIC roll out is against the national interests.

“We as Afghans who live in Afghanistan should stay united as brothers and work together,” MP Munawar Shah Baduri said.

“Anyone who lives in Afghanistan is Afghan,” MP Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost said.



Last Thursday President Ashraf Ghani officially launched electronic IDs roll out where parliament speaker Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi also was standing by the side of the president. A number of MPs also criticized Ibrahimi’s presence on the roll-out day.

Ibrahimi, however, said taking his electronic identity card was his right and now one has the right to question him about this.

“You do not have the right to ask me why you appeared there and why not. This was my right and I went and got my electronic identity card,” Ibrahimi said.



Arguments on electronic ID cards worsened as some MPs were set to fight one another.

More than 5,000 people are estimated to be newly displaced since early April in Kachin State following heavy fighting between the Myanmar Military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Affected areas include Tanai, Hpakant, Momauk, Mogaung, Injangyang and Chipwi townships, as well as the Laiza area. Fighting has subsided in some areas but is reportedly ongoing in Injangyang and Chipwi as of 29 April. There are reports of civilians that are unable to leave the conflict-affected areas of Tania, Hpakant and Injingyang townships. People fleeing the fighting are now sheltering in local churches, existing displacement sites, or staying with host families where they have received initial humanitarian assistance from the Government and local organizations.

The mVAM further showed that households in nine of 31 Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people. Recovery efforts should prioritize re-establishment of food gardens to minimize detrimental effects on food security.

The purpose of the HIP and its annex is to serve as a communication tool for DG ECHO's partners and to assist them in the preparation of their proposals. The provisions of the Worldwide Decision and the General Conditions of the Agreement with the European Commission shall take precedence over the provisions in this document.

0. MAJOR CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE HIP

In view of the expanding conflict, the lack of effective government commitment and the paucity of appropriate proposals, it will not be possible to conduct an effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programme in Afghanistan. As such the DRR objectives in Afghanistan will no longer be directly pursued and the EUR 1 000 000 allocated to this activity will be de-committed from this HIP.

1. CONTEXT

This Humanitarian Implementation Plan covers Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia. It is intended to address the needs of vulnerable populations affected by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and its consequences on neighbouring countries. It also includes provisions to improve capacities to prevent and respond to the effects of natural disasters and climate change.

In Afghanistan, the conflict between Government forces and non-state armed groups has intensified. According to a mid-year report from the United Nations, the number of civilians killed and injured during the first six months of 2017 persisted at the same record high levels as last year but with a worsening toll from suicide attacks, and a greater impact on women and children. In the same period, 173 409 people fled their homes due to the conflict, bringing the total number of displaced people to 1.7 million.

Forced displacement is reported in 29 out of 34 provinces and 58 per cent of all displaced people are girls and boys under 18. Most of the displaced people have moved to the cities, where social services are struggling to cope, leading to increased vulnerability and suffering. There is a mounting access problem for relief agencies and incidents have occurred where they have been directly targeted. DG ECHO's Integrated Analysis Framework (IAF) for 2016-17 identified extreme humanitarian needs in Afghanistan.

The vulnerability of the population affected by the crisis is assessed to be very high. At 7.8, Afghanistan holds one of the highest INFORM (Inform For Risk Management) scores, as well as one of the lowest and downward trending INFORM ‘coping capacity’ scores.

In view of the current increasing trend in the conflict and the lack of any credible peace process, the humanitarian outlook remains bleak, with needs that are expected to increase. Furthermore, the same conflict and instability is making it equally difficult for development programmes to achieve their objectives, notably to help the Government to provide a socio-economic environment that persuades Afghans to stay and build a future in Afghanistan.","Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia (Version 2 -16/03/2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/world/humanitarian-implementation-plan-hip-afghanistan-pakistan-iran-and-central-asia-version
11,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

12,afghanistan,"During the early days after the 9/11 attacks and the initiation of the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan it was relatively common to reference the woeful Soviet experience in that country. Here was a clear paradigm of what not to do in order to avoid getting stuck in a quagmire. Surely, American leaders would be more adroit. By employing advanced U.S. technology along with a more sensitive effort to win “hearts and minds,” the Taliban—what was left of it—would be quickly vanquished.

So much for that theory.

But it might be worth exploring yet again some historical aspects of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, 1979–1989, in order to shed some light, not only on the present predicament of the American war in Afghanistan, now lamentably in its sixteenth year , but perhaps also to gain some insights into contemporary Russian foreign policy and society too. A detailed appraisal covering the military aspects of the Soviet war appeared in the mid-April 2018 issue of the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the agreement on 14 April 1988 to withdraw all Soviet forces from Afghanistan. The writer of this interesting piece is the rather conservative but quite independent-minded Russian defense analyst Alexander Chramshikin. The piece appears under the headline “The Afghan Lesson for Russia: A Collision with Islamic Extremists Was Inevitable [Афганский урок для России: Столкновение с исламским экстремизмом было неизбежно].”

The author explains that there was misperception back then on both sides concerning the origins of the war. He notes that the Soviet leadership was seriously convinced that “American forces would invade Afghanistan in the near future [в Афганистан в ближайшее время начнется вторжение американских войск],” while Washington thought that Soviet forces were determined to drive all the way to the Persian Gulf in order to interfere with the transfer of oil supplies to the West. These assumptions were both completely wrong, of course, but Chramshikin says the assessment that the Americans got right was to seize the opportunity to “arrange for the Soviets their own Vietnam [устроить Советам свой Вьетнам].”

It is observed that the Soviet Army was completely unprepared to fight a counter-insurgency war. “It was a war without fronts and without a corresponding rear area [это война без фронта и соответственно без тыла].” Contact with the enemy could occur at any time and in any place. Weapons and tactics had been designed for Central Europe or the Far East, but not for mountainous Central Asia, and “All this led to many failures [Все это приводило к множеству неудач].” Assaults against Ahmed Shah Massoud’s partisan forces in the Panjshir Valley proved costly to Soviet forces again and again, “because all of the operational plans were received by Massoud in advance [поскольку все планы операций Масуд получал заранее].” To be sure, the Soviet brass tried to rectify the situation by giving transport vehicles additional armor and making sure their swivel guns could fire “almost vertically into the air” [почти вертикально вверх] to cope with ambushes in Afghanistan’s innumerable narrow valleys. Yet, it seems to be an immutable fact of counter-insurgency warfare that the insurgents have superior intelligence and understand the ground better.

The Soviets sought to innovate by developing a doctrine that focused on the use of helicopters and particularly the employment of special forces. Moreover, the new “main task was to be finding and interdicting convoys of arms coming from Pakistan [главной задачей стал поиск и разгром идущих из Пакистана караванов с оружием].” These strategic responses all sound familiar? There were some successes for Soviet forces. Chramshikin relates, for example, an episode at the end of 1984 when 220 partisans were killed in such an interdiction operation without losing any Soviet soldiers. But just a few months later, twenty-nine Soviet special forces soldiers were killed in a single battle. During the year 1985, Soviet forces lost eighteen aircraft and fifty-three helicopters, according to this analysis, and that was before the introduction of the Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles into the war. And that development, beginning in September 1986, “caused a sharp increase in losses, especially with respect to helicopters [привело к резкому росту потерь, особенно в вертолетах].” Despite such significant setbacks, Chramshikin claims that many thought that due to hard fighting in 1987 that the “Soviet Army could still completely win the war [Советская армия вполне может выиграть войну].”

In the end, Chramshikin concludes that the Kremlin could not sustain the war due to the “economic catastrophe” at home, but he also blames the advent of glasnost, which he says caused the Soviet society to turn actively against the war effort. He asserts that in this sense, the end of the Soviet war in Afghanistan was very similar to the end of the war in Vietnam. He describes the April 1988 agreement that ended the war as a “complete and unconditional capitulation of the USSR [это была полная и безоговорочная капитуляция СССР],” since he says that Washington and Islamabad did not even go through the motions of complying with their promises to stop aiding the partisans.

On our radar:

Yemen: A Twitter battle for Hodeidah

Let’s talk about Hodeidah — everyone else is, at least online. Late last month, Saudi officials (and a press release) said that Houthi rebels were “holding hostage” 19 ships in the waters outside Hodeidah, the Red Sea port that’s key to staving off famine in Yemen and is subject to an on-off blockade by the Saudi-led coalition. This, the Saudis said, prevented the ships from delivering fuel. A maritime tracking project jumped in via Twitter, saying that their data showed not only were the tankers delivering fuel and then departing from the port, but that the deliveries were more frequent than usual. “It seems that the more time we spend on tracking the [Hodeidah] tanker situation, the more bizarre it becomes,” the group, TankerTrackers.com, tweeted. Things got even weirder when YCHO, the coalition’s humanitarian operations in Yemen, used TankerTrackers’ data in a tweet to show that “there is no blockade on Yemen.” Confused? Here’s a handy summary from PRI. Oh, and now’s a good time to add that a battle for the port city – which would be disastrous for civilians — is still not out of the question. A senior Houthi official was recently killed nearby, apparently by a UAE drone, and we hear that the rumour mill is churning. We’ll keep you posted.

We've now identified and logged all of the vessels in question. Should they move, we'll know about it. They came in (for the most part) from the UAE via Djibouti, carrying fuel for the population, given it's collectively over 2.2M barrels. Saudis say Houthis blocked all 18. #OOTT pic.twitter.com/Zzm8W1ElN4 — TankerTrackers.com:oil_drum: (@TankerTrackers) April 21, 2018

Afghanistan: Who’s in control?

If Afghan officials need another worry, here’s one: in the past three years, government control over Afghanistan’s territory has steadily eroded as insurgent influence has climbed. That’s according to estimates from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, which was created by the US to monitor rebuilding efforts. Newly released figures offer a snapshot of the Afghan government’s unsteady grip on its own country: Militant groups including the Taliban and so-called Islamic State-aligned fighters now have control or influence in more than 14 percent of Afghanistan’s 407 districts, up from about 7 percent in November 2015, when SIGAR began tracking such things.

What does this mean for civilians, including the hundreds of thousands of refugees expected to return home – or to be pushed back home – this year? Afghans who have already returned find a country at war and their former homes in conflict zones, as we detailed this week from the border town of Spin Boldak. Recent returnees say they’re struggling with no land of their own, and no government plan to provide it. Others unable to return to their family homes head to rapidly multiplying tent settlements, where basic services are minimal or non-existent and humanitarian aid is often hard to come by.

Niger: Arrests in Agadez

Niger calls them mercenaries and wants them expelled. The UN reckons they were potential victims of slavery or extortion searching for safety. Either way, some 1,700 Sudanese refugees have left Libya for neighbouring Niger since December — moving south in search of more secure lives rather than north, a reversal of usual migration trends that was prompted by European Union efforts to stem migration. On 2 May, police in Agadez arrested around 150 Sudanese who were housed by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). It’s unclear why.

Journalist Eric Reidy was recently in Agadez reporting for us and said a number of refugees told him they’re worried that Niger’s government will deport them to Libya or Sudan. Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s interior minister, told Reidy that the Sudanese “came here because they expect to go to Europe.” None of the refugees Reidy spoke to in Agadez said that was their incentive. UNHCR says Niger is the only accessible, safe country for them right now. “Is there any corridor out of southern Libya that can offer… safety? No other corridor than Niger,” said Alessandra Morelli, UNHCR’s top official in the country.

Their presence is stoking fears that intensified conflict in southern Libya could lead to a large scale displacement crisis in northern Niger. Also in question is whether the UNHCR evacuation and resettlement mechanism for refugees trapped in Libyan detention centres is playing a role in drawing the Sudanese to Niger. Watch for our upcoming coverage, in which Reidy will explore these and other issues.

Myanmar: Lives upended, again

In January, we reported on early signs of renewed conflict in northern Myanmar, where clashes between the military and ethnic armed groups were quietly simmering – and civilians caught in the midst of things were out of the reach of aid organisations that face severe restrictions on access. Now, the conflict has escalated: in April alone, more than 5,000 civilians were displaced, and aid groups say recent clashes are the most extensive in years. This week, local and international humanitarian organisations called for a ceasefire and demanded that the government lift access restrictions. The UN’s rights watchdog for Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said she had “grave concerns” for the “sharp escalation in hostilities”. About 100,000 civilians have been displaced in northern Myanmar since 2011, when a ceasefire between the military and the Kachin Independence Army collapsed. They’ll likely soon be joined in long-term displacement by the 5,000 people whose lives were upended last month, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The prospect of quick returns, the federation said in a recent update, “is rather small”.







UAE: Undercurrents in Indian Ocean strategy

What do Yemen and Somalia have in common? If you said they’re home to some of the most vulnerable people on earth, you’d be right. The UN has estimated their combined humanitarian need at $4.5 billion for 2018. Their geo-strategic value might be an ingredient in their suffering, prompting international military involvement and political jockeying for influence. Which leads to another commonality: the UAE. The UAE’s Indian Ocean strategy appears to be in flux, with Yemen and Somalia playing (perhaps unwitting) roles.

In mid-April UAE pulled out of a military cooperation deal with Somalia, in a messy episode involving the looting of weapons and a planeload of $10 million in cash, according to Reuters. And this week, the UK’s Independent stated that the UAE is gradually taking over the Yemeni island of Socotra. Journalists who visited undercover say the UAE has already “all but annexed” the island, a poor, remote, and ecologically unique part of Yemen, off the coast of the Horn of Africa. Mainland Yemen has abandoned Socotra, the report notes, and the UAE’s ability to expand its influence was helped by the impact of cyclones in 2015. This week, the Gulf state further boosted its military presence there, according to Yemeni officials. Along with setting up a military base, the UAE has invested in social services and offers education and work opportunities in the Emirates. And the Independent adds that there may be plans for tourist resorts. It’s hard to gauge if there’s any resentment among residents of Socotra, but protests did break out when UAE officials tried to burn a shipment of qat, the stimulant leaf widely chewed all over the region. Oh, and in case you forgot: UAE is a key partner to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict.

Burundi: The human price of politics

Another vote, another call to boycott it, and fresh warnings that life may get tougher before it gets better for many in Burundi. Burundians go the polls on 17 May to vote on constitutional amendments that could see President Pierre Nkurunziza, who came to power in 2005, remain in office until 2034. The lingering effects of a devastating civil war that ended more than a decade ago, a moribund economy, a violent political crisis, and foreign aid cuts have conspired to leave one in four of Burundi’s citizens in need of humanitarian aid. Our analysis examines the toll the political tensions leading up to and perhaps following the 17 May poll may exact on Burundi’s people. And, as we’ll report next week, the growing tensions are adding to the anxiety of 170,000 Burundian long-term refugees in neighbouring Tanzania. They face increasing pressure to return despite promises of citizenship from a once-welcoming country, where many of them have spent their entire lives. One last thing before you read our analysis: In an announcement that just happened to follow World Press Freedom Day (see below), Burundi officials said local-language re-broadcasts by VOA and BBC are on hold for six months, according to a tweet from the state broadcaster, further limiting public access to information in the runup to the referendum.

Keep in mind:

Calling all humanitarian scholars

If you study humanitarian issues, this one’s for you: 1 June is the deadline to submit papers for the field’s leading academic conference, to be held 27-28 August in the Hague. The theme of the World Conference on Humanitarian Studies is “(Re-)Shaping Boundaries in Crisis and Crisis Response” — boundaries both symbolic and literal, obvs. Four themes and 60 panels (think “datafication” to “social museology”) will guide the proceedings at the fifth bi-annual gathering. What might all this achieve? There’s a panel for that: “What do Practitioners Really Need from Academics?”

And finally:

World Press Freedom Day: Horror and hope

We’re always humbled to mark World Press Freedom Day, with reminders of just how difficult it is for so many people to access fact-based, impartial information and how perilous it can be to report that information. A harsh reminder came shortly before the day was marked on Thursday, when a 30 April suicide blast killed nine journalists in Kabul, including veteran AFP photographer Shah Marai. The journalists were covering the aftermath of an earlier bombing when a second attacker struck. Marai’s images from his native Afghanistan gave the world a window onto life through civil war, Taliban rule and today’s instability. In a 2016 essay re-published after his death, Marai spoke frankly about life in Afghanistan, 15 years after the Taliban’s ouster. “There is no more hope,” he wrote: “… I have never felt life to have so little prospects and I don’t see a way out.” This New York Times piece offers more on Marai and his images. Our hope lies in the continued work of journalists around the world.

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks with Seth Jones, director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies about ISIS and Afghanistan.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:

In the longest-running U.S. war, there were two deadly attacks in the last two weeks in Kabul, Afghanistan, both claimed by ISIS as the Afghan government attempts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table. This latest attack - twin suicide bombings killed at least 25 people, including several journalists. The attacks were coordinated, so the second bomb went off as reporters and photographers arrived on the scene. We're joined now by Seth Jones. He's the director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies to talk about ISIS and Afghanistan. Welcome to the program.

SETH JONES: It's great to be on. Thanks for having me.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: We always hear about the Taliban in Afghanistan, but tell us who these ISIS fighters are. Are they former Taliban? Are they survivors from the campaigns in Iraq and Syria?

JONES: The vast majority of this - of these ISIS members are actually former Pakistan Taliban. They're individuals that defected in 2014 and 2015, and they migrated over to the Islamic State or ISIS.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's dig down here. I'd like to talk about their tactics, first of all. I mean, they're targeting civilians and, specifically, it seems, journalists. This isn't new, necessarily. But is that something that they're known for?

JONES: Unlike other more indigenous groups to Afghanistan - like the Taliban, which generally tries not to kill civilians, at least as much as possible - ISIS in Afghanistan has done exactly the opposite. Much like their brethren in Iraq and Syria, anybody is game.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: How big a threat are they? Have they eclipsed the Taliban?

JONES: Well, I think one has to put ISIS in Afghanistan into perspective. They are not a populist movement. They don't have a large support base either among Afghans or a large number of fighters. U.S. estimates are down in the 2-to-3,000 realm, which is an order of magnitude lower than the Taliban. But what they're willing to do is to conduct high-profile attacks against Afghan and international targets in cities like Jalalabad and Kabul. And that makes them certainly a threat, but it doesn't make them a threat to overthrow the Kabul regime.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is there coordination between the Taliban, or are they rivals?

JONES: They're predominantly rivals. In fact, there was a branch in 2015 of ISIS in Afghanistan in Farah and Helmand provinces. And they were actually former Afghan Taliban members. And what the Taliban did to them is largely decimated them through a range of set-piece battles and then targeted assassinations. They compete with each other over ideology, over target sets, over recruits. So in general, they are in a very competitive battle right now.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me a little bit about their different ideologies and aims, these two groups that are contesting each other.

JONES: If you read the propaganda, for example, of ISIS, what they'll say is they consider the Taliban regime to be one that only views creating an emirate within state boundaries, within Afghanistan. What ISIS really wants to do is create a Pan-Islamic caliphate not within specific boundaries but across a wide region. They also target Shia in ways that the Afghan Taliban don't.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: What does it say that ISIS is now in Afghanistan? I mean, what does it say about where we are now in this very long-running conflict?

JONES: Well, I think the fact that ISIS is still in Afghanistan tells us at least two things. One is that it does have staying power, even in places like Afghanistan. The U.S. and the Taliban have been attempting to target ISIS in Afghanistan for at least the last 2 1/2 years, and they have survived - and not just survived, but they've conducted a number of very high-profile attacks. It also says that any U.S. statements that ISIS, whether it's in Iraq or Syria, has been crushed - to use the words in the U.S. national security strategy - are way too early to say. I mean, the organization will almost certainly continue to operate in Iraq and Syria, as well as in countries like Afghanistan, Egypt, Nigeria and Libya. So this one is not over.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, thank you very much.

JONES: Thank you very much.

17,afghanistan,"Authorities blame Taliban, MEA in touch with Kabul for engineers’ rescue

Smita Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, May 6

Seven Indian engineers were abducted from northern Baghlan province of Afghanistan on Sunday morning. The men, as per unconfirmed reports, were travelling in a minibus when they were taken hostage by unidentified assailants near Bagh-e-Shamal village in Pul-e-Khomre city, the capital of Baghlan province. While no group has taken responsibility so far for the abduction, international news agencies quoted Baghlan authorities as blaming the Taliban. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said: “We are aware of the abduction of Indian nationals from Baghlan province. We are in contact with the Afghan authorities and further details are being ascertained.” The abducted engineers are working for KEC, an Indian company with the RPG group that was awarded a contract in 2013 to erect a 220-KV transmission line between Chimtala and Kabul. KEC has collaborated with the government-run Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) that operates power stations in the war-torn country. RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka reached out to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on social media, seeking help for the rescue of the abducted men. With its over $2 billion assistance towards rebuilding Afghanistan, India is involved in several infrastructure projects, including construction of dams, highways and other buildings. An estimated 150 Indian engineers and technical experts are involved in various projects on the ground. Afghan media house Tolo news quoted Baghlan governor Abdulhai Nemati as saying that the Indians were mistaken for government employees and efforts were on to release them “through tribe elders and mediation”. Sources also, meanwhile, asked the media to exercise caution in reporting so as not to “hamper efforts at successful resolution of the crisis”. There have been instances of Indians getting kidnapped in Afghanistan in the past in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, with the release of hostages secured in most cases. In 2016, an Indian aid worker kidnapped in Kabul was released after 40 days.

When Mohammad Shah realized his family would never be able to afford the $15,000 demanded by his fiancee's father for a traditional Afghan wedding, he turned to the one group he knew would help: the Islamic State.The 23-year-old left his village in the northern province of Jowzjan about four months ago to join the militant group, which has seen a recent influx of foreign fighters bolster its presence in Afghanistan. Soon afterward, Shah and other Islamic State fighters stormed his fiancee's house and kidnapped her at gunpoint. They later married in a ceremony at a mosque.""I'm really not happy with what my son did,"" said Jamaluddin, Shah's father, who fled his home in the district of Darzab to escape the Islamic State and now lives in a single, unbaked-brick room in Sheberghan, the provincial capital. ""I have never heard from him since -- he's not my son anymore.""The episode shows how Islamic State is replenishing its ranks in Afghanistan as fighters from a range of nations regroup after leaving battlefields in Syria and Iraq. Besides helping Afghan men marry in exchange for their loyalty, the group is terrorizing locals by closing schools, beheading enemies and kidnapping young women and girls to serve as sex slaves.The influx of foreign Islamic State fighters complicates President Donald Trump's efforts to end the 17-year conflict that has cost the U.S an estimated $714 billion. Trump last year said 16,000 U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan indefinitely to deny terrorists a haven and support President Ashraf Ghani's attempts to negotiate peace with the Taliban, a home-grown group that controls and contests nearly half of the country.While U.S. officials say the Islamic State has suffered losses over the past few months -- including Qari Hikmatullah, its leader in northern Afghanistan -- the group still has the capacity to carry out brutal attacks. Islamic State claimed responsibility for back-to-back bombings in the capital Kabul on Monday that killed 29 people -- including nine journalists -- in the deadliest strike on Afghanistan's media since 2001.The Islamic State's recent growth in Jowzjan is partly due to U.S. efforts to target the group's stronghold in Nangarhar, an eastern province bordering Pakistan, according to a State Department official who asked not to be identified discussing the sensitive information. Still, the official said the U.S. is focused on countering the group's recruiting efforts, particularly among poor villagers.As many as 600 Islamic State militants -- including 150 foreigners from Sudan to China to France -- are fighting coalition and Afghan forces and training new recruits in Jowzjan, said police chief Faqir Mohammad Jowzjani. They operate in deep tunnels to avoid air strikes and live in hidden rock homes in the mountains of Darzab district, he said.The bulk of them arrived via Pakistan in recent months, adding to 3,000 Islamic State fighters already based in Afghanistan, Jowzjani said. Most came after the group released a propaganda video in March telling soldiers in Syria and Iraq -- and sympathizers elsewhere -- to migrate to Afghanistan and Pakistan.""If Daesh remains here for the long term, it's possible it could build a new caliphate,"" Jowzjani said in an interview at his office in Sheberghan, using the Arabic name for Islamic State. ""They are boosted by the arrival of the foreigners, which suggest Daesh here has a direct link with bosses in Syria and Iraq.""Islamic State fighters, which first gained a foothold in Nangarhar in 2015, spread out to other districts in Afghanistan after the U.S. dropped its biggest non-nuclear bomb on their caves a year ago. The group controls or contests several districts in eastern and southern Afghanistan, in addition to two districts in Jowzjan -- where the Taliban has about twice as many men.Meanwhile the Taliban -- the country's main insurgent faction -- took over the Kohistan district of the northern province of Badakhshan on Friday after several days of fighting with Afghan forces, Sanaullah Ruhani, a spokesman of the province's police said by phone. The group started its annual spring offensive last month in an apparent rebuff of Ghani's unprecedented peace offer.Local officials can't do much to stem the rise of militant groups. Afghanistan's military suffered a ""sharp decline"" in numbers last year, losing about 10 percent of its troops, according to a report released Monday by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.""The government does not have sufficient military personnel to stamp them out,"" Lotfullah Azizi, governor of Jowzjan province, said in an interview at his office. ""If they weren't beaten, for sure, it will be a very serious danger which can threaten the survival of the whole province and the northern provinces.""'Everyone's Frightened'The Islamic State has built training camps in Darzab and is recruiting unemployed locals, mostly men under 20. Some join for survival, some are lured by the group's ideals and others are hired guns who run extortion, smuggling or kidnapping rackets. Foreigners serve as trainers and advisers, Jowzjani said.In Darzab, Islamic State shut down and burnt around 40 schools, depriving around 30,000 students from education. Islamist fighters have gone from house to house in insisting families reveal how many daughters they have. Four daughters? Four flags must be flown.About 15 percent of the district's 70,000 families have fled to neighboring provinces and the outskirts of Sheberghan city about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away. The Uzbek-dominated outpost of about 170,000 people near the Turkmenistan border is an important trading post where locals import vehicles, medicine and food.""Everyone is frightened here"" said Naeem Jamal, 32, a shopkeeper in the city. ""Daesh is more aggressive than the Taliban and has no pity for anyone.""Mubarak Shah fled to Sheberghan five months ago after a group of Islamic State fighters wearing black turbans broke into his house after midnight and kidnapped his two daughters, ages 16 and 18. The 48-year-old shopkeeper couldn't find them despite enlisting the help of tribal elders and mullahs, and now assumes they were sold as sex slaves. ""I felt so guilty because I was helpless to save my lovely kids,"" he said, crying. ""They have kidnapped lots of young girls even aged 12 to serve them sexually.

While Ghani was rolling out the cards at a ceremony in his palace, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah declared at a news conference that the disputed design of the ID card “has not received the needed legitimacy and support from the Afghan people.” Such a “one-sided decision,” he said, can only lead to “more problems.”

The main point of contention has been the use of the word “Afghan” on the cards to refer to all Afghan citizens. The word was historically synonymous with Pash­tuns, the country’s largest ethnic group. Other groups, especially the second-most-numerous Tajiks, have objected that using “Afghan” would politically benefit Pashtuns.

The debut of the IDs, which was held up for several years by ethnic disputes and technical problems, came just six months ahead of scheduled parliamentary elections. A presidential contest is due to follow next year. Ghani is expected to run for reelection, and it is unclear whether Abdullah will back his rival or run against him for a second time.

The pre-election period has been plagued by other problems, including insurgent violence and low turnout for ID-card registration, that have left many Afghans worried that credible and safe elections cannot be held this year. Fraud marred the past two elections, and the 2014 contest between Ghani and Abdullah was so discredited that the two finally agreed to share power.

In the past month, two insurgent bombing episodes rocked the capital and took more than 75 lives. On April 22, a suicide bomber on foot detonated in a crowd of people waiting to apply for their ID cards, killing 57 and wounding scores. On Monday, two back-to-back suicide bombings in a ­high-security zone killed 25, including nine Afghan journalists who had rushed to the scene.

With concerns growing over election security and political stability, experts are debating whether it would be worse to have another high-risk, fraud-marred election or none at all. The consensus appears to be that it would be worse to have no elections because that would leave the power-sharing executive and the legislature in a state of legal limbo and foster public disenchantment.

Still, the high-level rift over the electronic ID cards has sabotaged hopes that the creation of a foolproof voting document would lead to more credible results — and help resolve protracted fights over the size of each ethnic group, by allowing people to choose among 15 groups to identify them on their cards.

The creation of a fair, inclusive and biometrically secure card was one of the first tasks set out by the national unity government, brokered by the United States after the 2014 contest collapsed. But three years and many delays later, the fight over what information should be on the card is ongoing.

Now the contradictory positions taken by Ghani, a Pashtun, and Abdullah, who is half-Pashtun and half-Tajik but is allied with a Tajik-based party, seem likely to exacerbate the feuding that has long divided the country into regional fiefdoms led by ethnic strongmen and has prevented a more modern democratic party system from taking root.

The disagreement is also likely to further discourage people from registering, even in urban centers that in theory are safer than rural regions under insurgent control. In the first two weeks that applications for voter IDs were open last month, a little more than half a million people signed up, while the potential number of eligible voters is estimated at more than 12 million.

“This . . . may turn into an ethnic crisis, and it will be a big opportunity for those who are playing ethnic cards,” said Najib Mahmoud, a scholar of law and political science. Such a development, he said, “would be a disaster for the country.”

20,afghanistan,"General Objective

The overall objective of the assessment is to inform the response of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster for the ongoing dry spell in Afghanistan. The assessment aims at supporting the Cluster to better identify target population groups, priority areas and relevant interventions.

Specific Objective(s)

• Identify how population groups have been affected differently by the dry spell to better target interventions.

• Identify which areas are most affected by the dry spell, to inform geographic prioritization at the district level, beyond the initial provincial-level prioritization method1 • Identify the main coping mechanisms used by households to mitigate the impact of the dry spell.

• Identify the appropriate modalities of response for different population groups.

Research Questions

What are the districts that have been more impacted by the 2018 winter dry spell? How has the dry spell affected populations groups differently within the community, inclusive of men, women, boys and girls, as well as those dependent on agriculture or livelihoods, and in urban and rural settings? What are appropriate modalities of assistance relevant in the different dryspell affected settings? What are the current and expected coping strategies used by affected households to mitigate the implications of the dry spell?

2. Background & Rationale

Afghanistan is highly dependent on livestock and agriculture. Moreover, a large proportion of the population has faced multiple displacements, with conflict and returnee influxes expected to carry on throughout 2018. The winter wet season is a critical period throughout the year for harnessing successful food production and agricultural inputs for the entire year, as well as for replenishing community water sources. However, compared to national multi-year averages and based on actualized rainfall, the winter wet season for 2017/2018 has been uncharacteristically dry due to La Nina conditions. This dryness indicates an impending humanitarian crisis with those dependent on limited water resources as well as communities reliant on agriculture and livestock are also likely to face significant WASH concerns in the upcoming months, facing critical conditions in July to September 2018.

Accordingly, contingency planning by the WASH Cluster is essential and ongoing. As part of the contingency planning, this assessment is to inform the Cluster and its partners on the way in which vulnerable communities and households can be identified. This is critical in facilitating an efficient and effective response. It is for this reason that REACH and the WASH Cluster are collaborating to conduct this assessment, that compares the ways in which vulnerable households can be identified and recognise the different coping mechanisms in place between households in informal settlements, where access to WASH resources are limited, and at CDC level in both urban and rural areas, where WASH-based vulnerabilities differ depending on reliance on agriculture and livestock. Together this supports contingency planning and prioritization of the WASH Cluster, provides advocacy tools to support funding for the crisis and encourages effective beneficiary selection by WASH partners in the field.","Research Terms of Reference: Afghanistan Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Dry Spell Assessment - REACH Support to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster Information Management, Afghanistan",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/research-terms-reference-afghanistan-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-dry-spell
21,afghanistan,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A bomb blast inside a mosque in eastern Afghanistan that was being used as a voter registration center killed at least 14 people and wounded 33, officials said on Sunday.

Talib Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Khost, said that there was one female among those killed in the attack. ""The blast happened while people were busy with prayers, meanwhile in other part of the mosque people had gathered to get their voter registration cards for the election,"" he added.

Afghanistan plans to hold elections in October, the first since 2014.

Habib Shah Ansari, the provincial head of public health, also confirmed the toll from the attack in the city of Khost, the capital of the province of the same name.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the group's involvement. ""We reject any kind of involvement in this incident,"" he said.

Both the Taliban and a local affiliate of the Islamic State group reject democratic elections and have targeted them in the past. IS is not known to have a presence in Khost, but has expanded its footprint into other areas in recent years.

Last month, an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a voter registration center in Kabul, killing 60 people and wounding at least 130 others.

The Taliban and IS have launched a relentless wave of attacks since the start of the year, killing scores of civilians in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere. Afghan security forces have struggled to combat the groups since the U.S. and NATO concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014, switching to a counterterrorism and support role.

Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a vehicle carrying shopkeepers on their way to a market struck a roadside bomb in Afghanistan's northern Faryab province, killing seven of them. Police spokesman Karim Yuresh said another civilian was wounded in Sunday's attack, in an area where both the Taliban and IS are active.

In the eastern Paktia province, a car bomb killed two people and wounded another three. Abdullah Hsart, the provincial governor's spokesman, said the attack late Saturday targeted Hazart Mohammad Rodwal, a district chief, who was among the wounded. The Taliban claimed the attack.","Bombing at mosque in Afghanistan kills 14, wounds 33",https://newsok.com/bombing-at-mosque-in-afghanistan-kills-12-wounds-33/article/feed/2156849
22,afghanistan,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continued to remain grave in 2017 despite a reduction in needs at the mid-year mark from 9.3 million to 7.4 million. By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar province which registered a 310 percent increase in the numbers of internally displaced over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) and coalition forces’ escalating campaign to defeat non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the eastern region. Soaring suicide attacks and airstrikes – which increased by 50 percent and 68 percent respectively on 2016 – as well as more targeted NSAG assaults on military checkpoints and infrastructure also contributed to rising trauma cases.

Although overall civilian casualties decreased by 9 percent, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured). As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 percent of all civilian casualties. Unlike in 2016, however, when ground engagements comprised the largest proportion of deaths and injuries, combined improvised explosive device (IED) tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – accounted for 40 percent (4,151) of the total, highlighting the dangers posed to the population by NSAGs who, under increasing military pressure in the regions, are now resorting to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 included the forced closure of healthcare facilities by NSAGs as part of efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants, and which denied up to 1.4 million people (65 percent of them female) from access to essential services at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed or inactive due to the conflict according to the Ministry of Education. In order to address these issues and facilitate the creation of a protective environment in which Afghans are safe and free to go about their lives without fear of violence or harm, the protection cluster, in consultation with the HCT and ICCT, is developing a protection strategy in early 2018 to promote measures which support the reduction of civilian casualties and increase compliance with International Humanitarian Law / International Human Rights Law. These include the development of action plans and related advocacy to support the implementation of the National Policy on Civilian Casualty Prevention and Mitigation and the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, both recently endorsed by the government.

Despite initial projections of 1 million returns from Pakistan in 2017, an improved protection environment saw the arrival of just 156,140 Afghans in 2017 (98,140 undocumented returnees and 58,000 registered refugees). The decision of the Federal Cabinet of Pakistan in January 2018 to nevertheless issue the first ever 30-day extension of Proof of Registration cards to 1.4 million Afghan refugees prompted fears that a mass return was possible, if not imminent, and led to the development of an inter-cluster contingency plan to support 700,000 returnees with immediate humanitarian assistance totaling USD 198 million. Despite the Cabinet’s subsequent extension of PoR cards to 30 June 2018, the situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities. Partners on both sides of the border are currently monitoring the protection space for any signs of deterioration. While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, the tendency for existing returnee populations to settle in and around Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province – when combined with the significant numbers of internally displaced – has led to a doubling of the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66). As of November, more than 750,000 displaced populations lived in informal settlements in Nangarhar province, up from 429,000 in February, two thirds of which are concentrated in the two districts of Behsud and Sukhrod.

While natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected (a 20 percent reduction), the arrival of the La Niña weather effect at the end of 2017 has led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping season, leaving as many as 1 million people at risk of exposure to drought. In response, the ICCT has developed a contingency plan to provide emergency assistance (both in-kind and in cash) – totaling USD 110.4 million – to the most vulnerable households living across the 20 worst affected provinces.

Overall in 2017, humanitarian partners delivered life-saving assistance to 4.1 million people affected by conflict and natural disasters, sudden population movement and the effects of decades of underdevelopment and chronic poverty.

Humanitarian assistance was primarily delivered through medical care to the war wounded; emergency survival supplies of food, water and shelter to displaced and returnee populations, including multi-purpose cash grants (of which USD 35.9 million was disbursed) and sectoral support such as cash for food and cash for rent. As in previous years, humanitarian resources were also dedicated towards gapfilling for the provision of basic services, including healthcare and nutrition, with funds primarily targeted towards the 9 million people – approximately 40 percent of the population – affected by insufficient coverage of nationally-led systems or living in conflict-affected white areas.

Overall, the HRP received USD 320.7 million in committed funds representing 78 percent of overall requirements, making it the second highest funded HRP globally. As in previous years, the well-defined parameters of the plan, which focused on the provision of life-saving assistance, continued to resonate with donors who recognise the ongoing need for immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to be provided to populations for whom no alternative lifeline exists. The dedicated use of the 2nd CHF allocation 2017 to improve humanitarian response in hard to reach areas also helped to address existing imbalances in assistance provided to crisis-affected populations living in government and nongovernment held areas, the latter of which have typically been underserved in Afghanistan. During the year, humanitarian partners implemented programmes in almost 50 percent of all hard to reach districts (100) reaching more than 240,000 people in the process with emergency relief and protection assistance.

Despite these successes, a number of challenges remained.

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016 – when an unprecedented 675,000 were forced to flee their home – challenges with the existing IDP petition system led to some delays in the provision of emergency assistance and concerns that alternative models of IDP identification may be required in the future. At the same time, continued internal displacement, combined with ongoing returnee influxes, have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people residing in informal settlements, reinforcing the need for durable solutions which support reintegration, including the allocation of land and adequate housing and for which finalisation of an Executive Decree is still pending.

Indeed, with both short and long-term objectives now being pursued in parallel, Afghanistan is a defining example of the humanitarian-development nexus. Moving forward, it will therefore be a test of the humanitarian community’s ability to work in close cooperation with all relevant actors (including the UN, NGOs, development partners, the World Bank and donors), and with the government at both national and regional levels, to define collective outcomes and integrated responses, through multi-year joint planning which reduce needs, vulnerability and risk while at the same time building resilience.","Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 Year-End Report of Financing, Achievements and Response Challenges (January - December 2017)",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2017-year-end-report-financing

24,afghanistan,"NEW DELHI: India and China are likely to identify projects in areas of health, education and food security that the two countries can jointly undertake in Afghanistan, following discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at the recent Wuhan Summit.The two sides may soon hold a standalone dialogue for identifying projects in Afghanistan, people aware of the matter told ET. They said the plan is to identify projects that would improve lives of Afghan citizens and pave the way for a joint Indo-Afghan connectivity project through Afghanistan connecting China with Iran in the future.However, the proposed connectivity project is unlikely to be included in China’s Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) owing to India’s strong reservations against the mega project that seeks to connect Asia’s biggest country with the rest of the continent, Africa and Europe.Afghans require support in health, education and food security as they are fighting both Taliban and the Islamic State. India has been providing support to Afghanistan in healthcare and education for several years. Since last year the country has been supplying wheat to Afghanistan through Iran’s Chabahar Port India and China could look at a Sino-Indian connectivity project through Afghanistan after the two sides kick-start development projects, said one of the persons cited earlier.The two countries have twice held bilateral dialogue on the Afghan situation and both are also part of several multilateral fora on Afghanistan. In 2010, India and China had agreed to launch a joint project in Afghanistan, but there was no forward movement.Meanwhile, India and USA have undertaken joint projects in Afghanistan and, last year, co-hosted an entrepreneurship meet there. India and Russia have also been involved in a dialogue over the situation in Afghanistan.As decided in 2017 India will undertake 116 high impact community development projects in 31 provinces of Afghanistan. These investments will be in the areas of education, health, agriculture, irrigation, drinking water, renewable energy, flood control, micro-hydro power, sports and administrative infrastructure. The government has also decided that ongoing programmes for education, capacity building, skills and human resource development of Afghanistan, one of the largest such programmes in the world, will continue for a further period of five years from 2017 to 2022.While the proposed joint projects will be the first such initiative by India and China in a third country in South Asia, the two sides have partnered for joint hydrocarbon projects in Sudan, Syria and Colombia.","India, China likely to jointly undertake projects in Afghanistan",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-china-likely-to-jointly-undertake-projects-in-afghanistan/articleshow/64057491.cms
