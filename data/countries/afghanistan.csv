0,afghanistan,"President Ashraf Ghani said he is optimistic to end the 40 years of crisis in the country as he pointed to ongoing efforts for a national consensus on a peace plan.

“The national consensus for peace will be implemented,” Ghani said. “The people who think they can damage the national will (for peace) should rethink about peace. The way that the country comes to a consensus on will be followed until we achieve peace,” said Ghani.

In the meantime, Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar at a press conference in Kabul said he has offered a peace plan to government and that the plan is now on the table of President Ghani and senior US officials.

Based on the plan, he said, a political office should be opened for the Taliban in Kabul and then parts of the country should be handed over to the group as safe zones where they will live with their families.

“Taliban leaders and their families should live in non-war zones which are far from military personnel and are safe. Facilities should be provided for them, rockets should not be fired on them and should not be under prosecution,” Hekmatyar said.

Government has rejected any plan on handing some parts of the country as safe zones to the Taliban. Taliban has also condemned the plan, claiming that it will disintegrate Afghanistan and that it is something against their will.

Hekmatyar however said his plan is being discussed in the Pentagon and the White House.

“In a meeting where other officials were also present, I talked with president (Ashraf Ghani) in this regard and explained the plan. He agreed with most articles of the plan, except one part… which is the regions (safe zones) that he (President Ghani) might take the final decision on it after consulting with other officials,” he said.

The Afghan government announced a without precondition peace offer to Taliban last month in the second Kabul Process conference to bring the group to negotiations table. However, Taliban has not officially responded to the offer so far.

Some Afghans meanwhile said Taliban can join the peace process, but no province or region should be handed to them, because “they have killed manypeople”.

""Peace should be made with Taliban, but provinces should not be given to them,"" Kandahar resident Nazir Ahmad said.

""Taliban has carried out suicide attacks, explosions and has killed many people. Thus the areas should not be given to them,” Kabul resident Ahmad Farid said.",Ghani Optimistic To End 40-Year Crisis In Afghanistan,https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/ghani-optimistic-end-40-year-crisis-afghanistan

A Cycle of Return, Displacement and Migration

When Mohammad Afshar poured a can of fuel over himself and fumbled with the box of matches he was determined to end his life. This was on 15 November 2017. The father of 12 children and husband to two wives had exhausted all means to provide for his family and hardship seemed just too much to bear. He had sold one of his sons for Afs5,000 Afghani (US$80) to buy food, another son had died when the walls of the house collapsed under heavy snow and two daughters had frozen to death because he couldn’t afford enough blankets to keep them warm in winter.

A few weeks before the incident, he planned to sell their youngest daughter but was stopped only by his wife: “I would rather all of us die, than lose another one of my children”, she said. That was the moment he had decided to end his life in protest in front of the District Governor who visited the village. Only the quick reaction of bystanders who took the matches from his fingers foiled his plan.

Within days of their arrival in Afghanistan, they became internally displaced before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, Mohammad Afshar worked as a farmer on his land in his village in Takhar Province. In 1998, he and his family moved to Quetta in Pakistan to escape Taliban rule. “I found a job in a brick factory as a daily worker,” he remembers. “My income was decent and we were happy.”

But in 2016, after 18 years in Pakistan where he never tried to obtain or was asked for any kind of documentation, the harassment and extortion by Pakistani police reached their peak. He decided to return to Afghanistan.

When he arrived back in his old village in Takhar, the family’s house had been destroyed and the fields had been taken over by armed men. Having spent many years in exile he did not have the necessary support in the community to reclaim his property.

He and his family left the village and moved to another district into an abandoned building without doors or windows. Within days of their arrival in their home country, Mohammad Afshar and his family had joined the ranks of internally displaced people (IDPs).

One quarter of all returnees know they cannot return to their home villages Mohammad Afshar is not an isolated case: more than 100,000 Afghan IDPs and returnees currently live in improvised shelters, tents or under open sky, with more than 51,000 in Nangarhar province alone. This according to the latest results of IOM Afghanistan’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Baseline Mobility Assessments, conducted in December 2017 in 15 provinces of highest return and displacement.

Last year, one quarter of all returnees from Pakistan arrived in Afghanistan with no intention of returning to their province of origin. This is up from just over one fifth in the previous year. Of significant note, 67 per cent of Afghan returnees in 2017 with roots in Kunar Province had no intention to return to Kunar, where conflict has intensified in the past months and members of the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) are trying to gain influence. Among these, 86 per cent decided to settle in Nangarhar Province instead, notably in and around Jalalabad City.

“Insecurity is not the only reason for post-return displacement,” explains Michael Speir, IOM Afghanistan’s DTM Coordinator. “As in the case of Mohammad Afshar, many Afghan families who have lived abroad for decades only discover upon their return that their houses have been destroyed and their land taken away. Stripped of their homes and any opportunities to secure their living, these people have no other option but to seek alternative places to live.”

Lack of opportunities and services in rural areas furthers urbanization

Reasons why Afghans can’t return to their places of origin, especially in rural areas, include a lack of job opportunities and social services, such as schools, health facilities or markets.

More than 700,000 returnees and IDPs in the 15 assessed provinces reported to have no access to education, almost two million don’t have access to a doctor, and more than 1.5 million don’t have access to a market to buy and sell goods, including food items, according to IOM’s latest DTM results (see graph).

Mohammad Afshar’s case also explains the trend of urbanization in Afghanistan. “Before he left Afghanistan two decades ago, Mohammad Afshar was a farmer,” notes Speir. “When he moved to Quetta in Pakistan, the urban labour market required a different skill set. Then, upon return to his rural village in Takhar, there was no need for his urban ‘daily labor’ skills acquired in Pakistan. Ultimately, with no access to his former land and faded farming skills, he really struggled to ensure the survival of his family in rural Takhar.

Sadly, the extreme coping mechanism of selling his children was his last resort.” Lack of shelter, job opportunities and no school for returnees to Afghanistan Another case is that of Zabihullah and his family who also lived in Pakistan for many years. “One day, a representative from the Government of Afghanistan came to our camp and told us that if we return, we will be given shelter and jobs. Because the harassment in Pakistan was getting worse, I decided to bring my wife and five children back to our home district in Baghlan,” he explains. ”But there were no shelters and no job opportunities.” His children were not even able to go to school, because he could not provide the required certification.

When the tent that the family was forced to live in was washed away in a flash flood, Zabihullah was lucky to save all his family members, but lost most of his belongings. Zabihullah has decided to return to Pakistan, despite renewed uncertainty over the fate of Afghan citizens living in Pakistan.

Returnees at risk of cyclical, unsafe migration movements

“This is exactly what we don’t want to happen – cyclical, unsafe migration movements, because people get pushed from province to province, or from country to country,” says IOM Afghanistan’s Chief of Mission, Laurence Hart.

“Migration movements in Afghanistan have become coping mechanisms. The more often Afghans are forced to migrate, the more vulnerable they become, and the less likely it gets that they will be able to reintegrate,” the head of IOM Afghanistan explains.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 73 | 1 – 28 February 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-73-1-28-february-2018

3,afghanistan,"KABUL (TCA) — Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in a television interview over the weekend that the US is responsible for the death of Afghans and is behind the Afghan crisis and that only Russia can help Afghanistan, TOLOnews reports.

Speaking to Russia’s NTV, Karzai said countries such as the US and the UK cannot help Afghanistan in its anti-terror efforts.

Only Russia can help Afghanistan in counterterrorism efforts, not the United States that have been killing Afghans for the past 17 years and is behind Afghanistan crisis, Karzai said.

“Neither the Brits, who we have kicked out of the country several times, nor the Americans (can help Afghanistan) as they've been killing us for 17 years; only Russia can (help). We (Afghanistan) are the last barrier from terrorists. We've been fighting continuously for a century and a half. If you (Russia) create new relationships with Pakistan and Afghanistan, you can help,” said Karzai.

Karzai went on to say the US used Afghanistan in the war against the Soviet Union and also created al-Qaeda in military camps in Pakistan.

“Americans lie when they say that al-Qaeda emerged as the result of your [Russia’s] invasion. They used the war to develop al-Qaeda in military camps in Pakistan. They wanted to be the only superpower and they did it. The USSR collapsed and one of the reasons was the Afghan war,” Karzai said.

4,afghanistan,"KABUL (TCA) — In a meeting with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani on April 8, Uzbekistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Ismatilla Irgashev said his country had decided to reduce the price of electricity exported to Afghanistan from the current 8.5 US dollar cents to 5 cents per kWh, TOLOnews reported.

“Ismatilla Irgashev, Uzbekistan’s special envoy to Afghanistan in his meeting with the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan pledged to reduce the current 8.5 cents electricity price to 5 cents and the new prices will come into effect from July,” the Afghan presidential palace said in a statement on Monday.



According to the statement, another 1,000 megawatts of power will come through Uzbekistan’s Surkhan region to Baghlan province to Kabul, which will help overcome electricity shortages.

“It is important to mention that a 70 megawatt transmission line will be connected to Jalalabad while the actual capacity of the line is about 300 megawatts. To some extent electricity shortages have also been resolved in northern provinces and the logistical process of supplying electricity to the central regions of the country is in the implementation phase,” the statement concluded.



Meanwhile, officials of power company Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) have welcomed the move by Uzbekistan, saying the process will have a significant impact on electricity prices in the country.



Currently, Afghanistan imports 300 megawatts of electricity from Uzbekistan.



“In the middle of 2018, the price of electricity will be reduced from 7.5 cents to 5 cents and this will enable us to purchase 300 megawatts of electricity at 5 cents,” said DABS spokesman Wahidullah Tawhidi.

“Those are that mishaps that occurred,” McKenzie continued. “We are going to look at each one in turn. Each one is tragic. We regret each one. I’m certainly not prepared to say it’s a wave of mishaps or some form of crisis.”

11,afghanistan,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A photograph of an Afghan woman nursing her baby while writing a university entrance exam has sparked a global campaign to help her further her education in a country where women and girls are regularly discriminated against.

Jahantab Ahmadi attracted widespread attention after an official at Nasir Khusraw University in the central city of Nili posted a picture of her on social media last month.

It showed Ahmadi sitting in the shade of another woman’s chair, cradling her young child while completing a paper.

The image touched the British-based Afghan Youth Association (AYA), which started a GoFundMe campaign to help her and has so far raised nearly 11,000 pounds ($15,548).

The group said it planned to take the money to Ahmadi, who has since been given a place at Kabul University.

“I think it will inspire many people, and hopefully it will motivate other women - show them that if you’re committed, nothing can stop you,” said AYA secretary Shokryah Mohammadi.

“While we help her, hopefully in the future, she will help other women,” she said.

Women and girls in Afghanistan face severe restrictions in many aspects of daily life, including the right to education.

Human Rights Watch, citing government figures, said last year that 85 percent of the 3.5 million Afghan children not in school were girls. While two-thirds of adolescent boys are literate, the figure for girls is little more than half that.

Mohammadi said AYA was in touch with Ahmadi, who has three children including the two-month-old baby pictured with her.

Her husband, who is reported to be illiterate, was widely praised on social media for supporting his wife in a patriarchal society where women are mostly expected to stay at home.

Afghan politician Farkhunda Zahra Naderi, known for championing women’s rights, also pledged to help Ahmadi with her studies, and told the Thomson Reuters Foundation she had paid Ahmadi’s university fees in full for the next four years.","With one click, Afghan woman's dream of university comes true",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-women-education/with-one-click-afghan-womans-dream-of-university-comes-true-idUSKBN1HG2PA
12,afghanistan,"Thirty-year-old Mohammad isn’t sure who shelled his home in eastern Afghanistan’s Khogyani District: Taliban insurgents, or fighters aligned with the so-called Islamic State.

But when a rocket-propelled grenade struck three months ago, killing some of his livestock, he knew he could no longer stay.

“We had to leave that night. The battle had reached our doorsteps,” Mohammad said, standing outside his family’s new home: a bare, single room in a compound set amid tents and shanty homes near Jalalabad, the capital of the eastern province of Nangarhar.

This area, less than 100 kilometres from Mohammad’s former home, is among hundreds of patchwork settlements that have proliferated throughout Afghanistan over the last five years, fed by a steady surge of people uprooted by an intensifying conflict and others pushed back from neighbouring countries.

The displaced and the returnees throng together in swelling districts like Behsud, which curves around urban Jalalabad. In settlements spreading over once-barren land, people live clustered in tents, hastily built structures, or under the open sky.

Ivan Flores/IRIN A worker looks over a pile of stones for new construction at a settlement in Nangarhar Province’s Behsud District.

Their number has doubled over the past five years to more than 600 in the country’s worst-hit provinces, according to aid groups. In Nangarhar Province, wracked by insecurity and a prime destination for people returning from neighbouring Pakistan, almost one million people now live in these haphazard settlements – a figure that doubled over only seven months last year.

One in three people in Nangarhar is now either displaced or a returnee, with some 369,000 in Behsud alone, according to a recently released International Organisation for Migration survey. Each week, new violence brings more arrivals. Aid organisations can’t keep up, and the government has often stumbled in providing even basic support; food, shelter, and other fundamental needs are in short supply.

Analysts warn that the consequences of such widespread displacement may be felt for generations, as poverty rises and education rates fall.

“Our emergency response stocks have been largely exhausted by these displacements,” said William Carter, head of programme in Afghanistan for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which works with displaced communities in the region.

Across the country, more than 1.6 million people have been uprooted by conflict since 2015, and almost one million Afghans have returned from neighbouring Pakistan. Returnees from Iran and further abroad add to the turmoil.

Carter said donor funds to help people ousted by conflict have dwindled even while needs have soared. “So, whilst we are doing what we can, the future is somewhat bleak.”

Intensified battles

Afghanistan has seen decades of upheaval. But aid workers say recent violence is intensifying and becoming more complex: hundreds of thousands of civilians each year are caught in the crossfire between a growing number of combatants, including Taliban militants, IS-aligned fighters, militias, and NATO-backed government security forces.

Fighters aligned with IS have injected a new level of volatility into the mix in eastern Afghanistan, where it has carved out an enclave and staged attacks against the Taliban, the government, civilians, and aid groups – including a January attack on the offices of Save the Children in Jalalabad. The rise of the Islamic State Khorasan Province, as the local offshoot is sometimes known, has been rapid; it accounted for 1,000 civilian injuries and deaths in the country last year, according to UN figures, compared with a few dozen casualties only two years earlier.

“Thousands of families in eastern Afghanistan have had to flee their homes due to advances by groups aligned with the Islamic State,” Carter said. “But many families are simply fleeing armed conflict itself: the Islamic State is fighting the [Taliban], who is fighting Afghan National Defence and Security Forces, with the help of international special forces and airstrikes.”

Thirty-five-year-old Munir fled his home in Khogyani four months ago after the district descended into a battle zone.

“We left in large numbers with nothing but the clothes on our back, and each other,” Munir told IRIN. “A lot of our neighbours lost family members in the fighting.”

Today, his family lives in a tent in a crowded compound in Behsud, alongside others from his village who joined him on the midnight exodus.

Both Mohammad and Munir say they’ve been unable to find steady work.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Munir, 35, fled his home in the middle of the night in late 2017. He and his family now live in a tent on a compound in Behsud District, along with other people from his village.

Aid out of reach

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, which is also responsible for helping people displaced by conflict, has floated plans to build housing for both returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) across the country. In practice, however, many Afghans have had difficulty accessing aid for short-term, basic needs such as food and shelter.

According to a January study of displaced people in five provinces conducted by the NRC, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, and humanitarian research group Samuel Hall, only one quarter of displaced households surveyed reported receiving any aid whatsoever. The report also found that the process of registering for the government’s official aid programme for IDPs was bureaucratic, overly strict, and out of reach for the majority of people who needed it.

A separate December assessment of the displacement in Khogyani District – home to both Mohammad and Munir – found that the government was “not visible” in the response to the emergency.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Mohammad, 30, and his family, in the courtyard of their home in Behsud District. Mohammad’s single-room house is the only brick building in a compound filled with tents. But with little work available, he fears he can no longer afford the rent.

Officials at the refugees and repatriations ministry did not respond to IRIN’s requests for comment.

Displacement into informal settlements has also helped to make the Afghan capital, Kabul, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Around 1.5 million in 2001, its population is currently estimated at around six million and expected to reach eight million by 2020.

Analysts warn that the chronic displacement unfolding throughout the country will have long-term consequences that could span generations.

Nassim Majidi, director at Samuel Hall, says extreme poverty is likely to place greater pressure on families to push their kids to work. At the same time, research shows that many families are displaced multiple times, including many who return to Afghanistan from abroad only to find that the conflict has made their former homes unliveable.

“The humanitarian crisis will have social and political consequences,” said Majidi, who foresees repeated rounds of displacement, families split across borders, and a rise in child labour as Afghans resort to extremes to make ends meet.

“We’re facing wasted opportunities to educate the next generation, and instead facing intergenerational poverty,” she said.

While Mohammad’s five children aren’t yet working, they are no longer in school because he can’t afford to send them.

“If things don’t improve, at some point, they will have to work to help support the family,” he said.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Neighbours from Munir’s home village live in the same compound as his family in Behsud District. According to Munir, the families fled together “with nothing but the clothes on our back and each other”.

Outside his tiny new home in Behsud, Mohammad’s children played on a muddy road softened by rain; an open drain filled with garbage flowed nearby. There’s no running water; his family collects washing water from a muddy ditch shared with other families.

Conditions may be poor, but Behsud’s newly arrived say they have no illusions about returning home anytime soon.

Mohammad sometimes receives news from his village back in Khogyani – from others who are only now escaping.

“I hear our house is in ruins and the livestock have all died or been stolen,” he said. “There is nothing to return to but more battles.”

14,afghanistan,"In a meeting with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday, Uzbekistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Ismatilla Irgashev said his country has decided to reduce the electricity prices from the current 8.5 cents a unit to 5 cents a unit.



“Ismatilla Irgashev, Uzbekistan’s special envoy to Afghanistan in his meeting with the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan pledged to reduce the current 8.5 cents electricity price to 5 cents and the new prices will come in to effect from July,” the presidential palace said in a statement on Monday.



According to the statement, another 1,000 megawatts of power will come through Uzbekistan’s Surkhan region to Baghlan province to Kabul, which will help overcome electricity shortages.

“In recent months, seven provinces across the country were supplied with electricity, in Badghis province, the price of electricity from 35 Afs per kilowatt was reduced to 6 Afs while in Ghazni province, the price of electricity has been reduced by 75.6 percent,” the statement said.



“It is important to mention that a 70 megawatt transmission line will be connected to Jalalabad while the actual capacity of the line is about 300 megawatts. To some extent electricity shortages have also been resolved in northern provinces and the logistical process of supplying electricity to the central regions of the country is in the implementation phase,” the statement concluded.



Meanwhile, officials of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) have welcomed the move by Uzbekistan, saying the process will have a significant impact on electricity prices in the country.



Currently, Afghanistan imports 300 megawatts of electricity from Uzbekistan.



“In the middle of 2018, the price of electricity will be reduced from 7.5 cents to 5 cents and this will enable us to purchase the 300 megawatts of electricity at 5 cents,” said DABS spokesman Wahidullah Tawhidi.



Economic commentators have said the decision by Uzbekistan to reduce the electricity prices will also open a new phase of rivalry among power exporters in the region.",Uzbekistan Cuts Electricity Tariffs For Afghanistan,https://www.tolonews.com/business/uzbekistan-cuts-electricity-tariffs-afghanistan

More than three decades of war, sustained flows of returnees, civil unrest, insurgent activity and recurring natural disasters have contributed to chronic humanitarian need in Afghanistan. As of March, conflict has internally displaced over 42,200 people, 147,500 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran and Pakistan and natural disasters have affected roughly 3,900 people since January, according to the UN.

Widespread conflict, poor rain-fed staple production and limited labor opportunities are the main drivers of acute food insecurity in Afghanistan, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports.

According to the UN World Food Program (WFP), an estimated 9.3 million people are food insecure in Afghanistan—including 3.4 million severely food insecure; approximately 41 percent of children under 5 years of age are stunted and 10 percent suffer from acute malnutrition.","Afghanistan: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - Updated April 3, 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-food-assistance-fact-sheet-updated-april-3-2018
16,afghanistan,"The Islamic State has also lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq in recent months, including its de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, prompting American officials to express concern that the organization would turn its attention to Afghanistan. They cited a promotional video from the Islamic State extolling the virtue of fighting in Khorasan — the group’s name for Afghanistan and Pakistan — and particularly in the northern province of Jowzjan in Afghanistan.

The killing of Mr. Hekmatullah led to immediate infighting among rival factions of insurgents, who disagreed on whom his successor should be, Afghan government officials in the area said.

Mr. Hekmatullah, an ethnic Uzbek, was a fearsome presence in Jowzjan, a predominantly Uzbek region. As a former Taliban commander in his area, the district of Darzab, he became notorious for such extreme savagery that the Taliban expelled him from the organization, and he joined the Islamic State. Previously, he had also been a leader of the extremist Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

General Nicholson said Mr. Hekmatullah’s death was a blow to the group’s operations.

“IS-K in Jowzjan Province is the main conduit for external support and foreign fighters from Central Asian states into Afghanistan,” he said. “Hekmatullah was the key leader for those operations,” he added.

Afghan officials described Mr. Hekmatullah as running Islamic State in Khorasan operations not only in Jowzjan, but also in the provinces of Sar-i-Pul and Faryab, which are also in the north. According to the Jowzjan deputy police chief, Hafiz Khashi, after Mr. Hekmatullah’s death, three factions of his Islamic State followers began fighting one another to determine who would take his place.

He said those factions included foreign fighters from places including Chechnya and Syria, followers of Mr. Hekmatullah from his home district, and Islamic State fighters from elsewhere in Afghanistan who had joined his forces in the north.

The governor of Jowzjan, Maulvi Lutfullah Azizi, said the killing of Mr. Hekmatullah, and the infighting that resulted, had come just in time to prevent Mr. Hekmatullah’s fighters from overrunning government forces holding the district center of Darzab.

“He was very powerful and commanded up to 500 armed fighters,” Mr. Azizi said. “When he and his bodyguard were killed, his forces were within 50 meters of the district center.”

Hundreds of miles to the southeast, the district of Achin, in Nangarhar, heavily dominated by the Islamic State in Khorasan a year ago, is now largely under government control, according to officials and village elders there. Mohammad Ismail Shinwari, the governor of Achin, said schools were reopening and 4,000 displaced families had returned, although another 2,000 families were yet to come back.

“ISIS is no longer strong in this district,” he said.

The Islamic State has proved capable of replenishing its forces in the past, however. Last April, for instance, the American military said it had reduced the extremists’ numbers from 3,000 to 700. Then, last December, General Nicholson said that another 1,600 fighters had been “removed from the battlefield,” particularly in eastern Afghanistan.

A New York Times reporter traveled late last month through Achin to the front lines, where fighting against the Islamic State was still underway, although government forces had made major inroads.

On the 15-mile trip from the district center to the front line, the reporter saw only two civilian cars, and numerous ruined and burned homes, charred fields, and uncollected harvests. Along the way were four bombed-out cars; the unclaimed, dried-out bodies of what officials said were five Islamic State militants lay by the roadside. American military aircraft patrolled the area constantly, and bombing could be heard in the distance.

In Mamand Valley, once a stronghold of the Islamic State in Achin, the government has taken back 80 percent of the territory from the extremists, according to Mr. Shinwari, the local governor.

Waris Khan, 50, was one of those who returned to his home in the valley as a result, but he said he was skeptical about the future.

“If these forces who carried out the clearance operation here leave this area, the local police will be not able to keep this area under their control for even one day,” he said.

Even as it has lost territory in the north and east of Afghanistan, the Islamic State faction has apparently been stepping up suicide bombings in the capital, Kabul, claiming responsibility for a series of deadly assaults, mostly on targets in Shiite neighborhoods. Both Afghan and American officials have, however, expressed doubt about whether those attacks were really carried out by the Islamic State, or by Taliban factions.",ISIS Leader in Afghanistan Is Killed in U.S. Airstrike,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/world/asia/afghanistan-isis-leader.html
17,afghanistan,"Turkey plans to deport nearly 600 illegal Afghan refugees who have fled ongoing insecurity and economic crisis in their war-torn country.

Turkish security forces handed over the Afghan refugees, who had crossed into eastern Turkey through Iran due to ""ongoing terrorist activities and economic troubles"" in Afghanistan, to provincial immigration authorities, Turkey’s Interior Ministry announced on Saturday.

Deportation procedures are now completed for 591 refugees in the eastern province of Erzurum and charter flights to Kabul would be arranged on Saturday and Sunday to send them back, the ministry said in its statement.

""Following the completion of deportation procedures for illegal migrants in our other provinces, deportations will speed up and continue in the coming days,"" the statement noted.

According to the Turkish paper Hurriyet, several thousand Afghan refugees have crossed into Turkey in recent months after walking for days from the border to reach Erzurum.

US-led forces invaded Afghanistan and toppled the ruling Taliban regime some 17 years ago. That ongoing war has failed to bring stability to the country despite the presence of thousands of foreign forces. A recent survey found that Taliban militants were active in two-thirds of the country and were fully controlling four percent of it.

Taking advantage of the chaos fueled by local Taliban militants, Daesh terrorists first emerged in Afghanistan’s eastern and northeastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar in 2015 and they are currently seeking to strengthen their foothold in the war-torn country after they were defeated in Iraq and Syria.

According to the United Nations figures released earlier this year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the country’s conflict last year.

Rights groups have criticized Turkey for putting the lives of refugees at risk by deporting them to their conflict-torn countries.

Last week, Human Right Watch said Turkish forces had been stopping and sending back hundreds or thousands of displaced Syrians on a daily basis since December, opening fire on them on many occasions.

The externally-displaced Syrians are then forced to return to the violence-ravaged province of Idlib, which holds large concentrations of Takfiri terrorists, HRW said.

HRW said Turkey’s anti-refugee measures “has been reinforced by a controversial EU-Turkey March 2016 migration agreement to curb refugee and migration flows to the European Union.”

It said the EU should be “working with Turkey to keep its borders open to refugees, providing financial support for Turkey’s refugee efforts, and sharing responsibility by stepping up resettlement of refugees from Turkey.”",PressTV-Turkey to deport 600 illegal Afghan refugees,http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/04/07/557744/turkey-afghan-migrant

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, right, greets John Bolton, President Trump’s choice to be national security adviser, as he arrives at the Pentagon on March 29. (Reuters)

John Bolton takes over as national security adviser today in the midst of a new national security crisis: another chemical attack in Syria. President Trump responded with strongly worded tweets blaming both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warning there would be a “big price to pay.”

Bolton is known for his hawkish views and general belief that the United States should use military power preemptively. Trump’s views on conflicts like that in Syria have been inconsistent, even contradictory. As recently as last week, the president was apparently disagreeing with his own Pentagon when he said the United States should get out of Syria immediately. Yet one of his tweets during the weekend implied that stronger U.S. action might have stopped Assad.

But that’s only the latest crisis. Bolton and the Trump administration will also be confronting the looming diplomatic encounter with North Korea and ongoing challenges like the war in Afghanistan and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. As they do so, keep this basic point in mind: In many of these regional conflicts, the United States has a limited amount of leverage or is at the mercy of forces beyond its control.

That doesn’t mean the United States has no power, or that individuals like Bolton and Trump don’t matter; my book about how presidents shape military interventions argues that they do. But international relations scholars know well that international forces and other countries’ interests and domestic politics can be powerful constraints on what the United States can do to shape events, particularly in regional conflicts. That’s important to remember in the constant ebb and flow of news.

Several recent TMC posts examine those constraints in different parts of the world. Let’s take a look.

China will have a big say in what happens next with North Korea

After Trump’s announcement that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, China and North Korea had a surprise of their own to unleash: Kim made a secretive visit to Beijing. Here at TMC, Rush Doshi explored three takeaways from the meeting. Doshi concludes, “Beijing has strong incentives to push for full involvement in the forthcoming talks. Diplomacy over North Korean denuclearization remains fluid and volatile, but one thing remains clear: Xi Jinping won’t be content to stay on the sidelines.”

China itself has a complex and volatile relationship with North Korea. But whatever Bolton’s and ultimately Trump’s plans for North Korea, they must account for China’s increasingly active role.

Regional conflicts have their own internal dynamics that resist U.S. intervention

Recently, there has been renewed talk of a peace settlement in Afghanistan, where much to Trump’s apparent chagrin, U.S. forces remain on the ground. But how likely is a peace deal?

As Asfandyar Mir lays out clearly in his recent Monkey Cage post, internal dynamics and domestic politics within Afghanistan could derail peace at any step: during negotiations, defining exactly what a deal would look like, dealing with spoilers, putting a deal into force and, finally, possibly spilling back into civil war. The United States has little power to change most of these factors. Indeed, as Greg Jaffe recently wrote at The Post, top military officials now talk about “winning” in conflicts like Afghanistan not in terms of outright victory, but in keeping a permanent presence, an “infinite war.”

Many of Mir’s points about Afghanistan probably also apply to Syria, where realistic military options are hard to identify. Last year, after another alleged chemical attack, the United States struck Syria with a cruise missile. Marc Lynch wrote here that the strike alone wouldn’t shift the overall strategic stalemate in Syria. There is little reason to imagine things are much different this time.

Bolton’s hawkish views come from the era of unchallenged U.S. power after the Cold War — which is coming to an end

Bolton is best known for serving in the George W. Bush administration, when U.S. military power was largely unchallenged. As Joshua Shifrinson argued here at the Monkey Cage, “In an age of overwhelming U.S. military dominance, there is no other country to push back when the United States gets aggressive. As a result, militant and assertive views have more scope to shape policy.” Bolton’s hawkish views are partly a symptom of post-Cold War U.S. world dominance.

Shifrinson concludes that other countries like China may be challenging U.S. economic power, but that the United States still has a clear military advantage. That might make military force look more attractive to many in the White House, “because that is where the United States outcompetes the rest of the world.” Thus, “with U.S. power dominant but waning, Bolton’s elevation reminds us there are few limits to — and some momentum behind — a militaristic U.S. foreign policy.”

Alliances and diplomacy remain important for addressing regional conflicts

Trump and Bolton both appear to disdain alliances and many forms of diplomacy. But the ongoing challenges facing the United States show how important these tools can be.

For example, Stephan Haggard explained here how sanctions have actually worked to bring the confrontation with North Korea to this point. Multilateral coordination, always difficult with sanctions, turned out to be crucial. As Haggard notes, “The concerns now rest with a U.S. administration prone to grand gestures but with a foreign policy bench depleted to some extent by turnover. The United States faces the challenge of coordinating at the multilateral level and with China to maintain the sanctions pressure that will lead to talks.”

Although David Bosco recently argued here that Bolton has an underappreciated record of multilateralism, neither Bolton nor Trump is known for the kind of repeated, patient diplomacy Haggard suggests will be crucial for successful North Korea talks. Indeed, as Mira Rapp-Hooper has pointed out in several pieces here, Trump’s threats against North Korea have more often harmed U.S. alliances than changed the dynamics with Kim.

Taken together, these arguments have a sobering message for the president and his new national security adviser. Trump and Bolton will certainly put their own stamp on U.S. policy over the next few months. But they’ll have to contend with a host of complicated forces beyond their control, and will have less power to shape other regions’ conflicts than they may wish. The United States has had to relearn this lesson many times — often painfully, especially in the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.","Bolton starts today, with a Syria crisis on the agenda.

The Cluster Approach The cluster approach was established in 2005 following an independent Humanitarian Response Review, to address gaps and to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian response by building partnerships.

Thus, the cluster approach has been implemented for over 12 years now. Following the experience of the Humanitarian community in responding to the two L3s, the Haiti earthquake and the Pakistan floods in 2010, the IASC Principals “agreed there is a need to restate and return to the original purpose of clusters, refocusing them on strategic and operational gaps analysis, planning, assessment and results”. At the global level, the aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian needs by ensuring that there is a predictable leadership and accountability in all the main sectors or areas of humanitarian response.

Similarly, at the country level the aim is to strengthen humanitarian response by demanding high standards of predictability, accountability and partnership in all sectors or areas of activity. The cluster is about achieving more strategic responses and better prioritization of available resources by clarifying the division of labour among organizations, better defining the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian organizations within the sectors, and providing the Humanitarian Coordinator with both a first point of call and a provider of last resort in all the key sectors or areas of activity.

Afghanistan WASH Cluster The WASH cluster was first established and activated in 2008 in Afghanistan and UNICEF in the capacity of cluster lead agency was assigned the role of cluster coordinator. The cluster coordination responsibility was transferred to WHO and NGO MEDAIR in 2014 for a period of one year, however it came back to UNICEF since January 2015. WASH cluster has remained active since its inception and has been involved in preparedness and response activities including devising tools and standards and organizing awareness and skill development initiatives to strengthen cluster capacity and ensuring timely and coordinated response in emergencies.

The cluster systems in Afghanistan is coordinated by UNOCHA Afghanistan and WASH cluster actively participates in all Inter Cluster Coordination Team (ICCT) meetings. Coordinating its diverse portfolio of more than 40 partners, WASH cluster harmonizes submission of proposal to Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) and plays an important role in UN CERF fund mobilization.

The Afghanistan National WASH Cluster (ANWC) is supported by regional coordination mechanisms (often referred as regional clusters) where UNICEF’s five regional offices coordinate WASH partners through quarterly meetings. The OCHA also participates in these meetings. The department of Provincial Rural Rehabilitation and Development (PRRD) from the region provide update on humanitarian needs and response carried out in their provinces and the minutes of the meetings are shared with ANWC. In some provinces with higher humanitarian case-loads, WASH partners also meet independent to the regional meetings and these meetings can be more frequent.

At the national level, UNICEF is the Cluster Coordinator and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) is the national co-lead. There are other two co-leads in WASH Custer representing humanitarian agencies, namely DACAAR and NCA.","Afghanistan National WASH Cluster, Cluster Coordination Performance Monitoring (CCPM) Final Report – 2017",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-national-wash-cluster-cluster-coordination-performance-monitoring

Designed to promote discussion and inspire change, the radio series features the work of several high-profile women, who talk about their career challenges and successes in the interest of inspiring girls and young women to make similar vocational choices.

One such woman, and the first to be featured in the new series, is Hakima Alizada, a defence lawyer and the head of women’s affairs in provincial office of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.

Speaking during the first episode aired by local broadcaster Nasim Radio to an audience estimated at 60,000 listeners in and around the provincial capital, Alizada called on young girls to pursue their education as an effective starting point that can enable them to aim higher in their career aspirations.

“In my early days, as the first female defence lawyer in Bamyan, I faced and overcame many challenges,” said Alizada, who described how she graduated from Herat University and then worked to defend women’s rights, litigating cases of domestic violence, discrimination and abuse.

She called on young people, especially girls, to be “agents of change” by getting involved in community initiatives, seeking out leadership opportunities and supporting peace-building and development initiatives.

Organized by UNAMA’s Bamyan regional office, the radio series will feature many other role models, all of them Afghan women, and is part of a country-wide outreach initiative aimed at creating platforms for local communities to engage in dialogue on key issues.

Bamyan, well-known for its archaeological monuments, is also known for having a generally positive approach to women’s social and political participation. But certain harmful practices and a lack of awareness about women’s rights have hindered the province’s potential to be a standout champion for women’s empowerment.

The UN is committed to supporting efforts by the Afghan government and is working with a variety of institutions and actors to promote gender equality, help reverse inequality and support local programmes aimed at expanding opportunities for women.

UNAMA supports the Afghan people and government to achieve peace and stability. In accordance with its mandate as a political mission, UNAMA backs conflict prevention and resolution, promoting inclusion and social cohesion, as well as strengthening regional cooperation. The Mission supports effective governance, promoting national ownership and accountable institutions that are built on respect for human rights.

The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) has received a contribution of USD 9.3 million to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action (UN VTF) from the Government of Japan to undertake critical humanitarian mine action programming in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and South Sudan. Japan is one of the largest donors to the UN VTF providing over USD 132 million since 2010. In addition to its financial support, UNMAS benefits from the provision of Japanese in-kind personnel.

“The United Nations thanks the Government and People of Japan for their continued commitment to mine action,” stated Agnès Marcaillou, the Director of UNMAS. “Enduring conflicts, as we see in the Middle East and Africa where Japan is focusing its funding, have resulted in an unprecedented level of contamination by unexploded bombs, rockets and other ammunition. With Japanese support, UNMAS will continue to clear land and open roads allowing refugees and displaced people to return home and enable humanitarian actors to reach populations in need. This work will save lives and provide hope and opportunity for some of the poorest communities in the world.”

His Excellency Dr. Toshiya Hoshino, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations, said, “Humanitarian action cannot be undertaken without mine action. Nor can displaced people return home, or civilians live in safety and escape poverty. Mine action is, therefore, a prerequisite for sustainable development as well as for human security. Based on this idea, Japan has been placing assistance to mine action as one of its diplomatic priorities, and this year’s assistance is also in line with this firm commitment. As one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Mine Action, Japan expects this assistance will be used in an effective and coordinated manner. Japan will continue to play an active role in mine action in collaboration with the United Nations, the Member States, and civil society organizations to achieve our collective goal of creating a mine-free world.”

In these turbulent times, the needs of the humanitarian mine action sector are increasing as highlighted earlier this month when the United Nations launched the Portfolio for Mine Action Projects for 2018. The Portfolio shows the funding requirements increased by 29 per cent compared to 2017, to USD 661 million. With 27 per cent of the total secured, USD 483 million more is needed for clearance of explosive hazards, risk education, and support to victims and their communities. The Portfolio is available online at: http://www.mineaction.org/resources/portfolios.
