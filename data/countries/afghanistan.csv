Updated at 8:37 a.m. ET

Over the course of 15 years, the U.S. has contributed more than $3 billion into a trust fund that is aimed at helping Afghanistan with its reconstruction.

In total, donors from around the world have given the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which is administered by the World Bank, more than $10 billion.

But according to a watchdog appointed by Congress, those billions of dollars are at risk because the World Bank and the government of Afghanistan are not adequately monitoring where they go and how they are used.

""Once the U.S. or any other donor provides its contributions to the fund, neither the World Bank nor USAID can account for how those funds are specifically spent,"" said the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in a statement. SIGAR is tasked with monitoring U.S. spending in Afghanistan, and the U.S. provides money to the fund through USAID.

The ARTF describes itself as the ""the largest single source of on-budget financing for Afghanistan's development ... delivering important results within key sectors including education, health, agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, and governance."" It does not fund Afghanistan's security sector.

The funds from the trust fund are used to pay salaries of Afghan government workers, SIGAR says, but the World Bank does not require a third-party monitor to physically verify that those government workers actually exist.

The third party contractor's work is limited by security concerns because they are not always able to verify workers in insecure areas, the report states. The World Bank also does not publicly share evaluations of the third-party contractors who are monitoring how the money is used.

""Donors, including USAID and U.S. taxpayers, will continue to provide billions of dollars to the ARTF without adequate assurance that the money being spent is actually contributing to the ongoing operation of the Afghan government, addressing fiscal gaps in Afghanistan's national budget, and furthering the international community's overall reconstruction efforts,"" the report states.

The World Bank also is not consistently measuring performance of projects funded by the ARTF, according to the watchdog. ""Without an accurate, reliable evaluation, the World Bank will be unable to determine the impact the roughly $10 billion in donor funding has had in improving Afghan development.""

The fact that there is apparently little accountability for how the money is spent has an impact on the projects selected, according to the report: ""A senior aide to Afghanistan's President told us that the structure of the ARTF allows for ill-conceived projects to be funded because there is no repayment obligation and that dysfunctional projects are nearly impossible to eliminate.""

There's political pressure to spend the money, the aide reportedly said, ""even if the programs and projects being funded are ill-conceived or unneeded, or risk losing future funding.""

The World Bank responded to the report by saying that most of its findings ""are somewhat anecdotal, and do not fully take into account measures taken to improve the reporting on how funds are used.""

""Independent assessments conclude that in Afghanistan's volatile context, the ARTF is a vehicle of choice for pooled on-budget funding given its low transaction and management costs, transparency and accountability,"" the World Bank said in a statement. ""It provides a well-functioning arena for policy debate and consensus creation between the international community and government of Afghanistan while delivering important results to millions of Afghans across the country.""

The SIGAR report states that the World Bank has taken steps to improve its monitoring since the last report in 2011 but there are still major gaps.",Watchdog Says Billions In Afghanistan Funding At Risk Of Misuse,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/25/605304003/watchdog-says-billions-in-afghanistan-funding-at-risk-of-misuse

An interpreter who ""risked his life"" to help British troops in Afghanistan has said he will be killed by the Taliban if he is deported.

Abdul Bari, who fled from his home country to Manchester, has accused the government of deserting him by denying him asylum.

His lawyer Lewis Kett said he is seeking a judicial review challenging the rejection of his application.

A Home Office spokesman said it did not comment on individual cases.

Mr Bari, who acted as an interpreter for the Army in Helmand for two years, said: ""They came to my country to help us so I have to help them.""

""I helped the British forces at a very risky, very unsafe time but now I'm at risk so I wanted the British Government to look after me.""

Mr Bari, who received death threats while he was working in Afghanistan, said: ""Interpreters who have been deported to Afghanistan are all in danger.

""If I go back I will be killed.""

The Home Office has allowed some interpreters to stay but but only those employed on a specific date in 2012 - Mr Bari worked prior to that period.

But his asylum application and appeals have been refused and he's been told he must go back to Kabul.

Lewis Kett, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said: ""The Home Office has accepted that he was an interpreter, they have accepted he was originally threatened but they have not accepted he is at risk in Kabul.""

The case of interpreters seeking asylum has been backed by Lord Dannatt, Former Chief of General Staff for the British army, who said: ""If they genuinely feel there is a threat to their safety then we have a moral obligation to look after them and that probably means giving them an opportunity to come to this country.""

2,afghanistan,"One of the most impoverished countries in the world, Afghanistan has literally been devastated by decades of conflict. The public health sector has also been hard hit by the debilitating war, with many citizens having little or no access to healthcare, particularly in remote rural remote areas.

Unfortunately, disparities persist in provision of health services to men and women. Women cannot access medical services because they are not allowed to visit health facilities without male companions or to be examined by male medics. The number of female healthcare providers is very low, more so in the countryside, where more than 50 percent of the population lives.

Even though there have been efforts by the Ministry of Public Health and the international community to jack up the number of midwives and trained female healthcare staff. Cultural barriers and in some cases insecurity, however, militate against the success of these endeavors. As a consequence, many women lose their lives in the gestation period.

“Women of reproductive age are particularly vulnerable in a country still having an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate. Only 50 percent of deliveries take place in health facilities, where post-natal care can be provided by trained health staff,” the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Coordination said in the Humanitarian Needs Overview for 2018.

Maternal mortality ratio was 396 per 100,000 live births in 2015, report WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and United Nations Population Division Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group. Likewise, the Afghanistan Health Survey for 2016 said over 23 percent of deaths among women aged 15-49 are linked to maternal causes -- the highest among all other causes in this age group in the country.

One of the several maternal death causes is male family members’ refusal to let women visit a male physician in health facilities. Additionally, many women resort to harmful traditional practices to avoid visiting male doctors. No credible data is available on the women’s deaths resulting from inadequate access to healthcare.

Harmful practices include barring mothers from bathing and breastfeed babies in the first three days after delivery, a resort to self-medication, home remedies and faith healing. In some cases, formal health services are perceived as shameful by a woman, her husband or older family members because it demonstrates publicly the need for help during a vulnerable period, according to a qualitative assessment by William Newbrander and Team (2014).

In many instances, women do not have access to health services because there are no male family members to take them to health facilities. Also, some husbands do not allow their wives to visit health clinics or hospitals.

In Afghanistan, women have been faced with injustices and a brazen denial of rights in terms of health services. In large measure, it is a question of gender inequality. The Ministry of Public Health and other agencies can address this issue through comprehensive long- and short-term approaches. Training community health workers and offering incentives to female health workers working in remote areas of the country will help resolve the problem in the short term.

However, there is need for long-term and more effective measures to address the problem. The Ministry of Public Health, through the Health Promotion Department, should conduct community outreach programmes that give women access to health services during the gestation period. It is necessary for the health of mother and child.

Community outreach should also involve religious leaders, who are highly influential among members of the general public. Additionally, greater attention has to be paid to girls’ education to increase the number of educated women over the longer haul and recruit medics from within the community.

Women’s health is the backbone of healthy society. Vulnerable women should be afforded the opportunity to get health services even if they need to visit a male health practitioner. A comprehensive health promotion plan, involving all stakeholders and communities, could play an effective role in improving Afghan women’s overall health situation.

4,afghanistan,"New Delhi: The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Friday launched its very own franchise-based T20 league, to be held in the UAE in October, but the BCCI is expected to maintain its current stand of not allowing Indian players to turn freelancers.

The ACB claims that 40 overseas cricketers have shown interest in the league to be staged in Sharjah from 5-24 October.

While the top officials of Afghanistan board wanted BCCI to allow at least its non-contracted players to take part in the inaugural edition, India won't make exceptions for one particular private league, even though it is a venture of a long-time ally.

The BCCI has not allowed its cricketers to play in any T20 league outside the IPL and it is unlikely to change its stance for the Afghanistan Premier League (APL).

""I am not talking about the current Indian cricketers here but it will be great if the other Indian players can come and play in our league,"" ACB CEO Shafiqullah Stanikzai told PTI.

""I will speak to the BCCI officials on the subject but honestly it looks tough at the moment,"" he added.

India has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of Afghanistan cricket. The Afghanistan team trains in India and has home grounds in Greater Noida and now Dehradun. India will also be hosting Afghanistan's inaugural Test in June in Bengaluru.

""India has always lent a helping hand to its friend Afghanistan and will continue to do so. The ACB officials have not so far come to us on participation of our players in their league. Honestly speaking, it will be tough to allow the players at this stage. If we allow one, we have to give clearance to everyone,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI.

In a first, the BCCI had issued a NOC to Yusuf Pathan to play in a Hong Kong league last year but revoked it later.

Talking more about the APL, Stanikzai said the league will be a five-team affair initially and will comprise 24 games in a home and away format.

""Most probably we will have a draft system to pick the players, not the auction. The interest from investors have been encouraging so far and there are some Indian franchisees too who have shown interest,"" said Stanikzai.

The ACB already organises Shpageeza Cricket League at home but it is mainly a domestic event.

""With the APL, we aim to give exposure to our players to rub shoulders against the best in the world. It will also help the economy of our cricket. We see APL becoming one of the top-three leagues in the world,"" Stanikzai added.

Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai said the league will further fuel the game's growth in the country.

""The league will help us produce more world-class players and at a much faster pace as compared to now,"" he told PTI.","BCCI unlikely to allow Indian players from participating in newly-launched Afghanistan Premier League- Firstcricket News, Firstpost",https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/bcci-unlikely-to-allow-indian-players-from-participating-in-newly-launched-afghanistan-premier-league-4448593.html

The present Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) was prepared on the basis of the financing decision ECHO/WWD/BUD/2018/01000 (Worldwide Decision) and the related General Guidelines for Operational Priorities on Humanitarian Aid (Operational Priorities). The purpose of the HIP and its annex is to serve as a communication tool for DG ECHO's partners and to assist them in the preparation of their proposals. The provisions of the Worldwide Decision and the General Conditions of the Agreement with the European Commission shall take precedence over the provisions in this document.

0. MAJOR CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE HIP

In view of the expanding conflict, the lack of effective government commitment and the paucity of appropriate proposals, it will not be possible to conduct an effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programme in Afghanistan. As such the DRR objectives in Afghanistan will no longer be directly pursued and the EUR 1 000 000 allocated to this activity will be de-committed from this HIP.

1. CONTEXT

This Humanitarian Implementation Plan covers Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia. It is intended to address the needs of vulnerable populations affected by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and its consequences on neighbouring countries. It also includes provisions to improve capacities to prevent and respond to the effects of natural disasters and climate change.

In Afghanistan, the conflict between Government forces and non-state armed groups has intensified. According to a mid-year report from the United Nations, the number of civilians killed and injured during the first six months of 2017 persisted at the same record high levels as last year but with a worsening toll from suicide attacks, and a greater impact on women and children. In the same period, 173 409 people fled their homes due to the conflict, bringing the total number of displaced people to 1.7 million.

Forced displacement is reported in 29 out of 34 provinces and 58 per cent of all displaced people are girls and boys under 18. Most of the displaced people have moved to the cities, where social services are struggling to cope, leading to increased vulnerability and suffering. There is a mounting access problem for relief agencies and incidents have occurred where they have been directly targeted. DG ECHO's Integrated Analysis Framework (IAF) for 2016-17 identified extreme humanitarian needs in Afghanistan.

The vulnerability of the population affected by the crisis is assessed to be very high. At 7.8, Afghanistan holds one of the highest INFORM (Inform For Risk Management) scores, as well as one of the lowest and downward trending INFORM ‘coping capacity’ scores.

In view of the current increasing trend in the conflict and the lack of any credible peace process, the humanitarian outlook remains bleak, with needs that are expected to increase. Furthermore, the same conflict and instability is making it equally difficult for development programmes to achieve their objectives, notably to help the Government to provide a socio-economic environment that persuades Afghans to stay and build a future in Afghanistan.","Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia (Version 2 -16/03/2018)",https://reliefweb.int/report/world/humanitarian-implementation-plan-hip-afghanistan-pakistan-iran-and-central-asia-version
7,afghanistan,"The Afghan Taliban announced the launch of their annual spring offensive on April 25, on the same schedule they’ve stuck to for many years. At the same time, the United States is reported to have dropped more bombs in Afghanistan in the first quarter of 2018 than in the same period of any of the last fifteen years. This persistence—and, indeed, intensification—of the conflict might seem to suggest that conditions are not suited to pursuing a peaceful settlement.

But a more clear-eyed view is that the war in Afghanistan is now as ripe for negotiated settlement as it is ever likely to be. Military stalemate is an essential precondition for negotiated conflict resolution, and the war has been stalemated for nearly a decade already.

Afghanistan is a three-party conflict—the United States, the Afghan government, and the Taliban—with a fourth, shadow party, Pakistan, providing, at a minimum, valuable safe haven and freedom of movement for the Taliban. Each of the parties has shown interest in negotiations at various times over the last sixteen years, but the peaks of interest by each party have never coincided.

Though the signals have been mixed, the Trump administration appears to be following the pattern of its predecessor in imagining a political end-game in Afghanistan, but focusing predominantly on a military effort to try to turn the tide of the conflict, in hopes of negotiating from a position of greater strength.

In the aftermath of bloody attacks in Kabul, President Trump said on January 29 that talking with the Taliban would be a long way off, if ever. Other U.S. officials subsequently implied that his remarks shouldn’t be taken too literally. During a March 13 visit to Kabul, for instance, Secretary of Defense James Mattis publicly defined victory in Afghanistan as “political reconciliation,” but suggested a strategy of peeling away and reintegrating Taliban elements in bits and pieces. That version of reconciliation has already been tried and so far failed and is unlikely to motivate a group that is holding its own on the battlefield to take a U.S. call for settlement seriously.

Senior U.S. military officials for many months now have articulated a goal of achieving Afghan government control over 80 percent of the country’s population to set the stage for negotiations. This vision of political settlement looks more like negotiating terms of the Taliban’s capitulation rather than terms of compromise and power-sharing.

The premise underlying the “80 percent” goal is that rolling back the Taliban to that extent will persuade them that they have no opportunity for military victory, fracture the group, and severely damage their leverage in any negotiations. This goal is being pursued through more aggressive air strikes and by moving U.S. advisors closer to Afghan forces involved in offensive operations.

This approach is highly suspect for several reasons. First, although a favorite concept of counterinsurgency specialists, “population control” is probably not a particularly meaningful concept in Afghanistan, a country that is run by a government too weak to truly control the population. Afghan populations that appeared controlled at one point in time have rapidly proven susceptible to insurgent advances.

Second, several recent cases of insurgency suggest that the Taliban is perfectly capable of surviving, maintaining cohesion, and continuing to undermine the government while controlling only a small portion of the population, especially while it enjoys safe haven in Pakistan. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, for instance, survived for years in neighboring Uganda before returning to militarily overthrow Rwanda’s Hutu regime. Various Islamic militant groups in the Philippines have survived for decades, despite the fact that only an estimated 5 percent of the country’s population is Muslim. An insurgency’s resilience is not determined by the portion of the population it controls.

Third, neither more U.S. troops nor more intensive airstrikes are likely to turn the tide decisively. Recent RAND research examined approximately fifty cases of foreign military interventions. It found that foreign troops can help prevent a partner regime from losing to insurgents, but they do not improve the odds of victory, even when deployed in large numbers. Negotiated settlements involving substantial concessions to the insurgents are typically the best outcome that foreign interveners can hope to obtain. The same research found that even intensive air campaigns usually yield only very short-term improvements in security. The U.S. drone strike campaign in Pakistan, for instance, was successful in reducing militant attacks in the short term, but almost as soon as the U.S. ended its period of intensive strikes, militant activity returned to its prior levels.

Mazen Khosho fought for his country in Afghanistan. Then he fought bureaucrats to stop his eyesight from disappearing.

The former Canadian Forces paratrooper battled Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) to pay for the laser surgery he needed to correct an eye condition that was thwarting his efforts to learn a skilled trade – a condition that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes as being a hazard of Afghanistan even though VAC does not.

The VAC bureaucrats “want me to stay home and not work because I have back injuries and I have knee injuries,” Mr. Khosho said. “But the only way that I can be at peace and I can relax is when I am actually doing something, when I am actually working with my hands.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Khosho’s vision was perfect when he entered the military. He was a marksman. But, in the dry desert of Afghanistan, he found himself constantly rubbing sand from his eyes and, gradually, his vision began to go.

He was given a medical discharge in 2012 for a number of conditions, including PTSD, and decided to become a welder. SISIP Financial, the military’s insurance provider, agreed to pay for the training. But, eventually, Mr. Khosho could no longer see the lines of metal he was trying to fuse.

He had developed keratoconus – a condition that causes progressively blurred and distorted vision. It can be hereditary. But his doctor said in a letter to VAC that it is more often caused by “frequent rubbing of the eyes secondary to something in the environment or allergies. My understanding is that Mazen was exposed to significant environmental factors” in Afghanistan.

The doctor said Mr. Khosho would need a procedure called corneal cross linking to halt the deterioration. The treatment costs more than $5,000 and is not covered by Ontario’s public-health plan.

VAC said in an e-mail on Tuesday that it recognizes keratoconus to be a service-related injury, and will pay benefits when the first symptoms are associated with deployment to a specific area and when there is something about the area that causes excessive eye rubbing.

But when Mr. Khosho asked the department to pay the bill, he was denied twice in writing and several times over the phone. One of the denial letters said: “We have no medical evidence to relate your keratoconus of your right and left eye to your service in Afghanistan.”

Mr. Khosho said he was told by a case manager that there was no point in fighting the battle because the link between the condition and the deployment would be too difficult to prove. “But my wife kept on pressing and was persistent,” he said.

Eventually, the department agreed to pay for the treatment, saying the keratoconus could have been caused by a chemical spill that occurred when Mr. Khosho was working at a Canadian Forces base. But his doctors have said chemical spills do not cause the condition, Mr. Khosho said.

If VAC starts linking keratoconus to Afghanistan, the deparment will have to look at all the Afghanistan vets who developed it, Mr. Khosho said, “and that is something they don’t want to deal with.”

The Americans, on the other hand, do attribute the conditions of Afghanistan to the onset of keratoconus.

More than one representative of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs told Mr. Khosho that, if the Canadian government does not fully compensate him for the corneal cross linking and the continuing medical attention he requires, he can apply to the United States for compensation because Afghanistan was a joint effort. The USDVA recently sent him the forms to start a claim.

The only way that I can be at peace and I can relax is when I am actually doing something. — Mazen Khosho

Getting the eye treatment meant the former soldier could resume his career training. But his vision will never be restored to the level required of a welder. So Mr. Khosho asked the department to allow him to switch from welding to an apprenticeship in pipe fitting, which is more forgiving of bad eyes.

The VAC vocational-rehabilitation counsellor made it clear she did not want to approve the funding for a new training program, said Mr. Khosho’s wife, Rita Potestio.

Mr. Khosho did two days of physical tests demanded by VAC before the switch would be considered. Then he started a third 10-hour day of psychological questioning. But his PTSD kicked in and he felt an overwhelming urge to flee. “The guy was getting too personal,” Mr. Khosho said.

He left the testing and went straight to his family doctor who called VAC and, after several “angry phone calls,” persuaded the department to allow Mr. Khosho to change his apprenticeships without a psychological assessment.

VAC said in an e-mail that it needs to “assess veterans’ rehabilitation needs and ensure a holistic approach” before it can pay for apprenticeships. “If one program had been approved and didn’t work out for medical reasons,” the department said, “VAC would look at what worked and what did not in that program to ensure that a second program would meet the veteran’s needs.”

But Mr. Khosho said it is clear to everyone why the welding program did not work for him. It was his eyesight.

“I am 34 years old going on 35. I know what I want at this point. I want to rejoin society and do something with my life,” he said. “They are so eager to put all of this money into not making me go back to work which makes absolutely no sense.”

The 20 provinces in the war-torn country saw a 60 percent shortfall in rain and snowfall during the winter season.

“This year drought has reached a level that we will have to announce an emergency in several parts of the country,” said Hashmat Khan Bahaduri, spokesman for the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority in Kabul.

Bahaduri said funds would be allocated to mitigate the impact but that the country would have to import, or receive donations, to overcome food shortages.

According to Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a group set up by USAID to help planning for humanitarian crises, snowfall in Afghanistan’s last winter season was the lowest since 2002.

Snowmelt is an important source of water for crops and irrigation in a country where food is scarce for many households.

The U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) appealed on Monday for $10 million to help children and their families in drought-affected provinces.

The UN agency stated that food insecurity and reduced access to drinking water were beginning to take their toll in the 10 worst affected provinces, where 20 to 30 percent of water sources were reportedly dry.

“The priority is to prevent the situation from deteriorating, by responding to the needs of children and families in the worst affected areas,” said Adele Khodr, UNICEF representative in Afghanistan.

Poor rains and scanty snowfall mean less winter wheat, Afghanistan’s most reliable, resilient cereal crop.

An official at the agriculture ministry said it would start distribution of 2,000 metric tonnes of wheat imported from India and Kazakhstan before seeking fresh aid.

Last week, President Ashraf Ghani ordered officials to attend to the needs of distressed farmers and livestock producers.

But the situation is further complicated by an escalating conflict that often picks up with the start of warmer spring weather, leading to increased displacement and reduced access for humanitarian workers.",Emergency alerts loom as drought takes hold in war-torn Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-weather/emergency-alerts-loom-as-drought-takes-hold-in-war-torn-afghanistan-idUSKBN1HU1M4

Barkatullah is 13. He lost his right arm and leg in a mine explosion on May 2017. But that does not deter him from dreaming of a brighter future. ""The policemen were among the people who rescued me and saved my life,"" he says on a chilly evening in the children's playground at the Emergency War and Trauma Hospital in Kabul. ""That is what I want to do when I grow up.""

In Afghanistan, thousands of children each year are caught in the crossfire of ongoing violence. On Sunday, a suicide bomber struck in Kabul, aiming at civilians registering to vote at a school building in Kabul. Among the 57 deaths, 8 were children, according to Afghan police. There were another 100-plus wounded.

""There were bodies everywhere, some as young as 3- and 4-years-old,"" says 45-year-old Mariam, waiting outside Kabul's Emergency War and Trauma Hospital for news of her 14-year-old nephew, who was injured in the incident.

In its most annual report issued in February and covering 2017, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) documented 10,453 civilian casualties across Afghanistan — and 3,179 of them were children. The number of child victims – casualties refers to both those who are killed and injured — represents a 9 percent drop over the previous year. UNAMA attributed the drop in figures to ""actions taken by the Government of Afghanistan and Pro-Government security forces in 2017 to protect communities from harm.""

Despite this positive sign, there is still deep concern. ""Whether the number of documented casualties is going up or going down shouldn't obscure the fact that thousands of children are being injured or killed each year in the conflict in Afghanistan, a fact that is tragic and deeply unacceptable,"" says Heather Barr, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Kabul.

The annual total of children who are injured or killed stands in stark contrast to figures from almost a decade ago. In 2009, the U.N. body recorded 345 children killed of the total 2,412 civilian deaths caused by conflict-related violence.

Those who are injured have months, perhaps years, of rehab ahead of them. Barkatullah stares wistfully at the equipment in playground, much of which he can no longer play with. But a moment later he is swiftly wheeling away in his new wheelchair, daring his physiotherapist to chase him. ""He is a very active and friendly kid — always running around in his wheel chair, teasing the other children and even the doctors,"" says Carolina Stucchi, an Italian physical therapist at the hospital. And then she tries to catch him.

Barkatullah has lived at the hospital on and off for the past nine months while having surgeries and physical therapy. The facility has been a crowded place over the last few years: There were 2,829 child casualties in 2015 and a spike to 3,512 in 2016. In 2018, there have been 583 child casualties (155 deaths and 428 injured) in the first three months of the year.

And that is a challenge for an already overburdened health-care system in Afghanistan. Health workers face logistical challenges keeping in touch with patients in provinces that aren't always well connected with the city. They also have to work with family and relatives who may lack the knowledge and resources to care for the injured child. As a result, many children don't get follow-up support from the hospital.

Barkatullah, who like many Afghans goes only by one name, was out with his two brothers grazing their family sheep in Wardak province ten months ago when an improvised explosive device (IED) exploded close to them. His brothers, ages 8 and 10, died. In addition to losing two of his limbs, Barkatullah ""suffered from multiple internal injuries,"" says Stucchi.

In the bed close to Barkatullah's lies 10-year-old Hikmatullah. Unlike Barkatullah, he doesn't like to talk to anyone. His father, Azizullah, shares his story. ""He was at home when a stray rocket from an ongoing gun battle close by hit our house. We don't know who shot it,"" he recalls. Hikmatullah suffered injuries to both legs, left hand and also in the chest. ""He also lost one eye,"" his father says, adding that his son hasn't talked much since the incident.

""Children have their own coping mechanisms in dealing with situations,"" explains Stucchi, who not only conducts physical therapy with the children but also trains the parents to support children who have lasting disabilities after being injured. ""It can sometimes be challenging to teach the parents, but these children are stronger than the ones I have worked with in other countries,"" she adds.

The child casualties are caused by the insurgents but also by pro-government forces. According to UNAMA, 18 percent of the casualties recorded thusfar in 2018 were attributed to pro-government forces. Earlier last month, an Afghan air strike on a suspected Taliban gathering of religious students in Kunduz province resulted in 59 casualties, many of them children (although the exact numbers are still under investigation). The incident led to an uproar against civilian killings, especially targeting children. Former President Hamid Karzai was among the stronger opponents of such strikes. He said that ""air raids that target houses, schools and hospitals under the pretext of fighting against terrorism"" are ""an anti-Islamic act and against all humanitarian norms.""

The conflict has an impact on children beyond the deaths and injuries. According to researcher Barr, ""The statistics do not tell the tale of the far greater number of children who go hungry or go out to work much too young because wage earners in their home have been killed or injured; children who are forced out of school as insecurity escalates or their school is damaged or occupied; children facing dangers and desperation after their families are internally displaced within Afghanistan or flee as refugees; girls forced into marriage early by families that can no longer feed them because of the fighting and its economic consequences; and children subjected to sexual abuse such as the practice of bacha bazi by fighters.""

Against such a backdrop, the resilience of Barkatullah is all the more remarkable. But even this strong-willed child has fears. ""I like it a lot here; I don't want to go back home,"" he tells us, a day after one of his many surgeries. He shows us the list of names of his ""best friends"" — the staff at the children's ward — scribbled on his palms to help him remember and pronounce. ""They are helping me walk again,"" he adds gratefully. He says he prefers staying at the hospital rather than returning home.

Overhearing his son's remarks, his father, Abdul Rahman, is moved to tears. ""Our home isn't in a safe place and I don't want Barkatullah to return either,"" he admits with a heavy heart.

""Why don't you take him with you to your country?"" says the father as the photographer and I prepare to leave the hospital. ""He could have a better future there,"" he says, pleading for the safely of his only surviving child.

After one year on the job, the Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer speaks about the huge disparities he sees, aid worker security and his personal commitment to Afghanistan.

While the number of mine casualties is on the rise, funding for mine action in Afghanistan dropped by 65 per cent over the past five years.

ACBAR’s Twinning Program successfully teams up international and national NGOs to build capacities to the benefit of both counterparts.

Lack of basic services in three informal settlements in Nangarhar is exacerbated with new conflict displacements and arrivals from Pakistan

“It is a very tough place for aid agencies”

The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, took up his function one year ago. Now, the top humanitarian official talks about his first 12 months in country, discussions in donor capitals, changes in the security environment, Twitter and what UN and NGOs can expect from him in the future. The interview was edited for length and clarity.

OCHA: What stands out about Afghanistan to you after one year?

Toby Lanzer: One striking issue are the disparities between life in Kabul, a few other urban centres and the rest of the country. Sitting in the heart of Kabul, working closely with senior Government officials, the international and NGO community, I am exposed to the vision and plan to create a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. But there is a gap between that and what the average citizen of the country lives every day. And there is an even greater gap between this vision and the plan and what people feel who were struck by violence, displaced by conflict or forced to return to this country.

That is why humanitarian action remains so necessary, so relevant and yet amongst senior officials, including myself, often understated. We are all so focused on the future – peace, stability and prosperity – that sometimes not enough attention is paid to the suffering of today. It has taken me a long time to understand that because I sit in the middle of the green zone. In my first year here, I managed to visit almost 20 provinces, increasingly by road, to connect with the girls and the women, the boys and the men of this country. And what they tell me is “Yes, slowly things are getting better, but we are suffering”

What has been your main challenge as Humanitarian Coordinator?

Amongst my different interlocutors [including from the development and political portfolio] much of the conversation is about the search for a political resolution – peace – and nothing is more important for the tomorrow of this country. The thing is that today, there are people going hungry. The hardest thing for me was to understand the scale and the depth of suffering because much of my time was focused on the development agenda, on peace, on elections. But the humanitarian agenda in Afghanistan is as important and will benefit from more of my attention in my second year here.

With all the strategic plans and frameworks that you are involved in that aim at improving the situation in Afghanistan, what do you want to achieve personally? How far do you want to go with and for the people of Afghanistan?

Far! I will always try my hardest in settings where I think there is hope and where I think there is a national capacity to manage situations. And clearly there is [in Afghanistan] and there is a plan to put in place a system that will enable the government to meet its responsibility. And so, I am willing to invest a lot of my energy, my time and to use my networks to draw attention to the good things that are happening in Afghanistan.

The past year was marked by a record high number of civilian casualties, several high-profile attacks including one on a NGO compound in Jalalabad. In your view, what has changed for the humanitarian community – for UN and NGOs?

I am not sure I would separate the two. It is important to remember that as terrible as the 31 May explosion was, and as awful as the January attacks were, these are just three incidents in a long list of tragedies that have befallen the people of this country, including the NGOs. Look at what happened to MSF in 2015 [when the hospital in Kunduz was bombed] or what happened to ICRC in February 2017 [when 6 staff members were killed and 2 abducted]. The security environment has become more complex with more players. This evolution complicates the setting and the extent to which we are safe. And every time we are less safe, we lose contact with communities. And every time we lose contact with communities and elders, we become less safe. [Afghanistan] is a very tough place for aid agencies to work. One of the hardest in which I have been.

What do you do to help the UN Agencies and NGOs to stay and deliver?

The humanitarian imperative demands that NGOs and UN Agencies are as close to suffering communities as possible. To enable that, we need to have conversations with all parties to the conflict. Those conversations are a major component of what I do. Managing risk as opposed to avoiding risk is a major part of what I do. Enabling UN Agencies to drive along roads as opposed to travelling by helicopter is something I promote to connect us to communities and reduce costs. Both of which I hope to enable us to provide more assistance to the people who need it most.

You toured the European capitals, meeting politicians and donors at the highest levels. Is Afghanistan on their radar? Are you rattling at a closed door?

I knocked on the door, it is open and I will be walking through it more frequently. That said, everyone in Afghanistan needs to recognize that Afghanistan is one of a dozen countries where humanitarian needs are high. Donor capitals are stretched. The case we make must be compassionate, yet compelling and concerted. Our messaging is getting better, but we are not there yet.

I never have worked in a country before where there is so much development financing in the absence of peace. That is a good thing, but we need to leverage the interest of development donors to gain at the same time a bit more compassion for the suffering today.

You are active on Twitter. Why do you tweet and what message do you want to share with your more than 20,000 Followers? I mix Tweets on humanitarian, development and cultural issues. I am really into positive messaging, to show a side of Afghanistan that is not only negative. I tweet pictures of people I meet, children, mountains or jewelry – things that lets people identify themselves with Afghanistan. I use two hashtags that I came up with: #AfghanistanCan and #BeautifulAFG.

I do not know exactly what it is, but I am picking up more followers and getting lots of interaction in the past few weeks.

You have said that for the first year, you will listen and learn. What can we expect for your second year? And what will you tell the humanitarian partners?

I will continue listening more than I talk. One cannot learn enough about this country in one year and my commitment is multi-year, like the Humanitarian Response Plan. I will keep listening but I will be saying a few more things, too.

What will you be telling the humanitarian community?

A handful of NGOs here deserve enormous credit for being close to communities in rural areas and saving lives. I will do everything I can to help them to stay, protect and deliver and to enable a few more NGOs to replicate that very good practice.

Anything else you want to add and share with the readers?

I never liked the word resilience and I don’t use it here [in Afghanistan]. I have no place to talk about resilience where everyone is more resilient than I could ever hope to be. I admire the strength, the pride, the commitment of the people of Afghanistan to survive the 40th year of violence. Amid this misery, listening to a father who says “I want my girl to go to school” proves to me that there is real hope for this country and this hope lies within the strength of its people.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 74 | 1 March – 31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-74-1-march-31-march-2018

More U.S. military service members have died in aircraft mishaps over the past year than have died while serving in Afghanistan under the Operation Freedom’s Sentinel mission.

That terrible sentence makes me think there is a definite crisis in military aviation. It should give Pentagon leaders pause that a junior soldier can be more confident of their safety downrange, receiving imminent danger pay, than sitting in the back of a helicopter stateside.

Pentagon leaders, apparently, disagree.

“I would reject ‘wave’ and ‘crisis,’” Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., director the Joint Staff, told reporters Thursday at the Pentagon when asked about the recent, well, wave of air incidents that have killed 14 service members since the beginning of March.

“Those are that mishaps that occurred,” McKenzie continued. “We are going to look at each one in turn. Each one is tragic. We regret each one. I’m certainly not prepared to say it’s a wave of mishaps or some form of crisis.”

If this isn’t a crisis or a wave, I’d like to know what is:

That’s 47 service members dead, in just one year. Over that same time period, 31 service members died in Afghanistan.

16,afghanistan,"As the Afghan Government of National Unity takes steps to uphold stability and security, and to promote peace, NATO reaffirms its commitment to the development of the Afghan security and defence forces through a conditions-based approach for our Resolute Support Mission. We recognise and highly appreciate the essential contributions that the men and women in uniform from Allied nations, and from our Resolute Support Mission (RSM) operational partners, have provided over many years of NATO presence in Afghanistan.

At the second Kabul Conference of 28 February, President Ashraf Ghani took a decisive step toward Afghan reconciliation by proposing peace talks between the Government of National Unity and the Taliban, without preconditions. NATO Allies are united in their support for this proposal of an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process. We will respect and support a negotiated political settlement led by the Afghan Government which ends violence, cuts ties to terrorism and protects the human rights of all Afghan citizens. We also support the Afghan Government's intention to address all contested issues between the parties, including those relating to the future role of the international community in Afghanistan.

We urge the Taliban to respond favourably to this opportunity and participate in an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process. The responsibility to bring an end to a long era of conflict is now in the Taliban's hands.

We welcome the support for this proposal that was provided by countries within the region at the 27 March Tashkent Conference on Afghanistan. Regional actors have a significant role to play in support of peace and stabilization in Afghanistan. Pakistan facilitates important logistical supply lines for the Resolute Support Mission. We believe Pakistan's role will be important to a peace process, including in encouraging the Taliban to change their calculus. We encourage Pakistan to act on its stated support for a political solution to the Afghan conflict, to close terrorist sanctuaries and to work to prevent terrorist financial flows and cross-border attacks, including by working with its neighbours. We echo President Ghani's call on regional actors to cooperate more closely on fighting terrorism and to support the Afghan government's peace and reconciliation efforts. In this regard, we also encourage Iran and Russia to contribute to regional stability by fully supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.

Fair, inclusive and timely parliamentary and presidential elections due in 2018 and 2019 respectively are essential for peace, stability, and the consolidation of democracy. NATO therefore welcomes the recent announcement by the Afghan Independent Election Commission in setting the date for parliamentary elections on 20 October 2018. More broadly, we encourage Afghanistan to continue on the path to wider reform. The Government of National Unity will remain fully accountable for the commitments it made in this respect during the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan held on 4-5 October 2016, including the promotion of human rights, good governance, and combatting corruption in Afghanistan.

Allies are committed to strengthening Afghan security capabilities to tackle both internal security threats and terrorists who seek to use Afghanistan as a safe haven from which to plot attacks on other nations. NATO also supports the Afghan Government's determination to eliminate the threat of terrorism in all its forms, including that posed by ISIS/Daesh affiliates in Afghanistan.",Statement by Foreign Ministers on Afghanistan,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_154153.htm

Situation Overview

IOM is responding to a substantial increase in the return of undocumented Afghans from Pakistan and Iran. Since 01 January 2018, over 212,700 undocumented Afghans have returned due to diverse push factors, including deteriorating protection space in Pakistan and Iran. Most of those returning have lived outside of Afghanistan for decades, and will need support from the government and humanitarian actors both on arrival and as they seek to reintegrate. As the rate of return is influenced by a number of political, security and other related factors both in Afghanistan and neighboring countries, another surge in returns could occur at any time.

18,afghanistan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities will deport close to 600 illegal Afghan migrants in eastern Turkey back to Kabul this weekend, the interior ministry said on Saturday.

The Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey through Iran due to “ongoing terrorist activities and economic troubles” in Afghanistan, the ministry said, and security forces had handed the migrants over to provincial immigration authorities.

It said deportation procedures had been completed for 591 migrants in the eastern province of Erzurum and that charter flights to Kabul would be arranged on Saturday and Sunday to send the migrants back.

“Following the completion of deportation procedures for illegal migrants in our other provinces, deportations will speed up and continue in the coming days,” the ministry said in a statement.

Rights groups have criticised Turkey for deporting migrants back to conflict-torn countries, including Afghanistan, saying it was putting their lives at risk.

This week the Hurriyet newspaper reported that several thousand Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey in recent months and had walked for days from the border to reach Erzurum.

Afghanistan has been ravaged by militant attacks this year, and the government has made promises to tighten security in the wake of an attack in central Kabul that killed around 100 people in January.

The attacks have undermined support for President Ashraf Ghani, who offered in February to hold peace talks with Taliban insurgents fighting to drive out international forces and reimpose their version of strict Islamic law.

The Taliban have so far shown little sign of accepting the offer of talks with the Western-backed government, which they consider an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime, although they have offered to talk to the United States.",Turkey to deport nearly 600 Afghan migrants - interior ministry,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-afghanistan/turkey-to-deport-nearly-600-afghan-migrants-interior-ministry-idUSKBN1HE0DX
19,afghanistan,"Russia and Iran are ""propping up the terrorist networks that are killing innocent people"" in Afghanistan, the U.S. ambassador to NATO said Friday.

“Russia is not helping at all. ... Iran is not helping at all,” Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S.-backed outlet. “We hear this when we’re in Afghanistan, and we hear from the military leaders. They talk about the enablers — those who have the money and the capacity to be helpful but instead are really propping up the terrorist networks that are killing innocent people.”

U.S. officials have aired suspicions that Russia has been arming the Taliban over the past year, which Russia has denied.

Hutchison’s more-explicit rebuke comes as both sides contemplate their strategy for Afghanistan, 17 years after the United States first invaded in pursuit of Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda. Russia recently called for members of a security bloc that it leads with China to take an expanded role in the country, while representatives from the NATO alliance vowed Friday to continue backing the central government in Kabul.

“There should be no doubt about NATO's position: NATO will continue to provide the support that the Afghan Government has requested so we can help Afghanistan fully provide for its own security,” the top diplomats from every NATO member state said in a joint statement Friday.

Western officials chiefly focused on Pakistan when discussing the danger of Afghanistan’s neighbors undermining Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s efforts to negotiate a lasting peace. President Trump’s national security team developed a new strategy the region that prioritizes pressuring Pakistan to deprive terrorists of the safe havens that they use to launch cross-border attacks in Afghanistan.

But the NATO statement on Afghanistan also contained a challenge to Russia and Iran.

“We echo President Ghani's call on regional actors to cooperate more closely on fighting terrorism and to support the Afghan government's peace and reconciliation efforts,"" it said. ""In this regard, we also encourage Iran and Russia to contribute to regional stability by fully supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.”

Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has pointedly declined to dispute reports that Russia is arming the Taliban. Nicholson also protested in April “the overt legitimacy lent to the Taliban by the Russians.” More recently, Afghan forces have reported that Iranian commanders are participating in Taliban attacks.

Russian officials have hinted that they may take a larger role in Afghanistan, in the name of fighting terrorism. “We must redouble our efforts to preclude the proliferation of conflicts from Afghanistan and to promote a political settlement of the Afghan crisis,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.

Hutchison, a former Texas senator Trump appointed as the U.S. representative at NATO last year, said there’s a simple way for Russia to help.

“We call on Russia, Iran, and Pakistan to do more, and we call on places like India and China who could do more and have not gotten as involved as we think they could by — number one — saying to Pakistan: 'You have a chance to come in with the international community and be [involved in] a positive effort,’” she said. “‘We need to rally all of the capabilities that we have to stop terrorism in Afghanistan, which is then exported to many other countries around there. We want to stop it for the Afghan people and for all of the countries that would be invaded by terrorists.’”","US ambassador to NATO: Russia, Iran back Afghan terrorism",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/us-ambassador-to-nato-russia-iran-back-afghan-terrorism
20,afghanistan,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continued to remain grave in 2017 despite a reduction in needs at the mid-year mark from 9.3 million to 7.4 million. By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar province which registered a 310 percent increase in the numbers of internally displaced over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) and coalition forces’ escalating campaign to defeat non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the eastern region. Soaring suicide attacks and airstrikes – which increased by 50 percent and 68 percent respectively on 2016 – as well as more targeted NSAG assaults on military checkpoints and infrastructure also contributed to rising trauma cases.

Although overall civilian casualties decreased by 9 percent, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured). As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 percent of all civilian casualties. Unlike in 2016, however, when ground engagements comprised the largest proportion of deaths and injuries, combined improvised explosive device (IED) tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – accounted for 40 percent (4,151) of the total, highlighting the dangers posed to the population by NSAGs who, under increasing military pressure in the regions, are now resorting to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 included the forced closure of healthcare facilities by NSAGs as part of efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants, and which denied up to 1.4 million people (65 percent of them female) from access to essential services at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed or inactive due to the conflict according to the Ministry of Education. In order to address these issues and facilitate the creation of a protective environment in which Afghans are safe and free to go about their lives without fear of violence or harm, the protection cluster, in consultation with the HCT and ICCT, is developing a protection strategy in early 2018 to promote measures which support the reduction of civilian casualties and increase compliance with International Humanitarian Law / International Human Rights Law. These include the development of action plans and related advocacy to support the implementation of the National Policy on Civilian Casualty Prevention and Mitigation and the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, both recently endorsed by the government.

Despite initial projections of 1 million returns from Pakistan in 2017, an improved protection environment saw the arrival of just 156,140 Afghans in 2017 (98,140 undocumented returnees and 58,000 registered refugees). The decision of the Federal Cabinet of Pakistan in January 2018 to nevertheless issue the first ever 30-day extension of Proof of Registration cards to 1.4 million Afghan refugees prompted fears that a mass return was possible, if not imminent, and led to the development of an inter-cluster contingency plan to support 700,000 returnees with immediate humanitarian assistance totaling USD 198 million. Despite the Cabinet’s subsequent extension of PoR cards to 30 June 2018, the situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities. Partners on both sides of the border are currently monitoring the protection space for any signs of deterioration. While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, the tendency for existing returnee populations to settle in and around Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province – when combined with the significant numbers of internally displaced – has led to a doubling of the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66). As of November, more than 750,000 displaced populations lived in informal settlements in Nangarhar province, up from 429,000 in February, two thirds of which are concentrated in the two districts of Behsud and Sukhrod.

While natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected (a 20 percent reduction), the arrival of the La Niña weather effect at the end of 2017 has led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping season, leaving as many as 1 million people at risk of exposure to drought. In response, the ICCT has developed a contingency plan to provide emergency assistance (both in-kind and in cash) – totaling USD 110.4 million – to the most vulnerable households living across the 20 worst affected provinces.

Overall in 2017, humanitarian partners delivered life-saving assistance to 4.1 million people affected by conflict and natural disasters, sudden population movement and the effects of decades of underdevelopment and chronic poverty.

Humanitarian assistance was primarily delivered through medical care to the war wounded; emergency survival supplies of food, water and shelter to displaced and returnee populations, including multi-purpose cash grants (of which USD 35.9 million was disbursed) and sectoral support such as cash for food and cash for rent. As in previous years, humanitarian resources were also dedicated towards gapfilling for the provision of basic services, including healthcare and nutrition, with funds primarily targeted towards the 9 million people – approximately 40 percent of the population – affected by insufficient coverage of nationally-led systems or living in conflict-affected white areas.

Overall, the HRP received USD 320.7 million in committed funds representing 78 percent of overall requirements, making it the second highest funded HRP globally. As in previous years, the well-defined parameters of the plan, which focused on the provision of life-saving assistance, continued to resonate with donors who recognise the ongoing need for immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to be provided to populations for whom no alternative lifeline exists. The dedicated use of the 2nd CHF allocation 2017 to improve humanitarian response in hard to reach areas also helped to address existing imbalances in assistance provided to crisis-affected populations living in government and nongovernment held areas, the latter of which have typically been underserved in Afghanistan. During the year, humanitarian partners implemented programmes in almost 50 percent of all hard to reach districts (100) reaching more than 240,000 people in the process with emergency relief and protection assistance.

Despite these successes, a number of challenges remained.

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016 – when an unprecedented 675,000 were forced to flee their home – challenges with the existing IDP petition system led to some delays in the provision of emergency assistance and concerns that alternative models of IDP identification may be required in the future. At the same time, continued internal displacement, combined with ongoing returnee influxes, have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people residing in informal settlements, reinforcing the need for durable solutions which support reintegration, including the allocation of land and adequate housing and for which finalisation of an Executive Decree is still pending.

Indeed, with both short and long-term objectives now being pursued in parallel, Afghanistan is a defining example of the humanitarian-development nexus. Moving forward, it will therefore be a test of the humanitarian community’s ability to work in close cooperation with all relevant actors (including the UN, NGOs, development partners, the World Bank and donors), and with the government at both national and regional levels, to define collective outcomes and integrated responses, through multi-year joint planning which reduce needs, vulnerability and risk while at the same time building resilience.","Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 Year-End Report of Financing, Achievements and Response Challenges (January - December 2017)",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2017-year-end-report-financing
21,afghanistan,"BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - Earlier in the day, foreign ministers of NATO states on Friday held a meeting in Brussels to discuss the situation in the Middle East, cooperation with the EU and relations with Russia. They also urged Iran and Russia to contribute to the peace process in Afghanistan.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had discussed Russia with new US State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Friday.

""We had a time for a short bilateral meeting this morning that was very good and very useful. We addressed both the preparations for the upcoming summit in July, we addressed Russia, deterrence and defense,"" Stoltenberg said at a briefing.

NATO has been boosting its military presence in Europe, particularly in Eastern European states, since the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis, citing Russia's alleged interference in that conflict as a justification for the move.

Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations of its involvement in the Ukrainian conflict, while Russian authorities repeatedly said that NATO actions at the Russian border had destabilizing character.

Call for Peace in Afghanistan

""We echo President [Ashraf] Ghani's call on regional actors to cooperate more closely on fighting terrorism and to support the Afghan government's peace and reconciliation efforts. In this regard, we also encourage Iran and Russia to contribute to regional stability by fully supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process,"" the ministerial summit's final statement read.

The alliance also urged the Taliban movement to accept the Afghan president's proposal, who offered in February to hold peace talks with the insurgents.

""We urge the Taliban to respond favorably to this opportunity and participate in an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process. The responsibility to bring an end to a long era of conflict is now in the Taliban's hands,"" the statement said.

According to the statement, NATO pledged to continue providing support to the Afghan government to help it ensure the country's security.

Afghanistan has been experiencing significant political, social and security instability for decades, as various terrorist organizations continue to stage attacks against civilian and military targets. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces supported by the NATO-led units have been conducting joint operations to combat terrorism across the country.

""We also made progress in our preparations to launch a new training mission in Iraq at the Summit in July… Today we agreed on the concept of operations for our mission. This will include several hundred personnel. They will train Iraqi instructors, and develop Iraqi military schools,"" Stoltenberg said, as quoted by the NATO press service.

The NATO chief added that the mission aimed at assisting Baghdad in counterterrorism efforts, stabilization of Iraq and prevention of re-emergence of the Daesh*.

Iraq has been in a state of instability since the 2003 invasion of the US-led coalition that overthrew then-President Saddam Hussein. Since then, NATO has held a number of training missions in Iraq to increase the professionalism of Iraqi forces.

22,afghanistan,"The central bank of Afghanistan has granted a full banking licence to Islamic Bank of Afghanistan (IBA), making the latter the first full-fledged Islamic bank in the country.

The licence was granted by 9 April after IBA completed a conversion of its balance sheet, according to Faizan Ahmed, chief financial officer and member of the IBA board. He told Reuters that the bank had begun conversion of its assets and deposits in January.

IBA, previously known as Bakhtar Bank, had been operating under a conventional licence since its acquisition by Azizi Bank in 2009. The bank is midway through a new core banking implementation, started in December 2016 with Oracle and JMR Infotech.

The bank has paid-up capital of $25 million and held $187 million of deposits as of December 2017. It operates 59 branches across Afghanistan.

Though Islamic banking has been offered in Afghanistan via so-called “windows”, the country has had no full-fledged banks, something which is more common in neighbouring Pakistan.

Islamic windows allow existing traditional banks to offer a selection Shari’ah-compliant services, and are supported by Afghan United Bank, Ghazanfar Bank and Afghanistan International Bank in the country.

“Without any doubt, the commencement of banking operations of the first fully-fledged Islamic Bank encourages the Muslim nation to retain their capital in funds that have remained outside the banking circle,” said IBA CEO Amer Khalil-ur Rehman, CEO of IBA, at a launch ceremony.

Islamic improvement

In late 2017, the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries (ACCI) organized a conference on “Afghan Economic Growth through Islamic Banking” at Kabul Serena, aiming to promote awareness of Islamic banking’s potential.

“Awareness, bridging understanding gap & capacity building are the most demanded areas for promoting and strengthening Islamic banking and finance in those countries where the subject is in its introductory phases; Afghanistan being no exception,” said Fareedun Rostai, director of EmendGroup, an organisation dedicated to promoted Islamic finance.

Abdul Jabbar Safi, chairman of the Afganisatan Industrial Association, added: “Limited access to Islamic modes of finance is one of the various problems faced by the industrialists in Afghanistan. Islamic banking has started off with a good start, but it is vital that Islamic banks expand its product base, financing capabilities and ensure that the trust of the depositors and customers is strengthened for further growth of the banking as well as the industrial sector of the Country.”

Afganistan’s traditional banks have a somewhat chequered past. In 2010 Kabul Bank collapsed amidst a flurry of insider deals and $1 billion stolen by foreign donors. Officials are yet to recover the full amount stolen, and had, by 2011, only managed to reclaim around 10%.

Only a tenth of Afghans have bank accounts, and mistrust of the banking sector has kept account openings at a low level. According to the Economist, 24,000 safes were bought during the Kabul Bank crisis.",Afghanistan gains first full-fledged Islamic bank – IBS Intelligence,https://ibsintelligence.com/ibs-journal/ibs-news/afghanistan-gains-first-full-fledged-islamic-bank/

24,afghanistan,"Summary

As a landlocked country largely dependent on the water available in its major mountain rivers, modern Afghanistan has experienced a near constant state of water crisis, one that has frequently been exacerbated by intermittent civil wars from 1979 until the present. Without reliable sewage systems and power generation, Afghanistan has both a stagnant industrial sector and some of the worst sanitation facilities in the region: 59 percent of the water in urban areas of Kabul was found to be contaminated with bacteria according to one study done in 2003 by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources. Continuous fighting has taken a toll on Afghanistan’s water infrastructure, destroying much of the country’s network of meteorological and hydrological stations since 1980. When combined with the threat of widespread drought, ongoing war, and persistent poverty, an overall picture of persistent water conflict emerges.",Water Crisis Deepens the Misery in Afghanistan Civil War,https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/water-crisis-deepens-the-misery-in-afghanistan-civil-war/
25,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

26,afghanistan,"Taliban launches spring offensive; dashes Afghan peace hopes

KABUL: The Taliban’s announcement on Tuesday of the launch of its annual spring offensive has dashed the chances of peace talks with the Afghan government

The announcement follows last week’s deadly attack by Daesh on a voter registration center in Kabul.



“When the Taliban declares its spring offensive, it’s not only rejecting President Ashraf Ghani’s peace overture, but also launching a war against it,” Mohammed Daud Kalakani, a lawmaker from Kabul, told Arab News.



Since the announcement, the Taliban has unleashed a series of attacks, killing dozens of Afghan security personnel and the deputy governor of Logar province, Foreign Ministry officials told Arab News on Friday.



The offensive spells “disaster for the people,” Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed Radmanesh told Arab News.



“We have our own preparations, and have launched 11 offensives in different parts of the country.”



There have been at least six attacks on voter registration offices, including one in Kabul. The government has acknowledged that many of them are in areas beyond its control, but has vowed to beef up security for parliamentary elections scheduled for October.



There are fears that the Taliban offensive could escalate violence and reduce the chances of a transparent and secure election.



“So far, only 200,000 people have registered,” Ahmad Saeedi, an analyst and former Afghan diplomat, told Arab News.



“We have 13 million people qualified to vote, so even if we step up security and prolong the period of voter registration, possibly 1 or 2 million will register,” he said.



“Will this be enough of a turnout? Will the election be free, fair and transparent? No. The election will add to the crisis,” he added.



“Elections are held to bring political stability, but this one will increase the challenges for the government and the people.” Government officials insist the election will be held on time.",Taliban launches spring offensive; dashes Afghan peace hopes,http://www.arabnews.com/node/1292726/world
