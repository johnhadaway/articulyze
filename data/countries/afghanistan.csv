0,afghanistan,"BAMYAN - A new UN-backed radio series is promoting Afghan women’s public participation and leadership responsibilities in the central highlands province of Bamyan.

Designed to promote discussion and inspire change, the radio series features the work of several high-profile women, who talk about their career challenges and successes in the interest of inspiring girls and young women to make similar vocational choices.

One such woman, and the first to be featured in the new series, is Hakima Alizada, a defence lawyer and the head of women’s affairs in provincial office of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.

Speaking during the first episode aired by local broadcaster Nasim Radio to an audience estimated at 60,000 listeners in and around the provincial capital, Alizada called on young girls to pursue their education as an effective starting point that can enable them to aim higher in their career aspirations.

“In my early days, as the first female defence lawyer in Bamyan, I faced and overcame many challenges,” said Alizada, who described how she graduated from Herat University and then worked to defend women’s rights, litigating cases of domestic violence, discrimination and abuse.

She called on young people, especially girls, to be “agents of change” by getting involved in community initiatives, seeking out leadership opportunities and supporting peace-building and development initiatives.

Organized by UNAMA’s Bamyan regional office, the radio series will feature many other role models, all of them Afghan women, and is part of a country-wide outreach initiative aimed at creating platforms for local communities to engage in dialogue on key issues.

Bamyan, well-known for its archaeological monuments, is also known for having a generally positive approach to women’s social and political participation. But certain harmful practices and a lack of awareness about women’s rights have hindered the province’s potential to be a standout champion for women’s empowerment.

The UN is committed to supporting efforts by the Afghan government and is working with a variety of institutions and actors to promote gender equality, help reverse inequality and support local programmes aimed at expanding opportunities for women.

UNAMA supports the Afghan people and government to achieve peace and stability. In accordance with its mandate as a political mission, UNAMA backs conflict prevention and resolution, promoting inclusion and social cohesion, as well as strengthening regional cooperation. The Mission supports effective governance, promoting national ownership and accountable institutions that are built on respect for human rights.

UNAMA provides 'good offices' and other key services, including diplomatic steps that draw on the organization’s independence, impartiality and integrity to prevent disputes from arising, escalating or spreading.

4,afghanistan,"Thirty-year-old Mohammad isn’t sure who shelled his home in eastern Afghanistan’s Khogyani District: Taliban insurgents, or fighters aligned with the so-called Islamic State.

But when a rocket-propelled grenade struck three months ago, killing some of his livestock, he knew he could no longer stay.

“We had to leave that night. The battle had reached our doorsteps,” Mohammad said, standing outside his family’s new home: a bare, single room in a compound set amid tents and shanty homes near Jalalabad, the capital of the eastern province of Nangarhar.

This area, less than 100 kilometres from Mohammad’s former home, is among hundreds of patchwork settlements that have proliferated throughout Afghanistan over the last five years, fed by a steady surge of people uprooted by an intensifying conflict and others pushed back from neighbouring countries.

The displaced and the returnees throng together in swelling districts like Behsud, which curves around urban Jalalabad. In settlements spreading over once-barren land, people live clustered in tents, hastily built structures, or under the open sky.

Ivan Flores/IRIN A worker looks over a pile of stones for new construction at a settlement in Nangarhar Province’s Behsud District.

Their number has doubled over the past five years to more than 600 in the country’s worst-hit provinces, according to aid groups. In Nangarhar Province, wracked by insecurity and a prime destination for people returning from neighbouring Pakistan, almost one million people now live in these haphazard settlements – a figure that doubled over only seven months last year.

One in three people in Nangarhar is now either displaced or a returnee, with some 369,000 in Behsud alone, according to a recently released International Organisation for Migration survey. Each week, new violence brings more arrivals. Aid organisations can’t keep up, and the government has often stumbled in providing even basic support; food, shelter, and other fundamental needs are in short supply.

Analysts warn that the consequences of such widespread displacement may be felt for generations, as poverty rises and education rates fall.

“Our emergency response stocks have been largely exhausted by these displacements,” said William Carter, head of programme in Afghanistan for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which works with displaced communities in the region.

Across the country, more than 1.6 million people have been uprooted by conflict since 2015, and almost one million Afghans have returned from neighbouring Pakistan. Returnees from Iran and further abroad add to the turmoil.

Carter said donor funds to help people ousted by conflict have dwindled even while needs have soared. “So, whilst we are doing what we can, the future is somewhat bleak.”

Intensified battles

Afghanistan has seen decades of upheaval. But aid workers say recent violence is intensifying and becoming more complex: hundreds of thousands of civilians each year are caught in the crossfire between a growing number of combatants, including Taliban militants, IS-aligned fighters, militias, and NATO-backed government security forces.

Fighters aligned with IS have injected a new level of volatility into the mix in eastern Afghanistan, where it has carved out an enclave and staged attacks against the Taliban, the government, civilians, and aid groups – including a January attack on the offices of Save the Children in Jalalabad. The rise of the Islamic State Khorasan Province, as the local offshoot is sometimes known, has been rapid; it accounted for 1,000 civilian injuries and deaths in the country last year, according to UN figures, compared with a few dozen casualties only two years earlier.

“Thousands of families in eastern Afghanistan have had to flee their homes due to advances by groups aligned with the Islamic State,” Carter said. “But many families are simply fleeing armed conflict itself: the Islamic State is fighting the [Taliban], who is fighting Afghan National Defence and Security Forces, with the help of international special forces and airstrikes.”

Thirty-five-year-old Munir fled his home in Khogyani four months ago after the district descended into a battle zone.

“We left in large numbers with nothing but the clothes on our back, and each other,” Munir told IRIN. “A lot of our neighbours lost family members in the fighting.”

Today, his family lives in a tent in a crowded compound in Behsud, alongside others from his village who joined him on the midnight exodus.

Both Mohammad and Munir say they’ve been unable to find steady work.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Munir, 35, fled his home in the middle of the night in late 2017. He and his family now live in a tent on a compound in Behsud District, along with other people from his village.

Aid out of reach

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, which is also responsible for helping people displaced by conflict, has floated plans to build housing for both returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) across the country. In practice, however, many Afghans have had difficulty accessing aid for short-term, basic needs such as food and shelter.

According to a January study of displaced people in five provinces conducted by the NRC, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, and humanitarian research group Samuel Hall, only one quarter of displaced households surveyed reported receiving any aid whatsoever. The report also found that the process of registering for the government’s official aid programme for IDPs was bureaucratic, overly strict, and out of reach for the majority of people who needed it.

A separate December assessment of the displacement in Khogyani District – home to both Mohammad and Munir – found that the government was “not visible” in the response to the emergency.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Mohammad, 30, and his family, in the courtyard of their home in Behsud District. Mohammad’s single-room house is the only brick building in a compound filled with tents. But with little work available, he fears he can no longer afford the rent.

Officials at the refugees and repatriations ministry did not respond to IRIN’s requests for comment.

Displacement into informal settlements has also helped to make the Afghan capital, Kabul, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Around 1.5 million in 2001, its population is currently estimated at around six million and expected to reach eight million by 2020.

Analysts warn that the chronic displacement unfolding throughout the country will have long-term consequences that could span generations.

Nassim Majidi, director at Samuel Hall, says extreme poverty is likely to place greater pressure on families to push their kids to work. At the same time, research shows that many families are displaced multiple times, including many who return to Afghanistan from abroad only to find that the conflict has made their former homes unliveable.

“The humanitarian crisis will have social and political consequences,” said Majidi, who foresees repeated rounds of displacement, families split across borders, and a rise in child labour as Afghans resort to extremes to make ends meet.

“We’re facing wasted opportunities to educate the next generation, and instead facing intergenerational poverty,” she said.

While Mohammad’s five children aren’t yet working, they are no longer in school because he can’t afford to send them.

“If things don’t improve, at some point, they will have to work to help support the family,” he said.

Ivan Flores/IRIN Neighbours from Munir’s home village live in the same compound as his family in Behsud District. According to Munir, the families fled together “with nothing but the clothes on our back and each other”.

Outside his tiny new home in Behsud, Mohammad’s children played on a muddy road softened by rain; an open drain filled with garbage flowed nearby. There’s no running water; his family collects washing water from a muddy ditch shared with other families.

Conditions may be poor, but Behsud’s newly arrived say they have no illusions about returning home anytime soon.

Mohammad sometimes receives news from his village back in Khogyani – from others who are only now escaping.

“I hear our house is in ruins and the livestock have all died or been stolen,” he said. “There is nothing to return to but more battles.”

7,afghanistan,"(MENAFN - Wadsam) The Government of Japan has recently provided 5.3 million fund to UNHCR, UNICEF, UNMAS, WFP, WHO and IOM for humanitarian and emergency assistance in Afghanistan.

The funding from Japan will allow those agencies to address humanitarian challenges through provision of vital support to refugees returning from Pakistan and Iran, and to people suffering from food insecurity, malnutrition, natural disaster, displacement and other critical situations. The contribution responds to requirements under UNOCHA's 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan.

1) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) – USD 1,000,000Funding from the Government of Japan will support UNHCR to provide vital humanitarian assistance to returning Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran under the UNHCR facilitated Voluntary Repatriation Operation, as well as foster their sustainable reintegration in Afghanistan through community based programmes. While benefitting returning Afghans, such community based programmes also benefit internally displaced Afghans and local hosting communities. The funding will also contribute towards addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of the displaced populations and support refugees within Afghanistan. The overall funds will benefit an estimated 10,750 individuals.

2) United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) – USD 800,000

Contribution from the Government of Japan will enable UNICEF to provide education in emergency services to nearly 12,500 children (IDPs, returnees and their host communities) affected by emergencies. The project supported by the Japanese fund will also strengthening of coordination and information management of the Education in Emergency Working Group (EiEWG), with linkages to the Development Partners Group (DPG).

3) United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) – USD 1,000,000

Funding from the Government of Japan will support demining activities in Badakhshan, Balkh, Bamyan, Logar, Paktya, and Takhar provinces, where many communities remain affected by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW). It is expected that a total of 1.2 square kilometres of land will be cleared of landmines and ERW, directly benefitting over 7,300 people who reside within 1 km of contaminated areas, with indirect beneficiaries estimated at approximately 23,000. The assistance will contribute to socio-economic development as well as an overall reduction of civilian casualties. In particular, the support from Japan will contribute to initiatives including training and employment of female deminers, promoting active and meaningful female participation in mine action and fostering inclusive community resilience.

4) World Food Program (WFP) – USD 1,000,000With funding from the Government of Japan for its emergency response and the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS), WFP will be able to provide life-saving food assistance to more than 7,500 internally displaced persons and returnees and help 920 aid workers and up to 3mt of their cargo to fly to 25 hard-to-reach destinations across the country. UNHAS is an air transportation service that carries passengers and light cargo for humanitarian and development partners and provides timely medical and security evacuations as required.

5) World Health Organization (WHO) – USD 500,000

Funding of the Japanese Government through this project will ensure access to life-saving health care services to underserved populations and those displaced by conflict as well as the returnees from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. The support from Japan will contribute to strengthening capacities for effective trauma care, and avoiding preventable morbidity and mortality from conflicts and natural disasters. Under this project 5,200 severely injured victims of conflict will receive specialized trauma care services including major surgical interventions as 73,800 people will benefit from emergency medical and trauma care supplies through distribution by WHO.

6) International Organization for Migration (IOM) – USD 1,000,000Funding from the Government of Japan will support IOM to provide multi-purpose cash assistance to more than 2,000 highly vulnerable families returning from Iran. Japan's contribution will also help to facilitate the return of 30 qualified Afghans from Iran, at least 50% of whom are expected to be female, to work in, and transfer their skills to, public and private institutions in Kabul.

Japan has been strongly supporting Afghanistan's nation-building efforts in a wide range of fields from security to economic and social development, providing assistance in various sectors including political process, agriculture, education, health, infrastructure, rural development, and human capacity development.

Cumulative Japanese assistance to Afghanistan since 2001 amounts to USD 6.57 billion.

11,afghanistan,"INTRODUCTION

The Cluster Approach The cluster approach was established in 2005 following an independent Humanitarian Response Review, to address gaps and to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian response by building partnerships.

Thus, the cluster approach has been implemented for over 12 years now. Following the experience of the Humanitarian community in responding to the two L3s, the Haiti earthquake and the Pakistan floods in 2010, the IASC Principals “agreed there is a need to restate and return to the original purpose of clusters, refocusing them on strategic and operational gaps analysis, planning, assessment and results”. At the global level, the aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian needs by ensuring that there is a predictable leadership and accountability in all the main sectors or areas of humanitarian response.

Similarly, at the country level the aim is to strengthen humanitarian response by demanding high standards of predictability, accountability and partnership in all sectors or areas of activity. The cluster is about achieving more strategic responses and better prioritization of available resources by clarifying the division of labour among organizations, better defining the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian organizations within the sectors, and providing the Humanitarian Coordinator with both a first point of call and a provider of last resort in all the key sectors or areas of activity.

Afghanistan WASH Cluster The WASH cluster was first established and activated in 2008 in Afghanistan and UNICEF in the capacity of cluster lead agency was assigned the role of cluster coordinator. The cluster coordination responsibility was transferred to WHO and NGO MEDAIR in 2014 for a period of one year, however it came back to UNICEF since January 2015. WASH cluster has remained active since its inception and has been involved in preparedness and response activities including devising tools and standards and organizing awareness and skill development initiatives to strengthen cluster capacity and ensuring timely and coordinated response in emergencies.

The cluster systems in Afghanistan is coordinated by UNOCHA Afghanistan and WASH cluster actively participates in all Inter Cluster Coordination Team (ICCT) meetings. Coordinating its diverse portfolio of more than 40 partners, WASH cluster harmonizes submission of proposal to Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) and plays an important role in UN CERF fund mobilization.

The Afghanistan National WASH Cluster (ANWC) is supported by regional coordination mechanisms (often referred as regional clusters) where UNICEF’s five regional offices coordinate WASH partners through quarterly meetings. The OCHA also participates in these meetings. The department of Provincial Rural Rehabilitation and Development (PRRD) from the region provide update on humanitarian needs and response carried out in their provinces and the minutes of the meetings are shared with ANWC. In some provinces with higher humanitarian case-loads, WASH partners also meet independent to the regional meetings and these meetings can be more frequent.

At the national level, UNICEF is the Cluster Coordinator and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) is the national co-lead. There are other two co-leads in WASH Custer representing humanitarian agencies, namely DACAAR and NCA.","Afghanistan National WASH Cluster, Cluster Coordination Performance Monitoring (CCPM) Final Report – 2017",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-national-wash-cluster-cluster-coordination-performance-monitoring

The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) has received a contribution of USD 9.3 million to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action (UN VTF) from the Government of Japan to undertake critical humanitarian mine action programming in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and South Sudan. Japan is one of the largest donors to the UN VTF providing over USD 132 million since 2010. In addition to its financial support, UNMAS benefits from the provision of Japanese in-kind personnel.

“The United Nations thanks the Government and People of Japan for their continued commitment to mine action,” stated Agnès Marcaillou, the Director of UNMAS. “Enduring conflicts, as we see in the Middle East and Africa where Japan is focusing its funding, have resulted in an unprecedented level of contamination by unexploded bombs, rockets and other ammunition. With Japanese support, UNMAS will continue to clear land and open roads allowing refugees and displaced people to return home and enable humanitarian actors to reach populations in need. This work will save lives and provide hope and opportunity for some of the poorest communities in the world.”

His Excellency Dr. Toshiya Hoshino, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations, said, “Humanitarian action cannot be undertaken without mine action. Nor can displaced people return home, or civilians live in safety and escape poverty. Mine action is, therefore, a prerequisite for sustainable development as well as for human security. Based on this idea, Japan has been placing assistance to mine action as one of its diplomatic priorities, and this year’s assistance is also in line with this firm commitment. As one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Mine Action, Japan expects this assistance will be used in an effective and coordinated manner. Japan will continue to play an active role in mine action in collaboration with the United Nations, the Member States, and civil society organizations to achieve our collective goal of creating a mine-free world.”

In these turbulent times, the needs of the humanitarian mine action sector are increasing as highlighted earlier this month when the United Nations launched the Portfolio for Mine Action Projects for 2018. The Portfolio shows the funding requirements increased by 29 per cent compared to 2017, to USD 661 million. With 27 per cent of the total secured, USD 483 million more is needed for clearance of explosive hazards, risk education, and support to victims and their communities. The Portfolio is available online at: http://www.mineaction.org/resources/portfolios.

Finance Minister Eklil Hakimi said this money would be invested in healthcare services for remote areas, the implementation of the Digital CASA project, increasing capacity of state-owned banks, and in standardizing services in banks.

“At least $40 million American dollars which will be spent for capacity building at the state-owned bank and for enabling them to work based on international norms,” Hakimi added.

Addressing the signing ceremony, Public Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz said healthcare services will improve in remote areas once the project is implemented.

“The difference with this project is that it is focusing on some key parts. The priority is accountability,” Feroz said.

Meanwhile, Minister of Communications and Information Technology Shahzad Aryobi said the Digital CASA project will be implemented in all provinces in order to improve fiber optic cable services.

“The important part of this project is cyber security. We will boost cyber security through this project,” he said.

“Afghanistan is implementing an ambitious reforms program in a context of strong budget pressures imposed by low domestic revenue, though improving, (there is) massive security spending and enormous development needs,” said Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Afghanistan.

“In this challenging environment, we remain committed to helping the government of Afghanistan further improve service delivery to the Afghan people. For example, the new health project will improve health and nutrition services for the entire population of the country in all 34 provinces,” he added.",World Bank Grants $691m In Aid To Afghanistan,https://www.tolonews.com/business/world-bank-grants-691m-aid-afghanistan
14,afghanistan,"On February 20, 2018, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with his Pakistani counterpart Khawaja Muhammad Asif to discuss the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Afghanistan. In a press conference after their meeting, Lavrov described the presence of ISIS in northern and eastern Afghanistan as “rather serious,” and alleged that there were thousands of ISIS gunmen operating across the war-torn country.

Lavrov’s statement on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan was widely criticized in the United States. In an interview with the BBC World Service, General John Nicholson, the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, argued that Russia has exaggerated the ISIS threat in Afghanistan to justify its provisions of military assistance to the Taliban. Navy Captain Tom Gresback, the public affairs director at Resolute Support headquarters, also concurred with Nicholson’s assessment by claiming that there is little evidence that ISIS is expanding its military presence in Afghanistan.

Russia’s frequent exaggerations of the Islamic State’s presence in Afghanistan are closely intertwined with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s broader internal consolidation and foreign policy objectives. Russian policymakers have emphasized the ISIS threat to unite anti-Western nationalists around Russia’s expanded diplomatic involvement in Afghanistan, strengthen Moscow’s alliances with Central Asian countries, and establish common ground with Pakistan on the resolution of Afghanistan’s political crisis.

Since U.S. President Donald Trump authorized a MOAB (“mother of all bombs”) strike in April 2017 that killed 92 ISIS militants in Afghanistan, Russian officials have argued that U.S. policymakers have become complacent about the Islamic State’s ability to threaten regional stability. To highlight this perceived policy failure, Russia’s special envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov released a statement in December 2017 that praised Russia for being one the first countries to label ISIS as a major security challenge, and claimed that over 10,000 ISIS militants were present in Afghanistan, with many arriving from Syria and Iraq.

Even though Kabulov downgraded his estimate to 7,000 fighters on February 1, the narrative that Washington has not adequately responded to the Islamic State’s rise remains at the forefront of Russian official rhetoric on Afghanistan. In late February, Lavrov reiterated Kabulov’s concerns about ISIS fighters migrating from the Middle East to Afghanistan, and decried NATO’s failure to devote adequate resources to defeating this threat.

Even though Lavrov has struggled to sell the case for a rising ISIS threat to U.S. policymakers, the notion that the United States is facilitating the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan resonates powerfully within Russia. Quoting statements from Iranian military officials and Afghan policymakers, Russian state media outlet Sputnik has prominently featured allegations that the United States is supporting ISIS in Afghanistan to weaken the Taliban’s influence in the country. As these conspiracy theories are gaining broader acceptance in Russia, highlighting the ISIS threat ensures that anti-Western policymakers accept the need for an expanded Russian diplomatic role in Afghanistan.

In addition to bolstering internal support for the revival of Russia’s diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, Russia has focused on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan to establish more mutually beneficial alliances with its Central Asian partners. This strategy has reaped dividends, as Central Asian countries view ISIS as a legitimate security threat and a highly visible nemesis to rally public support against. Although Kyrgyzstan was noncommittal about assisting Russia’s military intervention in Syria, it has cooperated closely with Moscow against the ISIS threat from Afghanistan. The Kyrgyz military has also been active participant in Russian-led military drills aimed at increasing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)’s preparedness against the threat of ISIS in Afghanistan.

Even though Russian officials have historically chastised Tajikistan for its ineffective border security policies, Moscow’s emphasis on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan has created a sense of urgency in Dushanbe that has enhanced Russia-Tajikistan security cooperation. In recent months, Tajikistan has allegedly assisted Moscow’s supplies of light weaponry to the Taliban’s anti-ISIS operations, and facilitated Russia’s pre-emptive defensive measures against ISIS by acting as a conduit for the movement of Russian armored vehicles to Afghanistan’s frontiers.

Russia views these displays of support against ISIS as encouraging, because they allow Moscow to frame itself as a benevolent protector of Central Asian countries against terrorism rather than as a hegemonic actor. As many Central Asian governments continue to view the securitization of Islamic extremism as a useful tool for regime consolidation, Moscow is likely to be able to use its anti-ISIS efforts in Afghanistan to bolster the effectiveness of its regional alliances.

The Russian government’s successful engagement of its Central Asian partners against the ISIS threat in Afghanistan has encouraged Kremlin officials to focus on ISIS during their diplomatic negotiations with Pakistan. While joint pledges from Islamabad and Moscow to combat ISIS have been largely rhetorical in nature, Russian policymakers have been cautiously optimistic that increased dialogue on combatting ISIS will result in more extensive bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.

On March 21, Russia held a Joint Working Group (JWG) on counterterrorism with Pakistan at the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad. After this JWG, officials from both countries described the threat of ISIS in Afghanistan as a “grave concern,” and argued that the diffusion of foreign fighters from Iraq and Syria to South Asia was a major threat to regional stability.

Despite the lack of evidence for a rising ISIS presence in Afghanistan, Pakistani officials have shared Russia’s focus on ISIS in Afghanistan, because Islamic State’s rise is a symbol of the ineffectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism strategies in South Asia. As Pakistan continues to face international scrutiny for its links to the Taliban and Haqqani Network, Russia’s strategy of blaming Washington for the poor security situation in Afghanistan is appealing to Pakistani policymakers, and could cause collaboration against ISIS to act as a stepping stone for a more comprehensive Russia-Pakistan security partnership.

Even though ISIS appears to be a declining force in Afghanistan, Russian officials have exaggerated its presence to gain domestic support for Moscow’s diplomatic initiatives in Afghanistan, upgrade its alliances with Central Asian countries, and strengthen Russia’s burgeoning partnership with Pakistan. The success of this strategy ensures that Russia will continue to frame its involvement in Afghanistan around combatting the receding threat of ISIS for the foreseeable future.

15,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, right, greets John Bolton, President Trump’s choice to be national security adviser, as he arrives at the Pentagon on March 29. (Reuters)

John Bolton takes over as national security adviser today in the midst of a new national security crisis: another chemical attack in Syria. President Trump responded with strongly worded tweets blaming both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warning there would be a “big price to pay.”

Bolton is known for his hawkish views and general belief that the United States should use military power preemptively. Trump’s views on conflicts like that in Syria have been inconsistent, even contradictory. As recently as last week, the president was apparently disagreeing with his own Pentagon when he said the United States should get out of Syria immediately. Yet one of his tweets during the weekend implied that stronger U.S. action might have stopped Assad.

But that’s only the latest crisis. Bolton and the Trump administration will also be confronting the looming diplomatic encounter with North Korea and ongoing challenges like the war in Afghanistan and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. As they do so, keep this basic point in mind: In many of these regional conflicts, the United States has a limited amount of leverage or is at the mercy of forces beyond its control.

That doesn’t mean the United States has no power, or that individuals like Bolton and Trump don’t matter; my book about how presidents shape military interventions argues that they do. But international relations scholars know well that international forces and other countries’ interests and domestic politics can be powerful constraints on what the United States can do to shape events, particularly in regional conflicts. That’s important to remember in the constant ebb and flow of news.

Several recent TMC posts examine those constraints in different parts of the world. Let’s take a look.

China will have a big say in what happens next with North Korea

After Trump’s announcement that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, China and North Korea had a surprise of their own to unleash: Kim made a secretive visit to Beijing. Here at TMC, Rush Doshi explored three takeaways from the meeting. Doshi concludes, “Beijing has strong incentives to push for full involvement in the forthcoming talks. Diplomacy over North Korean denuclearization remains fluid and volatile, but one thing remains clear: Xi Jinping won’t be content to stay on the sidelines.”

China itself has a complex and volatile relationship with North Korea. But whatever Bolton’s and ultimately Trump’s plans for North Korea, they must account for China’s increasingly active role.

Regional conflicts have their own internal dynamics that resist U.S. intervention

Recently, there has been renewed talk of a peace settlement in Afghanistan, where much to Trump’s apparent chagrin, U.S. forces remain on the ground. But how likely is a peace deal?

As Asfandyar Mir lays out clearly in his recent Monkey Cage post, internal dynamics and domestic politics within Afghanistan could derail peace at any step: during negotiations, defining exactly what a deal would look like, dealing with spoilers, putting a deal into force and, finally, possibly spilling back into civil war. The United States has little power to change most of these factors. Indeed, as Greg Jaffe recently wrote at The Post, top military officials now talk about “winning” in conflicts like Afghanistan not in terms of outright victory, but in keeping a permanent presence, an “infinite war.”

Many of Mir’s points about Afghanistan probably also apply to Syria, where realistic military options are hard to identify. Last year, after another alleged chemical attack, the United States struck Syria with a cruise missile. Marc Lynch wrote here that the strike alone wouldn’t shift the overall strategic stalemate in Syria. There is little reason to imagine things are much different this time.

Bolton’s hawkish views come from the era of unchallenged U.S. power after the Cold War — which is coming to an end

Bolton is best known for serving in the George W. Bush administration, when U.S. military power was largely unchallenged. As Joshua Shifrinson argued here at the Monkey Cage, “In an age of overwhelming U.S. military dominance, there is no other country to push back when the United States gets aggressive. As a result, militant and assertive views have more scope to shape policy.” Bolton’s hawkish views are partly a symptom of post-Cold War U.S. world dominance.

Shifrinson concludes that other countries like China may be challenging U.S. economic power, but that the United States still has a clear military advantage. That might make military force look more attractive to many in the White House, “because that is where the United States outcompetes the rest of the world.” Thus, “with U.S. power dominant but waning, Bolton’s elevation reminds us there are few limits to — and some momentum behind — a militaristic U.S. foreign policy.”

Alliances and diplomacy remain important for addressing regional conflicts

Trump and Bolton both appear to disdain alliances and many forms of diplomacy. But the ongoing challenges facing the United States show how important these tools can be.

For example, Stephan Haggard explained here how sanctions have actually worked to bring the confrontation with North Korea to this point. Multilateral coordination, always difficult with sanctions, turned out to be crucial. As Haggard notes, “The concerns now rest with a U.S. administration prone to grand gestures but with a foreign policy bench depleted to some extent by turnover. The United States faces the challenge of coordinating at the multilateral level and with China to maintain the sanctions pressure that will lead to talks.”

Although David Bosco recently argued here that Bolton has an underappreciated record of multilateralism, neither Bolton nor Trump is known for the kind of repeated, patient diplomacy Haggard suggests will be crucial for successful North Korea talks. Indeed, as Mira Rapp-Hooper has pointed out in several pieces here, Trump’s threats against North Korea have more often harmed U.S. alliances than changed the dynamics with Kim.

Taken together, these arguments have a sobering message for the president and his new national security adviser. Trump and Bolton will certainly put their own stamp on U.S. policy over the next few months. But they’ll have to contend with a host of complicated forces beyond their control, and will have less power to shape other regions’ conflicts than they may wish. The United States has had to relearn this lesson many times — often painfully, especially in the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.","Bolton starts today, with a Syria crisis on the agenda.

A Cycle of Return, Displacement and Migration

When Mohammad Afshar poured a can of fuel over himself and fumbled with the box of matches he was determined to end his life. This was on 15 November 2017. The father of 12 children and husband to two wives had exhausted all means to provide for his family and hardship seemed just too much to bear. He had sold one of his sons for Afs5,000 Afghani (US$80) to buy food, another son had died when the walls of the house collapsed under heavy snow and two daughters had frozen to death because he couldn’t afford enough blankets to keep them warm in winter.

A few weeks before the incident, he planned to sell their youngest daughter but was stopped only by his wife: “I would rather all of us die, than lose another one of my children”, she said. That was the moment he had decided to end his life in protest in front of the District Governor who visited the village. Only the quick reaction of bystanders who took the matches from his fingers foiled his plan.

Within days of their arrival in Afghanistan, they became internally displaced before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, Mohammad Afshar worked as a farmer on his land in his village in Takhar Province. In 1998, he and his family moved to Quetta in Pakistan to escape Taliban rule. “I found a job in a brick factory as a daily worker,” he remembers. “My income was decent and we were happy.”

But in 2016, after 18 years in Pakistan where he never tried to obtain or was asked for any kind of documentation, the harassment and extortion by Pakistani police reached their peak. He decided to return to Afghanistan.

When he arrived back in his old village in Takhar, the family’s house had been destroyed and the fields had been taken over by armed men. Having spent many years in exile he did not have the necessary support in the community to reclaim his property.

He and his family left the village and moved to another district into an abandoned building without doors or windows. Within days of their arrival in their home country, Mohammad Afshar and his family had joined the ranks of internally displaced people (IDPs).

One quarter of all returnees know they cannot return to their home villages Mohammad Afshar is not an isolated case: more than 100,000 Afghan IDPs and returnees currently live in improvised shelters, tents or under open sky, with more than 51,000 in Nangarhar province alone. This according to the latest results of IOM Afghanistan’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Baseline Mobility Assessments, conducted in December 2017 in 15 provinces of highest return and displacement.

Last year, one quarter of all returnees from Pakistan arrived in Afghanistan with no intention of returning to their province of origin. This is up from just over one fifth in the previous year. Of significant note, 67 per cent of Afghan returnees in 2017 with roots in Kunar Province had no intention to return to Kunar, where conflict has intensified in the past months and members of the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) are trying to gain influence. Among these, 86 per cent decided to settle in Nangarhar Province instead, notably in and around Jalalabad City.

“Insecurity is not the only reason for post-return displacement,” explains Michael Speir, IOM Afghanistan’s DTM Coordinator. “As in the case of Mohammad Afshar, many Afghan families who have lived abroad for decades only discover upon their return that their houses have been destroyed and their land taken away. Stripped of their homes and any opportunities to secure their living, these people have no other option but to seek alternative places to live.”

Lack of opportunities and services in rural areas furthers urbanization

Reasons why Afghans can’t return to their places of origin, especially in rural areas, include a lack of job opportunities and social services, such as schools, health facilities or markets.

More than 700,000 returnees and IDPs in the 15 assessed provinces reported to have no access to education, almost two million don’t have access to a doctor, and more than 1.5 million don’t have access to a market to buy and sell goods, including food items, according to IOM’s latest DTM results (see graph).

Mohammad Afshar’s case also explains the trend of urbanization in Afghanistan. “Before he left Afghanistan two decades ago, Mohammad Afshar was a farmer,” notes Speir. “When he moved to Quetta in Pakistan, the urban labour market required a different skill set. Then, upon return to his rural village in Takhar, there was no need for his urban ‘daily labor’ skills acquired in Pakistan. Ultimately, with no access to his former land and faded farming skills, he really struggled to ensure the survival of his family in rural Takhar.

Sadly, the extreme coping mechanism of selling his children was his last resort.” Lack of shelter, job opportunities and no school for returnees to Afghanistan Another case is that of Zabihullah and his family who also lived in Pakistan for many years. “One day, a representative from the Government of Afghanistan came to our camp and told us that if we return, we will be given shelter and jobs. Because the harassment in Pakistan was getting worse, I decided to bring my wife and five children back to our home district in Baghlan,” he explains. ”But there were no shelters and no job opportunities.” His children were not even able to go to school, because he could not provide the required certification.

When the tent that the family was forced to live in was washed away in a flash flood, Zabihullah was lucky to save all his family members, but lost most of his belongings. Zabihullah has decided to return to Pakistan, despite renewed uncertainty over the fate of Afghan citizens living in Pakistan.

Returnees at risk of cyclical, unsafe migration movements

“This is exactly what we don’t want to happen – cyclical, unsafe migration movements, because people get pushed from province to province, or from country to country,” says IOM Afghanistan’s Chief of Mission, Laurence Hart.

“Migration movements in Afghanistan have become coping mechanisms. The more often Afghans are forced to migrate, the more vulnerable they become, and the less likely it gets that they will be able to reintegrate,” the head of IOM Afghanistan explains.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 73 | 1 – 28 February 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-73-1-28-february-2018
18,afghanistan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities will deport close to 600 illegal Afghan migrants in eastern Turkey back to Kabul this weekend, the interior ministry said on Saturday.

The Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey through Iran due to “ongoing terrorist activities and economic troubles” in Afghanistan, the ministry said, and security forces had handed the migrants over to provincial immigration authorities.

It said deportation procedures had been completed for 591 migrants in the eastern province of Erzurum and that charter flights to Kabul would be arranged on Saturday and Sunday to send the migrants back.

“Following the completion of deportation procedures for illegal migrants in our other provinces, deportations will speed up and continue in the coming days,” the ministry said in a statement.

Rights groups have criticised Turkey for deporting migrants back to conflict-torn countries, including Afghanistan, saying it was putting their lives at risk.

This week the Hurriyet newspaper reported that several thousand Afghan migrants had crossed into Turkey in recent months and had walked for days from the border to reach Erzurum.

Afghanistan has been ravaged by militant attacks this year, and the government has made promises to tighten security in the wake of an attack in central Kabul that killed around 100 people in January.

The attacks have undermined support for President Ashraf Ghani, who offered in February to hold peace talks with Taliban insurgents fighting to drive out international forces and reimpose their version of strict Islamic law.

Only Russia can help Afghanistan in counterterrorism efforts, not the United States that have been killing Afghans for the past 17 years and is behind Afghanistan crisis, Karzai said.

“Neither the Brits, who we have kicked out of the country several times, nor the Americans (can help Afghanistan) as they've been killing us for 17 years; only Russia can (help).

“Americans lie when they say that al-Qaeda emerged as the result of your [Russia’s] invasion. They used the war to develop al-Qaeda in military camps in Pakistan. They wanted to be the only superpower and they did it. The USSR collapsed and one of the reasons was the Afghan war,” Karzai said.

KABUL — The U.S. military said Monday that it has killed the senior leader of an Islamic State enclave in northern Afghanistan, highlighting an evolving fight that expanded more than a year ago after the militant left the Taliban in a dispute.

Qari Hikmatullah and his bodyguard were killed while walking in the Bal Chiragh district of Faryab province on Thursday, said Army Col. Lisa Garcia, a U.S. military spokeswoman. News of the strike began circulating in Afghan media and among local officials on Saturday, with some Afghan officials pinpointing its location a short distance over a provincial border in the Darzab district of Jowzjan province, about 275 miles northwest of Kabul.

Qari Hekmat, as Afghan officials commonly call him, was born in Uzbekistan, called Jowzjan home and spent years as a Taliban commander there.

The death draws attention to a remote area of Afghanistan where the Taliban and Islamic State fighters have battled each other. The Taliban attempted to mount an offensive last year to take back Hikmatullah’s district of Darzab and nearby areas. Hikmatullah’s group withstood the attacks, and Hikmatullah himself survived at least two assassination attempts by the Taliban, said one Afghan security official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

The U.S. military said in its statement Monday that Hikmatullah “had a history of divided loyalties,” initially serving as a leader in the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) before joining the Taliban and ultimately starting an Islamic State enclave. He is expected to be replaced by Mawlavi Habibul Rahman, another native Uzbek who has past ties with the Taliban, the U.S. statement said.

[ How the Islamic State gained a foothold in Afghanistan ]

Some Afghan officials have said that the airstrike was carried out by the Afghan air force, but the U.S. military statement specifically said it was a U.S. strike. The top coalition commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., nonetheless credited both the U.S. military and the Afghan Special Security Forces.

“ASSF and U.S. counterterrorism forces killed Hikmatullah, and they will kill any successors. IS-K will be eliminated,” he said, using an abbreviation for the terrorist group that stands for Islamic State-Khorasan.

Garcia said the Islamic State is believed to have about 2,000 fighters across Afghanistan, with concentrations in southern Nangahar province, Konar province and Jowzjan. Counting them can be difficult, with militants like Hikmatullah sometimes rebranding themselves.

Nicholson has said that IS-K is in three locations: southern Nangahar, Konar and Jowzjan. Afghan and U.S. forces are attacking all three of these locations. IS-K has tried to expand its presence but has been unable to do so, Nicholson said, adding that wherever its fighters are and whenever they emerge to threaten the Afghan people, IS-K will be eliminated. He said U.S. forces in Afghanistan will support Afghan government forces in achieving this goal and that there will be no safe haven for any terrorist group.

Hikmatullah led a group that is believed to have included hundreds of local militants, as well as several dozen foreign fighters originally from Uzbekistan. His activities focused mostly on isolated, poor villages, dominated by ethnic Uzbeks. He banned television and occasionally staged brutal public punishments after he took over, Afghan officials said.

The head of the Jowzjan provincial council, Abdul Hai Hayat, said Hikmatullah was killed in the Khawaja Arab village of Bal Chiragh district, which sits on the border with Jowzjan. Hayat said that Hikmatullah was ruthless and that his group beheaded a well-known cleric. In another case, his men killed someone, filled a bag with dismembered remains and displayed it publicly as a macabre warning.

Not all Islamic State fighters in northern Afghanistan are happy with the selected successor, and there has been fighting among Islamic State members for several days, Hayat said. Now is the best time for the Afghan government to attack them, he added.

Gen. Mohammad Radmanesh, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, said Monday that Hikmatullah was on the target list of both U.S. and Afghan forces and was killed in a mountainous region. His successor “does not have the efficiency and experience that he did,” the Afghan spokesman said.

Bill Roggio, who analyzes terrorist groups for the Long War Journal, said Hikmatullah’s fighters had begun to expand south from Jowzjan to Faryab province, taking shelter in Uzbek enclaves. Security in Faryab has worsened over the past several years. The Islamic State has played a role in that, but the Taliban also is very active in the province, Roggio said.

The U.S. military said Monday that it has combined with Afghan special operations forces on several other operations in the region, which depleted the options for who might replace Hikmatullah. They included a nighttime raid that began March 26 before midnight and killed an Islamic State platoon commander, and a March 16 airstrike that killed two other Islamic State platoon commanders as they met in neighboring Sar-e Pol province.
