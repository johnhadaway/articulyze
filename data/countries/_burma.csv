Anne Main MP has met with Foreign Office minister Mark Field after lobbying his department to help the Rohyingya refugees.

The minister met members of the all-party parliamentary group on Bangladesh and Burma, which Mrs Main chairs, to discuss the Myanmar minority who have been forced out of the country by its government.

Mrs Main said: “I am grateful the minister answered our calls and came to address the group. I have no doubt about his passion and desire to improve this awful situation. We must not let this dreadful humanitarian tragedy slip from the news.”

The St Albans MP visited Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh last September and has pushed the UK government to do more for them. The government has promised over £30m for the region.

At the meeting, Mr Field made a short speech then took questions from MPs and peers and spoke about the government’s commitment to finding a diplomatic solution for the Rohyinga, who were stripped of citizenship by Myanmar’s former military government in 1982, when the county was still called Burma.

He agreed with Mrs Main that greater pressure needed to be exerted on the Myanmar government by other countries, and raised the possibility of a UN Security Council resolution to hold them to account.

Two permanent members of the council, China and Russia, vetoed a resolution in the UN General Assembly last year which urged Myanmar’s military to end their campaign against the Rohyinga.

Mrs Main said after the meeting: “I was pleased with the minister’s frank responses. I can tell he cares deeply about this issue and he wants the best for the refugees.

“The fact we are the largest individual bilateral donor to the crisis speaks volumes. We must also look to make sure the staggering estimate of $1 billion in humanitarian aid needed for the camps next year goes to the right places, and not into the hands of people looking to exploit the Rohingya.

“I hope the government continue to lead on this and we see further international support for the Rohingya, especially with monsoon season on the way.”",http://www.hertsad.co.uk/news/st-albans-mp-rohingya-meeting-1-5454534

Win Myint will continue his predecessor's deference to Ms Suu Kyi as the de facto national leader.

The 66-year-old, who is the former lower house speaker, took his oath of office during a joint session of parliament, pledging loyalty ""to the people and the republic of the Union"" of Burma.

First vice president Myint Swe, a military nominee and second vice president Henry Van Tio, an upper house parliament nominee, took oaths alongside him.

Ms Suu Kyi and powerful army chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing watched the swearing-in.

For many years a political prisoner under the military that then ruled Burma, Ms Suu Kyi cannot become president because the junta-drafted 2008 constitution bars those with foreign family, which directly aimed to bar Ms Suu Kyi from becoming head of state. Her two sons are British.

Burma's military ruled with an iron fist before handing power to a civilian government led by Ms Suu Kyi in 2016.

The military still holds considerable power, with control of national security and other government functions and a quarter of the seats in Parliament.

Ms Suu Kyi said when her government took office that she would be ""above the president"". She led the government in that manner during the presidency of her close friend, Htin Kyaw, who retired last week because of ill health.

In his inaugural speech, Win Myint vowed to work on amending the constitution.

""As part of the priorities of the union government, amending the constitution is the most fundamental to build the federal democratic government,"" he said. ""I will prioritise to implement the rule of law, for the improvement of people's life, national reconciliation and internal peace.""

Burma's civilian government has come under international pressure for its handling of a crisis in northern Rakhine state, where security forces have been accused of ethnic cleansing and serious human rights violations that have caused about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.

""We are facing pressure, criticisms and misunderstandings at the international fronts and our country and our people are facing many challenges,"" Win Myint said in his speech. ""Though everything will not be solved easily, I will try my best to solve the problems and prioritise them.""

2,burma,"Britain has said it is “highly regrettable” that members of a parliamentary committee were refused visas by Myanmar to visit the country as part of their inquiry into the Rohingya-related work of the Department for International Development (DFID).

The International Development Committee (IDC) of Parliament was scheduled to visit Myanmar and Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have fled. Britain is one of the largest providers of aid for the refugees.

A report by the committee on the crisis published in January had expressed “grave concerns” over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya, their mass displacement and plans to repatriate thousands of them back to Myanmar without safeguards.

Stephen Twigg, chair of the 11-member committee that includes senior Labour MP Veerendra Sharma, said: “We are extremely disappointed. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is a direct consequence of our report on the Rohingya.

“The result is that planned meetings with government ministers and military personnel in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, including with state counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, have had to be cancelled.”

The Foreign Office minister for Asia, Mark Field, told the House of Commons: “Burmese officials have indicated three reasons for the refusal: first, that there is an extended public holiday in Burma; secondly, that access to Rakhine state remains restricted for security reasons; and finally…that they were unhappy that individual members of the IDC had signed a letter calling for the senior general of the Burmese army to be held to account for Burmese military behaviour in Rakhine.”

London continues to refer to Myamar by its colonial name of Burma.

3,burma,"Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing two Reuters reporters jailed in Burma, who are accused of possessing secret government papers, her office said on Thursday.

A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in western Burma's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August, which has sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.

Lawyers for the two reporters on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the case, saying there was insufficient evidence to support charges against the pair in Burma, also known as Myanmar.

""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are being prosecuted simply because they reported the news. I have reviewed the case file and it is clear beyond doubt that the two journalists are innocent and should be released immediately,"" Amal Clooney was quoted as saying in a statement released by her office.

Scenes of the violent military crackdown in Burma’s Rakhine state, a restive area that for decades has been the site of ethnic strife, have become familiar since the violence erupted in August: plumes of smoke rising in the distance, thousands of Rohingya Muslims escaping to Bangladesh on foot, entire villages standing empty.

Now the Burmese government is hoping to paint a different picture.

Under de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the government has pushed the nation’s most powerful business executives, many of them previously under U.S. sanctions, to pump millions of dollars into infrastructure projects, and tapped others to start Rakhine-

focused businesses, all while soliciting international donors.

But observers say these plans are fraught and likely to have few benefits for the Rohingya, nearly 700,000 of whom have fled to Bangladesh and who continue to cross the border even as preparations are underway for their return to Burma, which is also known as Myanmar. The efforts also have been insufficient in placating ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who are deeply distrustful of the government’s plans.





The development push reflects the position of successive governments that the violence in Rakhine, which the United States and United Nations have labeled ethnic cleansing, is caused by a lack of economic opportunity.

“From our point of view, the issue in Rakhine is very much related to poverty,” said Ye Min Aung, the vice chairman of Burma’s chamber of commerce, who has been asked by the government to launch a rice business in Rakhine. “That is the very root cause of the problems.”

Business executives such as him hope to return Rakhine state to its “former glories,” he said.

The rebuilding efforts are led by the Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine (UEHRD), a group formed in October. Suu Kyi, who chairs the committee, said it aims to build a “peaceful and developed Rakhine state.”

Critics say the government’s development agenda is premature and dodges the issues of discrimination, statelessness and violence faced by the Rohingya for generations. Questions remain over whether the Rohingya, who before fleeing faced severe constraints on their movement, would benefit from infrastructure such as roads, which they might be barred from accessing.

“The UEHRD was formed to divert attention from violent ethnic cleansing,” said David ­Mathieson, an independent analyst in Rangoon. “Tasking cronies to construct Potemkin villages won’t wash away the stain of mass crimes. The government is either receiving very bad advice and believes this reconstruction will work, or it’s a cynical ploy to pretend the violence was simply a bad dream.”

The torched Rohingya villages have been bulldozed as part of the development and investment push, leading to outcries from the United Nations that Burma is trying to cover up atrocities.

In a report released Monday, Amnesty International said at least three new security force bases are under construction in the north of Rakhine, citing satellite images and interviews with Rohingya in Bangladesh. The sites are being built by members of the security forces.

Amnesty International said it was “deeply concerned that the Myanmar authorities are reshaping the region so as to accommodate more security forces and more non-Rohingya villagers, at the expense of homes, agricultural lands and villages where Rohingya have lived and farmed for generations.”

Aung Tun Thet, the UEHRD’s chief coordinator, dismissed concerns raised by Human Rights Watch and echoed last week by Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.

“As far as our intention, it was not to clear up anything,” Aung Tun Thet said. “It was just merely to ensure that when the buildings are being built there is clear grounds on which the buildings can be constructed.”

With two repatriation centers completed, Burma is “ready to receive them,” he said of the Rohingya. Bangladesh and Burma signed a repatriation agreement in January, but no Rohingya have returned, as the implementation of the deal has stalled.

To help carry out its ambitious development plans, the government tapped the private sector, including a handful of the country’s most powerful business executives, some of whom had been sanctioned by the U.S. government for their relationships to the former military regime.

These economic strongmen were marshaled under the previous junta for projects such as the construction of the capital, Naypyidaw, and to broker arms deals, often in return for lucrative contracts and business deals. This time, some of those involved in the development plans have grown resentful of the expensive projects.

Groups tapped to rebuild the state include the Asia World Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Asia World, a conglomerate run by Steven Law, the son of a heroin kingpin. The company is constructing a 50-mile road through Rakhine, according to its website.

Law, who was branded a “top crony” of the previous ruling junta in a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable, was removed from the blacklist when the United States eased sanctions against Burma in 2016.

The Asia World Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.

Other formerly sanctioned tycoons who have contributed include property developers Khin Shwe and Zaw Zaw, whose business interests range from banking to hospitality and who traveled with Suu Kyi to Rakhine in November.

Khin Shwe declined to comment. Zaw Zaw did not respond to a request for comment.

A consultant on Burma investment familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that some of the business executives were unhappy with being asked to contribute money and resources.

“Myanmar’s business tycoons were summoned up to Naypyidaw and were strongly urged — though some saw no choice — to contribute to a fund to develop Rakhine state,” the consultant said. “There was little in the way of details or clarity as to what the fund would do. And it smacked of the junta days of being summoned to do some wacky project, but this time, without concessions.”

For the ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who, it appears, will be the major beneficiaries of the development push, the government’s efforts are insufficient and being implemented without enough input from the Rakhine community, they say.

“The government wants to show the international community how they are preparing things for the Bengalis, not for us [Rakhines],” said Soe Naing, a member of the Rakhine Social Network, a collection of activist groups, using a term that implies that the Rohingya are from Bangladesh. “The government is doing one-sided things for the Bengalis, not for the ­Rakhine people.”

As Bangladesh and Burma agree to complete the return of Rohingya Muslims, many refugees remain doubtful about the terms. More than half a million Rohingya have fled a violent military crackdown in Burma since Aug. 2017. (Reuters)

Burma’s government, struggling to handle accusations of ethnic cleansing over its treatment of Rohingya Muslims, is contemplating legislation that would seek greater oversight of the work of international nongovernmental organizations, including the United Nations, prompting concerns of a crackdown on their activities.

The Draft Law on International Non-Governmental Organizations, a copy of which was reviewed by The Washington Post, contains a vague definition of the groups it would regulate, proposes monitoring of aid groups’ work by Burmese staff and provides the affected organizations with few safeguards against the government suspending their work. This has led some groups to fear it could be used to restrict their work in Burma, which is also known as Myanmar.

The proposed law comes at a time of a wider crackdown on democratic freedoms under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her government, as they struggle to deal with the fallout of military operations that have sent nearly 700,000 Rohingya fleeing over the border to Bangladesh since August.

“The stated purpose of the law allows government to suppress activities they do not favor and undermines the efforts in advancing democracy and human rights,” according to a February presentation reviewed by The Post from the INGO Forum, a coalition of dozens of aid groups operating in Burma.

Representatives from international aid groups and diplomats are lobbying members of the parliamentary committee reviewing the draft to change the wording or to have it withdrawn. It was unclear whether the law would move past the commission or what provisions the final version would include.

It was also unclear who wrote the draft or if it was done at the direction of the president or state counselor’s office. Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the government, directed questions on the draft law to the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A deputy minister from the ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Tin Maung Oo, a member of the commission that is working on the legislation, said the group was consulting with ministries, representatives from nongovernmental groups and experts.

He said that international aid groups were doing important work and that the government would like them to “flourish” but that a law was needed to oversee their work.

Critics warn that such laws are part of a disturbing trend in the region.

“Across Southeast Asia, a raft of laws, policies and practices over the last year have made it clear that the space for civil society and critical speech is shrinking,” said Richard Weir, a researcher for Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “This trend is particularly pronounced in Myanmar, where the space for civil society was rapidly opened in 2011 and has shrunk since the National League for Democracy rose to power in 2016.”

Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, or NLD, government has also proposed amendments to the country’s protest law, including one that seeks to impose prison terms on those whose demonstrations could harm the “security, rule of law and stability of the state.”

In early March, hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Rangoon to protest the proposed changes, standing for a time in front of a massive portrait of Suu Kyi.

Two days later, the amendments were approved by the NLD-dominated upper house of parliament. The amendments are now in the lower house of parliament, where the NLD also holds a majority of seats.

A Western diplomat in Rangoon, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said the revised protest law and the draft law on nongovernmental groups were “the first two active steps [they] have seen by the NLD to make Myanmar less democratic.”

International nonprofit groups have noted a wider pushback against their work as the government makes it more difficult to get visas and travel authorizations. Some attendees at the February meeting of the INGO Forum believed the draft law could “be a precursor to further restrictions of civil space, as has happened in some other countries,” according to meeting minutes reviewed by The Post.

An especially troublesome section of the draft law mandates that Burmese citizens working for an international nongovernmental group report “cooperation” with the law to the government, adding an additional layer of monitoring that could erode trust and have a negative impact on partner agreements, according to the INGO Forum presentation.

In an analysis of the draft legislation, the Washington-based International Center for Not-for-Profit Law wrote that it “cannot find comparative examples in other laws.”

According to Tin Maung Oo, the draft law would apply to the work of the United Nations in Burma. The government has blocked a U.N. fact-finding mission from entering Burma, barred its human rights investigator and denounced the United Nations’ statements on Burma’s treatment of Rohingya Muslims, which it has labeled a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”

Criticism of the United Nations and aid groups is particularly pronounced in Rakhine state, where ethnic Rakhine Buddhists have long accused them of favoritism toward the Rohingya.

It is unclear whether the government would be able to apply the law to the United Nations and its work in Burma. Stanislav Saling, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Burma, said the country is already a signatory to “international conventions and agreements” that govern the United Nations’ work in the country.

But U.N. agencies implement many of their programs through nongovernmental groups, which could be affected by the law.

“The U.N. and other development cooperation partners have expressed concern that some of the provisions in the current draft of the law are arbitrary and excessive, and could restrict the ability of INGOs to play their important humanitarian and development role,” Saling said.

“We believe it will neither help government to regulate and manage INGOs, nor help INGOs to operate effectively, efficiently, transparently or accountably,” he added.

Beyond the newly proposed legislation, the NLD-led government has also continued punitive use of existing laws, such as the controversial Telecommunications Law, a piece of legislation signed by the previous government and often used to criminalize criticism of authorities.

The law was amended last year — reducing possible prison terms and narrowing those who could be charged — but fell well short of the full repeal demanded by activists. Free-speech advocacy group Free Expression Myanmar found that nine criminal complaints were filed between August 2017, when the bill was amended, and November 2017.

“They just amended article 66(d) to save appearances,” said Maung Saungkha, an activist and poet who was jailed for six months by the previous government under the law, referring to an article of the law. “They want to control free speech just as the previous government did.”

6,burma,"NAYPYITAW, Burma -- Burma's parliament on Wednesday elected as the country's new president a longtime loyalist of Aung San Suu Kyi who is expected to carry on his predecessor's practice of deferring to her as her nation's de facto leader.

The election of Win Myint comes as Suu Kyi's civilian government has struggled to implement peace and national reconciliation, with the powerful military still embroiled in combat with ethnic rebels and under heavy international criticism for its brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Muslim Rohingya minority.

Burma's military ruled the country for a half-century during which it was accused of widespread abuses before partially handing power to a civilian government in 2016. It remains in charge of security matters and still faces accusations of rights abuses.

Win Myint, the vice president selected as presidential candidate by the lower house and backed by Suu Kyi's ruling party, received 403 votes from the combined houses. Myint Swe, the vice president with the military's backing, had 211 votes, and Henry Van Tio, the vice president selected by the upper house, had 18.

""I will try my best to the greatest degree I have and carry out my civic duties as best I can,"" the newly elected president told reporters as he left parliament after the vote.

Like his predecessor, Htin Kyaw, who retired last week for health reasons, Win Myint, 66, is a longtime Suu Kyi loyalist and a stalwart member of her National League for Democracy party, an affiliation that earned him a brief spell as a political prisoner more than two decades ago under the previous military government.

When Suu Kyi's government was installed in 2016, she explained that she would be ""above the president,"" a situation amenable to both the president and the public.

The job of state counsellor was created especially for Suu Kyi because she is constitutionally banned from the presidency. A clause in the 2008 military-drafted constitution bars anyone with a foreign spouse or child from holding the job. It clearly targeted Suu Kyi, whose two sons are British, as was her late husband.

Burma's president is elected by a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament from among the country's three vice presidents, representing the lower house, the upper house and the military. Under the constitution, the military holds special privileges in the country's administration, including a 25 percent share of parliamentary seats and the three security portfolios in the Cabinet.

The National League for Democracy's landslide election victory in late 2015 gave it large majorities in both houses.

Having been both a member of the party's Central Executive Committee and speaker of the lower house for two years shows Win Myint holds the skills to be president, said Win Zaw, a lower house lawmaker from the party.

""We hope that he will do great work as the president, and I am sure he will use his power to do the best he can for the country,"" he said.

Win Myint, who resigned as speaker of the lower house last week, was a successful parliamentary candidate in the 1990 general election, which was invalidated by the military, denying him his seat. He was elected in 2012 and again in 2015.

Born in the Irrawaddy Delta in 1951, Win Myint won his degree in geology in Rangoon and became a lawyer in the 1980s. His involvement with the National League for Democracy began when it was established during the failed anti-military uprising of 1988, which led to his brief term in prison. In 2010, he became a member of the Central Executive Committee of Suu Kyi's party.

Khin Zaw Win, director of the Tampadipa Institute, a policy advocacy group, questioned whether Win Myint's fealty to Suu Kyi was an asset.

""To those who are asking, he will be forever Aung San Suu Kyi's henchman,"" he said. ""I don't expect much change in the presidency, unless Win Myint puts the country's interests before Aung San Suu Kyi's and that of the military.""

Burma is often called Myanmar, a name that military authorities adopted in 1989. Some nations, such as the United States and Britain, have refused to adopt the name change.

9,burma,"Burma tops a list of countries where the ability of aid groups to reach people in need has worsened in the past six months, the Geneva-based research group ACAPS has said.

In examining 37 countries, ACAPS analysts considered nine indicators, including violence against humanitarian workers and restrictions preventing people from reaching aid.

“Myanmar is the country where humanitarian access has deteriorated the most, as access for the Rohingya population has become increasingly difficult,” the group said in a statement.

The ACAPS report preceded another released Tuesday by a British parliamentary committee, which warned floods and disease could kill thousands of Rohingya refugees in camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.

The chair of the International Development Committee, Stephen Twigg, said in a statement that time was running out, adding that donors “must work with the Bangladesh government.”

“Substantial numbers of refugees are about to face another crisis. With the weather about to turn, the fragile safety and sanctuary that the Rohingya have found in temporary camps provided by Bangladesh is in jeopardy,” Twigg said.

United Nations officials say nearly 700,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled Buddhist-majority Burma to Bangladesh.

That came after militant attacks in August sparked a crackdown, led by security forces, in Rakhine State that the UN and United States have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.

Burma has repeatedly denied reports implicating soldiers in widespread abuses of Rohingya civilians, particularly in Maungdaw, a border district in western Rakhine State.

Although the Burmese government had allowed some groups to access the district, it was “in a short-term and unpredictable manner,” said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Burma.

“Most humanitarian organizations that had been working in Maungdaw District for years have still not been able to resume life-saving programmes for some of the most vulnerable people in the world,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.

A Burmese government spokesman was unavailable for comment.

The British parliamentary committee said the situation for Rohingya would likely worsen, with heavy rains expected to begin within days, followed by the cyclone season.

“Severe weather conditions and heavy rainfall could result in the deaths of thousands of Rohingya,” the IDC said.

The committee warned that the camps in Bangladesh are ill-equipped to withstand the 2.5 metres of heaviest rains predicted to fall from June through August. The camps were built quickly, with shelters in places prone to landslides and flooding.

Poor sanitation, as well as a low vaccination rate among Rohingya who had limited access to health care in Burma, meant flooding would likely bring disease, the IDC said.

ACAPS said humanitarian access had also deteriorated in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Pakistan and Turkey.",http://www.dvb.no/news/burma-worst-performing-country-aid-access-rohingya-refugees-face-monsoon-threats/80213
10,burma,"March 11, 2018; NPR

The US Holocaust Memorial Museum has revoked Aung San Suu Kyi’s Elie Wiesel award, given to those who confront hatred and prevent genocide, in light of her refusal to act on or even acknowledge the genocide being carried out against the Rohingya population in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).

Suu Kyi was given the award in 2012 in recognition of her work against the Burmese military junta and for a peaceful, democratic Myanmar, a cause for which she spent 15 years under house arrest. Her father, Aung San, negotiated Burma’s independence from Britain. She has been the recipient of nearly a dozen prizes, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award, and the Congressional Gold Medal. She currently serves as the State Counsellor of Myanmar, a position akin to Prime Minister; even though her party won a supermajority in the last election, she is prevented from holding the office of president because her late husband and her children were not born in Myanmar.

She faces global criticism now because she has refused to acknowledge or alleviate the plight of the Rohingya, a traditionally Muslim ethnic group based in Rakhine state. The country’s Buddhist majority and government refuse to acknowledge the Rohingya as citizens, referring to them as Bengali immigrants. As NPQ covered back in August, since neither Bangladesh nor any other country will allow them in, the Rohingya have nowhere to go. Either they live in refugee camps to which aid workers have little to no access, or they live in what the New York Times’ Nick Kristof has described as “modern-day concentration camps” in their native state, barred from citizenship, education, health care, and most other basic human rights. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, raped, burned, and displaced, but since aid workers and journalists are largely barred from Myanmar, exact statistics and the kind of large-scale interventions that might help have not been forthcoming. Reuters estimated in January that 655,000 Rohingya had been displaced. Al Jazeera reports that “in January, Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship, or safety, for those who return.”

The Holocaust Museum has been sounding the alarm for years. In 2013, they published a statement on the situation and staged an exhibition called “Our Walls Bear Witness: The Plight of Burma’s Rohingya.” In 2015, they released a report called “They Want Us All To Go Away: Early Warning Signs of Genocide in Burma” that called their treatment “a modern form of apartheid.” The report claimed that “there is still an opportunity to prevent this devastating outcome.” In 2017, Andrea Gittleman, Program Manager for the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide, said that the atrocities being perpetrated were preventable, but that “the international community has discarded much of its leverage to press the Burmese government to protect [the Rohingya].”

According to reports, Suu Kyi has lashed out at people who attempt to confront her about the genocide she has overlooked. Neither journalists nor international aid workers have been allowed into Myanmar; in fact, two journalists were arrested just months ago for investigating a mass grave in Rakhine State, where most Rohingya have traditionally lived. Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and United Nations ambassador, resigned from a Myanmar advisory board because, he said, “I discovered that this board was being used as a cheerleading squad for the government,” and he did not wish to serve on a board that was “devoid of any meaningful engagement with the local communities in Rakhine, whose people the advisory board is meant to serve.” (NPQ has frequently addressed the wisdom of resigning from boards that no longer fulfill their mission.)

On March 6th, the Museum sent a letter to Suu Kyi, stating,

Based on inspiration that you created for millions around the world, with your long resistance to military dictatorship, and your advocacy for freedom and human rights for all the people of Myanmar, we were honored to present you with the first Elie Wiesel Award in 2012. It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award….We had hoped that you—as someone we and many others have celebrated for your commitment to human dignity and universal human rights—would have done something to condemn and stop the military’s brutal campaign and to express solidarity with the targeted Rohingya population…we urge you to use your unique standing and your official role as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister to cooperate with international efforts.

The museum’s bold step is not only directly aligned with its mission, it is an example others may follow. Pressure is mounting for the Nobel committee to revoke her peace prize; an online petition has nearly 500,000 signatures. Though it may not help the refugees directly, it is a loud call for the world’s attention and a principled act of disengagement based on mission and principle.—Erin Rubin",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2018/03/14/holocaust-museum-revokes-humanitarian-award/
11,burma,"A new photographic exhibition documents the plight of Rohingya refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing in Burma and currently in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

A launch event was attended by members of the UK’s Rohingya diaspora community, some of whom met with Government officials in November last year to share their views on the crisis and discuss the UK’s response.

The exhibition by Adib Chowdhury lays bare the human cost of ethnic cleansing, recounting the violence and suffering through photographs and personal accounts. Each photo is accompanied by a handwritten testimony from the subject.

Adib Chowdhury is a British-Bangladeshi photojournalist who has travelled to conflict zones around the world, including Syria and Burma, to shine a light on the plight of refugees.

Chowdhury’s unique work is displayed alongside Government commissioned images recording the impact of UK aid.

Foreign Office Minister Mark Field opens an exhibition showing the plight of Rohingya refugees

Foreign & Commonwealth Office Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field said, “I pay tribute to the commitment, energy and generosity shown by the British people, especially the British-Bangladeshi and wider Muslim community in supporting those affected by the Rohingya crisis.

""The UK Government will continue to work with its international partners to try to resolve this crisis, and to hold to account those that are responsible for it.”

Britain has so far pledged £59 million to support the 688,000 Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh in the wake of humanitarian crisis created by the Burmese military.

Speaking at the exhibition, Adib Chowdhury said, “The exhibition is designed to tell the first-hand account of the Rohingya and give them a voice.

""The situation in Burma has been a horrific tragedy for many thousands of people, and I hope the photos will help to convey the unimaginable pain they have gone through.”



Nijam Uddin, General Secretary of the British Rohingya Community (BRC), said, “We’re pleased to have been invited to join this event and meet with Minister Field. The British Rohingya Community really appreciates that the UK Government is standing with us.”",http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/16119003.New_exhibition_highlights_harrowing_cost_of_ethnic_cleansing_in_Burma/

Background

As part of the programme, we visited the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar to follow-up on our interim report on that crisis (published in January 20183). The scale of the displacement, the provision made by the Bangladesh authorities and the efforts of the various international agencies, NGOs and other organisations, have to be experienced at first hand to be fully appreciated.4

We travelled to Bangladesh in early March 2018 as part of our inquiry into DFID’s work in Bangladesh and Burma1 commenced in October 2017.2

A new crisis

However, during discussions in the camps and afterwards, it became clear that a second challenge was fast approaching with the potential to derail, if not utterly negate, all the painful progress made in offering the displaced Rohingya refugees a measure of sanctuary, safety and hope. The matters raised were of such urgency that we felt a further interim report was required without delay.

While in Bangladesh, we heard grave and convincing concerns from many quarters that a substantial proportion of the Rohingya refugees’ accommodation was extremely vulnerable to the heavy rainfall that the imminent monsoon season would bring. Without decisions and action being taken very quickly to enable relocation to begin -- and to facilitate other mitigations -- people were going to die.

Extreme weather: heavy rain, storms, cyclones

The location, distribution and conditions of the Rohingya refugees’ camps and accommodation make them extremely vulnerable to the expected volumes of rainfall forecast for the 2018 wet weather, or ‘monsoon’, season and to the tropical storms and cyclones that are also a severe threat over the coming months. We were told that there were very serious risks of death, destruction and disease arising directly from flooding as well as consequent landslides and the escape of sewage and other forms of waste into a water-logged environment. These risks are estimated to affect some 230,000 Rohingya refugees.5 With around 500 Rohingya still arriving each week into the Cox’s Bazar district, the population under threat is constantly increasing.

This issue is extremely urgent for the simple reason that, at the time of writing, it is already mid-March and persistent rain is expected to begin in Cox’s Bazar in April until October with very heavy rainfall in June, July and August. Cox’s Bazar is expected to experience over two and a half metres of rainfall during these three months alone --average annual rainfall in the UK as a whole is 885 mm.

Conditions and factors in the Rohingya refugee camps which were described to us as creating, or aggravating, weather-related threats and risks included: • the location of the camps in an area which experiences strong winds and cyclones without the benefit of the evacuation systems and cyclone shelters that have worked effectively for the Bangladeshi population but do not have capacity for the refugees • restrictions on the use of durable materials, coupled with the sheer weight of demand, which have prevented the construction of new emergency shelters and led to the siting of structurally poor accommodation on hilltops and slopes offering limited protection from wind and wind-born debris • deforestation for fuel which has denuded the landscape and the consequent loss of binding root growth which has exacerbated the structural weakness of the sand and silt-based terrain, increasing the refugees’ vulnerability to mud and landslides • the sheer size, topography and population density of the Rohingya refugee camps -- plus the inhabitants’ previous lack of access to effective health care, in particular vaccinations -- which have already created conditions ripe for a public health disaster (diphtheria has already appeared7), and • the inevitable overwhelming of temporary sanitation arrangements by heavy rainfall, resulting in the environment being flooded by sewage, creating new vectors for the spread of contagious diseases.

We were told that the window of opportunity for establishing risk reduction and preparedness measures is closing. As the table above demonstrates, the time remaining until the rains start in earnest could be a matter of days. This in itself will hamper any efforts to take the steps necessary to prepare for the genuine deluges expected to start within two and half months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/house-commons-international-development-committee-bangladesh-and-burma-rohingya
13,burma,"What is now popularly called the Nyein Su Si Law (formally the Peaceful Assembly and Procession Law) dates back to 2011, when it was first sponsored by the Ministry of Home Affairs, one of the three ministries that continue to be controlled by the Tatmadaw (Burma’s military). Amid strong protests over many of its elements, President Thein Sein’s government amended it for the better in 2014; for example, by removing the need to seek permission from the police and softening the punishments for violators of the law.

However, as a growing chorus of criticism indicates, the final draft of the Nyein Su Si Law, which the National League for Democracy-dominated Amyotha Hluttaw (Upper House) approved on 7 March, is bound to erode the improvements made upon earlier versions. I argue that the NLD’s sledgehammer approach to the issue is going to further undermine the existing democratic space in the country, which by all indications needs expansion, not contraction.

First of all, the manner in which the bill has been debated in the Upper House, and hurriedly passed, is hardly reflective of democracy and the democratic values that the NLD government claims it represents and works for. The draft law was tabled in the Upper House on 19 February and carried in official newspapers on the following day, inviting comment from the public. This invitation was taken up in all seriousness as hundreds of activists from civil society organisations and political parties protested in Yangon on 5 March, denouncing elements of the draft law that they believe would undermine the very freedoms it is supposed to protect. In a rather self-undermining move, the Upper House approved it just two days later without offering so much as an explanation for such urgency. If the protests were any guide, the draft law does not reflect public opinion, and if some of the rumours are true, it does not even reflect the views of some NLD MPs. One political commentator believes that some NLD MPs were scolded and pressured by higher-ups into toeing the party line.

Opponents also criticise the proposed law on more substantive grounds. Article 18 in particular has come under heavy criticism, rightly so in my opinion. For instance, Nyo Nyo Thin, former MP and outspoken critic of the NLD, has pointed out that some of the wording such as “public morals” in Article 18 continues to enshrine the repressive language of the military-era government, and “is so broad that it is tantamount to stopping citizens from exercising the very freedoms of assembly, association, and expression in question.”

Given the loosely organised nature of grassroots movements and protests, mandatory disclosure of detailed information about funding sources for a planned demonstration and a maximum three-year prison sentence and fines seem designed to put unnecessary and inhibiting burdens on citizens’ right to exercise the freedoms in question. Susanna Hla Hla Soe, an NLD member of Parliament who opposed the bill, argued at a parliamentary session that freedom of assembly and association is a foundational right that people in Burma won not long ago through hard-fought struggles and the proposed amendments should not be adopted, as they would reverse the progress gained so far. I will further argue that these rights are not mere liberal luxuries that citizens in Burma can forgo but they are instrumental to a host of long-standing issues facing the country.

Issues that need a good protest law

One area that is going to be adversely affected by the Nyein Su Si Law is labour rights, which as they exist hardly meet international standards. In fact, workers who protest for their rights continue to face harsh responses from the police. A lot of progress still needs to be made in protecting workers in the country, such as improving their general working conditions and providing a living wage. In order to achieve this, workers need to, among other things, organise themselves and protest to increase their bargaining power vis-à-vis the government and employers. Unfortunately, the proposed Nyein Su Si Law is going to put a major hurdle in the way of workers’ struggle for their rights. This is the reason workers were among those who participated in the 5 March protest against the proposed bill.

A significant number of people have already been jailed through the existing Nyein Su Si law; for instance, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) reports that there are still 240 people who are either serving jail terms or facing trial due to their “political” activities. Furthermore, although one cannot tell with any certainty, while changes to the 2008 Constitution would probably come through a long process of elite-level negotiation, of course with the blessing of the military, there ought to be a huge role for grassroots level protests to play in this process. The NLD’s seeming obsession with criminalising protest is further indication that it could be backsliding on this crucial front.

The case for substantive democracy

At a broader level, limits on freedom of assembly are going to stifle freedom of expression, which cannot be exercised meaningfully without the former. Furthermore, democratic rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression are the very substance a democratic culture is made of. Unless citizens can engage with one another in a public space created collectively, the emergence and endurance of a democratic culture stands little chance of success. In other words, democratic rights should be understood beyond the sense of their practice and appreciated for their educational role as well. It is within this public space that citizens can exchange their views, reason with and learn from one another on all the issues that matter to them, whether it is the role of Tatmadaw or the ongoing Rohingya crisis, which is, in fact, almost completely stifling dissent within the country.

The existing public space remains precarious, as we have seen in a recent event in Yangon. Ashin Min Thu Nya (a.k.a. King Zero), a strong critic of the Buddhist nationalists, including figures like Ashin Wirathu, had to move his press conference from the Myanmar Journalist Network to a lesser known location after a heavy showdown with Buddhist nationalists. A local reporter who was present at the cancelled event remarked, “Some nationalist monks stopped event organisers and asked why they had cancelled the press conference, with a few even displaying physically aggressive behaviour.”

This is a clear example of two dissenting voices in confrontation. In my opinion, these types of confrontations, as long as they remain non-violent and respect norms of reciprocity, are necessary for democracy to work. After all, should people democratically choose an authoritarian government, there would not be much democracy could do about it. Therefore, they are by themselves to be neither denounced nor applauded, but to be observed as part of a vibrant democratic culture.

However, it is the responsibility of a democratically elected government to protect and democratise this public space, i.e., to ensure that dissenting voices get a fair hearing as well, and punish those who fail to abide by the rules. If the NLD government were after groups like the so-called Buddhist nationalists and the “we love Tatmadaw” folks, a blanket denial or whittling down of democratic rights is not the way forward. I am by no means arguing for a rights carte blanche. However, what the NLD government is failing to do is to firmly deal with these groups; for example, by not tolerating any forms of hate speech or violations of other laws. In a recent media appearance, the NLD-appointed minister for Religious Affairs and Culture lamented that the “government cannot act against rowdy monks without the backing of society.” Now, I am not so much calling for acting against rowdy monks as calling for the NLD-led government to act against anyone who fails to respect democratic rights and norms. If an 80 percent win in a general election did not constitute the backing of society, I don’t know what would.

In short, given that the country is far from experiencing a democratic boom, the NLD should take an expansive, not repressive, approach to democratic rights including of course the right to peaceful assembly and procession.

Detailed satellite images published by Amnesty International on Monday appear to show new security infrastructure replacing homes burned when Burmese forces moved in to the northern Rakhine state in a brutal campaign of violence beginning last summer.

About a quarter of a million Muslim Rohingya people were forced to flee across the border to Bangladesh amid allegations of ethnic cleansing by Burmese forces.

15,burma,"Myanmar on Friday defended deployment of its troops near the Bangladesh border, where thousands of Rohingya refugees have taken shelter, calling it an ""anti-terrorism operation"".

The move has drawn criticism from Bangladesh, which summoned Myanmar's ambassador on Thursday, while the UN refugee agency raised their concerns at the military build-up.

Some 200 troops were deployed to the border on Thursday, close to a nearby strip of land between Myanmar and Bangladesh that is home to makeshift camps housing some 6,000 Rohingya refugees.

The strip of land is officially designated as Myanmar territory but is widely referred to as ""no man's land"" because it lies beyond the country's border fence.

""We acted this way based on the information we got regarding terrorism, especially the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA) movement,"" Zaw Htay, a spokesperson for the Myanmar government, told AFP news agency on Friday.

""It was not aimed at antagonising Bangladesh,"" Htay said.

Bangladesh has called for an immediate pullback of Myanmar security forces - who have reportedly issued warnings using loudspeakers for Rohingya to leave the ""no man's land"" - from the area.

Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since August following a government crackdown, which was launched in the wake of deadly attacks on military posts by the ARSA.

It is the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world, according to the United Nations, with the majority of the displaced seeking refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.

The Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world, are not recognised as citizens of Myanmar and face widespread discrimination from the authorities. Prior to the current exodus, tens of thousands of Rohingya have already been living as refugees in several neighbouring countries.

The prospects for repatriation

Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal in January, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship, or safety, for those who return.

Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said last month conditions in Myanmar are ""not yet conducive"" for the Rohingya to go back.

""The causes of their flight have not been addressed, and we have yet to see substantive progress on addressing the exclusion and denial of rights that has deepened over the last decades, rooted in their lack of citizenship,"" Grandi told the UN Security Council on February 13.

Rights group Amnesty International said last month Myanmar's history of discrimination and segregation of the Rohingya were early ""warning signs"" of the ongoing crisis.

""This episode will stand in history as yet another testament to the world's catastrophic failure to address conditions that provide fertile ground for mass atrocity crimes,"" Secretary-General Salil Shetty said on February 22.

""The transformation of discrimination and demonisation into mass violence is tragically familiar, and its ruinous consequences cannot be easily undone,"" he added.

The UN has said the abuses by Myanmar's military may amount to genocide.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/myanmar-defends-military-build-bangladesh-border-180302074720505.html
16,burma,"Human rights atrocities and potential war crimes have been stepped up against other Burmese minorities while the world has been distracted by the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, a new United Nations report has revealed.

The revelations, disclosed in Geneva this week by the UN’s international fact-finding mission in Burma, also known as Myanmar, will compound global pressure on leader Aung San Suu Kyi, for her failure to curb harrowing human rights abuses across the country since coming to power in 2015.

While the Burmese military has inflicted horrific cruelty against the Rohingya, prompting a mass exodus from the western state of Rakhine since August, military violence against minorities in the northeastern states of Kachin and northern Shan has been silently escalating.

17,burma,"LONDON – Fifteen years ago this week, the United States invasion of Iraq began.

Before the statues of Saddam Hussein came down and U.S. forces transitioned to an occupation force two months later, a highly-decorated Special Forces colonel was asked to identify what it would take to stabilize Iraq and turn it into a functioning democracy. In the prescient report that he and his team delivered to U.S. Central Command, Colonel Tim Heinemann, the Green Berets commander, was frank in his assessment. He argued that the U.S. military hadn’t developed the “street smarts” it needed in Iraq, hadn’t built relationships with the real power brokers on the ground, and hadn’t done enough to prevent Iraqi military officers from going underground as insurgents. The surest way to develop the insights necessary to stave off chaos, the report argued, was to engage tribal leaders in a massive counterinsurgency effort to build trust – in his words, “not just to share tea one-on-one with local leaders, but to share tea 10 times until they opened up.”

The report was shelved by the chain of command, but that doesn’t mean it was wrong: not only did Iraq devolve into chaos precisely as the report had predicted, but the counterinsurgency strategy launched four years later to save Iraq by General David Petraeus shared much with Heinemann’s insights in 2003. Determined to see the mistakes of Iraq not repeated in other regions where democracy might flourish, the Green Berets commander left the army in 2005, started a nonprofit organization, and moved to a country of strategic importance to the U.S. where it was hoped that dictatorship would soon end: Myanmar, also known as Burma.

For the last 13 years, Heinemann has worked with American veterans and businessmen in Myanmar, “building friendships, allegiances, critical capacities, and networks” as he tells me, to be “of use to the U.S. when the time was right.” An opening came in 2010, when the military junta that has controlled the country since 1962 traded uniforms for civilian clothes, called elections, and opened the economy to foreign investors. Heinemann continued to collect “muddy boots insights” on the ground as headlines hailed the start of a new era in Myanmar

At long last, in January of this year, Heinemann released a report with his findings, called, “Weaponizing U.S. Economic Engagement in Burma.” It has been widely shared across defense and intelligence networks worldwide the past two months, and with good reason: Its warning of a “Burma in crisis” is stark. “US government and businesses are being deceived,” it begins, “by mischaracterizations of realities past and present in Burma. By the time the rules of this game are figured out, the US public and private sectors will be fully committed on the ground. It will then be too late, as has been the case in Iraq and Afghanistan.”

The report leaves little doubt about the chief protagonist: “The rules?” it asks. “There are no rules. The gravest danger today is that Burmese generals are waging war against democracy and America’s interests by misleading the U.S. government and business into supporting them. The strategy’s brilliance is to get U.S. stakeholders to help the strategy succeed against America’s own interests, and then thank the generals for this.”

It then gets to the heart of the matter. “The U.S. assumption that Burma is now in a post-conflict transition” – meaning that the civil war that raged between the Burman majority and the nation’s other ethnic groups since 1945 and was widely reported to have ended upon the country’s opening in 2010 – is “incorrect. The generals’ war of unilateral dominance is ‘on plan’” … and “has chilled interest in full fact finding.” The U.S. government’s “requests for proposals, programs, and initiatives are now being wielded like a club in the shadows by Burmese generals holding democracy hostage. The generals then intimidate pro-democracy ethnic leaders, state governments, traditional governments, civil society, as well as Burman pro-democracy losers to ‘stay in line, or else.’”

This “narrative of Burmese power elites,” it concludes, has “diminished America’s chance to ‘finally get it right’ on the other side of Asia.” Put simply, “Nobody is calling the kettle black.”

Since most Americans aren’t familiar with the geography of Myanmar, let’s use the U.S. political map to demonstrate what Heinemann is talking about. As we all know, America is blue (referring to Democratic states) on each coast and red (Republican states) across the vast middle of the country. Now, imagine if this divide were even more stark: that there was a continuous belt of blue along both coasts connected by a long blue line across the top of the country, surrounding the red states like a horseshoe. Imagine if everyone in the red states were Christian and Caucasian and everyone in the blue states were people of color and of many different religions. Now, imagine if the vast majority of America’s economic resources were all in the blue states, but that the U.S. government was operated by and for the red states, with an all-powerful and unaccountable U.S. military that constantly exploited the resources of the blue states for its own gain while denying its people basic rights.

That, in a nutshell, is Myanmar. Living in the “red” is the Buddhist Bamar ethnic group that makes up two-thirds of the population and controls the interior regions of the country and all of the instruments of state power. Living in the “blue” horseshoe are the people of 135 ethnic groups that worship different religions and speak different languages – all while laying claim to more than 80 percent of Burma’s resources, from jade to timber. But since the “red” Bamar majority controls the government and the large and powerful military, there is little check on the generals exploiting the resources of the blue areas, despite various ethnic armies fighting for autonomy and control. The story is basically the same as it’s been since 1962.

As international outcry grows over the Bamar military’s ongoing and depraved campaign of genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, more Americans are demanding action. But what most don’t understand is that the Rohingya crisis is not an exception in Myanmar, but the highest-profile case of a seven-decade-old reality: the exploitation of the weak by the strong. Without sufficient Western economic engagement in Myanmar, as Heinemann puts it, we have “left the fox in the henhouse,” allowing Myanmar’s military – and China – to dominate the game. Without understanding the big picture, any solution centered solely on resolving the Rohingya crisis won’t just fail to solve the real problem in Myanmar, it will make it worse.

So how does Heinemann suggest we begin to change the dynamic in Myanmar?

First, our long-term goal should be to turn Myanmar into a self-reliant economic powerhouse. Though it is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia that faces basic economic challenges like shoddy or nonexistent infrastructure, scarce access to electricity, and low life expectancy, it is growing quickly and has the potential to “resume its place as one of the most dynamic economies in Asia.” Breaking the military’s hold starts with fostering a more competitive economy – giving people greater choice and freedom.

Second, the United States’ public and private sector should join forces to experiment with more targeted economic development. Rather than spread U.S. investments ineffectively across the country, the U.S. should start by aiming small in specific mini-regions, increasing our impact and demonstrating what U.S. investment can do to improve the economy and quality of life. Instead of empowering the military or ethnic political organizations, Heinemann says, we should invest in “strong and honest” ethnic civil society organizations. As a local expert tells me, “The game remains about investing in slow processes of change, to empower the underdogs and help to build bridges between all sides over time. Military-owned companies and selected crony-run empires should be kept off-limits.”

Third, and finally, we need to recognize who the real change agents are. In Heinemann’s view, these are the “Young Lions in both Burman and Non-Burman ethnic camps who well appreciate the failures of their elders clinging to old ways.” Min Zaw Oo, peace negotiator and director of the Myanmar Peace Center, agrees. “Ethnic conflict in Myanmar has changed its dimension,” he tells me, “The young generation of Burmans blames the military and does not seek Burman dominance … we still have a chance to become a nation without internal armed conflict, but it may take another 20 years.”

One way to develop our ties with the next generation and encourage them to embrace the right values is to invite these Young Lions to participate in U.S.-led military training and professionalization programs, including the International Military Education Training (IMET) program. But we should move fast; we’re not the only country to recognize the potential of Myanmar’s younger generation. As one local analyst points out, when sanctions were last imposed on Myanmar, it simply drove the military closer to China and Russia, with hundreds of junior officers studying in the latter. Nothing would do more to drive further instability while compromising U.S. interests on this crucial border nation to China and India.

We didn’t heed Tim Heinemann’s warnings in Iraq in 2003, and the United States paid the price. Hopefully, we won’t make that same mistake again in Myanmar. We may choose not to act. But with this report, we can’t pretend not to know.

19,burma,"It is chilling to see how many times the word “genocide” is now being used to describe the humanitarian tragedy affecting Burma’s Rohingya Muslim minority. But like the endless Syrian civil war, this is a deepening crisis of historic proportions to which much of the world now seems largely indifferent — in spite of the warnings. There was the warning this week from the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, that Burma’s military appears to have committed “acts of genocide” against the Rohingya people. There was the warning last weekend in The New York Times from journalist Nicholas Kristof, who has just visited the country. “I saw a genocide in slow motion,” was the headline, as the military “continues to kill its Rohingya” by denying them health care and food. And there was the warning last month from Shirin Ebadi, Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2003, that Aung San Suu Kyi, also a Nobel laureate and Burma’s discredited de facto leader, must be held personally responsible for “genocide” of Rohingyas under her watch.

Article Continued Below

In the past six months, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Burma (also known as Myanmar) for Bangladesh to avoid what the UN describes as a classic case of ethnic cleansing by the Burmese military — including the burning of villages and raping of women. There are plans to send Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh back to Burma but UN officials said this week that widespread violence against them is continuing in Burma. Similar warnings have come from former Liberal leader Bob Rae, who was appointed Canada’s special envoy for the crisis. In a powerfully written interim report in December, he outlined the scale of the “humanitarian crisis,” the need for “accountability for potential crimes against humanity” and the urgency for “action by all governments.”

Rae’s final report will be presented to Canada’s Parliament in a few weeks, and he will recommend “actions that Canada and others need to take.” And that, for Canadians and for our Prime Minister, will be when the ball will be back in our court — coming at a time when the rest of the world’s attention is focused on a multitude of other global crises. Given that, in the face of possible genocide, what should Canada do? Fortunately, we do have history to guide us. This is not the first time that Canada has been confronted with a profound global challenge that the rest of the world ignored. Let us not forget the brutal Ethiopian famine in 1984. Canadians saw on their television sets the immense horror of a hidden famine that was killing hundreds of thousands. And what happened next was unforgettable. Led by Canada’s new prime minister Brian Mulroney and Stephen Lewis, Canada’s ambassador to the UN, Canada spearheaded an international rescue effort in Ethiopia that became part of the greatest single humanitarian relief mission in history. I remember that experience very well because, with Brian Stewart, I was producer of the CBC news team that provided those first reports out of Ethiopia. These two dramas are obviously different in nature, but there are some lessons we can apply from Ethiopia in 1984 to the Rohingyas of 2018. Three come to mind: We need to understand the gravity. That happened in 1984, and it can happen now. This makes Rae’s final report essential reading. Doing nothing is not an option. Canadians, by the millions, decided not to turn their backs on Ethiopia in 1984 even though much of the world did, at least at the beginning. Today is no different. Who else but Canada? The global mood in the era of Trump is cynically inward and self-serving. Does that apply to us? What better time for the Trudeau government to remind the world that Canada is indeed different.

A BURMESE court on Wednesday sentenced a former child soldier to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour under a colonial era law that critics say is being used to quash freedom of expression.

Aung Ko Htwe was arrested and charged under Section 505 (b) of the country’s Penal Code last August after telling the media how he was kidnapped by the Burmese military in 2005 when he was a teenager.

Speaking to reporters outside the court following his sentencing, the 26-year-old criticised his conviction.

“My rights have been violated. We have no rule of law in this country,” he said as he was taken away in shackles by police.

Section 505(b) of the Penal Code is a vaguely-worded law that makes it an offence to “cause fear or alarm to the public” and is often used to prosecute activists.

Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Htwe’s sister Nay Zar Tun said: “I have no idea what is wrong in telling how he became child soldier.”

“The military already admitted that they had used child soldiers,” she said. “It seems they are still using child soldiers.”

According to the Myanmar Times, he and three other child soldiers deserted Tatmadaw – another name for Burma’s military – in 2008. Aung Ko Htwe’s sister said, her brother was soon arrested for accidentally murdering a motorcyclist during an effort to escape from the military camp in restive Shan state. After a seven-month trial, he was sentenced to death.

Under former-President U Thein Sein, his punishment was reduced to life-time imprisonment. Once his case was raised with current military leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing with evidence that he was an under-age soldier, the sentence was reduced to 10 years. After serving 9 years in jail, he was released in July last year, she said.

Aung Ko Htwe also faces additional charges under the Union Seal Law for a protest in which he stepped on a copy of the Constitution during his hearing.

The law includes a provision against desecration of the Union seal. If found guilty, Aung Ko Htwe faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

Human rights organisation Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) condemned Aung Ko Htwe’s sentence and called for his immediate release.

This is “an open attack on freedom of expression,” the group said on Twitter. “[His conviction] directly contradicts Burma’s commitment to end child military recruitment.”",https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/03/burma-ex-child-soldier-sentenced-to-jail-hard-labour-for-talking-to-press/
22,burma,"Midwives working in refugee camps in Bangladesh have recounted the harrowing experiences of pregnant Rohingya women who fled from neighbouring Myanmar.

The mothers said they had seen family members raped and killed by Buddhist extremists and Myanmar’s security forces.

In posts on Facebook the midwives also described how mothers with newborn children arrived in Bangladesh without fresh clothing, and pregnant women were malnourished after having walked for days without food.

“We’ve had women come having lost their entire family,” Dr Sathya Doraiswamy, chief of health at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Bangladesh, told The Independent.

“The stories we’ve actually heard are various degrees of violence, ranging from emotional to physical to sexual violence.

“The main impact of what we see among the women and girls is that they have been subject to violence themselves, but in several other instances they have been witness to violence that has been inflicted on their very close family members.”

Over the last six months more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar, where there have been widespread reports of killings, rape and the burning of homes, leading to accusations the state is guilty of “ethnic cleansing” or even genocide.

More than half of those affected by the crisis are women and girls, Dr Doraiswamy said. He said the UNFPA has helped deliver 1,827 babies and provided antenatal care for more than 51,000 Rohingya women.

In Facebook posts shared with The Independent, a UNFPA-trained midwife said one Rohingya refugee came to her with labour pains soon after she and her husband arrived in Bangladesh. The mother, identified as Hasina Khatu, said the pain had started a day earlier when she was in Myanmar, and had increased slowly as she fled by boat.

“When I asked her about her family members, she told me that her only son who was aged two had been killed by the Myanmar army. She also lost her mother, father and sister. She told me her younger sister was raped and killed by the Myanmar army. When she told me this history she was crying.”

When the midwife gave Ms Khatu food, she said she had not eaten for at least two days. Later that night she delivered two premature boys. One weighed 2kg while the other weighed 2.2kg.

Another midwife described how one mother whose husband had been killed in Myanmar had no clothes to change her baby after she gave birth. “She had nothing in Bangladesh, she had lost everything in Myanmar,” the midwife said.

Other mothers arrived in Bangladesh with their children after walking for days without food.

One midwife said a mother and husband told her they had walked for four days with their newborn and older daughter after all of their family members were killed in Myanmar. “In four days they only drank a small amount of water and some dry food. I made sure they had food. I prayed that things would be better for them.”

Around 80 UNFPA-trained midwives have been providing sexual and reproductive health services through Bangladesh ministry of health facilities and in makeshift settlements formed near the refugee camps.

They also created around 19 women-friendly spaces where female refugees can share their experiences, and some choose to open up about the violence they have suffered.

Some were the victims of intimate partner violence, which Dr Doraiswamy said women in the camps were at a high risk of experiencing, and others had experienced sexual violence and rape at the hands of strangers.

“There is not adequate lighting in the camps, and the toilets are not always family toilets. Women have to walk long distances. Even to fetch water there is quite a bit of distance they have to walk. Along any of these points they face a very high risk,” Dr Doraiswamy explained.

However, he said the women-friendly spaces have been “quite effective”. He added: “For women who have undergone so much trauma, it actually brings about a calming experience when they come into these spaces. The sheer number of people we have been able to reach in the last six months has been quite telling in terms of the impact the UNFPA has had.”

The UNFPA has also distributed around 88,000 dignity kits, which contain clothes, soap, a comb and sanitary wear for women and girls.

Dr Doraiswamy called on the international community to provide funding to maintain UNFPA services, which he said are in high demand among women and girls in the camps.

He said “software sectors” such as women-friendly spaces were often seen as less important than work on shelters, water and sanitation, which he termed “hardware materials”.

He added: “For us to be able to maintain this on a medium to longer term, these kind of services need to be sustained, and the international community needs to pay close cognisance of this.

“Often, the presence of pregnant women or survivors of gender-based violence is forgotten. And that should not be the case.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rohingya-refugee-crisis-muslim-pregnant-women-myanmar-midwives-burma-unfpa-a8242516.html

BURMA’S military commander-in-chief urged the country’s ethnic rebel groups to agree to a comprehensive cease-fire agreement now and stop wasting time on demands he described as impossible.

“Instead of pointing to the past and finding faults, it is now high time to learn the lessons of the past and conduct for the country’s development,” Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said during a speech at the annual Armed Forces Day parade on Tuesday.

According to the Associated Press, the general said the decades long conflicts with rebel groups were the reason Burma (Myanmar) had failed to develop as quickly as its Southeast Asian neighbours.

Clashes between the military and rebel groups continue in Kachin and Shan State where the army have been accused of potential war crimes. A recent United Nations fact-finding mission found military violence against minorities in the northern states has been silently escalating.

“The long-standing conflicts in Kachin and Shan states have recently intensified, leading to more reports of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed in these areas by the security forces,” head of the UN mission, Marzuki Darusman told the Human Rights Council.

These include reports of “extrajudicial killings, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, enforced disappearances, destruction of property and pillage, torture and inhuman treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, forced labour, recruitment of children into armed forces.”

While the military has been pushing a formal National Ceasefire Agreement, only a handful of the ethnic armies have signed up. Others want to re-negotiate the deal to ensure greater political and economic autonomy.

Min Aung Hlaing blamed Burma’s British colonisers and their divide-and-rule policy for the differences among various ethnic and religious groups, and suggested that all parties put aside their grudges from the past.

Despite pledging her commitment to peace and national reconciliation, de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has failed to rein in the military who, on top of clashes in Kachin and Shan, are embroiled in brutal so-called “clearance operations” against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine State.
