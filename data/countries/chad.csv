The security situation in neighbouring countries continues to generate significant population movements towards Chad, particularly in the south of the country, as well as internal displacements in the Lac region.

Millions of people suffer the consequences of food insecurity and malnutrition every year, especially in the Sahel belt and recently in previously spared areas, such as Tandjilé. This situation is likely to worsen during the lean season (June - Sept.), which may occur early in 2018. The health system remains weak, exposing the country to epidemic risks and persistent diseases such as measles, hepatitis E and malaria, with a direct impact on morbidity and mortality.

The Lake Chad Basin humanitarian emergency is among the most severe in the world. The protracted conflict has uprooted around 2.3 million people, stoked high levels of hunger and malnutrition, and subjected millions of civilians to extreme hardship. Insecurity is hampering the resumption of normal life, leaving conflict-affected families dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.

Recent developments

The recent months have been marked by major incidents of insecurity that have claimed lives and disrupted humanitarian operations. On 1 March, armed attackers raided Rann town in Nigeria’s north-east, killing three aid workers and abducting three others. Humanitarian workers have been temporarily relocated from the town.

Two weeks earlier, heavily armed men stormed a school in Dapchi, also in north-east Nigeria, and kidnapped over 100 school girls, most of whom have reportedly been freed. Attacks are recurrent and insecurity is prevalent. In January alone,

Cameroon’s Far North region suffered more than 30 armed attacks. Also in January, some 8,000 people were uprooted in the region’s Mayo Tsanaga department by the attacks and military operations. During a visit to Cameroon and Chad,

UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, called on the international community and Governments to support humanitarian actors in increasing their operations. Funding shortfalls, alongside impediments to access, are major obstacles to providing adequate relief assistance. This year, USS$1.6 billion are needed to assist 7.8 million conflict-affected people. Last year, the $1.5 billion budget received 62 per cent of the funds.",Lake Chad Basin: Crisis Overview (as of 26 March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/lake-chad-basin-crisis-overview-26-march-2018

YAOUNDE, Cameroon, April 10, 2018/APO Group/ –On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

“Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. Canada is proud to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. This support will save lives and help to alleviate the suffering of people living in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

– Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs

Quick facts

In 2018, 3.3 million people will need life-saving assistance in Cameroon to meet their basic needs. This represents an increase of approximately 14% since 2017.

The funding announced today is in addition to the nearly $20 million in humanitarian assistance already announced in 2018. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s total contribution this year for Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria to over $47 million.

In February 2018, Minister Bibeau visited Maiduguri and Bama, in northeast Nigeria, where she met with members of communities affected by the Lake Chad Basin crisis, including survivors of gender-based violence, children and new mothers, as well as representatives of key humanitarian organizations.

3,chad,"(N'Djamena, 29 March 2018): The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Mark Lowcock, has approved the allocation of US $ 6.8 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for rapid response in the south of Chad. These funds will help provide vital humanitarian assistance to 45,000 people in need, including newly arrived refugees from the Central African Republic and their host communities.

Since 26 December 2017, clashes in northern Central African Republic have triggered important influxes of populations seeking refuge in southern Chad. More than 22,000 new refugees have been registered by UNHCR and the National Refugee Agency (CNARR) while cross border movements continue and the security situation remains volatile in CAR. Humanitarian organizations have rapidly deployed to provide life-saving assistance, but capacities are stretched and more resources are necessary to scale up the response and support host communities, who have shared their resources and face the risk of becoming food insecure as their food stocks are depleted. This new crisis occurs in a context where there are already 77,000 refugees and 43,000 Chadian returnees living in precarious conditions in southern Chad.

The Humanitarian Coordinator in Chad, Mr. Stephen Tull, warned of a possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation, “current humanitarian assistance is insufficient given the scale of needs, particularly against the backdrop of food insecurity and the fast-approaching rainy season, which could further exacerbate vulnerabilities. This CERF funding is critical for our response in southern Chad while our humanitarian appeal continues to be seriously underfunded year after year. Increased donor funding will be essential to save lives through sustaining and expanding our humanitarian operations.”

In total, eight projects will benefit from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocation and will help provide multisector refugee assistance (about 32% of the funds), food security and livelihoods (30%), health (10%) and nutrition (8%), protection (7%), water and sanitation (6%) and education (2%) services to over 20,000 refugees and 25,000 people among vulnerable host communities. Three per cent of the funds will also be allocated to UNHAS air services to maintain humanitarian access to the south of Chad. The United Nations recipient agencies are the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). They will work together with NGO implementing partners and state services to deliver the various projects over the next four months.

According to Abdoulaye Sawadogo, Head Ad Interim of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Chad, ""it is essential that other donors scale up their support, especially development donors, because CERF funding will only cover a fraction of the needs, and it is vital to strengthen the resilience of affected populations and provide them with sustainable solutions. This will require long-term political and development investments in the region.""

A response plan was developed by UNHCR and partners to respond specifically to the urgent needs of newly arrived refugees from the Central African Republic and vulnerable host communities. Implementing this plan requires US$ 28.5 million, of which US$ 3.5 million is already mobilized and US$ 6.8 million is now funded by CERF, leaving a funding gap of US$ 18.2 million.

In 2018, humanitarian partners in Chad need US $ 544 million to save and improve the lives of the 1.9 million most vulnerable people in the country. To date, less than 4% of the required funds have been met at national level. In 2017, only 45% of funding needs were covered, a decrease compared to the 53% received the previous year.

Note to editors: Created by the United Nations General Assembly in 2006, CERF is a humanitarian funding mechanism managed by OCHA, which enables a faster and more effective response to vital needs of people affected by natural disasters, armed conflicts, or under-funded crises.

Late last year, clashes between armed groups Mouvement national pour la libération de la Centrafrique (MNLC) and Révolution et Justice (RJ) in north-west CAR forced more than 70,000 people from their homes.

“Since last December, more than 15 Central Africans refugees have been killed on both sides of the border and at least 67 have suffered sexual and gender based violence while trying to go back to CAR to gather food and their scarce resources in exile,” he said.

UNHCR and partners have been providing life-saving relief such as healthcare, water and sanitation, shelter, food and nutrition assistance to newly arrived refugees since the start of the crisis.

However, without increased food aid, refugees could face prolonged period of food shortage while overwhelm humanitarian agencies’ response ability.

Severe floods have not only affected harvest, but they also posed an urgent need for accommodation.

Therefore, UNHCR is building emergency shelter in the camps and villages that host them, while also working with the authorities, partners and donors on a relocation plan.

“The situation with refugees’ health is also critical,” said Mr. Baloch, stressing that “malnutrition levels are already high, especially with children.”

More mobile clinics are also urgently needed and local health centres must be strengthened to ease the heavy toll taken by respiratory infections, malaria and other diseases.

Southern Chad, including Goré, one of poorest and most underdeveloped parts of the country, is already hosting some 43,000 Central African refugees and 45,000 Chadian returnees from CAR. It is now struggling to cope with an additional influx of 22,180.","Alarmed by plight of Central African refugees in Chad, UN urges funding to scale up humanitarian response",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1005252
5,chad,"Over 10 million in need of humanitarian aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, others – UN

More than 10 million people would require aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger as a result of the security challenges in the countries, the UN said on Thursday.

Its Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, who stated this at the end of her visit to Chad, called for urgent support for the countries, especially Chad.

Mueller said the humanitarian emergency across the Lake Chad basin was among the most severe in the world.

She said: “Persistent insecurity and Boko Haram operations mean that more than 10 million people in four countries – Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria – will need aid assistance this year just to survive.”

She called for urgent funding to support 4.4 million people in Chad, including refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons, as well as the communities hosting them.

Mueller underscored the need for durable solutions to the crisis in the Lake Chad region, as noted by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

OCHA said the closure of Chad’s border with Nigeria from the beginning of the crisis in the region in 2015, together with the continued implementation of emergency measures, have also had an impact on local populations who already face poor regional development.

“The activities of the extremist group Boko Haram, as well as violence in Sudan and the Central African Republic, have affected 500,000 people there, including 137,000 people the UN has deemed particularly vulnerable.

“During my visit to displacement sites, I saw the difficult living conditions and lack of means displaced communities face.

“It is unacceptable that these men, women and children who have lost everything, their home, belonging, livelihood and very often family members, continue to live in fear and uncertainty.”

Mueller was on a 10-day Chad mission to the Central African Republic (CAR) and Cameroon, where she saw first-hand the devastating humanitarian consequences of ongoing violence.

The UN official said she was moved by the solidarity of host communities who are sharing the little they have with those forced to run for their lives.

“It is essential to strengthen the livelihoods of these communities who are the first lifeline for those fleeing violence and insecurity,” she stated.

According to her, the crisis is taking place against a wider backdrop of recurrent food shortages and entrenched poverty across Chad, where nearly four million people require emergency food assistance and more than 200,000 children under five are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition.

However, funding for humanitarian operations there has not kept pace with increased needs, she regretted.

Mueller urged countries to step up their support to Chad, which requires $544 million in humanitarian funding in 2018, which so far, was less than four per cent funded.","Over 10 million in need of humanitarian aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, others – UN – tv360",http://tv360nigeria.com/2018/03/01/over-10-million-in-need-of-humanitarian-aid-in-nigeria-cameroon-others-un/

Casey Lawhorn, left, with his mother, Vi Lawhorn, and brother, Chad Lawhorn. Police in East Ridge, Tenn., said Casey Lawhorn shot and killed his mother and a friend before killing himself. (Courtesy of Chad Lawhorn)

Chad Lawhorn woke up about 3 a.m. Sunday, rested but hungry after a long flight from San Francisco back to Nashville the day before. As he was making himself some food, he got a message.

His younger brother, Casey James Lawhorn, transferred $250 to his Venmo account. Along with the money was a one-word note that, to Chad Lawhorn, instantly hinted at something terrible: “Damages.”

Chad immediately thought his brother would harm himself, as he had done twice before, and the money was somehow a way to compensate for the emotional toll about to befall him. Casey, he said, had been suffering from severe depression and had stayed briefly at mental-health facilities. Sometime between two failed suicide attempts, Casey wondered whether the reason he was still alive was because he didn’t have a gun, Chad said.

While still wearing his pajamas, Chad raced to his car to drive to East Ridge, Tenn., where his brother was living with their mother. He tried to call them during the two-hour drive, but Casey had turned off his cellphone, and his mother wasn’t answering the nearly two dozen calls he made.

He arrived to see his mother’s house surrounded by police cars, TV vans and crime scene tape. He stopped in the middle of the road and sat in his car for a few minutes, his mouth slightly open, when two officers approached him.

The news, Chad Lawhorn later learned, was far worse than he had feared.

His brother had shot and killed their mother and a close friend with a gun he had stolen, authorities said. Two officers told him that his brother had called 911 to report that he had killed his mother and his friend — and that he planned to kill himself.

[ He killed his mother and friend, then confessed on Facebook while on the run, police say ]

Casey Lawhorn would travel 300 miles across multiple states, setting off a day-long manhunt that would end in rural Mississippi, where his body was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound Monday morning, authorities said.

“I think I’m still in shock. People keep asking me how I’m feeling. … In my head, I don’t know what I feel. I don’t know how to feel. I don’t know what I need to do, and I don’t know what I need other people to do for me. … I feel myself drifting off,” Chad Lawhorn told The Washington Post.

Investigators have yet to say what they think drove Casey Lawhorn’s rampage. East Ridge Assistant Police Chief Stan Allen said the 23-year-old didn’t have any violent criminal history or any previous incidents involving his family.

The deaths come amid an intensifying debate about gun control and mental health in the United States. For Chad Lawhorn, a gun-control advocate, both issues hit hard as he struggles to find an explanation to his brother’s sudden eruption of violence.

“No one ever said he was a harm to anybody else. No mental-health professional ever indicated any of that,” he said.

Last year, Casey Lawhorn tried to overdose by injecting himself with heroin at the back of a secluded church before a police officer taking a break from patrol found him, his brother said. The year before, while in college, he chased Percocet pills with alcohol.

Chad Lawhorn said his brother had never owned a gun and shared his stance against guns. He can only assume that, perhaps, his brother didn’t want to fail a third time. But why he also killed their mother, Vi Lawhorn, and his close friend, Avery Gaines, remains a mystery.

The brothers were five years apart and both attended Middle Tennessee State University. Chad Lawhorn studied international relations, and his brother, political science. But Casey Lawhorn dropped out after his first suicide attempt in 2016.

Still, Chad Lawhorn said he tried to distract his brother from his demons. They watched every Marvel and Star Wars film together. “The Daily Show” was one of their favorite TV shows, and they often talked about which jokes they liked the best. They also went on road trips, including one to Texas to visit friends.

The brothers shared the same political ideals and both volunteered to do field work for political campaigns of Democratic candidates. They often talked about social justice, poverty and gun violence and shared the belief that gun laws are too loose in the United States, Chad Lawhorn said.

[ An innocent man served 17 years. His ‘crime’? He looked almost exactly like the real suspect. ]

Casey Lawhorn also volunteered at UnifiEd, a Chattanooga-based education advocacy group where his brother, now an independent political consultant, worked as a community organizer.

“Our team is shocked and heartbroken to learn of his actions. … We will work over the coming weeks to ensure that our staff, volunteers, and allies have the tools necessary to deal with this tragedy in a healthy way,” the organization’s interim executive director, Natalie Cook, said in a statement. “Our thoughts remain with Chad, his family, and our Hamilton County community during this difficult time of healing.”

In recent years, as Casey Lawhorn cycled through different jobs, he had grown embittered, and his problems with depression worsened, according to his brother. He relied on his mother and lived with her in the two-bedroom house she bought last year. (The brothers’ parents divorced in 2008).

“I know he’d been frustrated lately. He’d been unemployed. There’s some tension with that. My mom was pushing him to get a job,” Chad Lawhorn said. “She was always super worried about him after the last two attempts. She couldn’t process the prospect of losing her baby.”

Shortly before Casey Lawhorn killed himself, and as police pursued him, he posted what authorities said was a murder confession on his Facebook page. He described his mother’s last moments in graphic and chilling detail, and how he kept shooting her until “it was over.”

“She started screaming the worst scream I’ve ever heard,” he wrote. “Movies really don’t do justice to how true terror sounds.”

He hinted at his plans: “Nothing happens after death, but if there is a hell, I’m going to be in the lake of ice at the bottom.”

He talked about his brother, who he said would be hurt the most by his actions: “I’m sorry to him more than anyone.”

Chad Lawhorn said he doesn’t recognize the person who wrote those words.

“That was not who I grew up with and who I talked to on a daily basis,” he said. “He took my mom and my brother from me.”

8,chad,"Amina Mohammed said recent joint efforts by the four of the region’s affected countries – Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria – have resulted in “considerable progress” in the fight against the extremists, including the liberation of hostages as well as territorial gains.

However, she reported that the group has stepped up the use of women and girls as suicide bombings, while children were deployed in 135 such attacks in 2017: a five-fold increase over the previous year.

“It is now key to stabilize the areas that have been reclaimed, and that we seize the opportunity to really promote sustainable development,” said the UN deputy chief, speaking via videoconference from Liberia where she is participating in celebrations to mark the end of the UN peacekeeping mission in that country, known as UNMIL.

Ms. Mohamed was joined by Mohammed Bila, a representative of the Lake Chad Basin Commission based in the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, and Senior Conflict Advisor at Adelphi, Chitra Nagarajan, in painting a picture of the factors behind people’s suffering in the Lake Chad Basin and driving some to terrorism one year after the Council adopted its first resolution on the activities of Boko Haram in the strife-torn region.

Boko Haram, an Islamist militant organization based in north-east Nigeria, has carried out raids, suicide bombings and kidnappings across the Lake Chad region over the past decade.

Their operations have led to displacement, insecurity, destruction of infrastructure and what Ms. Mohammed described as a “complex and dire” humanitarian situation, with nearly 11 million people requiring assistance.

The group gained international notoriety in 2014 after abducting more than 270 girls from a Government school in Chibok, Nigeria.

It is believed to be behind the kidnapping last month of 110 schoolgirls from the Nigerian town of Dapchi, most of whom were safely returned this week.

Overall, Boko Haram has abducted more than 4,000 women and girls, according to the UN deputy chief, who added that those who return to their communities are often stigmatized.

As the violation of human rights continues to fuel insecurity in the Lake Chad Basin region, Ms. Mohammed said investing in community justice mechanisms will be essential for reconciliation, as well as for ensuring accountability and promoting peace.

She stressed the need to incorporate human rights and gender dimensions into activities aimed at countering terrorism or preventing violent extremism.

For example, she said the increase in Boko Haram’s use of women and girls as suicide bombers could be due to a lack of women security officers who can search other women at checkpoints.

And she called for more international action to support children affected by the upheaval in the region.

Chitra Nagarajan, a Senior Conflict Advisor with the think tank Adelphi, who is based in north-east Nigeria, also used her briefing to touch on the gender-related aspects of the crisis and also its impact on persons with disabilities.

In addition to the threats outlined by Ms. Mohammed, she spoke of how women and girls are pushed into early marriage with combatants, for example, or they fall victim to sexual abuse and exploitation, including at the hands of people who are supposed to protect them.

“Men and older boys are often the first to flee insecure areas,” she said, speaking via videoconference from the city of Maiduguri.

It is now key to stabilize the areas that have been reclaimed [from Boko Haram], and that we seize the opportunity to really promote sustainable development — UN deputy chief Amina Mohammed

“They are deliberately targeted, killed and forcibly recruited by armed groups. They’re viewed suspicion, arrested, and detained by security agencies, and they are involved in fighting, leaving women of all ages, as well as girls, younger boys and older men struggling to cope.”

The Security Council meeting took place as the United Nations marked World Water Day, which focusses attention on the importance of managing freshwater resources.

Mohammed Bila, a Remote Sensing Expert with the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), a decades-old initiative to regulate and control the use of water and other natural resources in the region, spoke of how climate change has had an impact on water governance.

He said the shrinking of Lake Chad has affected communities which depended on its shoreline to grow crops, leading to increased competition for water, accusations of river diversion, loss of livelihoods and social tensions.

He told the Council that the environmental monitoring network there is “inadequate, sparse, poorly funded and operated,” with only one water level measurement station for the entire lake.

“The environmental challenges facing the Lake Chad basin are interconnected to the challenges of climate change faced by the region of the Sahel of Africa,” he said.

“The Sahel is increasingly facing extreme variability of climate resulting in frequent droughts, short-duration high-intensity rainfall, desertification, water scarcity, land degradation, and ultimately food insecurity. Consequently, addressing the climatic root causes of local challenges through risk assessment and management will require a similar solution at the Sahel regional level.”","Lake Chad Basin: Areas reclaimed from Boko Haram must be stabilized, Security Council told",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1005721

Chad was among eight countries whose nationals were barred entry to the U.S. under the most recent iteration of Trump's controversial travel ban. The ban also targeted Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.

The travel ban only allowed for narrow exemptions and waivers.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted the decision to once again issue visas to Chadian nationals as a sign that the president's travel ban had effectively encouraged the country to strengthen security protocols.

""By lifting travel restrictions on nationals of Chad, the United States is demonstrating that the criteria set forth in Proclamation 9645 can and do work to enhance the security of the United States,"" she said.

The initial inclusion of Chad on the list of countries affected by the travel ban baffled many security experts, who pointed to the country's status as a key counterterrorism ally of the U.S.

The Trump administration, however, argued that shortcomings in Chad's identity-management and information sharing practices could pose threats to U.S. national security by allowing potentially dangerous individuals to enter the country.",US to remove Chad from travel ban list,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/382551-us-to-remove-chad-from-travel-ban-list
10,chad,"N’Djamena, 10 April 2018 – The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) has worked in Chad since 2006 with the aim of serving, supporting, and defending Sudanese refugees who left their homes when the ongoing conflict first broke out in 2003. With the chronic nature of the conflict in Sudan, different UN agencies and NGOs gradually began to reduce aid, channelling it to other, more recent conflicts. The return of refugees to Sudan is virtually impossible for the time being and within this context, promoting the autonomy and integration of refugees in Chad has become a priority.

One of the main problems affecting the integration of the Sudanese refugee population in Chad is that most of the Chadian education system is only available in French. This makes it very difficult for refugee students to go to university, even if they have obtained a baccalaureate, because most of them only speak Arabic.

Post-secondary education plays an essential role in promoting integration which is why, two years ago, JRS implemented a strategy to guarantee the professional and educational integration of refugees in various ways. The strategy included the development of a 3-year scholarship program at the ENS (Teachers’ Training College) through which 60 refugees can obtain a degree recognised by the Chadian State which certifies them as Chadian teachers. Additionally, JRS offers computer courses at two Arrupe centres, giving students the opportunity to develop computer knowledge, and French courses at different levels.

Thanks to a recent collaboration with the CALF (French Language Learning Centres), beneficiaries have been increasingly able to pass the DELF (Diploma in French Language Studies) exam in the camps. In 2017 alone, more than 1,800 students were educated as part of this program, of which more 25 percent were women. More than 10 percent of these students were Chadian, as encouraging the participation of the local population in these initiatives contributes to improving coexistence and integration in the community.

Ammar is a clear example of the importance of post-secondary education in the lives of refugees. He is 20 years old and lives in the Djabal camp in Goz Beïda, Chad. Besides being a trade student in mechanics, he is also a student in JRS’s French, English, and computer classes. Thanks to what he learns in his courses, he can increase his knowledge of mechanics by downloading videos and tutorials that are in French and English. His dream is to go to university and study medicine, but for the moment his economic needs make that impossible.

""One day, I hope to have the money to be able to go to college. My family is very large, and we need money because my father has 28 children.""

Despite all this, Ammar is optimistic: ""Right now, I am 20 years old and I still do not have any of the things that I have been looking for, but I'm sure I'll achieve them…every time I get up every morning, I try to give my best.”

In 2018, JRS's post-secondary education strategy will focus increasing the number of scholarships available by creating of new vocational training partnerships, allowing new generations of refugees access to high-quality French and computer science courses, and by looking for ways to expand these activities to other areas in Chad.

The integration of refugees in Chad is an increasingly urgent need and post-secondary education is one of the most effective solutions. It is vital to continue to sustain and improve programs that support integration.",Chad: Post-secondary education as a tool of integration,https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-post-secondary-education-tool-integration
11,chad,"You know by now that Internet of Things devices like your router are often vulnerable to attack, the industry-wide lack of investment in security leaving the door open to a host of abuses. Worse still, known weaknesses and flaws can hang around for years after their initial discovery. Even decades. And Monday, the content and web services firm Akamai published new findings that it has observed attackers actively exploiting a flaw in devices like routers and video game consoles that was originally exposed in 2006.

Over the last decade, reports have increasingly detailed the flaws and vulnerabilities that can plague insecure implementations of a set of networking protocols called Universal Plug and Play. But where these possibilities were largely academic before, Akamai found evidence that attackers are actively exploiting these weaknesses not to attack the devices themselves, but as a jumping off point for all sorts of malicious behavior, which could include DDoS attacks, malware distribution, spamming/phishing/account takeovers, click fraud, and credit card theft.

To pull that off, hackers are using UPnP weaknesses in commercial routers and other devices to reroute their traffic over and over again until it's nearly impossible to trace. This creates elaborate ""proxy"" chains that cover an attacker's tracks, and create what Akamai calls ""multi-purpose proxy botnets.""

""We started talking about how many of these vulnerable devices are out there and what can they be leveraged for, because most people seem to have forgotten about this vulnerability,"" says Chad Seaman, a senior engineer on the security intelligence response team at Akamai. ""As part of that we had to write some basic tools to find what was vulnerable. And some of these machines did have very abnormal [activity] on them. It was not something that we honestly expected to find and when we did it was kind of like 'uh oh.' So this theorized problem is actually being abused by somebody.""

Down With UPnP

UPnP helps devices on a network find and essentially introduce themselves to each other, so that a server, say, can discover and vet the printers on a network. You can find it both on internal, institutional networks and on the larger internet, handling things like IP address routing and data flow coordination. UPnP works with and incorporates other network protocols to negotiate and automatically configure these network communications, and it can be used when applications want to send each other large quantities of data to facilitate a sort of unrestricted firehose—think video streaming, or a gaming console talking to its web server.

'This theorized problem is actually being abused by somebody. Chad Seaman, Akamai

When IoT devices expose too many of these mechanisms to the open internet without requiring authentication—or when credential checks are easily guessable or can be brute forced—attackers can then scan for devices that have implemented a few of these protocols badly all in one device, and then exploit this series of manufacturer missteps to launch an attack.

That's also how the Akamai researchers found the malicious UPnP proxy schemes. Akamai says it found 4.8 million devices on the open internet that would improperly return a certain query related to UPnP. Of those, about 765,000 also had a secondary implementation issue that created a bigger network communication vulnerability. And then on more than 65,000 of those, Akamai saw evidence that attackers had exploited the other weaknesses to inject one or more malicious commands into the router mechanism that controls traffic flow. Those final 65,000 devices were grouped together in various ways and ultimately pointed to 17,599 unique IP addresses for attackers to bounce traffic around to mask their movements.

Uptick in Attacks

Just because they haven't been seen until recently, that doesn't mean UPnP attacks haven't been around. Last month, for example, Symantec published evidence that an espionage group it tracks known as Inception Framework uses UPnP proxying to compromise routers and obscure its cloud communications. But observers note that the strategy is probably not more common because the schemes are difficult to set up.

""In particular it's annoying to build these attacks against hundreds of personal routers, and testing these attacks is hard too,"" says Dave Aitel, who runs the penetration testing firm Immunity. ""I've not seen it in the wild. That said, a working version would get you significant access."" He notes, though, that data leaks stemming from implementation mistakes, like the ones Akamai detected, make it easier for attackers to craft their attacks. For the manufacturers who developed vulnerable devices? ""It falls under the 'WTF were they thinking' category,"" Aitel says.

Notably, the Akamai researchers saw evidence that UPnP proxying isn't just being used for malicious activity. It also seems to be part of efforts to skirt censorship schemes in countries like China to gain unfettered web access. Even when a user is behind the Great Firewall, they can use a proxy network built on exposed devices to query web servers that would normally be blocked. Akamai's Seaman notes that the group approached publishing its research carefully, since plugging these holes will limit people's ability to exploit them for access to information. Ultimately, though, they concluded that the risks must be addressed, especially given how long the vulnerabilities have been known for.

'It falls under the ""WTF were they thinking"" category.' Dave Aitel, Immunity

Users won't realize if their devices are being exploited for UPnP proxy attacks, and there is little they can do to defend themselves if they have a vulnerable device besides getting a new one. Some devices will allow users to disable UPnP, but that can lead to functionality issues. Though more and more devices have improved their UPnP implementations over the years to avoid these exposures, Akamai found 73 brands and almost 400 IoT models that are vulnerable in some way. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which tracks and warns about vulnerabilities, wrote in a note to impacted brands that, ""CERT/CC has been notified by Akamai that a large number of devices remain vulnerable to malicious NAT injections. ...This vulnerable behavior is a known problem.""

The whole point of proxying is to cover your tracks, so a lot is still unknown about how attackers use UPnP proxying and for what. But Akamai's goal is to raise awareness about the problem to ultimately reduce the number of vulnerable devices that exist. ""It was one of those things where it was like, this would be bad and it could be used for these attacks, but no one ever actually found it being used for that,"" Akamai's Seaman says. Now that it has been, hopefully manufacturers will finally do something about it.

12,chad,"After nine years of conflict in north-east Nigeria, 4.5 million people in the Lake Chad Basin need immediate food support and are dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. They remain cut off from their traditional livelihoods in an area where agriculture, fishing, livestock rearing, and regional trade were dynamic prior to the crisis. The number of food-insecure people across the region is expected to increase to 5.8 million by August 2018.1 The situation will keep deteriorating for the foreseeable future unless there is a concerted effort, driven by the governments of the conflictaffected countries, to lift communities out of a protracted crisis and support them to resume their lives and livelihoods. This cannot wait. A short-term humanitarian response, focused solely on keeping people alive, is not enough.

More than 2.2 million people remain displaced across Niger, Chad, Cameroon and north-east Nigeria as a result of the conflict. At the height of the conflict in 2014–15, non-state armed groups controlled about 20,000 square miles of land within north-east Nigeria alone (20% of Nigeria), where close to 1.8 million people lived.2 Military strategies to cut the armed groups off from their economic resources and declared ‘state of emergencies’ have had disastrous impacts on civilians’ access to livelihoods. Despite the government regaining control of areas in recent years, almost one million people are still living in out-of-reach areas and many communities remain displaced – or experience onward displacement – with little or no hope of returning to their homes due to threats from non-state armed actors and ongoing military operations in their villages of origin.

In Nigeria, one in five internally displaced persons (IDPs) have stated their intention to integrate locally in the current area of their displacement; and many others, while expressing the desire to leave, have asserted that the security situation is not yet conducive for going home.3 A significant return movement is not expected among Niger and Chad’s displaced communities in the coming year.

Ongoing insecurity, compounded by the lack of access to livelihoods, continues to expose displaced communities to protection threats such as killing, abduction, and sexual abuse, forcing them to resort to dangerous activities and negative coping mechanisms to survive. For women and girls, some of these negative coping mechanisms include early marriages (a direct consequence of lack of resources) or survival sex. Men and boys are also targeted and faced with abduction and killing as they go for firewood collection or to farm in insecure areas.

The food situation, far from improving, is expected to deteriorate from mid-2018, when climate-related stresses across the Sahel region are likely to compound the situation. According to a humanitarian needs forecast for the region, 62% of the Chadian population in the Lake region is expected to be food-insecure during the 2018 lean season: a 52% increase compared with 2017.4 In Nigeria, 3.7 million people could become food insecure if appropriate assistance is not delivered (compared with 2.6 million in January 2018). According to the 2018 Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan,5 5.7 million people are in urgent need of early recovery and livelihood assistance in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. However, the early recovery and livelihood sector was only 7.7% funded in 2017.6

While many humanitarian and development actors consider that conditions for early recovery are met in certain locations (the Lake region of Chad, most of Adamawa and Yobe state in Nigeria, the western part of Diffa region in Niger), the relative improvement in the security situation over the past two years has not translated into an improved access to livelihoods in most areas. Thanks to generous funding – 70% of the 2017 humanitarian response plan was funded in Nigeria – and a massive humanitarian scale-up, famine was averted in the north-east of Nigeria. But a similar level of humanitarian assistance will be hard to maintain in 2018, and even if it can, this will not provide a long-term solution to the lack of access to food and livelihoods in this protracted crisis.

The continuing lack of safe livelihoods risks contributing to ongoing cycles of violence, fuelling grievances and further undermining the stretched coping capacities of impoverished communities. Massive investment in livelihoods opportunities is needed now, combining short- and long-term approaches, to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Action must be taken immediately: vulnerable women, men and children cannot wait until they are safe to go home for a more durable solution. A strong political vision is required from the governments of conflict-affected countries, which should take the lead in coordinating humanitarian and development interventions. Moreover, investment in livelihoods should be seen as an opportunity to empower women and youth and to reduce gender inequality, in order to promote long-term peace in the region.","Supporting livelihoods in the Lake Chad Basin: Ways forward for conflict-affected communities in Nigeria, Niger, and Chad",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/supporting-livelihoods-lake-chad-basin-ways-forward-conflict-affected-communities-0

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In Cameroon’s Far North region, around 30 attacks were recorded in January alone in which around 20 people were killed, homes destroyed, livestock and property looted. Military operations have triggered displacements and restricted humanitarian assistance. Some 8,000 Cameroonians fled their homes in Mayo Tsanaga due to recent military operations and armed incursions. Since January, around 2,000 Nigerian asylum seekers relocated to Minawao camp, the main refugee settlement in Far North region. Part of them fled military counter-offensives in Nigeria’s Sambisa Forest area into Cameroon while a majority were out of camp refugees who decided to join the camp due to robberies and attacks in the villages they had settled in.

In Niger, armed raiders have killed and abducted civilians in Diffa region. An average of 12 civilians were killed, injured or abducted every month in 2017 in the region, a decline from an average of 20 per month in 2015 – 2016.

DISRUPTIVE ARMED ATTACKS

The recent months have been marked by dramatic incidents of insecurity. Armed raiders on 19 February abducted 110 school girls in Dapchi locality in Nigeria’s north-eastern Yobe state. The incident happened nearly four years after the kidnapping of over 270 girls from their school in Chibok area in Borno state. The authorities said most of the girls were freed on 21 March. The Government had previously announced that it prefered to negotiate their release. Attacks and insecurity remain prevalent in north-east Nigeria and the Far North region of Cameroon.

On 1 March, an attack on the town of Rann in Borno, near the border with Cameroon, claimed the lives of three aid workers. Three others were abducted and another injured. As security assessments are being carried out, a temporary relocation of the aid workers stationed in Rann was decided. The town is home to around 80,000 people, including 55,000 internally displaced persons who are mostly dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. Attacks on camps for displaced, villages and towns are recurrent, causing death and injury to civilians and continuous population displacements.

PERSISTENT FOOD INSECURITY

Protracted violence, population displacements and disrupted livelihoods have contributed to high levels of hunger across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin region.

Some 5.8 million are currently food insecure. Increased humanitarian assistance and favourable harvest in certain areas have helped ease food insecurity.

However, most poor households and displaced people remain highly dependent on food assistance to survive.

Staple food prices are mostly well above average, making food access even more difficult for households with few income-earning opportunities. In areas in Nigeria’s north-east which are hard to reach for humanitarian organisations, there is an elevated risk of famine, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) warned on 2 March. However, it pointed out that there is insufficient evidence to make a formal determination on famine.

PROTECTION

Protracted violence continues to subject civilians, including IDPs, refugees and host communities to grave protection risks and violations. In Chad, 106 cases of gender-based violence were reported in January in the western Lac region, mostly physical assaults (33 per cent) and resource deprivation (27 per cent). All victims received psychosocial support, but very few received medical and legal assistance. In 2017, 2,270 cases of sexual and gender-based violence were reported.

Comprehensive care for survivors is a persisting challenge. In 2018, the main challenge is access to justice for GBV survivors due to impunity, weak legal systems and cultural barriers. Access to health care services is also extremely limited and the number of mobile clinics has fallen due to lack of funding.",Lake Chad Basin: Crisis Update No. 22 (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/lake-chad-basin-crisis-update-no-22-january-february-2018
14,chad,"A. Situation analysis

Description of the disaster

Following clashes between armed groups in the North of Paoua in the Central African Republic (CAR) and a steady upsurge of violence in recent months, since 26 December 2017, an influx of CAR refugees entering the Eastern Logone region in the South of Chad has been observed since 26 December 2017. According to UNHCR Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, released on 12 March 2018, about 19,910 Central African refugees have arrived in Chad since the beginning of 2018. The situation is constantly evolving and according to UNHCR-Chad weekly report of 2 March, during the last week of February approximately 2,500 new arrivals were recorded in the Moissala area. Pre-registrations are on-going as new arrivals continue to be identified.

This latest influx is the largest population movement ever observed since the beginning of the crisis in 2013: It exceeds the total number of arrivals to Chad for the whole year 2017, which amounts to 2,000 people. Given the volatile and unpredictable security situation in the North of CAR (Ouham Pende), the presence of refugees will most likely continue for a long time.

In the context of this crisis, the Government and UNHCR, after noting the limited effects of ""camps"" on the socioeconomic integration of refugees, now favours the settlement of refugees from the emergency phase, into host villages such as the Diba experience. Only a part of the new arrivals is being registered in camps, which often constitute ""islets"" that limit the integration of refugees. In recent weeks, authorities and humanitarian partners have been working on redefining the relocation and identification strategy of these refugee resettlement sites / villages.

Chad Red Cross (CRC), in close collaboration with the ICRC and the French RC, has from the onset of this refugee influx, activated its departmental committee and the local volunteer network to monitor the situation. It equally deployed a joint Red Cross Movement assessment mission in January 2018, to assess the needs of the affected populations.

The initial RCRC Movement joint needs assessment in January, as well as the UNHCR Emergency Response Plan, highlight that over 40 host villages are overwhelmed by a precarious food situation, with urgent needs for shelter, food, drinking water, health, education and care for children. There is also a need to strengthen basic services (water, sanitation and health) in these villages. It is for these reasons that Chad RC is requesting a total amount of CHF 271,180, to support in responding to the direst needs of these refugee and host households.

Bearing in mind that during the first weeks of this refugees’ influx, UNHCR was still working on finetuning its strategy, Chad Red Cross, for proper response and action, took the necessary time to observe the evolution of the situation on the ground while coordinating with all actors to plan accordingly for an adequate intervention to fill existing gaps.

As the situation does not seem to be improving, Chad Red Cross within the framework of this DREF, aims to target the priority gaps highlighted by the Government, as well as UNHCR's weekly report of March 2 and Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, particularly about needs in the WASH sector. Indeed, it is essential to respond before the start of the rainy season, in May-June, to the urgent needs in water, hygiene and sanitation and prevent any epidemic outbreaks, while ensuring better access to basic services.",Chad: Population Movement from the Central African Republic (CAR) - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF n°MDRTD017 / PTD027,https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-population-movement-central-african-republic-car-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-0

16,chad,"It’s the first day of organized activities and the quarterback enters the huddle with a play call: Twins right, scat right, fake zoom, seam 678 Y flat drag.

For a coach working with rookie wide receivers, it’s a thrilling moment to see a new dimension in the offense. It’s also a common frustration to see them bailing out after the first section of the first play call.

“They’re sitting there going, ‘What the hell is that?’” says Ricky Proehl, a 17-year NFL wideout and Panthers position coach from 2011-16, who currently trains college prospects. “They’re sitting there, they heard twins right and are still trying to line up. First thing they say: Twins right? O.K., I’m the Z, so I line up on the right. They didn’t hear any of the other s--- because they’re trying to figure out, ‘Where do I line up?’”

Proehl is definitely buying into the theory that the wide receiver position is in a bit of a crisis at the college level. It’s hard to believe, just four years removed from the Sammy Watins/Mike Evans/Odell Beckham Jr./Brandin Cooks/Kelvin Benjamin class, we are entering a draft that may only contain one or two first-round picks at the position. Since 2014, only Amari Cooper has been picked in the first round and gone on to a Pro Bowl. Kevin White, DeVante Parker, Breshad Perriman, Nelson Agholor, Phillip Dorsett, Corey Coleman, Will Fuller, Josh Doctson, Laquon Treadwell, Corey Davis, Mike Williams and John Ross have all been slowed by injuries or slow to lift off.

The reasons are three-pronged, and could be why some of your favorite NFL teams are drafting receivers specifically out of the few pro-style offenses remaining in college, like Alabama, Georgia, LSU and Florida State (under Jimbo Fisher, who took the Texas A&M job last winter).

1. Collegiate offenses reduce wideouts to one side of the ball with limited responsibilities.

“They say hey, you’re going to be the A receiver. The A receiver lines up on the left. The B receiver lines up on the right. And then this receiver lines up slot right because the tight end is on the left,” Proehl says.

The issues at play: The receiver is often in his own world. He splits out and checks with his coordinator or position coach, who reads the coverages for him, and then directs the receiver to one of a few routes that correlate.

“They don’t worry about motion,” Proehl says. “They don’t worry about snap count. They don’t hear anything else and the coach holds the board up and they know I got one of five plays where I’m running a go, post, slant or a comeback. That’s all they’re running. If he’s off I’m running a hitch. Man, I’m running a go.”

2. Coaches are starting to teach routes differently, and perhaps less effectively.

Take one of the most basic components of the NFL route tree: the curl. For years, the receiver was taught to run 12 yards, plant hard and work back to the quarterback at a 45-degree angle. This allows the quarterback to throw a split-second early—like when the receiver digs his heel in to turn.

Now, receivers are coming out of school running the curl as a continuous semicircle, which creates myriad problems at the next level.

“When you’re running a semicircle, you’re keeping your arms moving and chopping, some coaches think its great because you’re playing fast, you’re not stopping,” Proehl says. “But a guy running a semicircle, if I’m running it and a guy like Kelvin Benjamin is running it, our circles are going to be different. The quarterback has to wait for you to come out and square your shoulders. That takes more time.”

That extra time means defensive backs have a window to undercut the route.

“When you come to him, plant your foot in the ground and come back at an angle, you’re boxing him out. He’s behind you. You create and maintain separation with your angle coming back to the QB.”

3. The use of the ‘fingertip method’

Proehl says some receivers are now taught to catch the ball with their fingertips, or are at least enamored by the prospects of it—the silent woosh, the aesthetic of it.

The problem is that there is little strength in those muscles, which could cause a batted pass from a defender or an outright drop. Proehl, who now works with agencies like powerhouse Rep 1 sports to prepare their draft-eligible wideouts and maintains a stable of NFL clients at his PSP training facility in North Carolina, prefers an attacking method.

“Try and hold a ball with your fingertips and see how easy it is to strip out of your hand,” Proehl says. “Put your whole surface of your palm and your fingers on the ball. That’s how you catch a ball. Every part of your hand. The more of your hand you have on the ball, the more you have to maintain an attack from a DB when he tries to strip it.

“Fingertips? There are 10 little points on the ball. Guys say it’s so cool. Man, I want my guys to be aggressive.”

One more damning comment…

I asked Proehl if, before he left the Panthers after the 2016 season, there was a sense among NFL scouts and coaches that receivers were diminishing in value, at least enough to invest serious draft capital. His answer:

“We heard that more with running backs at the time, that they’re a dime a dozen, that you don’t take them in the first round. When I was coaching, there were classes with Julio Jones, A.J. Green, Odell Beckham. That never came up before, but I have heard that this year. The receivers coming out just didn’t impress at the combine—no true route runners, and there may not be a whole lot [going in the first round].”

So who might gamble on a first-round receiver this year?

Keep your eyes on the Cardinals, who visited privately with Texas A&M wideout Christian Kirk; the Seahawks, who are in geographical proximity to Washington’s Dante Pettis; and the Saints, who have had multiple connections with fringe first-round prospects throughout the pre-draft process. The Bears might have no choice but to keep swinging and have had contact with consensus No. 1 receiver Calvin Ridley out of Alabama. But the Cowboys might be the safest bet. With Dez Bryant in decline, they spoke with Ridley and Maryland’s D.J. Moore at the combine. Their local pro day also provides access to a ton of talent, including Courtland Sutton from SMU.

That Kyle Lauletta-Jimmy Garoppolo Comparison

In a draft cycle with four potential star—some might even argue generational—talents at quarterback, it’s hard for a prospect like Richmond’s Kyle Lauletta to stand out.

However, this is also a draft cycle where a ton of teams need quarterbacks. Lauletta happens to be the son of a Naval Academy quarterback and, like Jimmy Garoppolo in 2013 and Carson Wentz in ’16, is the star of the Football Championship Subdivision. Is Lauletta the next Garoppolo, or are we just nearing that point in the draft where anything thrown against the wall that sticks is halfway interesting?

We reached out to Towson University head coach Rob Ambrose for assistance. Ambrose and the Tigers beat Garoppolo in an epic FCS semifinal back in 2013 and fell to Lauletta and the Spiders this season. He had both of his scouting reports queued up for the afternoon.

“I think Jimmy might be a little bit better, his release is quicker and he has the ability to be accurate from multiple release points,” Ambrose said by phone this week. “Jimmy is like a 2-guard in basketball. He is truly a pure shooter and ungodly talented.

“Kyle is a great passer and his release is still quick, but with Kyle, he’s as fundamentally sound as I’ve seen anyone play the position in college. Tremendous student, and that’s what I know for sure.

“The one thing that is the same about both of them is who they are. As famous as both of them became during their careers, they’re just as humble as two guys could be.”

Ambrose said that Lauletta’s strength is in dissecting defenses. His belief—which is something I’ve heard about Lauletta during the pre-draft process—is that he’ll be able to climb up draft boards during the visit phase (despite our insistence that risers are largely a myth). His knowledge of each of the four—four!—offenses he played in at Richmond is “encyclopedic,” and he'll be able to play white board games with coordinators and coaches.

This season, Ambrose created a few defenses specifically to trip up Lauletta, presenting bluff coverages or blitzes on third downs, then sending something different after the snap. It took just one rep for Lauletta to counter it the next down.

“He’s still physically talented, but he is a surgeon mentally… he’s so efficient. Look at the gaudy numbers of all the (FBS) quarterbacks have. They also have draftable wide receivers. These guys don’t have that. They don’t have three guys going to the combine. When you’re a 1-A guy, all you have to do is get it near these guys. What Kyle has is incredible accuracy.

“You take any tough ballplayers who are extremely accurate, that’s what matters.”

I asked Ambrose, who called Garoppolo the best quarterback he’s ever faced, if he got a similar feeling from his matchup with Lauletta back in October.

His response: “Oh God, yeah.”

So where could Lauletta end up? The Patriots connection is thrown around because of their investment in Garoppolo, but there is a lot of interest around the league in Lauletta. He’ll end up getting drafted by a team that prioritizes quick decision-making, fast release and defensive recognition. To me, that would put the Giants and Cardinals in the mix, and I would put the New Orleans Saints as a serious suitor. (The Giants and Cardinals, by the way, have come up multiple times when asking around about second- and third-round quarterbacks.)

Lauletta, I’m told, is in the middle of the “Tier 2” section. So if you think about Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen, Josh Allen, Baker Mayfield, Lamar Jackson and Mason Rudolph as Tier 1 quarterbacks, Lauletta is in the mix with Washington State’s Luke Falk and Western Kentucky’s Mike White.

Why does that matter? Backup quarterbacks and developmental second- to third-round quarterbacks are a crucial part of a team’s foundation. The free agent market is outrageously expensive, and netting a passer who could develop into a capable starter—or even a trustworthy No. 2—while on his rookie deal is a significant score.

• THE CRUCIAL QUESTIONS FACING THE QUARTERBACKS: Trying to put answers for the issues facing the top six quarterbacks of the 2018 draft.

MORE FCS QB LOVE…

In case Lauletta isn’t far enough off the radar for you: Princeton’s Chad Kanoff (6' 4"", 215), has already visited with the Patriots in Foxboro and had about a half-dozen on-campus workouts. The quarterback-needy Cardinals and Giants were both at the Tigers’ pro day.

That pro day was during a Nor’easter back in early March—the same day as Rutgers’ pro day workouts, which sent scouts scrambling all over South Jersey in bad weather. Princeton and Rutgers were supposed to combine their efforts, but Rutgers needed room for 300 guests, which exceeded the fire code in Princeton’s indoor bubble. The Scarlet Knights went to Florham Park (the Jets’s facility) and the Tigers were left to show off for the diehards.

Princeton head coach Bob Surace is a former Bengals assistant and one of the brightest minds in college football. His offensive meeting room is a laboratory, a history that includes a three-quarterback system (that’s right) and a dual-quarterback system that switched passers inside both 20-yard lines.

In 2016, Kanoff handed the ball off to another, more mobile passer inside the 20 and compiled just 1,741 yards, six touchdowns and six INTs. In 2017, after taking control of the Tigers’ offense, he logged 3,474 yards, 29 touchdowns and nine interceptions—the best statistical season for an Ivy League QB in conference history (better than Harvard’s Ryan Fitzpatrick, Dartmouth’s Jay Fiedler or fellow Princeton alum Jason Garrett ever had).

“In 2016 some scouts didn’t give him a grade, and when you don’t give a guy a grade, they often refuse to change it [the next year],” Surace told me. “They’re afraid their [college scouting director] is going to be like, ‘Did you even talk to that school?’”

“Watch Jared Goff. Watch his pro day. It was outstanding. Watch our guy and tell me—the body type, the athletic ability, the accuracy, the arm strength—that you’re not seeing a similar guy. Jared Goff is one of the best in the league, I’m not knocking Goff, but I’m saying Chad, when you watch these things, they’re similar. If teams just close their eyes and think, ‘Oh, we’re at Ohio State,’ at worst, he’s a second-day pick.

“He was challenged here. And he graduated in January, so all he’s done is live, eat, sleep and breathe football.”

Here’s one thing to keep in mind about Surace: I understand that some reading this column will think “Oh, a college coach talking up his QB, what a surprise.” But these are the things Surace has been telling NFL teams, and as a former NFL coach, he knows not to bang the table for someone that is going to waste a coach’s time at the next level. That’s not how an Ivy League coach (or FCS coach, or mid-major coach) gets players drafted. He did the same for linebacker Mike Catapano in 2013 (seventh-round pick of the Chiefs), Caraun Reid in 2014 (fifth round, Lions; now with the Colts) and Seth DeValve in 2016 (fourth round, Browns). All ended up getting drafted.

Arkansas’ coach isn’t the only Morris involved in recruiting process

Arkansas coach Chad Morris will be shifting into full recruiting mode after the Razorbacks officially close spring practice Wednesday. That will continue to be his main focus, essentially until fall camp for the 2018 season approaches in late July.

Morris won’t be the only member of his family heavily involved in recruiting activity this summer, though. His son, Chandler, is also expecting to be going through a plethora of recruiting experiences with trips to various camps and schools in the coming months. He’ll even have his dad alongside him for many of those.

Chandler Morris is a 2020 quarterback at Highland Park High School in Dallas. He’s expected to remain at Highland Park and take over the starting job, with Arkansas 2018 signee John Stephen Jones departing from the program to join the Hogs. Chandler served as Jones’ backup last season, completing 10 of 24 attempts with appearances in 4 of the Scots’ 15 games. Highland Park won a second consecutive state title last season.

Chad Morris recently told Josh Bertaccini, host of the Red Zone on 92.1 FM the Ticket in Fayetteville, that he already knows where his son’s most important recruiting trip will take place this summer.

“Chandler is heavy into the recruiting process, too,” Chad Morris said. “I’m going to be a dad and take him to some football camps across the country. He’s going to come to our camp first. That’s No. 1. At least I’ve got a relationship with his mom [Morris’ wife, Paula] so we can get him to this camp.”

Chandler attended the regional Under Armour All-America camp in Dallas Sunday. Arkansas will host a variety of camps for recruits during the first two weeks in June.

Memphis favorite for Trevis Hopper following Arkansas de-commitment

Defensive lineman Trevis Hopper has de-committed from Arkansas. He was the first 2019 pledge of the Morris era, announcing his pledge to the Hogs during a visit to campus in February. The move did not come as a major surprise after Hopper recently deleted all references to Arkansas on his Twitter account.

A source with knowledge of the situation has told SEC Country that Memphis is believed to have swayed Hopper’s thinking. Hopper attends Central High School, located 5 miles from the Tigers’ campus. He intends to make some form of an announcement Friday via Twitter. It’ll be interesting to see if that announcement will be his pledge to Memphis.

Arkansas now has two commitments in the 2019 class — offensive lineman Beaux Limmer and athlete Malik Chavis. The Razorbacks are expected to host at least four top 2019 targets for official visits this weekend.

ICYMI: Connor Noland spurs pro options, will enroll at Arkansas

Arkansas 2018 quarterback signee Connor Noland has eliminated any possibility that he won’t be joining the Razorbacks.

A highly regarded pitcher, Noland informed every Major League Baseball team Monday of his intention to enroll at Arkansas, regardless of his potential selection in the 2018 MLB Draft this June. He expects to arrive on campus in late May.

Noland is planning to play both football and baseball for the Razorbacks. His scholarship is counting toward the football program.

Acute rainfall deficits last season in several regions of the Sahel, and worsening insecurity have escalated humanitarian needs.

Drought has prematurely thrust pastoralist communities into the lean season, with herders migrating earlier than usual. Growing insecurity in Mali and armed attacks in border regions with Burkina Faso and Niger have uprooted hundreds of families in recent months, adding to the devastation by the long-running conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Swaths of pastoral and agro-pastoral regions are suffering severe pasture and water deficits. Around 2.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are at risk of serious livelihood crisis in 2018.

Mauritania, and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal and Mali are the worst affected in the Sahel.

Armed attacks, banditry and intercommunity conflict have increased in Mali’s central regions. In areas unaffected by conflict, chronic vulnerabilities persist. In the Lake Chad Basin, humanitarian needs will remain high in 2018 and beyond. In areas worst hit by violence, almost 500,000 children are severely acutely malnourished and 5.8 million people are struggling with high levels of food insecurity.

In 2018, 24 million people will need humanitarian assistance in the Sahel. Some 32 million people are at risk of, or struggling with food insecurity – among them 10.8 million severely food insecure – and 4.7 million children are malnourished. Over 5 million refugees, internally displaced people and returnees are grappling with the consequences of forced displacement.

Sahel countries count among the world’s most at risk of crises and disasters. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts and floods and land degradation threaten the livelihoods of highly vulnerable communities. Food insecurity and malnutrition are often high and widespread, with seasonal peaks pushing millions into crisis. In the last decade, a spike in armed conflict and violence has worsened chronic needs, uprooted entire communities and disrupted livelihoods.

To address the most urgent needs across the region, humanitarians will need US$2.7 billion in 2018. In five countries – Cameroon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria – aid organisations and Governments have developed response plans to provide life-saving assistance and help communities rebuild livelihoods. In Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal, humanitarian work plans address acute peaks, while preparing the full integration of relief response in longer-term strategies that address the structural causes of vulnerability.

Humanitarian action across the region is progressively adopting the New Way of Working. Response strategies this year are further strengthening collaboration with Governments and development actors to provide urgent relief assistance and tackle the causes of recurrent emergencies. The Sahel humanitarian response is aligned with the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) priorities, which recognise the importance of the humanitariandevelopment and security-peace nexus and enshrines a proactive crisis prevention-oriented approach. The UNISS support plan seeks to address common humanitarian/security concerns in the Sahel, particularly the Lake Chad Basin areas, northern Mali and the Liptako-Gourma region.

Only concerted and sustained efforts by all actors can bring peace, security, and development, improve human rights, uplift Sahel’s most vulnerable inhabitants from recurrent crises, and create stable conditions for communities and families to prosper.

CONFLICT, FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION

PROTRACTED AND EMERGING CONFLICT

Conflict remains one of the main drivers of humanitarian emergencies in the Sahel. Increased hostilities could heighten humanitarian needs in the region, where 24 million require assistance this year.

The deteriorating insecurity has in recent months opened a new front. Regions in Burkina Faso and Niger bordering Mali have come under a rising spate of armed attacks that have devastated communities and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. In 2017, around 90 incidents of insecurity were recorded in Burkina Faso, forcing 141 schools to shut and affecting thousands of children. Villages in Niger’s western Tillabéri and Tahoua regions have also suffered multiple attacks that have uprooted residents. Burkina Faso and Niger respectively host 23,000 and 56,000 Malian refugees.

Mali and the Lake Chad Basin remain the region’s prominent conflict hotspots. In Mali, insecurity is spreading from the northern to the central regions. Clashes between armed groups, banditry and intercommunal violence recurrently cause displacements. Some 5.1 million people – more than 27 per cent of the country’s population – live in the areas affected by insecurity. Currently 59,000 people are displaced within the country, and almost one in five Malians is food insecure. While humanitarian assistance has enabled hundreds of thousands of people to survive, the situation remains critical. In 2018, aid groups will assist around 1.6 million people, 200,000 more than the previous year.

Across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin, around 2.2 million people have been displaced. Millions of people are grappling with hunger, poor living conditions in displacement sites and other adversity unleashed by the nine-year-long conflict. Humanitarian action has saved many lives, but millions of people still require relief assistance to survive and rebuild their livelihoods.

As humanitarians strive to assist Sahel’s vulnerable populations, Governments are making efforts to tackle extremist violence. The establishment of the G5 Sahel Joint Force hopes to address a key factor of regional instability. However, military operations could complicate humanitarian access, underscoring the need for dialogue and coordination between humanitarian and military actors.

FOOD INSECURITY, DROUGHT AND PASTORAL CRISIS

Following poor rains in 2017, Mauritania and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal are witnessing severe pasture and water shortages. In these areas, the lean season has begun early and will last longer. Many pastoralist communities, who make up 30 per cent of Sahel’s population, begun migrating earlier than usual and will face a tough lean season as their resources dwindle. The early transhumance is exacerbating vulnerability. Meat and milk production has declined, livelihoods taken a hit and food prices are increasing. Terms of trade between cereals and livestock is unfavourable for herders. For instance, in Mali, Mauritania and Niger it dropped by 15 - 50 per cent compared to December 2016. In areas where pastoralists have moved into, the additional herds are exerting pressure on limited water and pasture and the likelihood of intercommunity tensions increased.

Across the region, food insecurity will remain high owing to the effects of poor rainfall, transhumance restrictions, high staple food prices and increasing displacement by conflict. For children, worsening food security will create additional hurdles such as learning difficulties or school retention, as parents are unable to afford fees and need their children to stay at home to work.

HIGH MALNUTRITION RATES

Malnutrition also remains prevalent in the region and is expected to deteriorate if early and sustained actions are not taken. Poor access to healthcare, water, sanitation, education and other basic services has left millions of children suffering from acute malnutrition. Some 4.7 million children are likely to face acute malnutrition. Global and severe acute malnutrition rates have surpassed the emergency threshold in parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. The drought that has also caused crisis among Sahel’s pastoralist communities is likely to increase the already high malnutrition rates. Education can play a key role in malnutrition prevention programmes by assisting children in school and their young parents with nutrition education, malnutrition screening services and prevention packages for the household.

MOBILISING FOR ACCELERATED RESPONSE

Humanitarian needs remain high in the Sahel, home to some of the world’s most protracted and severe crises. The impact of climate change, armed conflict and insecurity, underdevelopment and poverty subject millions of people to severe hardship. Around one in five people requiring humanitarian assistance in the world resides in the Sahel, and 16 per cent of the region’s 150 million inhabitants needs help.

The number of people uprooted, mainly by conflict, has nearly tripled in the past four years, rising from 1.8 million in 2014 to more than 5 million this year. Humanitarian response budget has hovered around $2 billion over the same period. In 2018, Sahel’s budget accounts for 12 per cent of the $22.5 billion global humanitarian financial requirement.

Progressively adopting the New Way of Working, humanitarian, Governments and development actors in the region have developed strategies to respond to the humanitarian emergency and address the causes of Sahel’s recurrent crises. Donor support has been critical in saving lives. 2018 is expected to be a very difficult year not only for pastoralist communities but also for thousands of communities who rely on markets for access to food in the Sahel. Accelerated efforts by all actors are crucial in reducing human suffering and restoring livelihoods.",Sahel 2018: Overview of Humanitarian Needs and Requirements,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/sahel-2018-overview-humanitarian-needs-and-requirements
19,chad,"Background

The Lake Chad Basin humanitarian emergency is among the most severe in the world. The protracted conflict has uprooted around 2.3 million people, stoked high levels of hunger and malnutrition, and subjected millions of civilians to extreme hardship. Insecurity is hampering the resumption of normal life, leaving conflict-affected families dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.

Recent developments

The recent months have been marked by major incidents of insecurity that have claimed lives and disrupted humanitarian operations. On 1 March, armed attackers raided Rann town in Nigeria’s north-east, killing three aid workers and abducting three others. Humanitarian workers have been temporarily relocated from the town.

Two weeks earlier, heavily armed men stormed a school in Dapchi, also in north-east Nigeria, and kidnapped over 100 school girls, most of whom have reportedly been freed. Attacks are recurrent and insecurity is prevalent. In January alone, Cameroon’s Far North region suffered more than 30 armed attacks. Also in January, some 8,000 people were uprooted in the region’s Mayo Tsanaga department by the attacks and military operations. During a visit to Cameroon and Chad, UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, called on the international community and Governments to support humanitarian actors in increasing their operations. Funding shortfalls, alongside impediments to access, are major obstacles to providing adequate relief assistance. This year, USS$1.6 billion are needed to assist 7.8 million conflict-affected people.

20,chad,"Operational Context

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

22,chad,"Social media and messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber have been blocked in Chad, a move advocacy groups have linked to the tense political situation in the country.

From as early as Mar. 28, users started reporting a shutdown, according to the organization Internet Without Borders (IWB). The internet censorship watchdog, the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), also confirmed network measurement data showed the BBC’s news website was blocked.

The cutoff comes after a national conference, boycotted by the opposition, recommended constitutional changes that could extend president Idriss Deby’s rule until 2033. Deby has ruled over the Central African nation since 1990. Legislative elections, due in 2015, have also been pushed behind several times. A largely semi-desert nation plagued by instability, Chad’s economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. But the plunge in commodity prices has pushed the government to impose cuts in spending that has roiled the nation in strikes and protests.

“Unfortunately, the Chadian regime is used to shutting down telecommunications, [the] internet in particular, whenever there are demonstrations or public expression of people’s discontent towards the government,” says Julie Owono, the executive director of IWB. Owono said the government might have instituted the blackout after videos of clashes within president Deby’s own Zaghawa clan were shared on WhatsApp. Authorities also didn’t respond to IWB’s request on why they blocked the BBC’s online site.

The current shutdown comes just days after advocacy groups submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Council detailing evidence of breaching freedom of expression, access to information, and the right to privacy. The violations included the January internet blackout ahead of demonstrations organized by civil society organizations, besides the eight-month social media cutoff following controversial elections in 2016. IWB estimates all these blackouts combined cost the Chadian economy €18 million ($22.1 million).

Yet Chad is hardly the only African government shutting down the internet or blocking messaging apps: nine African countries did so last year ahead of elections, political protests or national exams.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday lifted travel restrictions on Chad, citing improvements in the ""identity-management and information sharing practices"" of the African nation, one of several targeted by the president's controversial ban.

The president, according to a statement from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signed a proclamation that will allow Chad nationals to ""again be able to receive visas for travel to the United States.""

Story Continued Below

The move came following an assessment from the Department of Homeland Security that determined that the country's travel systems were improved ""sufficiently to meet the baseline security standard of the United States,"" the White House said.

""The President’s first priority is the safety and security of the American people,"" Sanders said. ""The tailored travel restrictions...will keep our country safe and encourage countries to meet our baseline requirements.""

The central African country was added to Trump's travel ban proclamation in September, along with North Korea and Venezuela, in an action aimed at addressing judicial concerns that the original measure unlawfully targeted Muslim travelers.

According to the Associated Press, Chad ran afoul of U.S. guidelines for security conditions when it ran out of the special passport paper needed to comply with a DHS request. The shortage ultimately led the country to miss ""baseline"" DHS criteria and landed it on Trump's revamped travel restrictions list.

Despite the status change, top U.S. officials in recent months praised Chad's counterterrorism efforts and left the door open to lifting travel restrictions on the country.

Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Chad had taken significant steps toward bolstering its security processes. “These steps I think are going to allow us to begin to normalize the travel relationship with Chad,” he said.

25,chad,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump lifted a U.S. travel ban on citizens from Chad on Tuesday after a six-month U.S. government review found improvements in the African country’s security standards, the White House said.

The Trump administration added Chad to a revamped travel ban list in September after it said the Chadian government had failed to send proof it had taken adequate security measures to prevent terrorists from traveling to the United States.

With Chad taken off the list, seven countries — Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela — are still subject to the travel restrictions.

In a proclamation lifting the ban on Chad, Trump said the other seven countries “did not make notable or sufficient improvements in their identity-management and information-sharing practices” and would remain on the list.

Trump’s critics have said his travel ban unfairly singled out Muslims, and violated U.S. law and the Constitution.

Courts struck down the first two versions of Trump’s travel ban, and the current one is narrower in scope than its predecessors. The U.S. Supreme Court will consider its legality this spring, and a decision is expected in June.

Trump said in the proclamation that Chad had taken steps to make its passports more secure and had improved the sharing of information with the United States on known or suspected terrorists.

26,chad,"These tiny pop outs still clinging to a paper ballot were used to determine whether a ballot was to be counted, and in whose favour. Tight TV close-ups of lawyers and scrutineers, heads inches apart, peering intently, at a debatable chad made the ridiculousness to which American democracy had descended even more painful.

In 2000, the president of the United States was chosen not by voters, not by the Electoral College, but by the Supreme Court. It was the controversial end to a bitter and divisive electoral outcome defined by the ludicrous process of adjudicating whether there was a “hanging chad” on any ballot.

Around the same time, young political activists in each Canadian political party became convinced that delegated conventions gave too much power to party elites, were undemocratic and subject to manipulation. Like dominoes each party establishment fell to the “one member, one vote” agitation.

Worse, the count of Florida ballots was frozen with tens of thousands of ballots unchecked, by Republican politicians and an imprudent — at best — Supreme Court. The sight of GOP operatives, sharp and slippery lawyers and a partisan court, cheating Al Gore of his presidency, feeds the anger and disillusionment of many Americans for whom it remains a deep scar to this day. Fair election counts matter and predictable and transparent counting processes matter most.

In a banquet hall in suburban Toronto last week we saw how demonstrably unequal, untransparent and simply undemocratic such systems can be. Yes, party bosses so determined, can manipulate election outcomes, or when exhausted and under pressure make dumb decisions, in any electoral system.

There was a whiff of mischief in the Alberta conservative leadership and at the end of the recent B.C. Liberal leadership campaign of similar type: party phone lines blocked, pin numbers not sent, IDs disappearing, questionable payments, etc.

The moral of the story, whether it is hanging chads, dubious delegates, or “one person, one vote” schemes, is that the system’s guardians and the rules they enforce must be clear, with no potential for late night “tweaks.” One may not be seen as a credible steward of party democracy if through incompetence or design you disenfranchise thousands of voters, or leave open to choice which riding they live in — on election night!

It’s past time to think again about party nomination and leadership processes.

We seem to have replaced the sleazy operative flipping bills off a roll of tens, with sneaky digital geeks manipulating identities, electronic payments, and access to the digital ballot box.

The election process must be seen to be fair and open: no ridiculously high financial deposits or nominating names thresholds, for example. The process must be overseen by guardians who are beyond reproach and have the experience, reputation and strength to stand their ground in the face of partisan bellowing. Voters need to have guaranteed access, throughout, to party decision-makers and referees about missing credentials, ballots or any other obstacle.

Rules about how the predictable variety of conflicts in a counting process will be resolved need to be public, and widely pronounced at the beginning of a contest, not after a bitter election night battle.

Here are two personal preferences: election decisions should be made by groups as close to the voters themselves as possible. Centrally run electronic ballot issuing and counting systems, are understandably seen as remote and insensitive, run by party bureaucrats whom you have never met. Far better, surely, to have riding-level decision-making about who gets to vote, who is a “real” party member, and how problems are to be solved.

Secondly, voters should be allowed to change their minds between ballots. Performance matters in politics, and leadership conventions are about candidate performance, as well as leadership selection. A powerful recent example is that Kathleen Wynne became premier significantly on the strength of her convention performance.

Processes that saw Doug Ford’s election, damaged the reputation of all parties and faith in democracy itself.
