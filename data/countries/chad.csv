The Memphis, Tenn., native pledged was Arkansas’ first 2019 pledge under coach Chad Morris. He committed while on a visit to Fayetteville in February. As of Monday afternoon, he no longer considered himself pledged to the Hogs. The move did not come as a major surprise after Hopper recently deleted all references to Arkansas on his Twitter account.

Hopper (6-foot-3, 265 pounds) is a 3-star prospect and the No. 473 overall recruit in his class according to the 247Sports composite. He attends Central High School.

His other offers include Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Louisville, Miami (Fla.), Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Tennessee. However, SEC Country has learned Memphis is now the perceived favorite to land his commitment.

Arkansas now has two commitments in the 2019 class — offensive lineman Beaux Limmer and athlete Malik Chavis. Both are 3-star recruits. Chavis is expected to play defensive back for the Hogs.

Late last year, clashes between armed groups Mouvement national pour la libération de la Centrafrique (MNLC) and Révolution et Justice (RJ) in north-west CAR forced more than 70,000 people from their homes.

“Since last December, more than 15 Central Africans refugees have been killed on both sides of the border and at least 67 have suffered sexual and gender based violence while trying to go back to CAR to gather food and their scarce resources in exile,” he said.

UNHCR and partners have been providing life-saving relief such as healthcare, water and sanitation, shelter, food and nutrition assistance to newly arrived refugees since the start of the crisis.

However, without increased food aid, refugees could face prolonged period of food shortage while overwhelm humanitarian agencies’ response ability.

Severe floods have not only affected harvest, but they also posed an urgent need for accommodation.

Therefore, UNHCR is building emergency shelter in the camps and villages that host them, while also working with the authorities, partners and donors on a relocation plan.

“The situation with refugees’ health is also critical,” said Mr. Baloch, stressing that “malnutrition levels are already high, especially with children.”

More mobile clinics are also urgently needed and local health centres must be strengthened to ease the heavy toll taken by respiratory infections, malaria and other diseases.

Southern Chad, including Goré, one of poorest and most underdeveloped parts of the country, is already hosting some 43,000 Central African refugees and 45,000 Chadian returnees from CAR. It is now struggling to cope with an additional influx of 22,180.","Alarmed by plight of Central African refugees in Chad, UN urges funding to scale up humanitarian response",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1005252
2,chad,"These final two and a half weeks leading up to the draft can take forever.

To fill the time, draft analysts continue to churn out mocks to try to get a better idea of how teams may pick. Chad Reuter of NFL.com put out another five-round mock and he has some familiar names joining the Chiefs. Let’s take a look.

Round 2, pick 54: Dorance Armstrong, EDGE, Kansas

This isn’t the first time Armstrong has been mocked to Kansas City. R.J. White of CBS Sports did so last month. The Chiefs met with Armstrong at the combine and told him they liked him a lot, so this wouldn’t be a surprising pickup.

Armstrong wasn’t too productive in 2017, earning just two sacks, but he was playing out of scheme. He’s better suited for a 3-4 scheme which is what the Chiefs run.

Armstrong is similar to a young Dee Ford in that he’s athletic but needs to work on his technique when he gets to the pros. That goes for most edge prospects. Luckily the Chiefs don’t necessarily need an immediate contributor at edge (although it certainly wouldn’t hurt). Taking one here would make sense.

Round 3, pick 78: Braden Smith, OG, Auburn

We talked about Smith in our potential offensive line prospects piece, projecting him as a second-round pick. Smith could certainly drop to round three and would be a steal for K.C. at this pick.

Smith will bring great size, versatility and toughness to whichever team drafts him. He could immediately compete for the Chiefs’ left guard spot and would have a good shot at winning that competition. Rounding out the offensive line by adding a guy like Smith would be a smart move for K.C.

Round 3, pick 86: Tarvarus McFadden, CB, Florida State

The Chiefs desperately need to address cornerback so I expect them to do so in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft. McFadden could go in round two but I think there’s a good chance he falls.

McFadden’s size for a corner is impressive at 6-foot-2, and he has the ball skills to come with that size. Unfortunately his speed is a concern. He ran a 4.67-second 40-yard dash which is terrible for a corner even at his size. He’s also not the best tackler which was a problem for K.C. last year.

The Chiefs might be better off taking a different corner here even if they have to sacrifice some size.

Round 4, pick 122: Rashaan Gaulden, CB, Tennessee

It’s interesting that Reuter has the Chiefs double-dipping at corner with back-to-back picks. I wouldn’t hate it. The Chiefs lack depth here and Gaulden would provide some nice versatility since he can play safety as well.

Safety might be the better fit for him because, like McFadden, Gaulden is tall (6-foot-1) and ran a slower 40 (4.61 at the combine, 4.69 at his pro day). He’s a good tackler and his field speed and agility are much better than his 40 suggests.

I wouldn’t mind the Chiefs taking Gaulden and using him as an in-the-box safety who can occasionally slide out to nickel in subpackages. Using him in the box would allow Eric Berry to move to centerfield which is where he excels.

Round 4, pick 124: Jordan Akins, TE, Central Florida

The Chiefs are highly interested in Akins so don’t be shocked if they take him. Akins could go lower in the middle rounds but the Chiefs might reach for him since they don’t have a fifth-round pick.

Akins will mainly be a pass-catching tight end in the NFL thanks to his speed. He’s a great pass-catcher and, while it could use some work, his blocking isn’t bad. He has shown the willingness to make blocks and stick with them downfield. He’ll just need to brush up on hand placement and instincts in the pros.

Akins could compete for the Chiefs’ No. 2 tight end spot because of his receiving ability. K.C. wants plenty of available pass-catchers for quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Akins fits the bill.

Overall draft grade: C+

I don’t like this mock as much as Reuter’s last but there is value with this one. It covers several needs and has the Chiefs making some value picks (Smith, Gaulden). If I could make changes, I’d probably swap positions in the second and third, having the Chiefs take a corner in round two and edge rusher in round three.",Chad Reuter updated 5-round mock: Reactions to Chiefs picks,https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/2018/04/09/chad-reuter-updated-5-round-mock-reactions-to-chiefs-picks/
3,chad,"These tiny pop outs still clinging to a paper ballot were used to determine whether a ballot was to be counted, and in whose favour. Tight TV close-ups of lawyers and scrutineers, heads inches apart, peering intently, at a debatable chad made the ridiculousness to which American democracy had descended even more painful.

In 2000, the president of the United States was chosen not by voters, not by the Electoral College, but by the Supreme Court. It was the controversial end to a bitter and divisive electoral outcome defined by the ludicrous process of adjudicating whether there was a “hanging chad” on any ballot.

Around the same time, young political activists in each Canadian political party became convinced that delegated conventions gave too much power to party elites, were undemocratic and subject to manipulation. Like dominoes each party establishment fell to the “one member, one vote” agitation.

Worse, the count of Florida ballots was frozen with tens of thousands of ballots unchecked, by Republican politicians and an imprudent — at best — Supreme Court. The sight of GOP operatives, sharp and slippery lawyers and a partisan court, cheating Al Gore of his presidency, feeds the anger and disillusionment of many Americans for whom it remains a deep scar to this day. Fair election counts matter and predictable and transparent counting processes matter most.

In a banquet hall in suburban Toronto last week we saw how demonstrably unequal, untransparent and simply undemocratic such systems can be. Yes, party bosses so determined, can manipulate election outcomes, or when exhausted and under pressure make dumb decisions, in any electoral system.

There was a whiff of mischief in the Alberta conservative leadership and at the end of the recent B.C. Liberal leadership campaign of similar type: party phone lines blocked, pin numbers not sent, IDs disappearing, questionable payments, etc.

The moral of the story, whether it is hanging chads, dubious delegates, or “one person, one vote” schemes, is that the system’s guardians and the rules they enforce must be clear, with no potential for late night “tweaks.” One may not be seen as a credible steward of party democracy if through incompetence or design you disenfranchise thousands of voters, or leave open to choice which riding they live in — on election night!

It’s past time to think again about party nomination and leadership processes.

We seem to have replaced the sleazy operative flipping bills off a roll of tens, with sneaky digital geeks manipulating identities, electronic payments, and access to the digital ballot box.

The election process must be seen to be fair and open: no ridiculously high financial deposits or nominating names thresholds, for example. The process must be overseen by guardians who are beyond reproach and have the experience, reputation and strength to stand their ground in the face of partisan bellowing. Voters need to have guaranteed access, throughout, to party decision-makers and referees about missing credentials, ballots or any other obstacle.

Rules about how the predictable variety of conflicts in a counting process will be resolved need to be public, and widely pronounced at the beginning of a contest, not after a bitter election night battle.

Here are two personal preferences: election decisions should be made by groups as close to the voters themselves as possible. Centrally run electronic ballot issuing and counting systems, are understandably seen as remote and insensitive, run by party bureaucrats whom you have never met. Far better, surely, to have riding-level decision-making about who gets to vote, who is a “real” party member, and how problems are to be solved.

Secondly, voters should be allowed to change their minds between ballots. Performance matters in politics, and leadership conventions are about candidate performance, as well as leadership selection. A powerful recent example is that Kathleen Wynne became premier significantly on the strength of her convention performance.

Processes that saw Doug Ford’s election, damaged the reputation of all parties and faith in democracy itself.

SEC Country’s LSU recruiting reporter Sam Spiegelman will answer reader questions Monday through Friday in a new segment called “LSU recruiting question of the day.” Feel free to join the conversation by tweeting your questions to Sam on Twitter (@samspiegs).

Why haven’t the Tigers noticed LW running back Chad Alexander? — dooza (@doozaboy) April 9, 2018

Let’s be honest. Members of the LSU staff and those in the personnel department are well-aware of Chad Alexander and his skill set.

At 5-foot-5 and a tad over 150 pounds, Alexander is in the discussion as one of the better scat backs in Louisiana for 2019. His role in the Landry-Walker (La.) High School offense paired with his combination of size, speed and agility make for an easy comparison to current West Virginia running back Tevin Bush, who was a dynamic weapon out of the backfield for the New Orleans powerhouse just a couple of years ago.

LSU’s 2019 running back board is pretty clear, though. It begins at the top with 4-star Southern Lab (La.) running back and longtime commit Tyrion Davis. The goal is to add some combination of either IMG Academy (Fla.) 4-star back Noah Cain or Destrehan (La.) 4-star back John Emery Jr. ahead of the December signing period.

Additionally, the team hosted 4-star Grayson (Ga.) athlete Ronald Thompkins II over the weekend. The talented 5-foot-11, 195-pound prospect is a projected running back that also could shift to slot receiver and play a handful of other roles in the Tigers offense. They recently offered 4-star Texas tailback Darwin Barlow, who has a similar build to Thompkins and Emery, and a visit could take place sometime in the near future.

While LSU is aiming to reel in at least two running backs in this recruiting class, it’s obvious that the staff is looking for a prototype at the position. Davis is a bruising downhill runner that will allow the offense to maintain a potent north-south rushing attack. Cain and Emery, like Thompkins and Barlow, add a bit more explosiveness along with great size and power.

Alexander is a few inches shorter than the aforementioned running backs and is more dynamic in space or in the passing game. LSU has not traditionally recruited running backs with that type of skill set, but could make the exception for Alexander if he were to camp in Baton Rouge and change their minds. In a class with added spots like 2019, coach Ed Orgeron and special teams coordinator Greg McMahon could be on the lookout for a return specialist such as Alexander.

For the most part, however, I’d lean toward either Emery or Cain joining the class first along with Davis before the team explores return specialists.

5,chad,"Operational Context

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

As wind whips through an open cockpit, the bush plane banks eastward above the red earth of central Africa. Columns of black smoke tower on the horizon—the calling card of armed cattle herders. The dry season is their time to escape the arid Sahel in search of pasture for their enormous droves—burning forest and poaching wildlife along the way. But they are not the only intruders. A bullet hole in the plane’s wing from a guerrilla’s potshot is a reminder that the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) still operates in these badlands, where war is again intensifying. The pilot, Cédric Ganière, peers into the hot, darkening haze. “There is nothing romantic about this,” he says. “They are destroying a country that isn’t theirs. The fox is in the middle of the chickens. It is just kill, kill, kill.”

This is the front line in the battle to save Chinko—one of the largest intact wildernesses in the heart of Africa. The reserve, deep in a remote corner of the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR), lies near borders with Congo and South Sudan. Sitting on an ancient volcanic plateau, the area supports an extraordinary mix of species thanks to a fusion of Congolian rainforest and wooded savannah, nourished by underground wells that feed an expansive network of waterways. This patchwork has created a vital paradise, home to hundreds of bird species and imperiled populations of megafauna—lion and leopard, chimpanzee and antelope, hippo and buffalo, wild dog and golden cat. Devoid of human habitation, it is one of the last holdouts for the country’s endangered elephant population.

But this enchanted Eden is under siege. A protracted civil war is escalating in the region—a brutal and forgotten conflict that has prompted warnings of genocide from the UN. Militarized poacher units have plundered the park to feed the lucrative, insatiable demand for bushmeat, ivory, animal skin, and traditional medicine. Miners illegally dredge riverbeds for diamonds and gold. And the slash-and-burn tactics of nomadic herders, who kill game to supplement their meager rations and salary, threaten a fragile ecosystem.

Within this maelstrom, a group of conservationists is fighting to protect Chinko. Leading this resistance is David Simpson, a charismatic 30-year-old and the park’s manager. His hunger for adventure led him to quit his factory job in the United Kingdom and move to the wilds of central Africa to work for a big-game hunting firm before transforming the area into a unique sanctuary.

Covering an area almost twice the size of Yellowstone, Chinko has since become a mini-state within a failed nation-state. The biggest employer outside the capital of Bangui, Chinko hires hundreds of locals (including reformed poachers) as rangers, builders, farmers, mechanics, and medics. But the park’s survival hangs on the fate of a chronically unstable region. Renewed conflict could wipe out everything Simpson and his cadre are dedicated to protecting.

***

High above the smoldering bush, Ganière calls the control room where NASA-made software plots each blaze on a Google Earth map. This nerve center and two small aircraft are Chinko’s eyes. Units of armed, camouflaged rangers below: its fist.

The tiny plane drops into a gut-wrenching turn toward base. On landing, Ganière spots Simpson, near the dirt airstrip chatting with a group of workers in Sango, the local language. This is a rarity for munju, or white foreigners, who, at best, typically learn a couple of phrases, then opt for French, the tongue of the country’s despised former colonial master.

Cédric Ganière flies over a bush fire on the Chinko savannah in his tiny, two-seater plane during a mission to spot cattle herders and blazes.

Wearing desert boots, tan chinos, and a checked shirt, Simpson has a coppery glow at odds with his origins in England’s leaden, drizzly north. His accent is an unusual blend: no-nonsense Yorkshire with a southern African twang. He is direct yet understated, with a light, good-humored touch, at ease holding court during Chinko’s nightly group dinners.

“People make conservation complicated,” says Simpson. “It’s not complicated. You just stop the people killing the animals, and then you’re done. How much do I deal with animals on a daily basis? Zero. I deal with people. Sort that out, and the animals are fine.” He pauses. “I wish it was just about animals, though. It’d be much fucking easier.”

The area around the Chinko River was not always a wildlife reserve. From 2005, it was administered by an isolated hunting ranch called Central African Wildlife Adventures, which ran high-end shoots on strict quotas for wealthy tourists. Simpson became general manager in 2011. Soon after, things began to fall apart in the region. Sudanese poachers and LRA rebels had already decimated the once-abundant elephant population; well-armed poaching groups were now butchering the remaining wildlife. “A client would be getting ready to shoot a giant eland, then a whole load of AK-47s would go off nearby and slaughter the entire herd,” recounts Simpson. “We once found an eland with eight AK bullets in it and was still going.” Buffalo were being annihilated; lion prides, poisoned.

In March 2012, Simpson and his team came across 13 victims of an LRA massacre near an illegal gold mine. Their skulls were crushed, and bodies hacked with machetes. He and Erik Mararv, the concession’s founder, went to the capital to answer questions as witnesses but were instead arrested for murder and jailed in a filthy, overcrowded prison. They later learned that an official involved in the ivory trade had pinned the murders on them.

Languishing in prison, the pair realized that the area around the Chinko River needed to be transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. “We had to protect it,” says Simpson. “It was under attack.”

***

Six months later, the trumped-up charges were dropped, and Simpson reunited with his parents in the UK. After three weeks, he and Mararv headed back to eastern CAR to begin the transformation. At first, Simpson says, his team, armed only with hunting rifles, faced poachers carrying AK-47s. But Chinko’s capabilities began to expand after securing funding and, in 2014, coming under the aegis of African Parks—a conservation nonprofit that has national parks covering 10.5 million hectares. A key objective was to clear the reserve of foreign pastoralists. Each dry season, hundreds of thousands of cows are herded south from Chad and Sudan in search of fresh vegetation, a yearly practice known as transhumance, now intensified by drought, desertification, and war.

A Chinko employee monitors screens in the park’s control room, where software plots ranger movement, bush fires, and other crucial information on a Google Earth map.

This tradition has existed for centuries but has altered radically with the proliferation of weapons and involvement of cattle barons who use cows as roving bank accounts. Desertification and conflict across the Sahel have pushed foreign pastoralists deeper into CAR and the Congo as they seek out verdant terrain, especially grasslands away from armed groups who levy taxes on migrating cattle. The animals overgraze land, spread disease, and devastate dry-season soil amid uncontrollable fires that are lit by herders to clear dense brush and encourage new grass growth.

Such mega-herds—each up to 800 strong—pass through the Chinko region. Park rangers have clashed with herders in shootouts, seizing weaponry and veterinary medicines. But diplomacy is preferred. Local negotiators meet with gun-wielding nomads over tea to encourage them to bypass the reserve through a specially designated “corridor,” marked by yellow plastic bags tied to trees. The herders are given food supplies if they don’t stray off the path. “Confidence does not come quickly, but we have started the process of communication,” says Chinko’s lead negotiator, himself the grandson of a cattle trader.

Surprisingly Chinko’s personnel also includes Hervé Ngambo, a short, unassuming man in his late 30s who, from the age of 15, worked as an elephant poacher. “In the bush, I would slowly approach the elephant until I was as close as possible,” he tells me one morning. “Then I would shoot it in its head, ears, or heart.”

At the start, Ngambo says he could leave his village and find an elephant the same day. A decade later, it took him weeks. Mass poaching was taking its toll. “I always had to come home with something. If I didn’t find an elephant, I’d kill a buffalo or other animals. We’d sell some parts and go back out as soon as possible.”

Elephants were the most valuable quarry. Each time he killed one, Ngambo called his contact, a man from CAR, who bought the ivory to sell to foreign dealers. Ngambo says a pair of tusks plus the meat could bag his five-strong hunting team more than $700—a decent sum in this desperately poor region. He claims he killed well over a hundred but has lost count.

As wildlife numbers plummeted, Ngambo struggled to make ends meet. Living near the Chinko boundary, this lifelong hunter was familiar with the park and embarked on a dramatic career change, joining the reserve in 2014 to track wildlife and poaching activity. “I stopped hunting because there were no animals left. I thought Chinko was good because I want my grandchildren to see elephants. Before, I needed to make money and there was no other work. Hunting was just a job. Now I am committed to protecting these animals.”

But only so long as Chinko exists. Ngambo said, “In my community, there is nothing. There is no work. If Chinko stopped tomorrow and I didn’t get a salary, I would have to go back to hunting.”

***

In the heat of a cloudless February afternoon, the helicopter races over Chinko’s savannah, a parched expanse interspersed with snaking trails of gallery forest, seemingly empty of all human life. That is, until the tents come into view.

Several dozen shelters cluster among charred trees. The thump of rotors draws out dozens of figures who disappear amid clouds of billowing dust. Simpson and his deputy, Evelyne Malfliet, step out to face a host of women and children wearing headscarves and vibrant dresses. They are Fulani—Islamic pastoralists by tradition and, in the case of this exiled community, survivors of savage sectarian violence.

Simpson and Malfliet walk through the desolate, makeshift village toward a small thatched hut where they meet with elders. The plight of this community can be traced back to the outbreak of civil war in late 2012, when a majority-Muslim coalition of rebels known as the Séléka advanced on the capital and overthrew the government, committing atrocities on their path to power. Militias composed largely of Christians—the anti-balaka—fought back. Clashes across the country killed thousands.

At the end of a meeting, the park manager, David Simpson, speaks with elders of a community that was displaced by vicious fighting and is now sheltering in Chinko.

The Séléka were eventually ousted, splintering into rival factions that now control some 80 percent of this mineral-rich country. Violence surged again in late 2016, compounding the humanitarian crisis and uprooting hundreds of thousands of people. One of them was Amadou Boukar, who, in March 2017, awoke before dawn to militants attacking his town, Nzako. “They killed lots of people—women and children,” says Boukar, a 41-year-old former shopkeeper and a father of five. “The attack lasted all day.”

Around 380 civilians fled into Chinko, where park staff gave them food and shelter, later relocating them deep in the savannah where the sheer remoteness offers protection, though hyenas and lions stalk their camp at night. “We would have nothing without Chinko,” Boukar continues. “We could not survive alone. But look at these children. There is no school. This is no future for them. We want to go home more than anything. All we need is peace.”

Chinko is a beacon in one of the world’s darkest corners, bringing order and employment in a time of chaos. It fills the void left by a wholly absent state, sending the park’s medical staff into the community and paying for 50 teachers who reach more than a thousand children. At stake is not just the ecology of the region—it’s the people, too.

Two suspected poachers who were arrested deep in the Chinko bush board a helicopter to be taken to a holding cell at the park’s main base.

“The conditions needed for people to thrive are the same conditions for wildlife and ecosystems to thrive,” says Peter Fearnhead, the CEO of African Parks. “If you have an ungoverned area where natural resources are being exploited in an illegal manner, this contributes to the cycle of poverty.” Well-managed reserves, he says, “can radiate a system of good governance over a very, very large area.”

Despite the existential threats and tortuous logistics of keeping Chinko afloat, Fearnhead believes it presents “one of Africa’s greatest conservation opportunities.” Already, against the odds, wildlife is bouncing back. “In CAR, you have this big black hole filled only with tragedy. Chinko portrays hope in a situation where everything is stacked up to be doom and gloom. We are not allowing Eden to be lost. We are in the process of bringing Eden back.”

***

Swaddled in khaki fatigues and a desert scarf, Stefan Maritz, Chinko’s acting assistant law enforcement manager, waits on the airstrip for takeoff in the 95-degree heat. This burly South African, a former lance-corporal, goes on leave tomorrow. Before his departure, there is one last task.

The day before, rangers found a poaching camp, uncovering a haul of carcasses—buffalo, crocodile, giant forest hog, monkey, water buck, and hippo (its teeth, a valuable substitute for elephant ivory). The rangers lay in wait for the poachers’ return, later catching five of them, confiscating shotguns, rifles, machetes, and a large cache of ammunition. These men are suspected to be part of a larger operation, backed by a wealthy businessman.

The chopper takes off and pushes to the south. “Our mission is to fight the wrong,” says Maritz. “In Chinko, there is authority. There are consequences for what you do. Once accountability falls away, nothing works anymore.”

Fifty miles on, the helicopter descends in a forest clearing. Carrying his Kalashnikov, Maritz greets two rangers who emerge from the scratchy, sun-scorched grass escorting two poachers, one of whom wears flip-flops; the other, barefoot and hobbling. For a fortnight these men have slept rough in the forest amid clouds of mosquitos and tsetse flies.

In a patch of shade, I ask them why they’re here. “This is the only way I can make money for my family,” responds Constant, a father of one in his late 30s whose wife is pregnant with their second child. He says he has been working here independently without support for two weeks and insists he wasn’t aware of Chinko’s boundaries. The rangers shake their heads. “There is no work in my village. There are no opportunities. I do this to survive.”

The two men stare into the trees. Constant seems resigned, strangely calm. The other, Kinimapé, looks forlorn—his eyes, bloodshot. After days of pursuing faceless villains in the bush, this is a strange meeting that only blurs the line between good and bad, between greed and desperation.

The rangers lead the men to the helicopter. It thuds back to base where the men are frogmarched to a holding cell for questioning. Three days later, they will be transferred to Bangui to enter the country’s decrepit justice system. Poachers can be jailed for up to ten years, but this is no real indication of the fate of these men. Whoever funded this poaching trip may let them languish behind bars, or pay off the cops and deploy them once more.

The sun slides behind a canopy of dark forest. The sky is a deep, bruised purple, slashed with red. The air is cooler now. After the day’s drama, Simpson is wrapping up before lights-out. He’ll be up by 5:30 AM tomorrow to do it all again.

“Give it five to ten years, Chinko will be the jewel of African Parks,” he says. “This could be a thousand-lion park. We could have 100,000 buffalo. We’ve now created some stability. If we keep on, we’ll see more development. Then, in time, hopefully, peace.”

Acute rainfall deficits last season in several regions of the Sahel, and worsening insecurity have escalated humanitarian needs.

Drought has prematurely thrust pastoralist communities into the lean season, with herders migrating earlier than usual. Growing insecurity in Mali and armed attacks in border regions with Burkina Faso and Niger have uprooted hundreds of families in recent months, adding to the devastation by the long-running conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Swaths of pastoral and agro-pastoral regions are suffering severe pasture and water deficits. Around 2.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are at risk of serious livelihood crisis in 2018.

Mauritania, and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal and Mali are the worst affected in the Sahel.

Armed attacks, banditry and intercommunity conflict have increased in Mali’s central regions. In areas unaffected by conflict, chronic vulnerabilities persist. In the Lake Chad Basin, humanitarian needs will remain high in 2018 and beyond. In areas worst hit by violence, almost 500,000 children are severely acutely malnourished and 5.8 million people are struggling with high levels of food insecurity.

In 2018, 24 million people will need humanitarian assistance in the Sahel. Some 32 million people are at risk of, or struggling with food insecurity – among them 10.8 million severely food insecure – and 4.7 million children are malnourished. Over 5 million refugees, internally displaced people and returnees are grappling with the consequences of forced displacement.

Sahel countries count among the world’s most at risk of crises and disasters. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts and floods and land degradation threaten the livelihoods of highly vulnerable communities. Food insecurity and malnutrition are often high and widespread, with seasonal peaks pushing millions into crisis. In the last decade, a spike in armed conflict and violence has worsened chronic needs, uprooted entire communities and disrupted livelihoods.

To address the most urgent needs across the region, humanitarians will need US$2.7 billion in 2018. In five countries – Cameroon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria – aid organisations and Governments have developed response plans to provide life-saving assistance and help communities rebuild livelihoods. In Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal, humanitarian work plans address acute peaks, while preparing the full integration of relief response in longer-term strategies that address the structural causes of vulnerability.

Humanitarian action across the region is progressively adopting the New Way of Working. Response strategies this year are further strengthening collaboration with Governments and development actors to provide urgent relief assistance and tackle the causes of recurrent emergencies. The Sahel humanitarian response is aligned with the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) priorities, which recognise the importance of the humanitariandevelopment and security-peace nexus and enshrines a proactive crisis prevention-oriented approach. The UNISS support plan seeks to address common humanitarian/security concerns in the Sahel, particularly the Lake Chad Basin areas, northern Mali and the Liptako-Gourma region.

Only concerted and sustained efforts by all actors can bring peace, security, and development, improve human rights, uplift Sahel’s most vulnerable inhabitants from recurrent crises, and create stable conditions for communities and families to prosper.

CONFLICT, FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION

PROTRACTED AND EMERGING CONFLICT

Conflict remains one of the main drivers of humanitarian emergencies in the Sahel. Increased hostilities could heighten humanitarian needs in the region, where 24 million require assistance this year.

The deteriorating insecurity has in recent months opened a new front. Regions in Burkina Faso and Niger bordering Mali have come under a rising spate of armed attacks that have devastated communities and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. In 2017, around 90 incidents of insecurity were recorded in Burkina Faso, forcing 141 schools to shut and affecting thousands of children. Villages in Niger’s western Tillabéri and Tahoua regions have also suffered multiple attacks that have uprooted residents. Burkina Faso and Niger respectively host 23,000 and 56,000 Malian refugees.

Mali and the Lake Chad Basin remain the region’s prominent conflict hotspots. In Mali, insecurity is spreading from the northern to the central regions. Clashes between armed groups, banditry and intercommunal violence recurrently cause displacements. Some 5.1 million people – more than 27 per cent of the country’s population – live in the areas affected by insecurity. Currently 59,000 people are displaced within the country, and almost one in five Malians is food insecure. While humanitarian assistance has enabled hundreds of thousands of people to survive, the situation remains critical. In 2018, aid groups will assist around 1.6 million people, 200,000 more than the previous year.

Across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin, around 2.2 million people have been displaced. Millions of people are grappling with hunger, poor living conditions in displacement sites and other adversity unleashed by the nine-year-long conflict. Humanitarian action has saved many lives, but millions of people still require relief assistance to survive and rebuild their livelihoods.

As humanitarians strive to assist Sahel’s vulnerable populations, Governments are making efforts to tackle extremist violence. The establishment of the G5 Sahel Joint Force hopes to address a key factor of regional instability. However, military operations could complicate humanitarian access, underscoring the need for dialogue and coordination between humanitarian and military actors.

FOOD INSECURITY, DROUGHT AND PASTORAL CRISIS

Following poor rains in 2017, Mauritania and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal are witnessing severe pasture and water shortages. In these areas, the lean season has begun early and will last longer. Many pastoralist communities, who make up 30 per cent of Sahel’s population, begun migrating earlier than usual and will face a tough lean season as their resources dwindle. The early transhumance is exacerbating vulnerability. Meat and milk production has declined, livelihoods taken a hit and food prices are increasing. Terms of trade between cereals and livestock is unfavourable for herders. For instance, in Mali, Mauritania and Niger it dropped by 15 - 50 per cent compared to December 2016. In areas where pastoralists have moved into, the additional herds are exerting pressure on limited water and pasture and the likelihood of intercommunity tensions increased.

Across the region, food insecurity will remain high owing to the effects of poor rainfall, transhumance restrictions, high staple food prices and increasing displacement by conflict. For children, worsening food security will create additional hurdles such as learning difficulties or school retention, as parents are unable to afford fees and need their children to stay at home to work.

HIGH MALNUTRITION RATES

Malnutrition also remains prevalent in the region and is expected to deteriorate if early and sustained actions are not taken. Poor access to healthcare, water, sanitation, education and other basic services has left millions of children suffering from acute malnutrition. Some 4.7 million children are likely to face acute malnutrition. Global and severe acute malnutrition rates have surpassed the emergency threshold in parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. The drought that has also caused crisis among Sahel’s pastoralist communities is likely to increase the already high malnutrition rates. Education can play a key role in malnutrition prevention programmes by assisting children in school and their young parents with nutrition education, malnutrition screening services and prevention packages for the household.

MOBILISING FOR ACCELERATED RESPONSE

Humanitarian needs remain high in the Sahel, home to some of the world’s most protracted and severe crises. The impact of climate change, armed conflict and insecurity, underdevelopment and poverty subject millions of people to severe hardship. Around one in five people requiring humanitarian assistance in the world resides in the Sahel, and 16 per cent of the region’s 150 million inhabitants needs help.

The number of people uprooted, mainly by conflict, has nearly tripled in the past four years, rising from 1.8 million in 2014 to more than 5 million this year. Humanitarian response budget has hovered around $2 billion over the same period. In 2018, Sahel’s budget accounts for 12 per cent of the $22.5 billion global humanitarian financial requirement.

Progressively adopting the New Way of Working, humanitarian, Governments and development actors in the region have developed strategies to respond to the humanitarian emergency and address the causes of Sahel’s recurrent crises. Donor support has been critical in saving lives. 2018 is expected to be a very difficult year not only for pastoralist communities but also for thousands of communities who rely on markets for access to food in the Sahel. Accelerated efforts by all actors are crucial in reducing human suffering and restoring livelihoods.",Sahel 2018: Overview of Humanitarian Needs and Requirements,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/sahel-2018-overview-humanitarian-needs-and-requirements

The security situation in neighbouring countries continues to generate significant population movements towards Chad, particularly in the south of the country, as well as internal displacements in the Lac region.

Millions of people suffer the consequences of food insecurity and malnutrition every year, especially in the Sahel belt and recently in previously spared areas, such as Tandjilé. This situation is likely to worsen during the lean season (June - Sept.), which may occur early in 2018. The health system remains weak, exposing the country to epidemic risks and persistent diseases such as measles, hepatitis E and malaria, with a direct impact on morbidity and mortality.

All of these factors expose already vulnerable populations to recurring crises, affecting their resilience capacity and making imperative an integrated humanitarian and development approach to overcome the cycle of chronic crises.",Chad: Humanitarian situation overview (as of 28th February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-humanitarian-situation-overview-28th-february-2018
10,chad,"After nine years of conflict in north-east Nigeria, 4.5 million people in the Lake Chad Basin need immediate food support and are dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. They remain cut off from their traditional livelihoods in an area where agriculture, fishing, livestock rearing, and regional trade were dynamic prior to the crisis. The number of food-insecure people across the region is expected to increase to 5.8 million by August 2018.1 The situation will keep deteriorating for the foreseeable future unless there is a concerted effort, driven by the governments of the conflictaffected countries, to lift communities out of a protracted crisis and support them to resume their lives and livelihoods. This cannot wait. A short-term humanitarian response, focused solely on keeping people alive, is not enough.

More than 2.2 million people remain displaced across Niger, Chad, Cameroon and north-east Nigeria as a result of the conflict. At the height of the conflict in 2014–15, non-state armed groups controlled about 20,000 square miles of land within north-east Nigeria alone (20% of Nigeria), where close to 1.8 million people lived.2 Military strategies to cut the armed groups off from their economic resources and declared ‘state of emergencies’ have had disastrous impacts on civilians’ access to livelihoods. Despite the government regaining control of areas in recent years, almost one million people are still living in out-of-reach areas and many communities remain displaced – or experience onward displacement – with little or no hope of returning to their homes due to threats from non-state armed actors and ongoing military operations in their villages of origin.

In Nigeria, one in five internally displaced persons (IDPs) have stated their intention to integrate locally in the current area of their displacement; and many others, while expressing the desire to leave, have asserted that the security situation is not yet conducive for going home.3 A significant return movement is not expected among Niger and Chad’s displaced communities in the coming year.

Ongoing insecurity, compounded by the lack of access to livelihoods, continues to expose displaced communities to protection threats such as killing, abduction, and sexual abuse, forcing them to resort to dangerous activities and negative coping mechanisms to survive. For women and girls, some of these negative coping mechanisms include early marriages (a direct consequence of lack of resources) or survival sex. Men and boys are also targeted and faced with abduction and killing as they go for firewood collection or to farm in insecure areas.

The food situation, far from improving, is expected to deteriorate from mid-2018, when climate-related stresses across the Sahel region are likely to compound the situation. According to a humanitarian needs forecast for the region, 62% of the Chadian population in the Lake region is expected to be food-insecure during the 2018 lean season: a 52% increase compared with 2017.4 In Nigeria, 3.7 million people could become food insecure if appropriate assistance is not delivered (compared with 2.6 million in January 2018). According to the 2018 Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan,5 5.7 million people are in urgent need of early recovery and livelihood assistance in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. However, the early recovery and livelihood sector was only 7.7% funded in 2017.6

While many humanitarian and development actors consider that conditions for early recovery are met in certain locations (the Lake region of Chad, most of Adamawa and Yobe state in Nigeria, the western part of Diffa region in Niger), the relative improvement in the security situation over the past two years has not translated into an improved access to livelihoods in most areas. Thanks to generous funding – 70% of the 2017 humanitarian response plan was funded in Nigeria – and a massive humanitarian scale-up, famine was averted in the north-east of Nigeria. But a similar level of humanitarian assistance will be hard to maintain in 2018, and even if it can, this will not provide a long-term solution to the lack of access to food and livelihoods in this protracted crisis.

The continuing lack of safe livelihoods risks contributing to ongoing cycles of violence, fuelling grievances and further undermining the stretched coping capacities of impoverished communities. Massive investment in livelihoods opportunities is needed now, combining short- and long-term approaches, to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Action must be taken immediately: vulnerable women, men and children cannot wait until they are safe to go home for a more durable solution. A strong political vision is required from the governments of conflict-affected countries, which should take the lead in coordinating humanitarian and development interventions. Moreover, investment in livelihoods should be seen as an opportunity to empower women and youth and to reduce gender inequality, in order to promote long-term peace in the region.","Supporting livelihoods in the Lake Chad Basin: Ways forward for conflict-affected communities in Nigeria, Niger, and Chad",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/supporting-livelihoods-lake-chad-basin-ways-forward-conflict-affected-communities-0

A court in the capital city N’Djamena yesterday ordered the release of Tadjadine Mahamat Babouri, known as Mahadine, who had been detained since 30 September 2016, after simply having posted several videos on Facebook criticizing the government’s management of public funds.

We are delighted that Mahadine has been released and will finally be reunited with his loved ones after spending over 18 months in prison on trumped up charges Balkissa Ide Siddo, Amnesty International Central Africa researcher Share this Twitter

“We are delighted that Mahadine has been released and will finally be reunited with his loved ones after spending over 18 months in prison on trumped up charges,” said Balkissa Ide Siddo, Amnesty International Central Africa researcher.

“More than half a million people from across the world signed letters and petitions calling for Mahadine’s release, and they too will be delighted to know that he is finally free.”

Mahadine had originally been charged with undermining the constitutional order, threatening territorial integrity and national security, and collaborating with an insurrectional movement. If he had been convicted he could have faced life imprisonment.

However, in March 2018, these charges were dropped and replaced with the much lesser charge of defamation. Following this requalification, the court recognized that he had long passed the limit for preventative detention and ordered his release. He will appear again before the court on 19 April but should remain free as defamation cannot be punished with imprisonment under Chadian law.

After being arrested on 30 September 2016, Mahadine was held for three days at a facility run by the National Security Agency (Agence National de Sécurité, ANS), where he was denied visits from his family or lawyer. During this time he was tortured, beaten up and subjected to electric shocks. He was then held in several facilities including the prison in Moussoro, from which he was transferred to Amsinene prison in Ndjamena on 21 February 2018.

Mahadine was one of 10 prisoners of conscience who were highlighted as part of Amnesty International’s annual Write for Rights campaign in 2017. Over 690,000 actions were taken from people across the globe for his immediate release. They had also called, pending his release, for his transfer to the Amsinene prison in Ndjamena, to be closer to his family.

Mahadine is one of dozens of human rights defenders, civil society activists and journalists in Chad who have been arbitrarily arrested in recent years for criticizing the government. In September 2017 Amnesty International launched a report highlighting the sustained increase in repression since both the 2015 presidential elections and the introduction of severe austerity measures to combat the country’s sharp economic crisis.

It is good news that Mahadine has finally been freed, but real and lasting change in Chad will mean reforming laws and practices to ensure that no one can be arrested simply for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression Balkissa Ide Siddo Share this Twitter

12,chad,"(N'Djamena, 29 March 2018): The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Mark Lowcock, has approved the allocation of US $ 6.8 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for rapid response in the south of Chad. These funds will help provide vital humanitarian assistance to 45,000 people in need, including newly arrived refugees from the Central African Republic and their host communities.

Since 26 December 2017, clashes in northern Central African Republic have triggered important influxes of populations seeking refuge in southern Chad. More than 22,000 new refugees have been registered by UNHCR and the National Refugee Agency (CNARR) while cross border movements continue and the security situation remains volatile in CAR. Humanitarian organizations have rapidly deployed to provide life-saving assistance, but capacities are stretched and more resources are necessary to scale up the response and support host communities, who have shared their resources and face the risk of becoming food insecure as their food stocks are depleted. This new crisis occurs in a context where there are already 77,000 refugees and 43,000 Chadian returnees living in precarious conditions in southern Chad.

The Humanitarian Coordinator in Chad, Mr. Stephen Tull, warned of a possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation, “current humanitarian assistance is insufficient given the scale of needs, particularly against the backdrop of food insecurity and the fast-approaching rainy season, which could further exacerbate vulnerabilities. This CERF funding is critical for our response in southern Chad while our humanitarian appeal continues to be seriously underfunded year after year. Increased donor funding will be essential to save lives through sustaining and expanding our humanitarian operations.”

In total, eight projects will benefit from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocation and will help provide multisector refugee assistance (about 32% of the funds), food security and livelihoods (30%), health (10%) and nutrition (8%), protection (7%), water and sanitation (6%) and education (2%) services to over 20,000 refugees and 25,000 people among vulnerable host communities. Three per cent of the funds will also be allocated to UNHAS air services to maintain humanitarian access to the south of Chad. The United Nations recipient agencies are the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). They will work together with NGO implementing partners and state services to deliver the various projects over the next four months.

According to Abdoulaye Sawadogo, Head Ad Interim of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Chad, ""it is essential that other donors scale up their support, especially development donors, because CERF funding will only cover a fraction of the needs, and it is vital to strengthen the resilience of affected populations and provide them with sustainable solutions. This will require long-term political and development investments in the region.""

A response plan was developed by UNHCR and partners to respond specifically to the urgent needs of newly arrived refugees from the Central African Republic and vulnerable host communities. Implementing this plan requires US$ 28.5 million, of which US$ 3.5 million is already mobilized and US$ 6.8 million is now funded by CERF, leaving a funding gap of US$ 18.2 million.

In 2018, humanitarian partners in Chad need US $ 544 million to save and improve the lives of the 1.9 million most vulnerable people in the country. To date, less than 4% of the required funds have been met at national level. In 2017, only 45% of funding needs were covered, a decrease compared to the 53% received the previous year.

Note to editors: Created by the United Nations General Assembly in 2006, CERF is a humanitarian funding mechanism managed by OCHA, which enables a faster and more effective response to vital needs of people affected by natural disasters, armed conflicts, or under-funded crises.

The Lake Chad Basin humanitarian emergency is among the most severe in the world. The protracted conflict has uprooted around 2.3 million people, stoked high levels of hunger and malnutrition, and subjected millions of civilians to extreme hardship. Insecurity is hampering the resumption of normal life, leaving conflict-affected families dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.

Recent developments

The recent months have been marked by major incidents of insecurity that have claimed lives and disrupted humanitarian operations. On 1 March, armed attackers raided Rann town in Nigeria’s north-east, killing three aid workers and abducting three others. Humanitarian workers have been temporarily relocated from the town.

Two weeks earlier, heavily armed men stormed a school in Dapchi, also in north-east Nigeria, and kidnapped over 100 school girls, most of whom have reportedly been freed. Attacks are recurrent and insecurity is prevalent. In January alone,

Cameroon’s Far North region suffered more than 30 armed attacks. Also in January, some 8,000 people were uprooted in the region’s Mayo Tsanaga department by the attacks and military operations. During a visit to Cameroon and Chad,

UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, called on the international community and Governments to support humanitarian actors in increasing their operations. Funding shortfalls, alongside impediments to access, are major obstacles to providing adequate relief assistance. This year, USS$1.6 billion are needed to assist 7.8 million conflict-affected people.

Like the swallows in San Juan Capistrano, the NBA playoffs descend upon us every spring. And though you might think the NBA playoffs are interminable, they actually come and go quicker than the swallows. Plus there is no swallow among the swallows — and I’ve studied them since 1978 — that you could call the “LeBron James of swallows.”

Anyhow, here is everything you need to know about the NBA postseason that Jalen Rose won’t tell you:

Can anyone stop James Harden?

Sports

The Houston Rockets have the NBA’s best record, largely due to the brilliance of presumptive league MVP Harden.

Harden is a delight to watch, unless you’re rooting for the other team, in which case you are not delighted that he gets fouled EVERY SINGLE TIME HE DRIVES TO THE BASKET.

In the NFL, there is the “Tom Brady Rule:” If a defender appears to touch to Brady after he releases the ball, it is roughing the passer. In the NBA, there is the “James Harden Rule:” If a defender appears to defend Harden as he slithers through the lane, it is a shooting foul.

Trying to guard Harden in the open court is like trying to eat soup with a fork.

True story: I bumped into Harden the other day at the supermarket, and the security guard removed me from the store.

Harden is attempting 10.1 free throws a game, tops in the NBA this season. The next best is Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 8.7, and he only gets fouled that often because his jersey is wider to accommodate his 13-letter last name, resulting in more incidental contact with helpless defenders.

Brad Stevens appears to be the real deal

In the past generation, the college game’s best and brightest used-carpet salesmen, Rick Pitino and John Calipari, landed in the NBA from the NCAA with a thud. Less-celebrated college-coaching stars, such as Lon Kruger, Leonard Hamilton, Tim Floyd and Mike Montgomery, also failed in transitioning to the pro game.

Stevens, meanwhile, went from Butler to Boston as seamlessly as Marco Polo went from the Adriatic Sea to Asia.

Now in his fifth Celtics season, the team’s record has improved every year. Stevens could turn water into wine, whether it’s San Pellegrino or something Danny Ainge hands to him in a paper cup.

The Celtics have the league’s fourth-best record despite turning over most of their roster, with seven rookies on board. They lost their new All-Star acquisition, Gordon Hayward, on opening night, and their best player, Kyrie Irving, has been sidelined for a month and will miss the entire postseason.

Stevens is so good, I’m willing to bet he could take over the current presidential Cabinet and make America a winner.

Trust The Process? A thousand times no

Let me apologize to the 76ers, who I predicted would finish 39-43, and let me acknowledge the stellar play of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. But though I love watching this team play, I cannot root for Philadelphia, because this team has been fraudulently constructed.

If tanking is the future of Sports Nation, Couch Slouch will be on the next Greyhound to Gatineau. Besides, I love a good poutine.

I cannot Trust The Process. I mistrust The Process. I bemoan The Process. I reject The Process. I condemn The Process. I spit on The Process.

The Process is more insidious than Russian meddling. Because this is a threat from within, not from a hostile foreign power. This is intentional, hidden-in-broad-daylight rigging of the results.

This is so un-American, I’m surprised it hasn’t cracked the Liberty Bell again.

Good luck knocking LeBron out of the East playoffs

He’s made the NBA Finals seven straight seasons. He’s more dependable than chicken soup. He’s indestructible; if he lay down on train tracks, no train would ever harm him.

In a fabulous 15-year career, could he really be having his finest season? It’s the closest he’s ever come to averaging a triple-double — 27.7 points, 9.2 assists, 8.7 rebounds.

At this point, only an apocalyptically moronic imbecile — or Skip Bayless — could possibly be critical of LeBron’s NBA legacy.

16,chad,"Background

The Lake Chad Basin humanitarian emergency is among the most severe in the world. The protracted conflict has uprooted around 2.3 million people, stoked high levels of hunger and malnutrition, and subjected millions of civilians to extreme hardship. Insecurity is hampering the resumption of normal life, leaving conflict-affected families dependent on humanitarian assistance for survival.

Recent developments

The recent months have been marked by major incidents of insecurity that have claimed lives and disrupted humanitarian operations. On 1 March, armed attackers raided Rann town in Nigeria’s north-east, killing three aid workers and abducting three others. Humanitarian workers have been temporarily relocated from the town.

Two weeks earlier, heavily armed men stormed a school in Dapchi, also in north-east Nigeria, and kidnapped over 100 school girls, most of whom have reportedly been freed. Attacks are recurrent and insecurity is prevalent. In January alone, Cameroon’s Far North region suffered more than 30 armed attacks. Also in January, some 8,000 people were uprooted in the region’s Mayo Tsanaga department by the attacks and military operations. During a visit to Cameroon and Chad, UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, called on the international community and Governments to support humanitarian actors in increasing their operations. Funding shortfalls, alongside impediments to access, are major obstacles to providing adequate relief assistance. This year, USS$1.6 billion are needed to assist 7.8 million conflict-affected people. Last year, the $1.5 billion budget received 62 per cent of the funds.",Lake Chad Basin: Crisis Overview (as of 26 March 2018) - Interactive,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/lake-chad-basin-crisis-overview-26-march-2018-0
17,chad,"The latest stop on our draft prospect tour is in Miami, with a mid-round project pass rusher that the Buccaneers could add to their group of defensive linemen.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were aggressive in their pursuit of defensive end help this off-season. They acquired free agent Vinny Curry, and pulled off a blockbuster trade with the New York Giants to acquire veteran Jason Pierre-Paul. Both of those moves will help generate significantly more pass rush than the Buccaneers had last year, but the team shouldn’t rest yet in their attempt to rebuild the defensive line.

While the Buccaneers likely won’t spend their first round pick on a defensive end anymore, the rest of their picks are fair game. Tampa will likely try to add a “project” player into the mix – a player with a very high ceiling who may not be ready to start right away. Miami’s Chad Thomas is a strong candidate if the Bucs choose to go with that strategy.

Thomas’s College Career

Chad Thomas played four seasons for the Miami Hurricanes, accumulating 10 sacks, 26 tackles for loss, 103 total tackles, 7 passes defensed, and 2 forced fumbles. Thomas was quiet as a freshman and sophomore playing mostly in spot duty as a backup. Thomas had just one sack in those two seasons, but started getting going as a junior, when he started 12 games and had a career high 4.5 sacks, 11 tackles for loss, and 37 total tackles.

Thomas also played one of the best games of his collegiate career that season against Florida State when he got 2 tackles for loss, a sack, and four solo tackles. In Miami’s bowl game to close the season Thomas had another strong performance with a half-sack, forced fumble, fumble recovery, and 4 solo tackles.

Thomas returned to school as a senior to build upon his draft stock and for the most part it was a successful choice. He set career highs in tackles and tackles for loss, and also tied his sack count from the year before. In the ACC championship against Clemson he shined with seven tackles, two tackles for loss, and a sack. Thomas disappointed at the combine, but his four year campaign at Miami should still put him in position to be a day two pick in the draft, likely in round three.

Pros

Chad Thomas has a lot of the things that you can’t teach. He is very much a classic example of a player with all of the measurables you could ask for and the right “look”. Thomas in that way is the defensive version of quarterback Josh Allen, who also has all the measurables but not enough production. Thomas measured in at 6’6, 281 lbs (nearly the same as Jason Pierre-Paul) with a 33 1/2 inch wingspan.

From a purely athletic standpoint Thomas offers a lot to love for teams. He bursts out of his stance and can take advantage of slower, more cumbersome offensive tackles to close the pocket in a hurry. Thomas has the capability to line up inside at defensive tackle on passing downs in the NFL, and that potential versatility will capture a lot of attention from teams who want to maximize usage of their draft prospects.

Cons

While Chad Thomas has many attributes that can’t be taught, there are a lot of things that he needs to be taught. Thomas disappears for long stretches and in four years at Miami wasn’t able to find consistency or get more than 4.5 sacks which is very worrisome. Thomas by most estimations seems to be missing the finer points of playing defensive end and the little things that push talented players to become elite players. He doesn’t have great instincts against the run and often times gets neutralized at the beginning of the play – it’s difficult to tell whether Thomas rushes with a plan or if he simply relies on his athletic gifts, so NFL teams will need to try to figure that out in their sit-downs with him.

Why the Buccaneers Need Chad Thomas

Tampa Bay has assembled a strong group of pass rushers to improve on their league-worst 22 sacks last season, but they still need to add a bit more young talent to the mix. Chad Thomas has that potential talent, and the Buccaneers have an experienced defensive line coach in Brenston Buckner who was hired in part to maximize talented, incomplete players.

Having a quality rotation of defensive ends is critical in the NFL and the Buccaneers seem to almost be there. Thomas would be a situational addition at first while he nails down the nuances of his position and becomes a more consistent performer. A rotation of Pierre-Paul, Curry, Spence, Gholston and Thomas looks extremely appealing.

Will it Happen?

Landing Chad Thomas will be a bit tricky for the Buccaneers. Because of the trade for JPP the Bucs are without a third round pick, which is the ideal round for Thomas to be picked. He wasn’t productive enough to warrant a second round selection, so the Bucs would need to hope that he slips to the fourth round. If that happens and the Bucs haven’t already spent a first or second round pick on another end, I could definitely see them selecting Thomas with their fourth rounder.","Tampa Bay Buccaneers draft profile: Edge, Chad Thomas",https://thepewterplank.com/2018/04/07/tampa-bay-buccaneers-draft-profile-edge-chad-thomas/
18,chad,"A. Situation analysis

Description of the disaster

Following clashes between armed groups in the North of Paoua in the Central African Republic (CAR) and a steady upsurge of violence in recent months, since 26 December 2017, an influx of CAR refugees entering the Eastern Logone region in the South of Chad has been observed since 26 December 2017. According to UNHCR Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, released on 12 March 2018, about 19,910 Central African refugees have arrived in Chad since the beginning of 2018. The situation is constantly evolving and according to UNHCR-Chad weekly report of 2 March, during the last week of February approximately 2,500 new arrivals were recorded in the Moissala area. Pre-registrations are on-going as new arrivals continue to be identified.

This latest influx is the largest population movement ever observed since the beginning of the crisis in 2013: It exceeds the total number of arrivals to Chad for the whole year 2017, which amounts to 2,000 people. Given the volatile and unpredictable security situation in the North of CAR (Ouham Pende), the presence of refugees will most likely continue for a long time.

In the context of this crisis, the Government and UNHCR, after noting the limited effects of ""camps"" on the socioeconomic integration of refugees, now favours the settlement of refugees from the emergency phase, into host villages such as the Diba experience. Only a part of the new arrivals is being registered in camps, which often constitute ""islets"" that limit the integration of refugees. In recent weeks, authorities and humanitarian partners have been working on redefining the relocation and identification strategy of these refugee resettlement sites / villages.

Chad Red Cross (CRC), in close collaboration with the ICRC and the French RC, has from the onset of this refugee influx, activated its departmental committee and the local volunteer network to monitor the situation. It equally deployed a joint Red Cross Movement assessment mission in January 2018, to assess the needs of the affected populations.

The initial RCRC Movement joint needs assessment in January, as well as the UNHCR Emergency Response Plan, highlight that over 40 host villages are overwhelmed by a precarious food situation, with urgent needs for shelter, food, drinking water, health, education and care for children. There is also a need to strengthen basic services (water, sanitation and health) in these villages. It is for these reasons that Chad RC is requesting a total amount of CHF 271,180, to support in responding to the direst needs of these refugee and host households.

Bearing in mind that during the first weeks of this refugees’ influx, UNHCR was still working on finetuning its strategy, Chad Red Cross, for proper response and action, took the necessary time to observe the evolution of the situation on the ground while coordinating with all actors to plan accordingly for an adequate intervention to fill existing gaps.

As the situation does not seem to be improving, Chad Red Cross within the framework of this DREF, aims to target the priority gaps highlighted by the Government, as well as UNHCR's weekly report of March 2 and Emergency Response Plan for Central African Refugees, particularly about needs in the WASH sector. Indeed, it is essential to respond before the start of the rainy season, in May-June, to the urgent needs in water, hygiene and sanitation and prevent any epidemic outbreaks, while ensuring better access to basic services.",Chad: Population Movement from the Central African Republic (CAR) - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF n°MDRTD017 / PTD027,https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-population-movement-central-african-republic-car-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-0
19,chad,"Amina Mohammed said recent joint efforts by the four of the region’s affected countries – Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria – have resulted in “considerable progress” in the fight against the extremists, including the liberation of hostages as well as territorial gains.

However, she reported that the group has stepped up the use of women and girls as suicide bombings, while children were deployed in 135 such attacks in 2017: a five-fold increase over the previous year.

“It is now key to stabilize the areas that have been reclaimed, and that we seize the opportunity to really promote sustainable development,” said the UN deputy chief, speaking via videoconference from Liberia where she is participating in celebrations to mark the end of the UN peacekeeping mission in that country, known as UNMIL.

Ms. Mohamed was joined by Mohammed Bila, a representative of the Lake Chad Basin Commission based in the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, and Senior Conflict Advisor at Adelphi, Chitra Nagarajan, in painting a picture of the factors behind people’s suffering in the Lake Chad Basin and driving some to terrorism one year after the Council adopted its first resolution on the activities of Boko Haram in the strife-torn region.

Boko Haram, an Islamist militant organization based in north-east Nigeria, has carried out raids, suicide bombings and kidnappings across the Lake Chad region over the past decade.

Their operations have led to displacement, insecurity, destruction of infrastructure and what Ms. Mohammed described as a “complex and dire” humanitarian situation, with nearly 11 million people requiring assistance.

The group gained international notoriety in 2014 after abducting more than 270 girls from a Government school in Chibok, Nigeria.

It is believed to be behind the kidnapping last month of 110 schoolgirls from the Nigerian town of Dapchi, most of whom were safely returned this week.

Overall, Boko Haram has abducted more than 4,000 women and girls, according to the UN deputy chief, who added that those who return to their communities are often stigmatized.

As the violation of human rights continues to fuel insecurity in the Lake Chad Basin region, Ms. Mohammed said investing in community justice mechanisms will be essential for reconciliation, as well as for ensuring accountability and promoting peace.

She stressed the need to incorporate human rights and gender dimensions into activities aimed at countering terrorism or preventing violent extremism.

For example, she said the increase in Boko Haram’s use of women and girls as suicide bombers could be due to a lack of women security officers who can search other women at checkpoints.

And she called for more international action to support children affected by the upheaval in the region.

Chitra Nagarajan, a Senior Conflict Advisor with the think tank Adelphi, who is based in north-east Nigeria, also used her briefing to touch on the gender-related aspects of the crisis and also its impact on persons with disabilities.

In addition to the threats outlined by Ms. Mohammed, she spoke of how women and girls are pushed into early marriage with combatants, for example, or they fall victim to sexual abuse and exploitation, including at the hands of people who are supposed to protect them.

“Men and older boys are often the first to flee insecure areas,” she said, speaking via videoconference from the city of Maiduguri.

It is now key to stabilize the areas that have been reclaimed [from Boko Haram], and that we seize the opportunity to really promote sustainable development — UN deputy chief Amina Mohammed

“They are deliberately targeted, killed and forcibly recruited by armed groups. They’re viewed suspicion, arrested, and detained by security agencies, and they are involved in fighting, leaving women of all ages, as well as girls, younger boys and older men struggling to cope.”

The Security Council meeting took place as the United Nations marked World Water Day, which focusses attention on the importance of managing freshwater resources.

Mohammed Bila, a Remote Sensing Expert with the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), a decades-old initiative to regulate and control the use of water and other natural resources in the region, spoke of how climate change has had an impact on water governance.

He said the shrinking of Lake Chad has affected communities which depended on its shoreline to grow crops, leading to increased competition for water, accusations of river diversion, loss of livelihoods and social tensions.

He told the Council that the environmental monitoring network there is “inadequate, sparse, poorly funded and operated,” with only one water level measurement station for the entire lake.

“The environmental challenges facing the Lake Chad basin are interconnected to the challenges of climate change faced by the region of the Sahel of Africa,” he said.

“The Sahel is increasingly facing extreme variability of climate resulting in frequent droughts, short-duration high-intensity rainfall, desertification, water scarcity, land degradation, and ultimately food insecurity. Consequently, addressing the climatic root causes of local challenges through risk assessment and management will require a similar solution at the Sahel regional level.”","Lake Chad Basin: Areas reclaimed from Boko Haram must be stabilized, Security Council told",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1005721

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In Cameroon’s Far North region, around 30 attacks were recorded in January alone in which around 20 people were killed, homes destroyed, livestock and property looted. Military operations have triggered displacements and restricted humanitarian assistance. Some 8,000 Cameroonians fled their homes in Mayo Tsanaga due to recent military operations and armed incursions. Since January, around 2,000 Nigerian asylum seekers relocated to Minawao camp, the main refugee settlement in Far North region. Part of them fled military counter-offensives in Nigeria’s Sambisa Forest area into Cameroon while a majority were out of camp refugees who decided to join the camp due to robberies and attacks in the villages they had settled in.

In Niger, armed raiders have killed and abducted civilians in Diffa region. An average of 12 civilians were killed, injured or abducted every month in 2017 in the region, a decline from an average of 20 per month in 2015 – 2016.

DISRUPTIVE ARMED ATTACKS

The recent months have been marked by dramatic incidents of insecurity. Armed raiders on 19 February abducted 110 school girls in Dapchi locality in Nigeria’s north-eastern Yobe state. The incident happened nearly four years after the kidnapping of over 270 girls from their school in Chibok area in Borno state. The authorities said most of the girls were freed on 21 March. The Government had previously announced that it prefered to negotiate their release. Attacks and insecurity remain prevalent in north-east Nigeria and the Far North region of Cameroon.

On 1 March, an attack on the town of Rann in Borno, near the border with Cameroon, claimed the lives of three aid workers. Three others were abducted and another injured. As security assessments are being carried out, a temporary relocation of the aid workers stationed in Rann was decided. The town is home to around 80,000 people, including 55,000 internally displaced persons who are mostly dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. Attacks on camps for displaced, villages and towns are recurrent, causing death and injury to civilians and continuous population displacements.

PERSISTENT FOOD INSECURITY

Protracted violence, population displacements and disrupted livelihoods have contributed to high levels of hunger across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin region.

Some 5.8 million are currently food insecure. Increased humanitarian assistance and favourable harvest in certain areas have helped ease food insecurity.

However, most poor households and displaced people remain highly dependent on food assistance to survive.

Staple food prices are mostly well above average, making food access even more difficult for households with few income-earning opportunities. In areas in Nigeria’s north-east which are hard to reach for humanitarian organisations, there is an elevated risk of famine, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) warned on 2 March. However, it pointed out that there is insufficient evidence to make a formal determination on famine.

PROTECTION

Protracted violence continues to subject civilians, including IDPs, refugees and host communities to grave protection risks and violations. In Chad, 106 cases of gender-based violence were reported in January in the western Lac region, mostly physical assaults (33 per cent) and resource deprivation (27 per cent). All victims received psychosocial support, but very few received medical and legal assistance. In 2017, 2,270 cases of sexual and gender-based violence were reported.

Comprehensive care for survivors is a persisting challenge. In 2018, the main challenge is access to justice for GBV survivors due to impunity, weak legal systems and cultural barriers. Access to health care services is also extremely limited and the number of mobile clinics has fallen due to lack of funding.",Lake Chad Basin: Crisis Update No. 22 (January - February 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/lake-chad-basin-crisis-update-no-22-january-february-2018
21,chad,"You know by now that Internet of Things devices like your router are often vulnerable to attack, the industry-wide lack of investment in security leaving the door open to a host of abuses. Worse still, known weaknesses and flaws can hang around for years after their initial discovery. Even decades. And Monday, the content and web services firm Akamai published new findings that it has observed attackers actively exploiting a flaw in devices like routers and video game consoles that was originally exposed in 2006.

Over the last decade, reports have increasingly detailed the flaws and vulnerabilities that can plague insecure implementations of a set of networking protocols called Universal Plug and Play. But where these possibilities were largely academic before, Akamai found evidence that attackers are actively exploiting these weaknesses not to attack the devices themselves, but as a jumping off point for all sorts of malicious behavior, which could include DDoS attacks, malware distribution, spamming/phishing/account takeovers, click fraud, and credit card theft.

To pull that off, hackers are using UPnP weaknesses in commercial routers and other devices to reroute their traffic over and over again until it's nearly impossible to trace. This creates elaborate ""proxy"" chains that cover an attacker's tracks, and create what Akamai calls ""multi-purpose proxy botnets.""

""We started talking about how many of these vulnerable devices are out there and what can they be leveraged for, because most people seem to have forgotten about this vulnerability,"" says Chad Seaman, a senior engineer on the security intelligence response team at Akamai. ""As part of that we had to write some basic tools to find what was vulnerable. And some of these machines did have very abnormal [activity] on them. It was not something that we honestly expected to find and when we did it was kind of like 'uh oh.' So this theorized problem is actually being abused by somebody.""

Down With UPnP

UPnP helps devices on a network find and essentially introduce themselves to each other, so that a server, say, can discover and vet the printers on a network. You can find it both on internal, institutional networks and on the larger internet, handling things like IP address routing and data flow coordination. UPnP works with and incorporates other network protocols to negotiate and automatically configure these network communications, and it can be used when applications want to send each other large quantities of data to facilitate a sort of unrestricted firehose—think video streaming, or a gaming console talking to its web server.

'This theorized problem is actually being abused by somebody. Chad Seaman, Akamai

When IoT devices expose too many of these mechanisms to the open internet without requiring authentication—or when credential checks are easily guessable or can be brute forced—attackers can then scan for devices that have implemented a few of these protocols badly all in one device, and then exploit this series of manufacturer missteps to launch an attack.

That's also how the Akamai researchers found the malicious UPnP proxy schemes. Akamai says it found 4.8 million devices on the open internet that would improperly return a certain query related to UPnP. Of those, about 765,000 also had a secondary implementation issue that created a bigger network communication vulnerability. And then on more than 65,000 of those, Akamai saw evidence that attackers had exploited the other weaknesses to inject one or more malicious commands into the router mechanism that controls traffic flow. Those final 65,000 devices were grouped together in various ways and ultimately pointed to 17,599 unique IP addresses for attackers to bounce traffic around to mask their movements.

Uptick in Attacks

Just because they haven't been seen until recently, that doesn't mean UPnP attacks haven't been around. Last month, for example, Symantec published evidence that an espionage group it tracks known as Inception Framework uses UPnP proxying to compromise routers and obscure its cloud communications. But observers note that the strategy is probably not more common because the schemes are difficult to set up.

""In particular it's annoying to build these attacks against hundreds of personal routers, and testing these attacks is hard too,"" says Dave Aitel, who runs the penetration testing firm Immunity. ""I've not seen it in the wild. That said, a working version would get you significant access."" He notes, though, that data leaks stemming from implementation mistakes, like the ones Akamai detected, make it easier for attackers to craft their attacks. For the manufacturers who developed vulnerable devices? ""It falls under the 'WTF were they thinking' category,"" Aitel says.

Notably, the Akamai researchers saw evidence that UPnP proxying isn't just being used for malicious activity. It also seems to be part of efforts to skirt censorship schemes in countries like China to gain unfettered web access. Even when a user is behind the Great Firewall, they can use a proxy network built on exposed devices to query web servers that would normally be blocked. Akamai's Seaman notes that the group approached publishing its research carefully, since plugging these holes will limit people's ability to exploit them for access to information. Ultimately, though, they concluded that the risks must be addressed, especially given how long the vulnerabilities have been known for.

'It falls under the ""WTF were they thinking"" category.' Dave Aitel, Immunity

Users won't realize if their devices are being exploited for UPnP proxy attacks, and there is little they can do to defend themselves if they have a vulnerable device besides getting a new one. Some devices will allow users to disable UPnP, but that can lead to functionality issues. Though more and more devices have improved their UPnP implementations over the years to avoid these exposures, Akamai found 73 brands and almost 400 IoT models that are vulnerable in some way. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which tracks and warns about vulnerabilities, wrote in a note to impacted brands that, ""CERT/CC has been notified by Akamai that a large number of devices remain vulnerable to malicious NAT injections. ...This vulnerable behavior is a known problem.""

The whole point of proxying is to cover your tracks, so a lot is still unknown about how attackers use UPnP proxying and for what. But Akamai's goal is to raise awareness about the problem to ultimately reduce the number of vulnerable devices that exist. ""It was one of those things where it was like, this would be bad and it could be used for these attacks, but no one ever actually found it being used for that,"" Akamai's Seaman says. Now that it has been, hopefully manufacturers will finally do something about it.

22,chad,"Social media and messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber have been blocked in Chad, a move advocacy groups have linked to the tense political situation in the country.

From as early as Mar. 28, users started reporting a shutdown, according to the organization Internet Without Borders (IWB). The internet censorship watchdog, the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), also confirmed network measurement data showed the BBC’s news website was blocked.

The cutoff comes after a national conference, boycotted by the opposition, recommended constitutional changes that could extend president Idriss Deby’s rule until 2033. Deby has ruled over the Central African nation since 1990. Legislative elections, due in 2015, have also been pushed behind several times. A largely semi-desert nation plagued by instability, Chad’s economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. But the plunge in commodity prices has pushed the government to impose cuts in spending that has roiled the nation in strikes and protests.

“Unfortunately, the Chadian regime is used to shutting down telecommunications, [the] internet in particular, whenever there are demonstrations or public expression of people’s discontent towards the government,” says Julie Owono, the executive director of IWB. Owono said the government might have instituted the blackout after videos of clashes within president Deby’s own Zaghawa clan were shared on WhatsApp. Authorities also didn’t respond to IWB’s request on why they blocked the BBC’s online site.

The current shutdown comes just days after advocacy groups submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Council detailing evidence of breaching freedom of expression, access to information, and the right to privacy. The violations included the January internet blackout ahead of demonstrations organized by civil society organizations, besides the eight-month social media cutoff following controversial elections in 2016. IWB estimates all these blackouts combined cost the Chadian economy €18 million ($22.1 million).

Yet Chad is hardly the only African government shutting down the internet or blocking messaging apps: nine African countries did so last year ahead of elections, political protests or national exams.

23,chad,"Previously Africa’s largest water body in the Sahel region, Lake Chad has lost its glory and is facing extinction since 1963 when its size shrunk from 26,000 square kilometres to 1,350 square kilometres by 2001.

It lost about 95% of its size to inefficient damming and irrigation methods thereby affecting the over 30 million people in Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria who depend on the water body as their major source of water.

Cameroon-based architecture firm Hermann Kamte & Associates (HKA) has come up with an idea to use architecture to revive the shrinking lake back to its glory. They have designed a state-of-the-art desalination and research center called The Forgotten – Dead or Alive.

According to environment news site inhabitat.com, the center was designed by HKA to have an amphibian-like form to blend in with the lake surroundings. It will also connect the lake to the Atlantic Ocean via pipelines, which would transport water from the ocean.

The desalination center would treat the salt water which will be reused as fresh water to help restore the lake, reports inhabitat.com. It adds that the pipelines and lake research would take place between 2016 and 2026.

HKA published images of the design which looks like an ultra-modern football stadium on water. It says in 2020 trees and vegetation will be planted around the lake; and in 2080, the pipelines will transporting water from the ocean will be shut.

Currently, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) are sensitizing the 9 million people close to the lake over their activities that is affecting the water body.

LCBC is a regional body that regulates the use of the basin’s water and other natural resources. They maintain that inefficient damming and irrigation methods by countries bordering the lake are partly responsible for its shrinkage.
