Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

1,chad,"Andy Dalton has come under fire in recent years, largely due to the Bengals’ struggles on the field.

Dalton has typically been one of the NFL’s more scrutinized quarterbacks throughout his career in Cincinnati. He briefly silenced his critics with his big 2015 season, which saw him playing at an elite level for stretches.

However, Dalton has regressed in each of the past two seasons, as he’s committed 27 turnovers since 2016 after committing just nine in 2015. His completion percentage has also lowered in each of the past two seasons, while the Bengals have gone 13-18-1 during that span.

So of course, the quarterback is going to get the brunt of the blame, but Chad Johnson doesn’t want to hear it. He recently took a fan to task on Twitter and defended Dalton:

Don’t ever disrespect Andy Dalton, you don’t understand the difficulties one must endure at the helm, when he’s upright & able to go through his progressions he is as good any one, even under duress he makes plays others wouldn’t.

MILWAUKEE — The Milwaukee Brewers bring out the best in Chad Kuhl.

Kuhl and Richard Rodriguez combined on a two-hitter, leading the Pittsburgh Pirates over the Brewers, 9-0, on Sunday.

Kuhl is 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA in six starts against the Brewers, and the Pirates are unbeaten in those games.

“There were a few games last year that really stand out,” Kuhl said. “This is up there, just for the amount of weak contact and all that. It was one of my better ones, for sure.”

Adam Frazier, Jordy Mercer and Josh Bell hit solo homers for the Pirates, who are 9-3 against NL Central teams.

Kuhl (4-2) allowed one hit in seven innings, struck out eight and walked two, lowering his ERA from 5.01 to 4.12. Domingo Santana singled in the second and was erased on a double play.

“His secondary pitch command today was as good as I've ever seen it,” Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. “His fastball probably had the most finish we've seen this season.”

Kuhl settled in after going to three balls on each of the first four batters.

“He's got a real good arm. He's throwing hard. There was obviously no pressure on him at all today,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.

Rodriguez struck out his first four batters, allowed Hernan Perez's single up the middle, then stuck out his final two hitters.

Chase Anderson (3-3) gave up five runs and five hits in 5 1⁄ 3 innings. Anderson has given up 10 home runs in 45 1⁄ 3 innings after allowing 14 last season in 141 1⁄ 3 innings.

“When you don't hit your spots and you pitch in a place like this, and if the ball's up a little bit, balls are going to tend to fly out of the park,” Anderson said.

Frazier hit his first leadoff homer, his second home run this season, and Corey Dickerson added an RBI double later in the inning.

Mercer's first homer since Sept. 11 made it 3-0 in the second. The Pirates added four runs in the sixth on a leadoff triple by Starling Marte and five consecutive one-out singles. Dickerson, Colin Moran, Mercer and Kuhl drove in runs.

Bell homered in the seventh against Jorge Lopez.

“There was not much good to report about today's game,” Counsell said.

Kuhl was masterful, but the Brewers have struggled offensively.

Milwaukee has been shut out seven times in 35 games after being blanked eight times last season. Milwaukee was shut out three times in a four-game sweep by the Cubs in late April.

“It's a big number already, for sure,” Counsell said.

Brewers infielder Eric Sogard is hitless in his last 27 at-bats, the longest hitless streak by a Brewer since Aramis Ramirez went 0 for 28 in 2014. Sogard has drawn five walks during that span, and his batting average has dropped to .100.

Notes: Pirates righty Joe Musgrove (right shoulder strain) will make a rehab start with Double-A Altoona on Monday. ... Brewers catcher Stephen Vogt (right shoulder), on a rehab assignment at Double-A Biloxi, came out of Saturday's game after making a throw on a steal attempt. Vogt is scheduled to return to Milwaukee to be examined. ... All-Star closer Corey Knebel (left hamstring) pitched Saturday at Biloxi and was scheduled to pitch again Sunday. “He's on track to join us at the end of the week at the latest,” Counsell said. ...

3,chad,"""According to the Grand Bargain commitments, there is a need for more direct support and funding to local and national responders. Through this project, we will strengthen civil society organisations' capacity to respond professionally to humanitarian crises, and better help people affected,"" says Felix Muhigana, NORCAP Project Manager.

Close to 17 million people are affected by the humanitarian emergency across the four Lake Chad basin countries; Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. The crisis is characterised as one of the world's most severe. More than 2.3 million people are displaced, and communities are suffering from violence, food insecurity and malnutrition.

""Unchartered terrain""

Four NORCAP experts are already on their way to Niger and Chad. They are hosted by World Food Programme and UNICEF, but will work independently from their host agencies.

""We are very excited to do a completely new project. This is unchartered terrain for us, and for NORCAP"", says Slim Florian Bacha, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and deployee to UNICEF in N'Djamena, Chad.

According to Muhigana, the deployees will map and identify those civil society organisations that are most in need of capacity building and help them develop skills and expertise in areas such as financial management, organisational development and monitoring and evaluation.

""This is the kind of expertise that the organisations said they needed the most. In addition, deployees will link up with existing donors in Chad and Niger, to advocate and enable organisations to get direct access to donors and funds. With a better knowledge of how these things work, they will be able to better serve people in need, says Felix Muhigana.

""This project has a lot of potential, because we are able to set an example of how this can and should be done. At the same time, it is a huge responsibility. We will communicate closely across the region and with our Project manager, to make sure we get off to a good start"", explains Karolina Olofsson, Organisational Development Coordination Expert. She is going to work from Diffa, in Niger, with WFP.

Stepping stone for the future

NORCAP's collaboration with the Civil Society Network begun with the Lake Chad Donor Conference in Oslo, February 2017. The conference raised awareness about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin, aiming to ensure donors pledged money and commitment to scale up humanitarian interventions and alleviate human suffering.

During the conference, the Civil Society Network, an organisation with representatives from the Lake Chad Basin countries, approached NORCAP for a possible partnership. NORCAP did a scoping mission to Chad and Niger, which in turn secured funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""This project is very different from what we've done before, but it speaks to NORCAP's strategic commitments. During the project's pilot phase, we will actively explore additional partnerships to further develop local capacity in the Lake Chad basin, including with relevant donors,"" says Ulf Flink, Head of the NORCAP Unit in NORCAP.",Empowering the first responders,https://www.nrc.no/expert-deployment/2016/2018/empowering-the-first-responders2/
4,chad,"GENEVA / N’DJAMENA (30 April 2018) – The UN Working Group on mercenaries has called for more financial and other resources to stop armed conflict in Chad and surrounding countries and to put an end to human rights abuses committed by multiple actors, some of whom are foreign fighters and alleged mercenaries.

The abuses identified include killings and torture. More resources will help millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the fighting, they said.

In a statement at the end of a nine-day visit to the country the UN experts said the activities of armed groups, including Boko Haram, have provoked a huge humanitarian crisis and it is essential for human rights to be put at the centre of efforts to combat them.

“Boko Haram has destroyed communities that have lived and obtained their livelihoods in the Lake Chad region for many years. They have killed around 30,000 people, caused the internal displacement of around two million others and left around 10 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance,” said Patricia Arias, a member of the Working Group delegation.

“Scores of human rights abuses including killings, torture and abductions have been inflicted on the local population, including women and children. Women have been subjected to sexual violence and used as suicide bombers,” she said.

“The Lake Chad region, which is now the centre of Boko Haram attacks and violence, is the site of a humanitarian crisis that affects not only Chad but neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. But the entire country is also challenged by a number of armed conflicts in which foreign fighters and mercenaries are engaged,” she added.

The experts said many people were forcibly recruited into Boko Haram, including nationals of the countries bordering Lake Chad. However, they noted that mercenaries from countries outside the region had also joined the group, reportedly to provide training.

The UN experts say understanding the motivations of people joining extremist groups and engaging in mercenary activities is critical. More than half of the population of Chad are under 18 years old, and about 40 percent live in poverty.

“With such a high poverty rate there are serious risks of young people joining groups like Boko Haram and Daesh for financial and material gains, and in the Lake Chad region, where some of the poorest and most marginalised communities are, the risk is even higher,” said Ms Arias.

However, the Working Group made clear that the security threat was not only focused on the Lake Chad region. In the north, the conflict involving Daesh in Libya had heightened concerns particularly after its recent alliance with elements of Boko Haram.

In the east, the conflict in Sudan had resulted in an influx of thousands of refugees into Chad, while to the south violence in the Central African Republic had had the same effect. During our visit we heard Chad described as “an island surrounded by an ocean of wars”, the experts noted.

“Trans-border criminal activities by armed groups are rampant in parts of the country known as ‘no man’s land’, which are vast open areas that provide routes for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.”

As a result of the violence and armed conflicts, Chad is now hosting more than 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, around 70,000 Chadian citizens have returned mostly from the Central African Republic and are gathered at sites around the country, including N’Djamena.

“The humanitarian situation coupled with security threats is simply overwhelming,” said Saeed Mokbil, another member of the Working Group. “The 2015 suicide bombings by Boko Haram and incidents of internal armed rebellion in N’Djamena have also highlighted the volatile situation in the country,” he stressed.

“Security measures are therefore imperative, but they must be implemented in line with human rights standards. This includes ensuring people arrested for their alleged connection with armed groups like Boko Haram are not held without due process. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure human rights; including fair trial guarantees for detainees in places like Koro Toro are fully respected.

“Promoting development, alleviating poverty, building peace and social cohesion are important in providing durable solutions for the local population. These all require strong regional and international support. Humanitarian agencies seriously need more resources and funding in order to carry out critical programmes to support affected populations,” said Mr. Mokbil.

The Working Group commended positive initiatives by the Chadian authorities, including the ratification of the OAU Convention on the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa. A new penal code adopted last year includes a specific provision criminalising mercenarism. But, so far, there have been no prosecutions under it.

The delegation members held meetings in N’Djamena and visited the returnee and refugee site at Gaoui. They met Government representatives, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organisations and victims of human rights abuses.

The Working Group will present a full report on the findings of its visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

Full statement in French and English

The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination was established in July 2005 by the then Commission on Human Rights. Its mandate was further extended by the Human Rights Council in 2008. The Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world. The Chairperson-Rapporteur is Mr. Gabor Rona (United States of America). Other members are Ms. Elzbieta Karska (Poland) Ms. Patricia Arias (Chile), Mr. Anton Katz (South Africa), and Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen).

The Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.

5,chad,"In Cape Town, the residents brace for “Day Zero” in late August, when the taps could run dry. Further north, in the Sahel, drought has prematurely thrust migrating communities into the crosshairs of soldiers from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, adding to the conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Looking out her window at the snow-covered ground following another nor’easter, climate scientist Lisa Goddard ponders weather’s effect on other global crises: the drought leading to the Syrian civil war, torrential rain causing floods in India and Pakistan, the recent hurricanes that wrecked the Caribbean — outcomes she might have predicted. But unlike a TV meteorologist, Goddard, director of Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), doesn’t attempt to forecast the weather on any specific day. Rather, she looks months ahead, offering longer-term predictions — a bit like The Old Farmer’s Almanac but with “climatology and actual statistics of variability behind it,” she says.

“We study phenomena that may cause a region’s climate to differ from previous years,” Goddard continues. “A key factor is the temperature of the oceans … and since ocean currents change slowly, we can anticipate their effects on the atmosphere.”

As the director of IRI, which assists developing countries to prepare for and manage the impacts of climate change, Goddard, 51, has traveled from Colombia to Zambia — and many countries in between — helping to build national forecasting systems from scratch and working with aid agencies, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to anticipate the next weather emergency. Until just recently, however, neither Goddard nor academics in general have been seated at the tables of the United Nations, the World Bank or any other multilateral organization advising on policy and programs for society at large.

Goddard is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.”

That will soon change. In April 2017, President Lee Bollinger announced Columbia World Projects (CWP) — perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in his nearly 16-year tenure — to connect the capacities of the Ivory Tower to organizations with the power to translate research into programs that benefit the global community. “The extraordinary developments in recent decades of greater interconnectedness … have created or accelerated highly complex problems and have given rise to political movements favoring a reversal or change of course,” Bollinger said in a statement announcing CWP. “The multilateral institutions created in the period following the Second World War are straining under new realities. … All of this calls out for universities to become more involved.”

Nicholas Lemann, former dean of Columbia’s journalism school, has been tasked with directing CWP, and Goddard will lead its inaugural project focused on climate threats to food production and nutrition in six countries (Ethiopia, Senegal, Colombia, Guatemala, Bangladesh and Vietnam). In addition to improving food security, her goals include expanding economic livelihoods and supporting environmental stability. Goddard also wants to expand an enterprise created and implemented at the IRI — index insurance, which issues payouts to farmers in years when the weather causes categorical loss.

Surprisingly, climate change did not drive Goddard’s interest in weather. It started instead with a love of physics. Born in California to a teacher and a government official, Goddard received her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in atmospheric and oceanic sciences from Princeton University. While at Princeton, she developed a curiosity about the cyclical El Niño climate pattern, which brought her to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the El Niño guru himself: Mark Cane, who helped build the first computer model to successfully predict the 1985 El Niño months in advance. Cane went on to found the IRI with a mission to help millions of people by better preparing for the effects of droughts and changing ocean temperatures.

“I have known Lisa since she was a student, and as the IRI director, she has worked a miracle, taking an organization that was demoralized and facing a serious threat to its existence, and bringing it to extraordinary vibrancy,” says Cane, referring to IRI’s loss of funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which threatened to shutter the institute a few years back.

“I believe the IRI is increasingly recognized worldwide as the expert institution for application of climate science to societies in the developing world. This was what the IRI was intended to be, but it took Lisa to make it a reality,” Cane adds.

For her part, Goddard, who has two sons and lives north of Manhattan near the Hudson River, says that she is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.” Still, she has her critics. Judith Curry, a former professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, says that IRI’s seasonal forecasting methods are several levels below state of the art.

“Their approach relies heavily on forecasts of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña, which has no particular skill beyond a few months,” Curry says. “Even if they were able to accurately predict [the El Niño effect], this shows very little skill in predicting the intensity of the Asian and African monsoon rains. Simply put, they are not using the best models, and their interpretation of the drivers of climate dynamics is overly simplistic.”

Goddard says that even the best models have errors and biases. “This is something that is not handled in any sophisticated way for real-time prediction at any other center in the world,” she explains. “The biggest sin in the prediction world … is using the output of a model, straight off the shelf, and without consideration of those who are using the information.” People of all backgrounds with a little training can make use of the information the IRI provides, Goddard insists, not just climate scientists.

“Once, in a meeting in Kenya,” Goddard recalls, “a colleague of mine communicated the concept of probability, which is not a word in their local language, to aid workers by using a paper airplane, which he flew repeatedly, marking all the spots where it landed on the floor to represent the range of possible climate outcomes.

“The locals got it, and their communities have since embraced our forecasts.”",Severe Weather Ahead: She's Predicting the Next Climate Crisis,https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/severe-weather-ahead-shes-predicting-the-next-climate-crisis/85664

On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

“Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. Canada is proud to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. This support will save lives and help to alleviate the suffering of people living in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs

Quick facts

In 2018, 3.3 million people will need life-saving assistance in Cameroon to meet their basic needs. This represents an increase of approximately 14% since 2017.

The funding announced today is in addition to the nearly $20 million in humanitarian assistance already announced in 2018. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s total contribution this year for Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria to over $47 million.

In February 2018, Minister Bibeau visited Maiduguri and Bama, in northeast Nigeria, where she met with members of communities affected by the Lake Chad Basin crisis, including survivors of gender-based violence, children and new mothers, as well as representatives of key humanitarian organizations.

9,chad,"Finding themselves with some free time on a warm spring day midway through last week, Chad Beebe and his dad, Don, took advantage to get out and do some fishing.

Catch anything?

“Oh, a couple, just mostly smaller stuff,” Chad Beebe said of the day’s take that they released.

“That was fine. All I wanted to do was get out for a little while, take my mind off things for a bit.”

His future, of course, had weighed heavily in the former Northern Illinois wide receiver’s thoughts the previous week, when he monitored the three-day NFL draft.

The 5-foot-10, 190-pound Beebe was not taken in the draft and not offered a free agent contract by any teams.

He did, however, get a couple of bites from two teams — the Minnesota Vikings and Indianapolis Colts — willing to let him test the NFL waters with invitations to their rookie mini-camps.

Beebe spent last weekend in Minnesota and this weekend will be in Indianapolis, which has a new coach in Frank Reich.

Reich, of course, was the backup quarterback to Jim Kelly during much of the time Beebe’s dad was playing with the Buffalo Bills in a nine-year NFL career that included six Super Bowl appearances.

“I do remember going to (Reich’s) house for dinner,” Chad Beebe said. “But I was about 4 when my dad retired as a player so my memories of that time are pretty vague.”

Beebe went on to play for his dad in high school at Aurora Christian before moving to NIU. The younger Beebe had 775 all-purpose yards last fall, capping an injury-plagued collegiate career that featured 64 receptions for 930 yards and three TDs.

He also returned punts and kicks and held for field goals and PATs.

“I’m just happy with the way things worked out, that I have the potential to maybe earn a contract,” Chad Beebe said. “Growing up as a kid, that’s all you can hope for, to get an opportunity. My passion is to play football.”

It hasn’t always been easy.

Beebe played in 10 games as a freshman and had an 80-yard TD catch against Massachussetts. He appeared in 12 games with five starts for the Huskies as a sophomore, but broke his arm late in the MAC championship game.

Doctors inserted two plates and 13 screws to repair it.

Beebe returned in 2015 and played in 13 games but suffered a season-ending leg injury the summer before his senior season in 7-on-7 drills. He had to have a hamstring tendon reattached, along with work on his knee and took a medical redshirt, returning for senior year in 2017, when he missed three more games to injury.

“Some people think I’m crazy to continue to play,” Chad Beebe said. “But this is what I need to be doing right now. It’s my passion.

“It’s funny, my parents had me try all sports when I was young and I just gravitated to it, especially offense. I love the game, love the feel of game day and putting the pads and cleats on.”

Not always, though.

“I remember starting at 5 or 6 and playing in little league (football) out in Plano,” he said. “My very first practice I got clocked pretty good and was crying on the way home.”

His dad told him he didn’t have to play if he didn’t want to. The youngster simply returned with more resolve.

And, he still has it.

“It’s funny, even with all the injuries,” he said. “I feel great. I’m running the fastest I ever have and I’m stronger than ever before.”

• UNHCR condemns forced return of Nigerian refugees from Cameroon to Borno

• Acute food insecurity persists in northeastern Nigeria • 2.3 million people in Nigeria reached with food assistance in March

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

• The International Organization for Migration (IOM) identified approximately 1.72 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states as of mid-April, an increase of nearly 85,700 people—5.5 percent—from February. Borno hosts approximately 83 percent of the IDP population in the three states.

• According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Government of the Republic of Cameroon (GoRC) has forcibly returned nearly 390 refugees to Borno in 2018, which the GoRC has denied. On April 22, the UN agency released a statement condemning the forced return of Nigerian refugees from Cameroon to Borno.

• Ongoing insecurity in northeastern Nigeria could hinder crop production during the main 2018 agricultural season, with many vulnerable households remaining dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet basic needs, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). FEWS NET projects that Crisis—IPC 3— and Emergency—IPC 4—levels of acute food insecurity will likely persist through September in most of Borno and parts of Adamawa and Yobe.5 • Humanitarian actors provided emergency food assistance to an estimated 2.3 million people in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe in March.

On 14 April, the first group of Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad returned home to North Darfur in Sudan.

Over 3,000 children from Jebel Marra assisted to take Grade 8 examinations.

The UN commemorated the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action on 4 April.

The latest FPMA Bulletin by FAO reports that prices of wheat, mainly consumed in urban areas, declined in the capital, Khartoum, by more than 20 per cent in March with the ongoing harvest.

First convoy of Sudanese refugees from Chad

For the last 15 years, Adam El-Nour Abakar, 45 years old, was in exile in Chad. Last week, Adam and his family returned to their home in Kebkabiya village, in North Darfur with their five Children, all of whom were born in Chad.

“I’m so happy to return to my country with my family. I really feel comfortable and content. I cannot thank UNHCR and the Governments of Chad and Sudan enough for facilitating our return to Sudan,” said Abakar, with a deep sigh.

Adam and his family are part of a first convoy of 53 Sudanese refugees, who returned to Sudan from eastern Chad on 14 April, after more than a decade in exile. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the Commissioner of Refugees (COR), Hamad El-Gizouli, welcomed the returning Sudanese refugees at the reception centre in Tina, North Darfur. Besides three months of food rations, the returnees were provided with a reintegration package and transportation of personal belongings and livestock to their home villages in North Darfur. The return follows the signing of a Tripartite Voluntary Repatriation Agreement in Khartoum on 31 May 2017, between the Governments of Sudan and Chad and UNHCR. Mr. El-Gizouli described the return as a historic moment. He reiterated the importance the Sudanese Government attaches to the voluntary return of refugees, and the hope that these returnees will be able to rebuild their lives as Sudanese citizens.

Sudan and Chad—with assistance from UNHCR and its partners—plan to repatriate 20,000 refugees from Chad this year. At least 300,000 Sudanese refugees are in Chad, many of whom fled Sudan following the conflicts in Darfur between 2003 and 2004. With the new stability and improved general security in Darfur, many have indicated an interest in returning, according to UNHCR.

With a shortfall of US$37.7 million to respond to recovery, returns and re-integration, Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR Representative for Sudan, appealed for urgent funding to assist the efforts of the Government of Sudan to provide durable solutions for returning communities.",Sudan: Humanitarian Bulletin | Issue 07 | 2 – 15 April 2018 [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-07-2-15-april-2018
12,chad,"Chad Mendes has had about two and a half years to think about getting another crack at Frankie Edgar.

Mendes lost to Edgar via first-round knockout at The Ultimate Fighter 22 Finale in December 2015. Six months later, Mendes was suspended by USADA after he says he unknowingly took a psoriasis medication which included a banned substance.

So that’s a lot of time to dwell on his most recent loss. And as it turns out, Mendes’ impending return comes at a time in which it very well might make sense for “Money” to rematch Edgar.

With UFC featherweight champion Max Holloway set to meet Brian Ortega at UFC 226 in July, and Edgar without a dance partner at the moment, Mendes would like a crack at avenging his loss.

“I honestly would like to get that Frankie fight back,” Mendes said on a recent edition of The MMA Hour. “Frankie is obviously a top-level guy and he’s a guy that I know I can beat. That fight would be great. I honestly feel like any of the guys I match up with in the top ten, I match up great.”

Mendes comes off of a USADA suspension on June 10. Booking out his return fight is a little bit tricky. He’s not getting a title shot after two losses and the suspension, Jose Aldo is expected to fight Jeremy Stephens on July 28, and both Josh Emmett and Darren Elkins, who are ranked in the UFC’s official top-10, are Team Alpha Male associates.

TAM has a well-documented history of drama among fighters who compete in the same weight class. That’s why Mendes says that he’s gone out of his way to discuss the situation with his Sacramento teammates, and he believes they’re all on the same page: These guys aren’t going to fight each other unless there’s a title on the line.

“It sucks now that Team Alpha Male is kind of taking over the featherweight division,” Mendes said. “I think we have four or five guys in top 15. We’ve already sat and talked. I told these guys, I love you all and I don’t want to fight you unless it’s for a title, but if it’s for a belt, we’re gonna scrap. I think everyone is on the same page as far as that goes. We’re not going to fight unless it’s for a belt. That’s kind of where we’re at at this point.”",Chad Mendes would like another crack at Frankie Edgar,https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/5/6/17305278/chad-mendes-would-like-another-crack-at-frankie-edgar
13,chad,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

This report was jointly written by researchers from the Feinstein International Center and the Centre for Humanitarian Change in Nairobi.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
14,chad,"NEW YORK — Chad Bettis pitched like an ace, Nolan Arenado’s homer scored a direct hit on the Big Apple and David Dahl produced a crucial pinch-hit RBI.

The result was a 2-0 Rockies victory over the Mets on Saturday night at Citi Field. It was the fourth consecutive victory for Colorado — a season high — and ensured the club of a winning record on this tough, nine-game road trip.

Bettis was brilliant — again. Mixing all of his pitches, including a curve he dropped in on any count, he kept the Mets off-balance. He pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing six hits and walking only one while striking out two. Bettis (4-1) lowered his overall ERA to 2.05, and his road ERA to 1.35.

“Tonight was definitely a much bigger mix of pitches than prior starts,” Bettis said, acknowledging that his didn’t use his go-to changeup quite as much. “I thought (catcher) Chris (Iannetta) and I had a good game plan going in and I thought we executed it very well.”

Right-hander Adam Ottavino, the closest thing the Rockies have to a sure thing, shut down the Mets in the eighth, and closer Wade Davis pitched a perfect ninth, picking up his 13th save in 14 chances.

Over the past 10 games, Colorado starters have pitched like the Braves of Greg Maddux and company, posting a 1.61 ERA with nine quality starts.

So, while the offense has run hot and cold, and the bullpen has had some issues, the rotation has given the Rockies a chance to win each of those 10 games.

Bettis escaped a peculiar jam in the sixth. Asdrubal Cabrera line a one-out single before Jay Bruce scorched a ball right at first baseman Ian Desmond, who couldn’t handle it, but kept it from heading into the corner for extra bases. Bruce was given a hit and the Mets looked like they were in business with runners on first and second. But Todd Frazier lined out to shortstop Trevor Story, who turned a double play by doubling up Cabrera at second.

Dahl allowed the Rockies to breath in the ninth. They jammed the bases when Iannetta was hit by a pitch, Noel Cuevas singled and Carlos Gonzalez was intentionally walked. Up stepped Dahl, who, after whiffing on a 3-0 pitch, laced Robert Gsellman’s 3-1 fastball to left, scoring Iannetta.

“I think that 3-0 swing helped me on that next pitch,” Dahl said. “I just tried to take my same approach on that at-bat. I’ve been working a lot in the cage, trying to minimize some movements. I’m just trying to simplify some things.”

Arenado continued his hitting streak, belting a two-out, solo home run in the first off Mets left-hander Steve Matz. The ball sailed over the 408-foot mark in dead-center field and hit the mechanical Big Apple that rises up with the Mets hit a long ball.

“That was pretty cool,” he said. “I didn’t think I had the power to do that. I hit it as good as I could.”

Arenado extended his season-best hitting streak to six games, during which he’s batted .333 with four home runs.

A mental error by Charlie Blackmon cost the Rockies a possible chance in the sixth. Blackmon led off with an infield single and stole second, putting him in prime position to score. But when Ian Desmond lined out sharply to center fielder Brandon Nimmo, Blackmon tagged up but was thrown out easily on Nimmo’s one-hop throw to third. Arenado struck out to end the inning.

The Rockies failed to get an earlier insurance run. In the eighth, Pat Valaika hit a one-out single and the Mets intentionally walked Blackmon to pitch to Desmond. The strategy paid off. Gsellman struck Desmond out looking at an 88 mph changeup. Desmond didn’t like the call, but the rally died. Desmond, 0-for-4, is now batting .177.

Looking ahead

Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (1-4, 4.24 ERA) at Mets RHP Noah Syndergaard (2-1, 3.10), 11:10 a.m. Sunday; ATTRM, 850 AM

Freeland is coming off a tough loss at Chicago, where he pitched well but didn’t get the victory. The left-hander allowed three runs on six hits, struck out five and walked only one. Overall, Freeland has not pitched well away from Coors Field. He’s 0-3 with a 5.57 ERA in four road starts this season, but he’s starting to find his form and he’s reducing his walks. Freeland pitched three scoreless innings in relief July 15 at Citi Field in Colorado’s 9-3 loss to the Mets. Syndergaard was not very “Thor-like” in his last start, allowing three earned runs on 10 hits over six innings in a loss to the Braves. All three runs, coming on five hits, came in the first inning. Syndergaard is 1-1 with a 3.80 ERA in four starts at Citi Field this season. He took a no-decision in his last start against the Rockies on July 31 at Citi Field, giving up three runs (two earned) on six hits in a 6-4 New York victory.

Armed men on 11 April attacked and seized an aid worker near Kouango town in the southern Ouaka prefecture. The aid worker was released, but his belongings were taken. A week earlier, gunmen abducted a driver with an international aid group also near Kouango. The attacks risk affecting humanitarian access in the area. Efforts are underway to sensitise on the neutrality of humanitarian workers.

FIRST GROUP OF SUDANESE REFUGEES RETURN HOME

The first group of Sudanese refugees willing to return home left on 14 April. Fifty-three people were repatriated under the terms of a May 2017 agreement between Chad, Sudan and UNHCR on voluntary refugee return. More than 329,000 Sudanese have been living in eastern Chad for over a decade.

Many are unwilling to return due to persistent insecurity back home. Meanwhile, around 4,000 Chadians in Darfur have returned home since December 2017.

Since February, intercommunity clashes have forced around 3,000 people – mainly from Koro locality in Mali’s northern Gao region – to flee to Burkina Faso. The clashes between Dogon and Peul communities have also claimed several lives. The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth. Rising intercommunal tension has also been reported around the Mali - Niger border following the 11 April abduction of a German aid worker in Niger.

Governors from the Lake Chad Basin will meet in Maiduguri, North-East Nigeria to discuss regional approach to addressing the Boko Haram Crisis.

Nearly a decade after Boko Haram commenced its insurgency activities in North-East, the crisis has taken a regional dimension leaving millions displaced, billions worth in damages to property across the region.

Reuters reported within the week that insurgents were holding territories while also taking taxes in the Lake Chad region.

This has prompted international calls for addressing the crisis using a regional approach. Following the visit by the UN Security Council in March 2017, Resolution 2349 on Boko Haram and Lake Chad was adopted.

The Resolution called upon Governments in the region to address the root-causes of the crisis.

In order to begin the process of designing a regional framework for addressing the crisis, 11 Governors from the affected States in Cameroun, Chad, Niger and Nigeria will gather in Maiduguri, the epicentre of the crisis, in Borno State, Nigeria from 8-9 May 2018.

According to the United Nations, President Muhammadu Buhari as well as Ibn Chambas, UN Special Representative of the Secretary General for West Africa and the Sahel will be part of the meeting.

Also, François Louncény Fall; UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Central Africa, Ambassador Zaina Nyiramatama; Special Representative of the African Union to the Lake Chad Basin and Edward Kallon; UNDP Resident Representative in Nigeria are expected to grace the meeting.

17,chad,"WASHINGTON, April 30, 2018 –The World Bank approved a $41 million grant to the Government of Chad from the International Development Association (IDA)* to promote the adoption of technological innovations in the agricultural sector, sustainably boost productivity, and enhance climate resilience in targeted areas.

The Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (ProPAD) will benefit some 360,000 people and prioritizes smallholder farmers cultivating 1 to 5 hectares of land annually. In addition to enhancing rural household food security and nutrition, the project aims to boost households’ income and help them market a larger share of their production.

“Although Chad possesses a total agricultural area of over 49 million hectares, only 6% is currently being farmed. Moreover, only 9% of the available water resources are used and less than 1% of agricultural land is irrigated,” said Soukenya Kane, World Bank Country Director for Chad. “While other projects are targeting livestock systems in the Sahelian agroecological zone (AEZ), this project will focus on the Sudanese AEZ, which offers a unique opportunity to diversify agricultural production and to develop dynamic and complementary crop and livestock value chains.”

The ProPAD seeks to improve access to and accelerate the adoption of improved technologies adapted to rural production systems of the Sudanese AEZ, which includes the Salamat, Moyen-Chari, and Mandoul regions. The project also aims to strengthen climate resilience by enabling smallholder farmers to make informed decisions and anticipate climatic events.

The ProPAD also aims to scale up key value chains, such as rainfed cereals (sorghum, millet, corn, rice) and associated crops (peanuts, cowpeas, sesame), in addition to diversifying livestock and dairy production in periurban areas. To accomplish this, the project will strengthen national capacities in agricultural research and development and advisory services.

The project chose the Salamat, Moyen-Chari, and Mandoul regions because they offer high agricultural potential, while displaying very concerning rates of rural poverty and food insecurity.

“The project will be implemented in areas where almost 1.5 million people--that is, more than 11% of the total population--live. The targeted regions are also characterized by high poverty levels: 70.9% in Mandoul, 61.4% in Moyen-Chari, and 48.4% in Salamat. In these communities, the average fertility rate is estimated at approximately 6.5 children per woman,” said Francois Nankobogo, World Bank Country Manager for Chad.

The International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries. Founded in 1960, IDA provides grants and low-interest or interest-free loans for projects and programs aimed at stimulating economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving the lives of the poorest. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 75 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. IDA resources help effect positive change in the lives of the 1.5 billion people living in the countries that are eligible for its assistance. Since its inception, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have increased steadily and averaged about $18 billion over the past three years, with about 54% of commitments going to Africa.

The overnight killings, which cost the life of a civilian along with two customs officials, two forestry agents and the soldier, occurred when ""Boko Haram elements attacked an advanced post of the Chad army"" in Gabalami in the country's far west, the source said.

The attackers were ""repelled"" but managed to escape without suffering losses, the source added.

Boko Haram, a militant movement opposed to Western influence and seeking an Islamic state based on Sharia law, has caused the deaths of at least 20 000 people since it took up arms in 2009 in Nigeria.

Neighbouring Chad has seen a recent increase in attacks by the group.

Last month, Chad's national television reported that three of the country's soldiers had been killed during a clash with the jihadists, without giving the location.

It came as fighting took place between Boko Haram and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) soldiers in Arge in Nigeria's Abadam district, which is on the Chad border.

A Chadian soldier, as well as 20 Boko Haram members, were killed in another clash in late March in the restive Lake Chad region.

Two more soldiers were killed in an ambush in the same area a month earlier, in the first Boko Haram attack on Chadian soil since May 2017, in which nine soldiers died.

Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria have all joined the military effort by Nigeria to crush Boko Haram.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

20,chad,"ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (Reuters) - Almost 50 years after they were hunted to local extinction, black rhinos will again roam the wilds of the Central African nation of Chad, the latest chapter in a movement to bring big mammals back to former ranges on the continent.

On Thursday, six rhinos will be flown to Chad’s Zakouma National Park from the South African city of Port Elizabeth, sedated and confined in specially-crafted crates to ensure they don’t cause a commotion mid-air.

The initiative comes against the backdrop of a poaching crisis that saw more than 1,000 rhinos slain in South Africa last year to meet red-hot demand for their horns in Asia, where they are prized for their alleged medicinal properties.

For graphic on rhino poaching on South Africa click here

With 18,000 white rhinos and 2,000 of the smaller black rhino, South Africa is home to about 80 percent of the global population of the pachyderms, making it the springboard for reintroduction efforts elsewhere.

“By establishing a viable and secure population of rhino in Chad, we are contributing to the expansion of the rhino population in Africa, and the survival of a species that has faced high levels of poaching,” said South African Environment Minister Edna Molewa.

No rhino has been seen in Chad since the early 1970s.

African Parks, a non-government organization which runs Chad’s Zakouma and other reserves, has also reintroduced rhinos and lions from South Africa to Rwanda and is planning to relocate lions to Malawi.

One of the six black rhinos due to be relocated to Chad is seen in an enclosure at Addo Elephant National Park, near Addo, South Africa, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Ed Stoddard

“We have been using the history of conservation success in South Africa to repopulate other areas in Africa,” Andrew Parker, director of conservation at African Parks, told Reuters as a hulking rhino lumbered about its holding pen below him.

The Chad-bound rhinos were in the fortified enclosures or “bomas” for three months in preparation for their long haul.

The animals have been fed lucerne, a kind of super-nutritious hay, the past few weeks. It will be initially provided to them in Chad as they adjust their diet to new trees and shrubs.

Security has been tight: the animals’ location was kept under wraps, they will be given a police escort to the airport, and in Chad they will be dehorned and fitted with transponders.

Jumbo-sized logistics and planning go into such an operation: the animals were tranquilized in Marakele National Park in northern South Africa and then brought to Addo, which has better facilities.

Cranes hoisted the crates containing the rhinos onto flat-bed trucks and they will be monitored carefully by vets on the plane for the 15-hour trip which involves two stops.

21,chad,"Black rhinos have been reintroduced to Chad 50 years after they were wiped out there entirely by poaching.

Six of the horned mammals were transported safely to the central African nation’s Zakouma National Park, having been flown 3,000 miles from South Africa.

The project was the result of an unprecedented collaborative effort by the governments of the two African countries, as well as South African National Parks and the international NGO African Parks.

After two years of intensive preparation for their arrival, the rhinos were introduced to their new home on Friday.

For the time being, they will be kept in specially constructed enclosures for a period of acclimatisation before being released into the park.

“We are resolved to create a secure and prosperous future for wildlife and people, so that generations of Chadians can experience the benefits of healthy and intact natural landscapes,” said Chad’s ambassador to South Africa, Sagour Youssouf Mahamat Itno.

“It is a mark of the strength of our partnership with African Parks and the transformation of Zakouma in to a secure sanctuary that we are now able to bring rhinos back to Chad where they will receive enduring protection.”

“Their reintroduction signifies an important advancement in the restoration of the park, furthering its potential as a conservation area to contribute through tourism to local economies and social development”.

The historical range of the black rhino included most of southern and eastern Africa, but today it is confined exclusively to protected nature reserves.

Successful reintroductions have already taken place in other African nations including Malawi and Botswana, and African Parks previously led a reintroduction of the species in Rwanda. Chad adds another nation to its range, and conservationists hope this will aid their chances for long-term survival.

African Parks took over management of Zakouma National Park in 2010, and the organisation has worked with the national government to turn it into a sanctuary in which the animals will be safe.

This has been achieved through a combination of law enforcement and community action programmes.

“The rhinoceros has survived on this planet for millennia, but with fewer than 25,000 remaining due to the insatiable demand for their horns, they are more affiliated with extinction than survival,” said Peter Fearnhead, CEO of African Parks.

Mr Fearnhead noted that “all too often, headlines on rhinos are about their demise as they teeter on the brink of extinction”.

In March, the world mourned the loss of Sudan – the last surviving northern white rhino – which has likely spelled the end of that particular subspecies.

Only around 5,000 of the remaining rhinos in Africa are black rhinos, and the majority live in South Africa.

Though poaching will still be a threat for Chad’s new rhino population, a dedicated rhino ranger unit should help protect them and enable them to thrive.

“Through our partnership with the government of Chad we have been able to restore security to Zakouma, creating an opportunity to re-establish a Central African population of the species in a secure and functioning park,” said Mr Fearnhead.",Black rhinos return to Chad 50 years after poaching wiped them out,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/black-rhinos-return-chad-poaching-south-africa-african-parks-conservation-extinct-a8338111.html

This Campaign 2018: The Run for the 43rd segment is with Democrat Chad Overton.

He says he knows business. He has run his own for two decades. Now, Overton says he can use that experience as the next 43rd district representative.

Overton says, ""I've always worked, not only for my paycheck, but I've created hundreds of other paychecks so I think the experience in knowing firsthand how to handle economic growth and economic development obviously plays a huge role in this.""

On the topic of school safety, Overton says he wants to immediately increase the amount of money going to schools so they can take steps to increase security.

He adds he is not in favor of arming teachers.

Overton says, ""I'm not really for that. I think teachers go to college to teach and sometimes it seems that we even take that responsibility away from them, making them teach a standardized test which is a whole other issue but to me it makes no sense to arm a teacher. I don't understand that at all. I mean, do the next thing we want them to do is go to the parking lot and do the asphalt during the summer, too?""

On the topic of opioids and the drug epidemic, Overton says he is a foster parent and has witnessed the impact the crisis is having on children. He says work should be done to prevent addiction and he wants to hold manufacturers accountable.
