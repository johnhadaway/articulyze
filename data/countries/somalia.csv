MOGADISHU: The speaker of Somalia's parliament resigned on Monday after a dispute with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed that analysts said was fuelled in part by a crisis in the Gulf spilling into the politics of the volatile Horn of Africa nation.

The resignation of Mohamed Osman Jawari came the day after the seizure of $9.6 million in cash at Mogadishu airport from a plane that had landed from the United Arab Emirates, according to police and government sources.

The Mogadishu government confirmed the seizure but did not say what the money was for.

The mystery cash has fuelled a widespread view among Somalis that the political problems in their country are the work of foreign powers, said Rashid Abdi of the think-tank International Crisis Group.

The speaker's dispute with the president had simmered for weeks and came close to violence. Last week a no-confidence vote against him did not go ahead after he and his opponents arrived at parliament with armed guards.

The president and speaker have long been rivals, analysts said.

The Arab states have strong trading links with and influence in Somalia, which lies across the Gulf of Aden, although this clout is offset by the sway of Turkey, one of Somalia's biggest foreign investors and the owner of an in-country military base.

""Somalia is vulnerable and the Gulf crisis is a catalyst,"" Abdi said. ""The executive was concerned (about) where this speaker was headed.""

It was unclear if Jawari's resignation would ease the recent tension, and there was no immediate comment from the president, whose fragile administration is partly propped up by African Union peacekeepers.

1,somalia,"How Turkey is winning hearts and minds in Somalia

In 2011, Western donors sat back while 250,000 Somalis died of starvation. Then Turkey stepped in. Jamal Osman reports on the rise of aid from the Muslim world.

Abdifatah Mahad stands tall in the middle of his farm on the outskirts of Baidoa, Somalia. He boasts about how well he’s doing and the variety of his produce: maize, beans and vegetables such as peppers and onions.

Farmers here used to stare at the sky and wait for a drop of rain. Now they look under their feet – to where they have dug wells. They are ambitious; the reliable water source means farming is possible all year round and they hope to supply nearby towns. ‘We want to meet the demands of the local people,’ says Abdifatah.

‘They call it humanitarian aid but we call it dead aid; meaning it’s intended to kill’

Six years earlier, this region was the epicentre of a famine that claimed the lives of 250,000 Somalis. Four million people were in danger of starvation, according to the UN. Successive natural disasters, and an apparent lack of compassion from rich nations, have taught Somalis a hard lesson: to strive for self-reliance.

‘They call it humanitarian aid but we call it dead aid; meaning it’s intended to kill,’ says Abdifatah. ‘They brag about helping us and take credit for things that are not even beneficial.’

His claim is not baseless. With regular US drone strikes terrorizing communities in this area, it’s also hard for Somalis to believe the same hand is giving out humanitarian aid.

Western nations make appealing promises but help does not always materialize. The famine of 2011, which I covered for British TV network Channel 4 News, is a prime example.

We had finally arrived in Baidoa, south­western Somalia in August, after more than a week travelling through famine-affected areas controlled by the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabaab.

We headed to the main hospital, which was full of malnourished children. I met three very young patients Khadija, Mohamed and Safiya, who were suffering from acute malnutrition and dehydration. Their bones had decayed; they were too weak to cry. All they had for comfort was the heat of their mothers or siblings who had been left to care for them.

Families had walked miles from villages to get here. Desperate parents were competing for the attention of a goatee-bearded man with a white jacket, Dr Abdalla Bulle, who was struggling to cope with the influx. He told me that many children were dying soon after arrival, with five or six being buried every day.

Seven years later, I spoke again with families who had lost loved ones to the 2011 famine. They still struggle to understand why they were abandoned to their fate. ‘How is it that the world’s richest nations with so much wealth to spare couldn’t save our children?’ one woman asked. ‘What did we do to be disowned by fellow human beings?’ asked another.

Left to die

Why didn’t the pictures of starving Somalis convince politicians in the US and Europe to act? After all, aid workers on the ground had been raising the alarm for more than a year. The answer is that, led by the US, Western nations (with the exception of Nordic countries), stood back, withheld aid and watched Somalis – among them some 125,000 children – die.

Advert

The publicized narrative was that donors feared some of the food aid could fall into the hands of al-Shabaab – a proscribed terrorist group. For NGOs, this meant they were at risk of prosecution under the US Patriot Act.

But some humanitarian workers suspected a different motive. They told me the Western military planned to use starving Somalis as a cheap way to defeat the militants – by eroding their support and, eventually, provoking a local revolt.

While men and women in suits pondered over the outcome of their decision, and al-Shabaab blocked relief, aid workers on the ground were pleading for help. ‘We really need, sometimes, to put politics aside,’ said Hassan Ismael who I met in Baidoa distributing food aid from Islamic Relief, the only UK-registered organization operating in areas controlled by al-Shabaab at that time. ‘This is a humanitarian emergency. We need to save lives.’

His appeal was falling on deaf ears. By the time the declaration of famine spurred the West into action, shaming the US into lifting restrictions, it was too late. Many more people would have perished had it not been for the speedy mobilization of Somalis in the diaspora, and charities from the Muslim world.

Some humanitarian workers suspected a different motive. They told me the Western military planned to use starving Somalis as a cheap way to defeat the militants – by eroding their support and, eventually, provoking a local revolt

It was a lesson and a game changer for the humanitarian industry in Somalia. ‘New’ foreign actors came in – notably Turkey.

At the height of the famine in August 2011, Turkey’s leader Recep Erdoğan and his family arrived at the head of a huge delegation consisting of senior cabinet ministers, business leaders, NGOs, media and celebrities.

Erdoğan brought a sense of brotherhood and hope. Since 2011, Turkey has sent almost $1 billion in aid to Somalia. After the emergency was over, Turkish companies launched into major infrastructure projects, building roads, hospitals and the port. Turkish Airlines is the only international carrier that flies to Mogadishu. Turkey has cemented its place in the hearts of the Somali people, who watch its soap operas and buy its products.

Evidence suggests that Western nations sent more money than Turkey. For instance, the UK alone spent $148 million in Somalia in 2017-18. But while Somali elites may talk about money spent by the West on promoting democracy and security, ordinary Somalis are unlikely to be able to name one thing. Asked about Turkey, they would give a long list. Simply, ordinary citizens feel the Turkish presence in the country is improving their lives.

The US and European nations no longer have a monopoly on the humanitarian industry in Somalia. Arab charities have always been in Somalia doing things quietly, but the renewed, up-scaled commitment from the Muslim world in 2011 did much to break the mould.

The differences between the two are stark, according to Khalif Abdirahman, an independent researcher on humanitarian aid.

Muslim organizations, he says, operate on trust. They are based in-country. They focus on development and switch to emergency when necessary. They buy food-aid locally. They are pragmatic, quick to respond. They deal with people directly. And with much money flowing in direct from the faithful – obligatory charitable giving is one of the five pillars of Islam – they don’t waste time and resources on paperwork.

In contrast, he says, Western NGOs focus on ticking boxes. They operate out of Nairobi. They compete for funding for specific projects, which is not necessarily what people need. They usually import food. They do less on development. They are slow to respond to emergency situations. They concentrate most on proposal writing to capture more market share.

‘Western organizations seem to be emotionally disconnected,’ explains Khalif, ‘Somalis seem to better understand the rationale behind the Muslim organizations’ operations.’

I returned to Baidoa in 2017 to cover another drought. This time the aid community was better prepared – and so were the people themselves. In the past, Somalis would often say to me: ‘We ask donors to help us’. Today, I rarely hear that.

Somalia has a long way to go to feed its citizens. After all, the nation is still embroiled in a 30-year-long war. But attitudes are changing; people like Abdifatah have a stronger determination not to depend on foreign aid and ‘Muslim brothers’ are playing a critical role in improving people’s lives.

According to Mohamed Moalimuu, Secretary General for the Union of Somali Journalists, the plane was from the United Arab Emirates and had been caught at the Mogadishu airport.

On his part, a VOA journalist, Harun Maruf, reported that the plane was believed to be carrying cargo for the UAE mission in the Somali capital. He, however, quotes sources as saying the amount was unknown adding “its final destination not yet clear.”

The UAE has been on a diplomatic collision course with Somalia over the business dealings of a UAE-based company DP World with semi-autonomous Somaliland.

DP World entered Berebra Port deal with Somaliland along with Ethiopia. Somalia reported the incident to the United Nations weeks back. Somaliland government insists its parliament had okayed the deal even though Somalia’s lower house of parliament voted to declare it “null and void.”

Somalia has been riled by a political crisis that involves the lower house of the legislature and the executive. It is said that the Prime Minister is championing a cause to remove speaker Jawari who insists he is not going to resign.

Local journalists are already linking today’s incident to the political crisis. Legislators are said to vote on a no-confidence motion against the speaker on Monday.

In March, Parliament voted unanimously to cancel the deal, in a motion that the speaker, Mohamed Osman Jawari, presided over.

The bill, which included language that forbids any foreign investment contracts without approval by the Parliament, was put forward without input from the president or prime minister. Observers said the vote was a sign of the growing political strength of Mr. Jawari.

Allies of the president and the prime minister put forward a no-confidence motion against Mr. Jawari, which has twice been delayed for security reasons. On Wednesday, Mr. Jawari’s backers accused opponents of having accepted money to vote against the speaker. “Down with bribetakers!” they chanted.

Parliamentary police officers loyal to Mr. Jawari lined up to protect the speaker’s podium.

In response, state security forces loyal to the president deployed outside Parliament, raising fear that tensions between the two men could lead to violence.

Soldiers from Danab, a Somali special forces contingent trained by the United States, were also deployed to secure the Parliament.

The standoff ended after Paul Lokech, who leads a Ugandan contingent of the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia, brokered a deal between Mr. Jawari and Mr. Mohamed to talk through the dispute.

“They need to dialogue and get their problems sorted out,” Mr. Lokech said in a telephone interview. “That’s what we agreed upon.”

The port deal is one illustration of the growing disruption that an international dispute has created in domestic Somali politics.

That rift has pitted Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are major trading partners with Somalia, against Qatar, whose financial support was widely seen as critical factor in Mr. Mohamed’s victory in last year’s presidential election.

The vote against the DP World deal further strained relations between Somalia and the Emirates, which wants to see Mr. Mohamed distance himself from his Qatari patrons and their allies.

“The Emiratis are waging a campaign against Farmajo,” said Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst on Africa and the Middle East at the Heritage Foundation. “Farmajo has refused to join an embargo against Qatar, and that has really angered the Saudis and the Emiratis.

In 2018, 44,790 severely malnourished children, including 2,516 children with medical complications, have been admitted in UNICEF supported treatment programmes. The number of admissions to date exceeds the number of admissions during the same period in 2017 by 33 percent. The increasing trend in admissions highlights a sustained risk to of malnutrition.

UNICEF and partners have launched a national measles vaccination campaign aiming to reach 4.7 million children. The campaign started in Puntland in January, where 933,406 children were reached (93 percent coverage). The campaign is now planned to continue in south and central states, as well as Somaliland where an additional 3.7 million children will be targeted.

In response to continued critical needs for emergency access to safe water, UNICEF and partners supported an additional 40,500 people from 28 displaced person settlements through emergency water trucking and water voucher provision in Nugaal, Bay, and Banadir regions.

UNICEF held inception workshops in Puntland and Somaliland for a new Children on the Move programme aimed at mitigating against the effects of child migration, and provide services for children at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse whilst on the move. The workshops trained ministry and civil society child protection workers on key strategies to identify children at risk and on the development of case management for children who are moving within Somalia and across borders.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical due to ongoing impacts of drought, displacement and conflict. As per the FSNAU-FEWSNET 2017 Post Deyr findings, 5.4 million people are still in need of urgent assistance, including 2.8 million children. An estimated 1.2 million children are or will be acutely malnourished over the next year, including 232,000 children at risk of life-threatening severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Over 4.4 million people need humanitarian WASH services, with 3.5 out of 5 people without adequate water to meet basic needs. More than 5.7 million people require basic health services, including critical needs in maternal and child health, as one in seven Somali children die before the age of five. Disease outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera and measles continue to represent a major threat to children, with over 1,000 cases of AWD/cholera (56 per cent children under 5) and 2,500 cases of measles reported in 2018. Over 3 million children, out of 4.9 million in country, are estimated to be out of school. More than 2.1 million people have been displaced, including over 1 million in the last year alone; and displacement flows continue at critical levels into areas such as Baidoa in Bay Region, which has received between 500 and 2,000 new arrivals per week since mid-January, 2018. 4 Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups continue to exacerbate high levels of acute humanitarian needs. More than 76 percent of recorded gender-based violence (GBV) survivors are reported to be from IDP communities. Grave violations against children continue at worrying rates, with 402 cases, mostly abductions, recruitment and use, and killing/maiming reported in January 2018.",UNICEF Somalia Humanitarian Situation Report #2: 1-28 February 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/unicef-somalia-humanitarian-situation-report-2-1-28-february-2018

This is one of the central pillars of the Fund, which was set up to support the highest-priority needs by the best-placed responders. The SHF thus works hand in hand with its implementing partners, with a view to support and understand their needs and expectations.

Consequently, the primary objective of the 2017 SHF Implementing Partners’ survey was to determine the non-governmental implementing partners’ satisfaction with the services provided by the SHF and factors that cause satisfaction or dissatisfaction, which may lead to changes and adjustments in the management of the Fund, where possible or necessary. In the future, the SHF may solicit similar feedback from other stakeholders.

The survey was carried out from 27th of December 2017 until 31st of January 2018. Of 109 eligible SHF non-governmental partners invited to respond, feedback was received from 82 non-governmental organizations.

Responses received indicate high level of satisfaction. More than 80 per cent of organizations are satisfied with the focus of the Fund’s 2017 allocations and almost 75 per cent participated in the strategic prioritization processes resulting in allocation strategies.

The overwhelming majority of respondents (96 per cent) are satisfied with documents guiding the application process; eight in ten organizations find it good or excellent. The vast majority of respondents – more than 90 per cent – stated that working with the SHF has an impact in the capacity strengthening of the organization.

These results confirm the importance of the SHF in the humanitarian response in Somalia, not only by providing timely and flexibly resources to respond to humanitarian needs, but also contributing to strengthening the capacity of implementing partners and, through this, to the overall effectiveness and accountability of humanitarian response in Somalia.

Some areas of improvement recommended by the respondents, touched on the communication process and the need for trainings on finance management, project submission, among others. Some measures are already being placed and the SHF team will conduct an in-depth/further analysis of the findings to make sure the majority of suggestions can be incorporate in the operation to strengthen the Fund.",Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF): 2017 Implementing Partners’ Survey Final Report,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-shf-2017-implementing-partners-survey-final-report

11,somalia,"Over the last eleven years, the once makeshift military base at the end of the runway at the Mogadishu airport has turned into a bustling mini town. Sandwiched between concrete barriers and a jagged coastline, the base hosts scores of recently returned diplomats, aid workers, and United Nations staff members, along with thousands of African Union peacekeepers. When I visited the compound in 2010, I received a jerry can of water to wash with and a cot. Now, international-security companies run hotels that serve fresh lobster and chilled white wine. Diplomats jog along the beach that lines the camp, but in a sign of lingering safety concerns, they rarely venture into Mogadishu city itself.

In Mogadishu’s markets, parks, and beaches there is a sense of security not known here for decades, and the government of Somalia largely credits the United States and the African Union with providing it. The Trump Administration has increased American military involvement in Somalia to levels not seen since eighteen American soldiers were killed by clan militias in the 1993 clashes depicted in the film “Black Hawk Down.” The number of American troops on the ground doubled last year, to over five hundred, and air strikes increased to thirty-four in 2017, double the number that took place in 2016.

The U.S. military is fighting a shadow war with Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda-aligned Islamist group that still controls large swathes of Somalia. American forces are operating from remote, rural bases and striking deep inside Al Shabaab-controlled territory. Somali officials say that the Special Forces raids and drone strikes targeting the group’s leadership have had significant impact. Al Shabaab fighters are now on the run in many areas and unable to seriously threaten the Somali government’s hold on the capital city of two and a half million people, as well as other large towns. But it is unclear how long that security will last.

After a decade of effort here, the twenty-one thousand African Union ground troops that secure Mogadishu are preparing to leave the country by 2020 and hand over security to an estimated eight to ten thousand poorly equipped Somali soldiers and police. “We can’t stay here forever, and we have not planned to stay here forever,” Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira, the African Union’s Special Representative to Somalia, told me. “And we are not the Somali National Army.”

Madeira said that if a decision is made to keep some African Union forces in Somalia, more funding must be provided by the international community. The European Union, which provides much of the funding for the A.U.’s mission in Somalia, cut its contributions in 2016 by twenty per cent. “This is a very expensive war, you know, counter-insurgency, counterterrorism, is perhaps much more expensive than conventional warfare,” Madeira said.

While Al Shabaab has been degraded by the American military, it can still strike the center of Mogadishu. Suicide-bombing campaigns have gained intensity, and in October of 2017, a massive truck bomb killed more than five hundred people. Yet the city’s beaches are packed most days with residents eating in restaurants or at local stalls that sell snacks. Small boats bearing Somali flags take women out for rides, navigating through the crowd of swimmers. Bullet-riddled shop walls have been repaired and covered with bright, hand-painted images of what’s for sale, everything from bottles of bleach to corn on the cob, printing paper, and chicken drumsticks.

The relative stability of the capital is primarily the result of a grinding, decade-long campaign by African Union soldiers, mostly from Uganda, to gradually retake control of the city. When they arrived in Mogadishu, in 2007, gangs of Al Shabaab fighters controlled of much of the city. A.U. troops established a base in Mogadishu’s southern suburbs and attempted to protect a Western-backed transitional government. In reality, they only controlled a handful of embattled city blocks and a Presidential palace under siege. In 2011, A.U. forces launched an offensive that pushed Al Shabaab fighters out of the city, but fighting continued in pockets, and the Islamists’ presence on the outskirts of the city continued to threaten the capital. In rural areas, between 2014 and 2016, the group overran several African Union military bases. The A.U. has never released casualty figures, but estimates run to several thousand.

Building on the A.U.’s success, the Obama Administration launched a drone-strike campaign in Somalia in 2011. Last summer, the Trump Administration expanded those operations. African Union commanders say that the American drone strikes have restricted the movements of Al Shabaab fighters. A group that once stood and fought them ferociously is more cautious with American drones in the skies. Brigadier Paul Lokech, the commander of all African Union forces in Mogadishu, told me that the presence of American drones in Somalia has made A.U. forces more effective. “If it is there, that means you solve the problem faster,” he said.

Lokech, an officer in the Ugandan Army, commanded African Union troops during the 2011 offensive that pushed Al Shabaab out of the capital, earning him the nickname the Lion of Mogadishu. Six feet six inches tall, he returned to Mogadishu in December to command troops in the capital for a second time. When I asked him about the American military presence, Lokech chose his words carefully. “They are not within the AMISOM chain of command, but we coördinate,” he said, using the acronym for the African Union Mission in Somalia. “They are friendly forces; they are allies. We talk to one another.” (American military officials did not respond to a request for comment regarding U.S. operations in Somalia.)

Somali government officials have hailed American forces and say that they would welcome even greater U.S. military involvement. Abdirahman Omar Osman, the Somali information minister, told me that his government wants more drone strikes. He also said that he expects the U.S. military to help plan, unofficially, an upcoming offensive by African Union and Somali forces against Al Shabaab, and help advancing troops by softening up target areas with drone strikes beforehand.

Training Somalia’s Army to operate on its own has been a struggle. Regional political divisions and rifts between clans have slowed efforts to reach a consensus on how the country’s security institutions should be structured. Corruption is endemic. In December, the U.S. suspended aid to some of Somalia’s security forces because graft was so pervasive. Community leaders told me that they are confused about why the United States is not facilitating peace talks between warring clans, a central cause of the country’s continued instability. They say Al Shabaab exploits this chaos by offering protection to vulnerable, weaker clans.

“Americans control the air. And you don’t have people in the air. The people are on the ground,” Sultan Hajja Abdullah, an elder in the Bimal clan, told me. He said that he wanted the American officials to talk to community leaders like himself. “Yes, we appreciate that the Americans are killing the Al Shabaab leaders, destroying their bases. But what the Americans were supposed to do is to reconcile the clans.”

Across Mogadishu, clan leaders and residents also whisper about growing numbers of civilian casualties in U.S. drone strikes. The exact number of deaths is unknown—Al Shabaab ban smartphones that have cameras in the areas they control—so images of civilian casualties from drone strikes are rare. Last year, the Trump Administration relaxed the rules of engagement for the U.S. military’s Africa Command that the Obama Administration had put in place to minimize civilian casualties.

Given the Trump Administration’s distaste for diplomacy and nation-building, prospects of the U.S. working toward peace negotiations seem far-fetched. In December, Elizabeth Shackelford, a career diplomat, quit her post as a political officer for the U.S. mission to Somalia. Her resignation letter to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, obtained by Foreign Policy, admonished both him and the Trump Administration for abandoning the U.S.’s commitment to democracy and human rights. The U.S. currently has no Ambassador to Somalia.

Diplomats and military officials who have served in Somalia told me that there is a distinction between the military objective of weakening a terrorist group, and helping a country reconcile and build institutions that sustain its peaceful future. Pursuing one without the other, they argue, will never end the conflict.

Somalis, meanwhile, express cautious excitement about having the U.S. military on their government’s side. But they also know that the next two to three years will be pivotal, as African Union peacekeepers withdraw and the American military focusses on killing militants, not mending a failed state. Yet only the most cynical among them, so far, recognize how much the U.S.’s vision for success in Somalia differs from their own. Lokech, the African Union commander, cautioned that that there is no military solution in Somalia. “As the military campaign goes on, other functions should be going on,” Lokech told me. “You need to build a police force.”",Trump’s Military Escalation in Somalia Is Spurring Hope and Fear,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-military-escalation-in-somalia-is-spurring-hope-and-fear

By Nita Bhalla

NAIROBI, April 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rapists in Somaliland face up to 20 years in jail after the break-away conservative Islamic region passed its first law against rape in a drive to combat gender violence, a senior official said on Monday.

The bill, which passed parliament's upper house on Saturday, also criminalises other forms of gender violence such as forced marriage, trafficking for sexual slavery and sexual harassment.

Ayan Mahamoud, Somaliland's representative in Britain, said the draft law had been awaiting parliamentary approval for years - and that President Musa Bihi Abdi's government, which was elected in November, saw curbing sex crimes as a priority.

""This really is a historic law for Somaliland. For the first time potential rapists will be scared that they will be punished and end up in jail for years,"" Mahamoud told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from London.

""It also means that survivors can get at last seek redressal and have access to justice, instead of being forced to marry their rapists to save the so-called family honour.""

The bill was passed by the lower house in January.

Mahamoud said it was expected to be signed into law by Abdi in the coming weeks.

Until now rape was not defined as a crime in Somaliland, a self-declared republic in the Horn of Africa.

That meant perpetrators faced no penalty. Victims' families were instead paid off or the victim was forced to marry her rapist to avoid public shame.

Women's groups said they were encouraged that parliament's more conservative upper house, known as the House of Elders, had approved the bill with 35 out of 50 votes in favour.

""This bill provides both procedural provisions to support managing sexual offences and substantive provisions on the punishments of the offences,"" said a statement from Nagaad, a network of 46 women's organisations in Somaliland.

However they stressed that the government would need to ensure people knew about the law, and that adequate resources be provided to ensure law enforcement agencies and the judiciary implemented and enforced it.

Somaliland, which has a population of about four million, declared independence from Somalia in 1991 following a bloody civil war, but is not internationally recognised as a country.

14,somalia,"Refugee advocates have hit out at reports that South Sudan, Iran and Somalia could be ""excluded"" from one of Australia's refugee programs.

The Guardian reported on Thursday that humanitarian migrants from eight countries will now be prioritised under the Community Support Program (CSP) resettlement scheme, with other nationalities told their applications are ""highly unlikely to be accepted"".

The CSP is only one part of the broader humanitarian intake. It allows individuals, families or community organisations to sponsor and support a refugee to come to Australia.

The priority countries are understood to be the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Bhutan, Syria and Iraq.

Nationals of several other countries that were previously considered for resettlement, such as South Sudan, Somalia and Iran, are now ""excluded and will not be able to access the program"", according to The Guardian.

A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson told SBS News that ""Australia's refugee and humanitarian program is non-discriminatory and has the flexibility to respond to emerging humanitarian situations"".

""No nationality is excluded from consideration, but the Australian Government does establish priorities each program year based on a range of inputs including NGO and community views put forward through the annual program consultations,"" he said.

""The priorities under the CSP align with those for the broader refugee and humanitarian program.""

But refugee advocacy groups have responded to the reports with shock.

Refugee Council of Australia spokesperson Samuel Dariol told SBS News that ""community sponsorship should be non-discriminatory, both in terms of country of origin and not prioritising those with skills or money"".

""The fact that refugees facing significant persecution, such as those from South Sudan, are excluded from the program is very worrying, considering that over 2.5 million people have fled ongoing conflict and violence.

""Australia should be doing more, not less, to address the situation for refugees from South Sudan, Somalia, and other emergencies around the world.""

We have serious concerns about the current Community Support Program #auspol https://t.co/0QgzDynpj2 pic.twitter.com/KNidmG2cJe — Refugee Council (@OzRefugeeCounc) April 5, 2018

Mr Dariol also hit out at the CSP more broadly, saying that it has so far ""failed to adequately provide an opportunity for a truly community-led sponsorship program"".

""The current model is extremely expensive, discriminates against certain groups of refugees, and takes places away from the Australian Government's existing commitment to refugee resettlement.""

He said that Australia should learn from Canada's experience in community sponsorship, which ""works to ensure everyday citizens can join together to support new arrivals"".

Maker Mayek, a South Sudanese-born lawyer that helped kickstart the social media campaign which turned around the 'African Gang' hashtag, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.

""Nearly 2.5 million South Sudanese refugees in the East African region. The country is still at war. South Sudan is excluded from Australia's Community Support Program. Think about Peter Dutton's views about South Sudanese-Australians. Are you still surprised? I'm not,"" he wrote on Thursday.

Migration Council Australia chief executive Carla Wilshire told SBS News it was ""critically important"" for the humanitarian intake to be ""non-discriminatory"".

Ms Wilshire said it was vital these programs respond to ""global needs and vulnerabilities"" and that Australia works closely with UNHCR - the UN Refugee Agency - to ensure this.","Anger as South Sudan, Iran, Somalia 'excluded' from an Australian refugee program",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/anger-as-south-sudan-iran-somalia-excluded-from-an-australian-refugee-program

A crisis in the Gulf has had an unexpected consequence - a rush to build ports all down the Somali coast. But, as Mary Harper writes, some fear it could tear the Horn of Africa apart.

Somaliland's port town of Berbera is sleepy and somewhat scruffy. Paintings of fish, crabs and sailboats adorn the faded buildings. Tangled nets lie in the sandy streets.

It is hard to imagine that this charming seaside town is at the centre of an almighty row between Somalia and this self-declared republic which broke away in 1991 but has not been recognised internationally.

This dispute is part of a far wider problem. A crisis in the Gulf is playing out in dramatic form in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa. Some argue it could tear the whole region apart.

After nearly 30 years of conflict and instability, Somalia is particularly vulnerable.

""Somalia has become a chessboard in the power game between Qatar and Turkey on the one side and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their allies on the other,"" says Rashid Abdi, director of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Group.

""There is no doubt that these rivalries are spilling over into Africa. Somalia is especially vulnerable because of its proximity to the Gulf and its long historical relationship with the region.""

The disagreement between Somalia and Somaliland centres around two deals, both connected with the UAE.

The UAE is building a massive military base in Berbera. It is a highly strategic location. The US and the former Soviet Union built bases there decades ago, plus one of the continent's longest runways, which is more than 4km (2.5 miles) long.

Image copyright Mary Harper Image caption The sleepy town of Berbera has found itself in the middle of an almighty row about who controls the port

For the Emirates, Berbera is conveniently close to Yemen where it is part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The UAE has another military facility up the coast in Eritrea's port town of Assab.

Meanwhile the Dubai-based company DP World is taking over the port, which exports millions of live animals to the Gulf every year. Landlocked Ethiopia is also involved, with a 19% stake, as it sees Berbera as a useful alternative to the congested, expensive port in Djibouti upon which it is totally dependent.

Although Somaliland is not recognised as an independent country, it operates as if it is. It is more stable than the rest of Somalia, has a functioning economy, and its own government, legal system, currency and flag. Power has been transferred peacefully during a series of elections since it declared independence 26 years ago.

But Somalia regards Somaliland as part of its territory. Earlier this month parliament in Somalia voted to nullify the port deal.

""Somaliland and DP World have been very arrogant and disrespectful,"" says Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Isse Awad. ""The company cannot legally sign an agreement without our consent. We will not allow any party to violate our sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

But DP World and Somaliland remain committed to the project. They probably know that, in practice, the authority of the Somali federal government does not extend far beyond the capital Mogadishu.

There has been no strong central authority since the fall of President Siad Barre in 1991. An Islamist insurgency began more than a decade ago, and much of Somalia is controlled by al-Shabab militants and other armed groups.

Somaliland's ambassador to the UAE, Bashe Awil Omar, describes Somalia's hostility to the deal as ""ludicrous"".

""We have been managing our own affairs for nearly 30 years. Somalia has not contributed anything to our territory so why is it interfering now?""

Mr Omar says the military base will be a good thing for Somaliland. ""It will protect our coastline. UAE troops will train our security forces. They will also use the base to launch attacks on Yemen.""

But it is easy to understand why Somalia is concerned. Not only has a breakaway republic signed significant economic and military agreements with a foreign power, but the UAE is also bypassing the federal government by striking deals with Somalia's regional states.

These five states have a fractious relationship with central government and with each other. Some have received military training, equipment and funding from the Emirates. DP World and its subsidiaries are negotiating deals to manage a string of ports in at least three of them.

The situation is different in the capital Mogadishu.

As you fly in low over the turquoise sea to the airport, stretched along the beachfront is a vast Turkish base. It is said to be its largest military training facility outside Turkey. Mogadishu's lucrative port, which used to be fought over by warlords, is now run by a Turkish company, Al Bayrak.

Image copyright Mary Harper Image caption A Turkish company has brought order to Mogadishu's port

The Somali federal government has been put in a difficult position. It owes allegiance to Qatar and Turkey, but its key trading partners, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are on the other side of the Gulf divide.

Saudi Arabia imports 80% of Somalia's livestock, compared with the meagre 3.5% imported by Qatar. In a port in Dubai, fridges, building materials and air conditioners are loaded onto dhows bound for Somalia, manned by Gujarati crews.

Somalia insists it holds a neutral position in the Gulf crisis. But its regional states have played havoc with its diplomacy by declaring allegiance to the Saudis and the UAE.

The Horn of Africa expert Alex de Waal argues that the crisis in the Gulf has an impact way beyond Somalia.

""This has the potential to deepen the fractures across the whole region. The Arab states, including Egypt, are trampling across the painstakingly built norms and institutions for Africa's peacemaking with their cynical, unilateral divide-and-rule realpolitik.""",How the crisis in the Gulf could spread to East Africa,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43585814

By the end of 2017, 5.4 million Somalis were still in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 2.7 million people faced crisis and emergency. The risk of famine persists in 2018 if emergency relief efforts are not sustained.

Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) provided critical support to the most urgent humanitarian needs, prioritizing direct implementation, integrated response and working, when and where possible, with national partners (39 per cent of funds).

The 1st Standard Allocation in ($25.4 million) supported early scale up of famine prevention response and was closely aligned with $33 million in grants from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).

Coordinated allocations prioritized immediate needs in worst-affected areas, with SHF funding used to rapidly boost NGO operations and CERF funds used to cover procurement of life-saving supplies in bulk through UN agencies.

Another $18.6 million was allocated by the SHF to support integrated programming through two integrated response rounds (Bay and Bandir; Lower Shabelle, Galmudug and Togdheer); for enabling programmes and for measles vaccination.

As 2017 was closing, the SHF injected $12 million through the 2nd Standard Allocation for integrated response at priority hotspots (Galgaduud, Banadir, Bay, Lower Shabelle and Mudug); and to address cluster-specific priority needs in select areas, providing critical funding for sustaining response early in 2018.",Somalia Humanitarian Fund: Dashboard 2017 (As of 5 March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-dashboard-2017-5-march-2018

Authorities in Somalia say the bags containing cash were unmarked and unverified by UAE diplomats, thus the investigation as to whether the money was intended to destabilise the country.

The United Arab Emirates deplores this violation of international law and norms, while the UAE has provided all kinds of political, economic, military and humanitarian support in the darkest conditions to establish security and stability in the Somali Federal Republic.

The Saudi owned Al Arabiya news channel reports that the UAE foreign ministry has issued a statement saying the move by the Somali authorities was ‘illegal and contradicted diplomatic norms and traditions’.

“The United Arab Emirates deplores this violation of international law and norms, while the UAE has provided all kinds of political, economic, military and humanitarian support in the darkest conditions to establish security and stability in the Somali Federal Republic.”

In November 2014, Somalia and the UAE signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance military cooperation.

Mohamed was removed from his assignment as the general commanding officer for presidential guard force over allegations that he got involved in Wednesday's standoff at the country's parliament headquarters in Mogadishu.

The commander, according to the sources has allowed a group of presidential guards to escort the embattled lower house speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari and his second deputy Mahad Awad and entering weapons to the parliament illicitly.

Additionally, Mohamed voiced his opposition to the government's move to stripping off Jawari's security detail and the detention of dozen of soldiers who had earlier escorted him to Parliament building for violating security procedures.

A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity has confirmed to GO that Colonel Omar Abdirahman was appointed as interim commander of the presidential guard, replacing the sacked chief who has been in power since 2017.

""The head of Villa Somalia [Presidential Palace] security force has been fired after he disagreed with the decision to remove Speaker Jawari’s security detail,"" he added.

The government has withdrawn Jawari's bodyguards and detained scores of army soldiers for going into the parliament with weapons that prompted da fierce deadlock between the MPs and led to the cancellation of Wednesday's session.

Following the removal of the Somali guards, troops from AMISOM - the African Union Mission in Somalia have now fully taken over the security of the speaker who is at loggerheads with the Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire.

Jawari has been the Speaker of Parliament since August 2012.

Priority areas for humanitarian response

Humanitarian situation deteriorates as drought worsens.

The State-by-state drought analysis released by OCHA in February, shows that drought continued to contribute to the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the first quarter of 2018. Most areas have experienced at least four successive seasons of below normal rainfall, resulting in water shortages, loss of livestock and crop failure, and leading to widespread acute food insecurity. Download the State-by-state analysis here: https://tinyurl.com/ycgkae4b This analysis identifies the priority areas for response and provides an overview of the operational presence of humanitarian partners across the country. It notes that areas such as Awdal, Bari, Sanag, Nugal, Sool and Woqooyi Galbeed have experienced four consecutive seasons of below normal rains.

Consequently, of the one million people in the priority areas, more than half are in Emergency (IPC 4). Urgent nutrition support is required as most of these places have critical levels of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) of 15 per cent or higher. Some areas in Galgaduud and Mudug have seen massive displacement of pastoralists to urban and periurban areas in search of assistance due to the loss of their livestock. Over half of the population of Galmudug is in need of aid. By the end of 2017, the Gaalkacyo IDP population had the highest malnutrition rates in the country of 21.9 per cent.

A high concentration of extremely vulnerable displaced persons has made the Banadir region one of the priority areas for humanitarians. It hosts more than 700,000 IDPs. Nearly 270,000 displaced people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and 4), while most of the IDPs in Mogadishu face critical levels of acute malnutrition (16.1 per cent GAM prevalence).

About 154,000 IDPs were forcefully evicted in Mogadishu in 2017.

Baidoa, in Bay region, continues to be one of the areas requiring urgent and sustained humanitarian response. Displaced people continue to arrive, fleeing drought and armed hostilities. In February alone, 12,600 people arrived in Baidoa and the number is expected to grow, according to the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).

Malnutrition among the IDPs is at critical levels of 15.1 per cent GAM prevalence. Loss of assets and livelihood opportunities have severely exacerbated their vulnerability, and made them largely dependent on aid.

Also on Sunday, three air attacks targeted areas in south and central Somalia under the control of the al-Qaeda linked group.

In El Buur an air attack targeted a vehicle carrying five people including a mother and a child, according to residents. In another attack near the port city of Kismayo a vehicle was targeted leaving at least three people dead, all civilians according to a local member of parliament.

No one has taken responsibility for the air attacks but they come days after the White House granted its military broader authority to carry out attacks in Somalia against al-Shabab fighters.

""The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region,"" Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said in a statement on Friday.

Two US defence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to Reuters news agency, said parts of Somalia had been declared an ""area of active hostilities"" for at least 180 days by the White House on Wednesday. The capital of Mogadishu was not included.

Since President Donald Trump came to office in January 2017, 38 US air attacks have taken place in Somalia killing 13 civilians, according to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ).

In Obama's last year in office, the US carried out 15 air attacks in Somalia killing five civilians, according to TBIJ.",African Union: 30 al-Shabab fighters killed in Somalia attack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/african-union-30-al-shabab-fighters-killed-somalia-attack-180402063208401.html
