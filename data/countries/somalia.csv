Operational Updates

• Although the Deyr rains (October – December 2017) were better than projected and large scale humanitarian assistance managed to avert famine, recovery of livelihood and livestock assets in northern and central Somalia to pre-crisis level will require several consecutive good seasons (Somalia Food Outlook February – September 2018, FEWSNET and FSNAU, March 2018).

• With the Gu 2018 rainy season expected to be average across most parts of the country, populations in Awdal, Sool, Sanaag and Bari in the north, as well as Mudug and Galgaduud in central Somalia are particularly likely to face reduced access to food and income from agricultural labour, crop production and livestock sales. Abnormal livestock deaths have been reported in Awdal leaving poor families with extreme loss of income. The majority of households in this region are expected to be in emergency phase until June 2018.

• In March, prices of imported food commodities (rice, sugar, vegetable oil, wheat flour) remained relatively stable across the country, except in Somaliland where prices of imported staple foods have risen above average due to the devaluation of the Somaliland shilling against the US dollar, impacting the purchasing power of poor households in the region.

• In March, WFP reached 1.13 million people across Somalia with food and nutrition assistance. This includes: 375,000 people who received assistance through cash-based transfers worth US$ 4.2 million, as well as 271,000 mothers and children reached with treatment and preventive nutrition assistance.

• WFP’s Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) transported 3,617 passengers and 23 mt of cargo to 19 locations inside Somalia, serving 106 UN, diplomatic and media agencies as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs).","WFP Somalia Country Brief, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/wfp-somalia-country-brief-march-2018

MOGADISHU, Somalia—A German nurse, Sonja Nientiet, from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Mogadishu was abducted on Wednesday night in what local security officials believe to be an inside job involving at least one of the personnel guarding the ICRC compound.

The Daily Beast has learned that a head security officer for Dhiblawe Security, the local private security company contracted to guard the ICRC compound and the adjacent Shamo Hotel. He is believed by security officials to have orchestrated the kidnapping, which took place at roughly 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday night. He is reported to have stolen three AK-47s and one PK machine gun from the ICRC’s security storeroom just prior to abducting the nurse.

“It is obvious to us that this was a well-planned, well-organized kidnapping,” Adbulaziz Ali Ibrahim, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Security, told The Daily Beast. “I can confirm this was an inside job.”

According to local security officials, the kidnapper used an ICRC vehicle to transport the aid worker and left the compound through its back gate, which is connected to the Shamo Hotel and was unguarded. That vehicle was found in the Hodan district of Mogadishu later that evening, suggesting the kidnapper changed vehicles after leaving the ICRC compound.

International security personnel have reported that one national staff member, a translator, who observed the kidnapping taking place was taken alongside the German nurse and later escaped, although local security officials have not yet confirmed this.

The Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) has arrested nine security personnel guarding the compound and is currently pursuing three additional security personnel who were in the compound and fled after the abduction. NISA guards have taken over security in the compound for the time being. “The security personnel who were inside the compound are currently in detention and being questioned,” Ibrahim said.

NISA investigators believe that a dispute between the security personnel at Dhiblawe and the company's owner played a role in the kidnapping, and Nientiet is being used as leverage in this disagreement.

“We are in touch with his family and those close with him to try to convince him to safely return the German woman,” Ibrahim said. “We are doing everything we can to ensure her safe return.”

But even if a personal dispute sparked Nientiet's kidnapping, security officials are concerned that her kidnappers may have already linked up with al Shabaab. According to local security officials, NISA initially thought the kidnappers took Nientiet to the small town of Elasha Biyaha roughly 15 kilometers from the capital the night the kidnapping took place. They now believe Nientiet has been taken to Adale, a coastal town in the Middle Shabelle region north of Mogadishu, which in recent months has become a stronghold for the al-Qaeda-linked-terrorist group.

The ICRC compound in Mogadishu is located in the K5 district near the intersection where a bombing on Oct. 14 killed over 500 people. It is roughly a five-minute drive to the city’s “green zone” at the Mogadishu International Airport.

According to the ICRC, its 10 remaining non-Somali staff have been evacuated to Nairobi until further notice and movement inside the capital has been suspended.

“We are in touch with authorities, local leaders, and others in the area to gather as much information as we can and do our very best to ensure a quick and safe release for her,” ICRC spokeswoman Crystal Wells told The Daily Beast. “We just want her unconditional and immediate release.”

Nientiet joined ICRC in 2014 and worked with the organization in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In January she moved to Somalia, where she worked as a health delegate providing care directly in Mogadishu’s hospitals, primary care centers, and detention centers as well as training Somali first responders.

“She is someone who is spending every day taking care of some of Somalia’s more vulnerable people,” Wells said.

Though this is the first kidnapping of a foreign aid worker in Somalia in nearly 10 years, the country remains particularly dangerous for humanitarian personnel. According to the United Nations, at least 30 humanitarian workers were killed in 2016 and 2017 in Somalia. In March, a local Red Cross worker died from his injuries after a bomb attached to his vehicle detonated, and on Tuesday, a Somali aid worker with the World Health Organization was shot by gunmen in Mogadishu. She was inside Mogadishu’s Bakara Market, known as Al Shabaab’s last remaining territory in the city, and was buying items for a wedding she was planning to attend the following week when she was killed.

According to Ibrahim, local security forces do not have any evidence tying the security officer suspected of orchestrating the kidnapping with al Shabaab, but they continue gathering information on what may have motivated the kidnappers and whether they are in contact with the terror group.","A German Nurse with ICRC Kidnapped in Somalia, Security Officials Call It an Inside Job",https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-german-nurse-with-icrc-kidnapped-in-somalia-security-officials-call-it-an-inside-job
2,somalia,"Situation overview

Heavy rains continued in the Juba and Shabelle basins over the last week with the flood situation, worsening, especially in Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle State. Flash and river flooding have continued over the past week affecting and displacing thousands of people. The current water levels exceed a 50-year return period in most locations, according to Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). The Juba and Shabelle rivers have reached bank-full levels in several locations, causing flooding much earlier in the season than ever before.

According to SWALIM projections, the heavy rains in the two basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands will continue next week. River levels inside Somalia are expected to continue rising in the coming days with more cases of flooding along the Juba and Shabelle rivers.

Humanitarian impact and needs

Flash and river flooding has so far affected an estimated 630,000 people. More than 214,800 of these have been displaced from their homes following the heavy rains received across the country in April, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN). Assessments continue to determine the impact of flooding in the affected areas. PRMN reports that some IDPs are moving out of settlements to take advantage of the rains back home.

In Hirshabelle State, Belet Weyne town and the surrounding riverine villages are the worst hit areas with an estimate 180,000 people displaced from their homes. As of 2 May 2018, the river water level began to recede slightly in Belet Weyne and reports from the upper stream villages indicate similar marginal recession in water levels. However, road movement remains limited, thus hindering access to some of the affected areas, including the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian supplies. Another 56,000 people have been affected in Middle Shabelle region in Hirshabelle State, including 7,000 people displaced. The flooding has isolated or displaced residents in 18 riverine villages along the river. Road access, grain stores and farms have also been affected. Waterlogging and lack of access to hygiene facilities and uncollected garbage are heightening the risk of communicable diseases, mainly in IDP settlements. Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad are among the worst affected areas.

In South West State, the torrential rains have resulted in localized flash floods in many towns. Some 174,000 people have been affected and 6,100 displaced. More than 200 latrines have either been damaged or totally destroyed in 26 IDP sites across the state and partners are concerned about the outbreak of diseases. More than 5,000 IDPs have been displaced in Baidoa, most of them moving to nearby IDP settlements on higher ground. Most of the emergency shelter materials provided to IDPs since January 2017 cannot withstand the heavy rains. Baidoa town hosts 246,000 IDPs. Some 295 IDPs exited settlements to return to their farms in the last week. This is the highest number of returnees recorded in a week since August 2017. Meanwhile, according to the Food Security cluster, the Gu rains are likely to have a positive impact on food security in many parts of Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle.

In Jubaland State, some 206,000 people have been affected, with 94,620 having been displaced. The weak points along the Juba river banks are likely to worsen the risk of river flooding. In Kismayo, heavy rains have led to the destruction of roads and latrines. An unknown number of latrines have been filled up with flood water and some shelters belonging to IDPs destroyed. In Middle Juba region of Jubaland State where river flooding was also reported. Some 66,000 people have been affected and 17,200 have been displaced, mainly in in Bu'aale, Jilib and Saakow. Some 98 per cent of the families living on both sides of the river have been forced to flee. Two children, a girl and boy, died in Bu'ale due to flooding. Livestock deaths have been reported. Most areas in Middle Juba are under the control of nonstate armed actors limiting access.

In Galmudug State, medium and moderate rains were received in most parts of the Galgaduud and Mudug regions. Some 9,300 IDPs have been affected in IDP settlements in low-lying areas of Cabudwaaq town. Flooding also damaged 75 IDP improvised shelters and latrines. WASH-related concerns have been reported among IDPs in Caabud Waaq IDP settlements with fears of disease outbreaks due to limited access to latrines and stagnant waters.

In Somaliland, heavy rains were received in Hargeisa town on 30 April. The floods swept away a mother and her two children. The woman survived, but the two children died. However, on the whole the rains are having a positive effect in Somaliland. Sool region and the surrounding areas also recorded heavy rains.

In Banadir region, flash flooding affected nearly 54,000 people mainly in IDP settlements in K12, towards the Afgooye corridor. Banadir hosts approximately 497,000 IDPs. Most of the improvised shelters and latrines have been destroyed. There is a heightened risk of communicable diseases with 690 cases of AWD/cholera recorded since January.

Abstract: For the past year and a half, al-Shabaab has continued to take advantage of the ongoing political and security turmoil between Somalia’s federal government, regional state administrations, and other powerful social groups, including the country’s clans and sub-clans and minority groups. Militarily, the jihadi-insurgent group retains significant capabilities to launch a range of attacks targeting both military and “soft” targets, including major suicide-vehicle bombings inside the most secure areas of the country such as central Mogadishu. In 2017, the group also overran a number of African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali government military bases and forcefully reasserted itself in the northern Puntland region. Meanwhile, the Islamic State in Somalia, al-Shabaab’s main jihadi competitor, continues to lag behind it in terms of numbers, military capabilities, and media reach, though there are recent signs that the Islamic State-Somalia has been able to penetrate more deeply into the Afgooye area to the west of the capital and outside of its Puntland base.",Black Banners in Somalia: The State of al-Shabaab’s Territorial Insurgency and the Specter of the Islamic State,http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/black-banners-somalia-state-al-shabaabs-territorial-insurgency-and-specter-islamic-state
4,somalia,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A battle for access to seaports is underway in one of the world’s unlikeliest places: Somalia, now caught up in a regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side, with Qatar backed by Turkey on the other.

At stake: not just the busy waters off the Somali coast but the future stability of the country itself.

Somalia has been at war for decades and until the last few years it has struggled to attract foreign investment. But rivalries in the nearby Arabian peninsula are resulting in serious inflows into Somalia.

A year ago, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates government signed a $336 million contract to expand the port of Bosaso, north of Mogadishu in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland.

Less than a year before that, another UAE-owned firm took control of the Berbera port in the breakaway northern region of Somaliland and pledged up to $440 million to develop it. In March, Ethiopia took a stake in the port for an undisclosed sum.

At the same time, Turkey, an ally of UAE rival Qatar, is ramping up a multi-billion dollar investment push in Somalia. A Turkish company has run the Mogadishu port since 2014, while other Turkish firms have built roads, schools, and hospitals.

The rivalries have intensified since June, when the most powerful Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Iran and Islamist militants.

That Middle Eastern feud is driving the desire to control the Horn of Africa and its waters, according to diplomats, businessmen, scholars and Somali officials.

Somalia is close to vital oil routes and its ports could also serve landlocked Ethiopia, which has a population of 100 million.

Gulf nations have had trade and religious ties with Somalia for centuries, but those relationships are now up in the air as new rivalries emerge.

“Somalia has been caught in the middle of this effort to try to expand influence, commercial and military, along the coast,” said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE increasingly view the Somali coastline - and Djibouti and Eritrea to the north - as their “western security flank”, according to a senior western diplomat in the Horn of Africa region.

Qatar and Turkey, whose investments are almost all in Mogadishu, are focused on supporting President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He and his chief of staff are widely viewed in Somalia and by western diplomats as loyal to Doha after receiving funds for their 2017 election campaign.

A Qatari official told Reuters Doha had provided $385 million in infrastructure, education and humanitarian assistance to the central Somali government.

The official said making deals directly with regional governments in Somalia, as the UAE has done, undermined the central government.

Somali finance minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh agreed.

“The Gulf region has a lot of money and if they want to invest in Somalia we welcome them with open arms,” he told Reuters. “But it’s a question of going through the right doors.”

The federal government in Mogadishu has long been at odds with the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. The latter operates virtually as an independent state and has for years sought to secede from Somalia, but has not won international recognition.

DETRIMENTAL EFFECT

Less than a decade ago there was virtually no commercial interest in Somalia.

That began to change in 2011 when al Qaeda-backed al Shabaab militants retreated from Mogadishu. Months later, Turkey launched famine relief operations, opening the door for projects that now make it Somalia’s biggest foreign investor.

The government hopes new investment, especially in infrastructure, can help the country rebuild.

Better tax collection is boosting government revenues, but this only covers public sector salaries. Huge amounts of capital are needed for roads, schools and other basics. Middle Eastern companies and charities could provide some of it.

However, the money could also destabilize the country further by deepening tensions between the central government, aligned with Turkey and Qatar, and Puntland and Somaliland, which both receive money from the UAE.

“These investments are having a detrimental effect on our political stability and worsening the relationship between our federal government and the regions,” said former national security adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali.

“This could cause a constitutional crisis that only al Shabaab will benefit from.”

The Gulf crisis has already deepened rifts in Somalia. The central government has stayed neutral, to the annoyance of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which Puntland and Somaliland have backed against Qatar.

“Getting out of this mess is very difficult,” Sheikh-Ali said. “Without unity we cannot.”

The Somali presidency and the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Western nations fear the Gulf rivalries playing out in Somalia could sideline their multi-billion dollar, U.N.-led efforts to build a functional Somali army to fight Shabaab before the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers in 2020.

Political crises between Mogadishu and the regional authorities are undermining government efforts to strengthen financial systems and embark on other core tasks of a state, diplomats say.

TROUBLE

The Gulf rivalry is also being felt on the ground in Somalia.

In mid-April, Somalia and the UAE ended military cooperation. Since 2014, the UAE had trained and paid the salaries of Somali troops in Mogadishu and built an anti-piracy force in Puntland. Hundreds of weapons were looted from the training center in Mogadishu as it shut down.

This came after Somali security forces seized nearly $10 million flown in from the UAE to pay soldiers and temporarily held the plane which brought the cash. The UAE also closed a hospital that offered free care.

Last week Puntland officials traveled to Dubai to meet UAE counterparts and P&O, the state firm developing its port.

“Investing millions of dollars in Somalia at this critical juncture in history is very important for us,” Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said.

Similarly, Somaliland officials hosted UAE diplomats last week to discuss “enhancing bilateral ties”.

“For Somalis themselves, this kind of geopolitical game of chess, where Somalia is solely a proxy conflict to the trouble in the Gulf, this is obviously bad news,” said Harry Verhoeven, professor at Georgetown University in Qatar.

7,somalia,"Tensions between Somalia and the United Arab Emirates ratcheted up this week as Mogadishu ditched a military deal with its ally and seized millions of dollars in cash from an Emirati plane.

The escalation came after months of building friction in Somalia as the Gulf crisis pitting Arab powers against each other spills over into the fragile state, whose position of neutrality has not gone down well at home or with its allies.

Rashid Abdi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told AFP that while the UAE and Somalia have traditionally been close, and Mogadishu has vowed to remain neutral over the Gulf divisions, the central government is nevertheless ""perceived to be very much pro-Qatar"".

Some of Somalia's federal states were unhappy with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed's neutral stance, and have broken with the official position to side with the UAE.

Diplomatic tensions first spilled into the open in March after the Dubai-based DP World gave Ethiopia a 19% stake in the Berbera port in breakaway Somaliland - whose independence is not recognised by Mogadishu.

Lawmakers in Somalia, which also has a history of animosity with Ethiopia, adopted a resolution accusing the company of having ""intentionally violated the sovereignty of Somalia"".

Tempers have also flared over a military base being built by the UAE in Somaliland.

'Unnecessary tensions'

On Sunday, Somali security forces stormed onto a UAE civilian aircraft at the international airport, and seized $9.6m in cash held in three unmarked bags.



""The security forces noticed the suspicious bags and handed them over to the concerned departments,"" Somalia's security ministry said in a statement.

However the UAE in a statement accused security forces of holding those on the plane ""at gunpoint"", and said the cash had been allocated to support the Somali army and trainees.

""The current Somali government ... is creating unnecessary tensions with a friend and an ally who supported the stability and security of Somalia during its hardest phases,"" tweeted UAE state minister for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash.

""We call for wisdom and reason"".

Just days later, on Wednesday, Somalia's defence ministry announced it was taking over the management of hundreds of Somali troops who had been trained by the UAE.

The UAE has been running a military camp in Mogadishu where it trains Somali soldiers, who are also paid by Emirati officials.

""As a government, our responsibility is to take care of our armed forces and pay their wages and not to delegate that responsibility to others. We thank the UAE for the training and relentless support it provided,"" Defence Minister Mohamed Mursal told a local news agency.

Experts describe the bloated and largely ineffective Somali army as more a collection of clan militias, with various international militaries providing poorly-coordinated training to different units.

The security of the country, battling the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab extremists, has largely been propped up by AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping force, which is due to withdraw by 2020.

'Vulnerable and weak'

The 10-month Gulf crisis pits Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain against Qatar - which has been accused by its rivals of fostering close links with Tehran and supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar denies the charges.

With close geographic, political, economic and cultural ties with the Gulf, observers warn the Horn of Africa is facing heightened instability as countries come under pressure to pick sides while Arab powers jockey for political influence.

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the 1991 overthrow of president Siad Barre's military regime which ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict.

Abdi warned the Gulf crisis could have a ""serious destabilising impact on Somalia.""

""There's no doubt that the Gulf crisis has spilled over into the Horn. Now countries which are strong can manage this war, but Somalia is very vulnerable and very weak,"" he said.

The Water Price Monitoring assessment aims to establish a data collection, monitoring and reporting system on water market prices in order to allow humanitarian and development actors to better analyse humanitarian needs in areas particularly affected by drought.

March data collection in Lower Shabelle was conducted through a quantitative survey between 30 - 31 March, focusing only on those water points in the region that are charging for water. The assessment has followed the official district boundaries of the region.

All prices are shown in US Cents for 90L of water. This is the daily amount used by a household of six members, consuming the minimum Sphere standard of 15L water per person per day. Price changes are subject to exchange rate.

Key Findings

• This factsheet presents information collected from 36 water points in Afgooye District, Lower Shabelle Region.

• Prices of water in Lower Shabelle reportedly increased by an average of 9% from February to March.

• The majority (58%) of assessed water points showed no change in price from February to March. Thirty-one percent (31%) showed an increase in price mainly due to more households accessing these water points, while 11% showed a decrease in price mainly due to an increase in water supply following ongoing rains.

• The majority (69%) of assessed water points in Lower Shabelle reportedly have their water treated at the distribution point. The majority of these (84%) have it treated though chlorination, while 16% have it treated through aquatabs.","Somalia Drought Crisis - Water Price Monitoring: Lower Shabelle Region, Somalia, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-drought-crisis-water-price-monitoring-lower-shabelle-region-somalia-march
9,somalia,"According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the current floods are some of the worst the region has ever seen, and the current water level exceeds a 50-year return period in most locations.

“Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,” Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General said, briefing reporters in New York on Monday.

“Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, [health,] shelter and food response in their interventions,” he added.

The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over six million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.

Floods worse than anticipated

The magnitude of rainfall has been much worse than anticipated, said Yngvil Foss, the deputy head at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Somalia.

Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available

– Yngvil Foss, UN aid official

“Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available,” she said, noting that UN relief agencies have been able to raise funding over the past week to scale up critical interventions.

The UN World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, delivered 4.5 million metric tons of medicines and other medical supplies to Belet Weyne, the capital of the hard hit HirShabelle province, on 29 April.

Peacekeeping troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) also evacuated more than 10,000 residents of Belet Weyne from inundated parts of the city as well as providing tarpaulins and water to those affected.

More funding urgently needed

However, more funds are urgently needed to help the increasing numbers of internally-displaced.

Yesterday, Somalia's President, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed “Farmajo” visited flood affected areas and appealed to the international community for urgent humanitarian assistance.

Somalia’s Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, totalling $1.5 billion (before the floods), is only 19 per cent funded. Launched by UN agencies and humanitarian partners, it aims to reach some 5.4 million people with assistance.","Almost 500,000 affected as devastating floods inundate central Somalia – UN mission",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008612
10,somalia,"It was 1991 when Somali President Siad Barre was ousted, catapulting the country into disarray and prompting emboldened warlords to cleave the country apart.

Although an internationally-backed government was established in 2012 following interventions by Ethiopia and the African Union, the country remains fractured – bedevilled by humanitarian crises and a protracted struggle against Al Shabab militants.

In practice, the authority of the central government does not extend far beyond the capital, Mogadishu. It is within this context that Somalia’s recent row with the UAE should be dissected.

Ten months have passed since the Arab quartet of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar. Hugely reliant on foreign investment and aid, Somalia has imported the crisis.

On April 8, amid rising tension, Somali security forces stormed a UAE jet at Mogadishu airport, seizing $9.6 million (Dh35.3 million) in cash destined for the Puntland Maritime Police Force, an anti-piracy unit of the Somali army backed since 2014 by the Emirates.

In response to the breach of diplomatic protocol, the UAE abruptly ended its military training programme in Somalia. Sheikh Zayed hospital in Mogadishu suspended operations.

Immediately thereafter, Qatar donated 30 buses and two cranes to Mogadishu regional officials. “That is not coincidental,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project director at the International Crisis Group (ICG).

The gesture is emblematic of international pressures weighing on Somalia, thanks to pre-existing relationships and its proximity to the Gulf.

Turkey operates a military base of epic proportions in Mogadishu, whose lucrative port is run by Al Bayrak, a Turkish corporation. Ankara was an early investor in Somalia, though analysts say popular support for Turkey’s presence is dwindling.

Turkey's ally, Qatar, whose airline immediately used Somali airspace when the boycott began last year, has sought to involve itself in Somali politics, according to Faisal Roble, a leading Somalia expert.

Saudi Arabia, which imports 80 per cent of Somalia’s livestock, donated $50m in 2016 after Mogadishu severed ties with Iran. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed visited Riyadh less than a fortnight after his inauguration last year for his first official trip.

Meanwhile, the UAE, which has been training and paying the salaries of 2,407 Somali troops, is most active in the autonomous region of Puntland, whose government yesterday appealed to the Emirates to remain engaged.

“There is a common understanding that Puntland doesn’t get the support it requires from the government,” said Mr Abdi. But the involvement of international players “has driven a wedge between Mogadishu and the different regional states,” he added.

As Somalia’s fortunes have faltered in recent years, economic imperatives have compelled its regions to accept aid and investment from different players. After the Gulf dispute, such investment brought into question the central government’s promise to remain neutral in the Gulf dispute.

The stunning plane seizure follows months of deteriorating ties between Abu Dhabi and Mogadishu.

Somali politicians reacted with fury to the tripartite deal between Dubai’s DP World, the government of breakaway Somaliland and landlocked Ethiopia over control of a strategic port at Berbera. The UAE is also constructing a military base in Somaliland, just 260 km from war-torn Yemen, which contains Africa’s longest runway.

Somali politicians, powerless to dictate Somaliland affairs, claimed the deal was a violation of its sovereignty.

On the other side, Mogadishu’s failure to disavow Qatar may have caused irritation in the UAE. “There are many people here in the UAE who feel deeply invested in Somalia’s future and stability and are saddened by developments,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior Arabian Peninsula analyst at ICG.

12,somalia,"The Gulf impasse caused political turmoil in the African country, with its central government aligning with Qatar and the federal states drifting towards the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The crisis has begun to challenge the country's territorial integrity.

On the evening of May 23, 2017, a quotation appeared on the bottom of Qatar’s official news channel, attributed to the Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani. “Iran,” it said, “is an Islamic power in the region that cannot be ignored.”

In spite of Thani’s insistence that the quotations were fakes, they were the pretext for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to drive a wedge through the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and several other Arab countries blockaded Qatar, sent Qatari nationals home, and broke off diplomatic relations. Leaders from around the world scrambled to mend the rift, foreseeing the likelihood that it might have a negative impact if it spilt over into other countries.

According to Omar Mahmoud, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, Somalia is one those countries – “as Somalia has imported the Gulf crisis,” he says.

The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), has taken a similar stand to many other countries, supporting the Kuwaiti initiative to broker dialogue between the quarrelling GCC states. But Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken an uncompromising stand, lobbying other countries to follow them in a wider attempt to politically isolate Qatar.

The FGS’s awkward neutrality, however, has been interpreted as a “vote for Qatar,” according to Mahmoud, pitting the central government against its member states.

The state leaders have voiced concerns about their ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, aligning themselves more closely with this grouping.

The issue came to the fore when Dubai-based shipping company DP World reached an agreement with the self-declared Republic of Somaliland.

The two parties signed a 25-year lease on the northern port of Berbera, sidestepping Mogadishu to secure the deal. The federal government views the deal as a violation of Somalia’s territorial integrity and constitution.

The UAE, which initiated and brokered the deal, kept 51 percent stake in the Berbera port project; Somaliland kept 30 percent and Ethiopia, having expressed its desire to take part in the project, secured 19 percent.

Somalia's federal government responded by declaring the agreement null and void and took the issue before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Abubakr Osman, Somalia’s Permanent Representative to the UN said the UAE’s plan was a “clear violation of international law.”

“Every company which wants to invest in Somalia must follow the due process as laid down by the law,” President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo” Mohamed told the Somali Parliament.

The deal for Berbera port, the government maintains, is illegal, as foreign affairs are primarily the domain of the central government in Mogadishu, according to the Somali constitution.

But following two decades of weak central governance, Mogadishu has little direct say in the affairs of regional state administrations, including Somaliland, which has declared total independence and doesn’t recognise the sovereignty of Mogadishu over its territories.

The UAE, Mahmoud says, “at times bypassed Mogadishu, and reached out to member states.” Mahmoud adds that this is the case not just in Somaliland, but “also Bosaso, Puntland,” where another Dubai-based company manages the main commercial port.

“So, the question becomes to what extent is the UAE working with Mogadishu on these agreements,” he tells TRT World.

Well, to what extent does the UAE need to?

“We need development, and no sane individual or leader will object to that,” Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, president of Puntland, said following a visit to Dubai. “That is why the support of the UAE is so important,” he continued.

At both the federal and, especially, at the regional level, Somalia’s ties to the Gulf run deep.

Somalia is composed of federal member states which operate with varying degrees of autonomy. Somaliland in the northwest considers itself independent from Somalia. ( TRTWorld )

Between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, diasporic Somalis sent roughly $35 million in remittances back to Somalia in 2017. Two-thirds of livestock exports, which constitute roughly 40 percent of Somalia’s GDP, have their biggest market in Saudi Arabia. The UAE also finances infrastructure projects, trains and equips troops in the regional administrations as well as donating significant amounts of aid.

When the federal government in Mogadishu refused to be strong-armed into breaking with Qatar, the federal member states – whose multifaceted relationships with the Gulf are vital – broke with the federal government, expressing their solidarity with the Emirati position.

Somaliland, Puntland, South West, Hirshabelle and Galmudug showed their support for the Emirati- Saudi-led blockade by following their lead.

“The federal member states are arguing that a relationship with the UAE and Saudi Arabia would be much more beneficial than losing that and maintaining a relationship with Qatar,” says Mahmoud. “And that’s argued on a number of fronts. Economically, in terms of remittances, in terms of livestock, infrastructure development; so economically there is a big incentive there.”

The DP World agreement in Berbera, for example, operated with a view to expanding the capacity for livestock to be exported from that port. The UAE has also been paying the salaries of the Puntland Maritime Police Force since 2011. When Galmudug broke with Somalia's central government, it cited its “commercial relationship”, “sustainable development” and the “security” support provided by the UAE when explaining its decision.

The combination of a lack of strong central control, and the economic considerations of regional administrations appears to have been enough incentive for them to diverge from the central government on this matter.

As Gulf states jockey for influence, Somalia is increasingly caught in the crosshairs. But tensions between the UAE and Somalia reached a new high when Somali security authorities seized $9.6 million, which arrived in Somalia from Abu Dhabi Airport.

Though Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi, UAE ambassador to Somalia maintained that the money was intended for the Somali Ministry of Defense to contribute to the salaries of Somali troops, a Somali official insisted it was almost 10 times the expected amount, raising suspicions about what the cash was intended for.

The seizure resulted in a standoff that lasted for several hours between airport officials and Emirati officers. ( Feisal Omar/ Reuters )

An investigation followed to determine if the money was intended to “destabilise” the country.

Abdiwahab Sheikh Abdisamad, a Nairobi-based senior consultant at Southlink Consultancy, tells TRT World that because the “central government cannot control the entire region, the UAE has taken advantage of that vulnerability.”

“Somalia has become a theatre in this conflict,” he continued. He believes avoiding the central government to work directly with the regional administrations will undermine progress made to stabilise Somalia and create “further divisions.”

The UAE has responded by closing Sheikh Zayed Hospital, which used to provide free treatment for the residents of Mogadishu and soon after ended its military training mission in Somalia.

“They [the UAE] don’t have consideration for the constitution of Somalia, they don’t consider the rules and regulations of Somalia, nor do they consider the situation on the ground,” Abdisamad said, which is why he believes that the attempt by President Mohamed to distance Somalia from the UAE is an encouraging attempt to show the sovereignty of the centre.

His stance inspired young Somalis globally, who initiated the #UAEhandsoffSomalia and #Somalia_speaks hashtags.

Don't come in through the window, come in through the door. #UAEhandsOffSomalia — Abdi Addow 🕊 (@AbdiAddow1) April 9, 2017

The last time the Gulf states requested Somalia cut ties with another country was 2012, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud cut ties with Iran. President Mohamud’s government received $50 million from Saudi Arabia that day in aid – spoils earned for his eager cooperation.

In this case, the stakes are higher, as Qatar is a valued partner of the FGS, alongside Qatar’s ally Turkey, which has provided an unparalleled level of support to the FGS.

Both relations with the Saudi-UAE-led coalition and Qatar and Turkey are important for Somalia, “but when Somalia recognised that the money coming from the UAE was meant for other purposes than supporting the Somali military, Somalia acted accordingly,” Abdisamad said.

Somalia as a whole and the FGS, in particular, have made great progress in recreating a degree of normalcy in the country. At this very delicate stage, the Somali government, according to Abdisamad, has judged it needs more friends than enemies.

But as the Somali government becomes increasingly bold at determining its foreign policy, the country is also finding its bearings in determining which countries it prefers warm relations with.

“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia,"" he said, ""are much more important today than the financial assistance being provided by the UAE.”

UPDF EVACUATION

The Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) are opposed to the on-going process of down-sizing the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces in the war-torn Eastern African country, warning that it could have consequential negative impact on efforts to stabilise Somalia.



The United Nations directed AMISOM to start on a gradual reduction of its forces and already 1,000 personnel sent back home.



Plans were underway to cut the same number in October this year, from the current 21,000 peace-keeping fighters in the area.



The UN wants AMISOM to eventually handover to the Somali National Army (SNA) by 2021.



However, the commander of Uganda contingent AMISOM Sector 1, Brigadier Gen Paul Lokech, said they still need more time to prepare to handover saying the move, if not reverted and handled carefully; it could draw the country back turmoil.



“From a military perspective, I would say it is not yet time for us to draw down. We need time to prepare the local forces for a transition,” he stressed.



Lokech was recently interacting with a team of Ugandan journalists who were in Somalia for a four-day visit.



The team, led by Major Ceaser Olweny, deputy spokesperson of AMISOM, visited several areas including Ceeljaale, the headquarters of Battle Group 22, about 120km South of Mogadishu.



They reached other areas such as Shalambood, the First Battalion headquarters, 8kms from Ceeljaale, Buufo, the Nineteenth Battalion headquarters, 81kms south west of Mogadishu.



During the press briefing at his base in Mogadishu, Lokech explained that they had trained a number of personnel of the SNA as they prepare them to takeover but that it take time.



Lokech said AMISOM had made several achievements, including enabling peace to return to Mogadishu, which he said had enabled the new constructions going on in the city.



“A lot of buildings are coming up and the city is generally busy, and outside there is no single town under our Sector where al-Shabab is based, they come from outside and from other sectors to attack our positions,” he said.",Somalia not ready for AMISOM handover - UPDF,https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1477077/somalia-ready-amisom-handover-updf

Flash and river flooding has affected more than 582,000 people and of these over 200,000 have been displaced from their homes following heavy rains received across the country in April, according to UNHCR-led Protection and Return and Monitoring Network (PRMN).

The Gu rainy season (April – June) started early March with consistent, heavy rains in flood-prone areas of southern and central regions. The Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands continued to receive moderate to heavy rains, according to FAOmanaged Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM).

Other central and northern parts of the country are expected to receive moderate to high rains in the first week of May with regions of Puntland being the exception. Overall, rainfall has been above average over broad areas of Somalia and the result has been a rapid increase in river levels causing flash and riverine flooding in many locations.

SWALIM has reported that the probability of floods of this current magnitude is once every fifty years. The Juba and Shabelle rivers have reached bank full levels in several locations causing flooding much earlier in the season than historically observed.

16,somalia,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 600 weapons were stolen in the past week from a former United Arab Emirates-run training center in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu and are for sale in the city, weapons dealers said on Wednesday.

Weapons looted from a former United Arab Emirates (UAE) military training camp are displayed during a Reuters interview in Mogadishu, Somalia April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Feisal Omar

The weapons, including new Kalashnikov assault rifles and Chinese versions of them, were stolen by Somali National Army soldiers who had been trained by the UAE at its facility, three Somali men who purchased weapons from the soldiers told Reuters.

The Gulf nation has trained hundreds of Somali troops since 2014 as part of an effort boosted by an African Union military mission to defeat an Islamist insurgency and secure the country for the Somali government, which is backed by Western nations, Turkey and the United Nations.

The UAE ended the program on April 15, shortly after security forces at Mogadishu’s airport seized millions of dollars and temporarily held a UAE plane.

The escalating diplomatic dispute is one aspect of the fallout in volatile Somalia from a crisis in the Gulf region that has spilled into the Horn of Africa.

Somalia’s relations with the UAE are strained by a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia because Mogadishu has refused to take sides. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have strong trading links with and influence in Somalia, offset by the sway of Qatar and its ally Turkey, one of Somalia’s biggest foreign investors.

Neither Somalia nor the UAE is showing urgent interest in resolving their dispute, said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Somali officials wanted to be seen “standing up” to the UAE, “and the Emirati officials’ position is, ‘If Somalia doesn’t want our money, fine, we’ll take it elsewhere,’” Malley told Reuters in Nairobi after returning from a trip to Mogadishu.

The UAE-trained troops began stealing weapons from the facility shortly after the program was disbanded, the dealers said. The soldiers sold guns directly to the dealers and indirectly via their brokers.

The looting appears to have occurred while the UAE was in the process of emptying its training center.

On Sunday night a ship docked at Mogadishu’s port was loaded with equipment from the UAE’s training center, including several dozen shipping containers of weapons, dozens of armored vehicles fixed with anti-aircraft guns and hundreds of cars, a port staff member told Reuters.

On Monday, gunfire broke out at the former training center where some of the troops were still camped out, and UAE-trained troops who were still there fled with as many weapons as they could, before a rival group took over the facility.

Residents in the area told Reuters they saw UAE-trained forces discarding their military uniforms and fleeing the facility in three-wheeled rickshaws with guns in their laps. [L8N1S0508]

After 90 minutes of sporadic gunfire, the facility was secured by presidential palace guards, a Reuters journalist at the scene said.

UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Officials from Somalia’s defense ministry did not immediately answer phone calls requesting comment on the weapons theft. Defense Minister Mohamed Mursal resigned this week to contest for the vacant position of parliament speaker.

Army commander General Abdiweli Jama Gorod said on Monday that some soldiers who were behind the attempted theft of equipment from the facility had been arrested.

“The Somali national forces now have in hand the few soldiers and officers who were behind today’s incident and we assure we shall bring them before justice,” he said in comments reported by the state-run Somalia News Agency.

Gorod did not answer phone calls on Wednesday afternoon seeking comment.

Due to the diplomatic dispute, the UAE-trained troops are being called “rebels” by some elements of the army, a security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

The dealers showed Reuters five weapons they said they bought from the soldiers. They all bore the marking “SO XDS”, indicating that they belonged to the Somali army.

An arms expert said this was consistent with the previous arrangement between the two countries.

“The weapons belonged to the SNA, which distributed them to the UAE training center. So they are marked SO XDS,” he said.

“About 600 to 700 AK-47 and (other) guns were looted from the former UAE training camps,” weapons dealer Jama Ali told Reuters, speaking from a home in Mogadishu where he and two other men presented the weapons.

Ali said they purchased the weapons for $700, a significant discount on the current price of $1,350 in Mogadishu for a new Kalashnikov. The dealers then began last night reselling the weapons at $1,000 each, he said.

“The best day for business is when there is government infighting,” said Hassan Abuja, another dealer. “Prices of weapons and ammunition go up.”","Exclusive: Weapons stolen from UAE training facility in Somalia, sold on open market",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-arms/exclusive-weapons-stolen-from-uae-training-facility-in-somalia-sold-on-open-market-idUSKBN1HW26I

A battle for access to seaports is underway in one of the world's unlikeliest places: Somalia, now caught up in a regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side, with Qatar backed by Turkey on the other.

At stake: not just the busy waters off the Somali coast but the future stability of the country itself.

Somalia has been at war for decades and until the last few years it has struggled to attract foreign investment. But rivalries in the nearby Arabian peninsula are resulting in serious inflows into Somalia.

A year ago, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates government signed a $336 million contract to expand the port of Bosaso, north of Mogadishu in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland.

Less than a year before that, another UAE-owned firm took control of the Berbera port in the breakaway northern region of Somaliland and pledged up to $440 million to develop it. In March, Ethiopia took a stake in the port for an undisclosed sum.

At the same time, Turkey, an ally of UAE rival Qatar, is ramping up a multi-billion dollar investment push in Somalia. A Turkish company has run the Mogadishu port since 2014, while other Turkish firms have built roads, schools, and hospitals.

The rivalries have intensified since June, when the most powerful Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Iran and Islamist militants.

That Middle Eastern feud is driving the desire to control the Horn of Africa and its waters, according to diplomats, businessmen, scholars and Somali officials.

Somalia is close to vital oil routes and its ports could also serve landlocked Ethiopia, which has a population of 100 million.

Gulf nations have had trade and religious ties with Somalia for centuries, but those relationships are now up in the air as new rivalries emerge.

""Somalia has been caught in the middle of this effort to try to expand influence, commercial and military, along the coast,"" said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE increasingly view the Somali coastline - and Djibouti and Eritrea to the north - as their ""western security flank"", according to a senior western diplomat in the Horn of Africa region.

Qatar and Turkey, whose investments are almost all in Mogadishu, are focussed on supporting President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He and his chief of staff are widely viewed in Somalia and by western diplomats as loyal to Doha after receiving funds for their 2017 election campaign.

A Qatari official told Reuters Doha had provided $385 million in infrastructure, education and humanitarian assistance to the central Somali government.

The official said making deals directly with regional governments in Somalia, as the UAE has done, undermined the central government.

Somali finance minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh agreed.

""The Gulf region has a lot of money and if they want to invest in Somalia we welcome them with open arms,"" he told Reuters. ""But it's a question of going through the right doors.""

The federal government in Mogadishu has long been at odds with the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. The latter operates virtually as an independent state and has for years sought to secede from Somalia, but has not won international recognition.

Detrimental effect

Less than a decade ago there was virtually no commercial interest in Somalia.

That began to change in 2011 when al Qaeda-backed al Shabaab militants retreated from Mogadishu. Months later, Turkey launched famine relief operations, opening the door for projects that now make it Somalia's biggest foreign investor.

The government hopes new investment, especially in infrastructure, can help the country rebuild.

Better tax collection is boosting government revenues, but this only covers public sector salaries. Huge amounts of capital are needed for roads, schools and other basics. Middle Eastern companies and charities could provide some of it.

However, the money could also destabilise the country further by deepening tensions between the central government, aligned with Turkey and Qatar, and Puntland and Somaliland, which both receive money from the UAE.

""These investments are having a detrimental effect on our political stability and worsening the relationship between our federal government and the regions,"" said former national security adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali.

""This could cause a constitutional crisis that only al Shabaab will benefit from.""

The Gulf crisis has already deepened rifts in Somalia. The central government has stayed neutral, to the annoyance of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which Puntland and Somaliland have backed against Qatar.

""Getting out of this mess is very difficult,"" Sheikh-Ali said. ""Without unity we cannot.""

The Somali presidency and the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Western nations fear the Gulf rivalries playing out in Somalia could sideline their multi-billion dollar, U.N.-led efforts to build a functional Somali army to fight Shabaab before the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers in 2020.

Political crises between Mogadishu and the regional authorities are undermining government efforts to strengthen financial systems and embark on other core tasks of a state, diplomats say.

Trouble

The Gulf rivalry is also being felt on the ground in Somalia.

In mid-April, Somalia and the UAE ended military cooperation. Since 2014, the UAE had trained and paid the salaries of Somali troops in Mogadishu and built an anti-piracy force in Puntland. Hundreds of weapons were looted from the training centre in Mogadishu as it shut down.

This came after Somali security forces seized nearly $10 million flown in from the UAE to pay soldiers and temporarily held the plane which brought the cash. The UAE also closed a hospital that offered free care.

Last week Puntland officials travelled to Dubai to meet UAE counterparts and P&O, the state firm developing its port.

""Investing millions of dollars in Somalia at this critical juncture in history is very important for us,"" Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said.

Similarly, Somaliland officials hosted UAE diplomats last week to discuss ""enhancing bilateral ties"".

""For Somalis themselves, this kind of geopolitical game of chess, where Somalia is solely a proxy conflict to the trouble in the Gulf, this is obviously bad news,"" said Harry Verhoeven, professor at Georgetown University in Qatar.","Why Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey Are Battling Over Somalia",https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/why-saudi-arabia-qatar-and-turkey-are-battling-over-somalia-1.6051936

In Kenya, floods have displaced over 260,000 people and killed 100 others in at least 15 of the country’s 47 counties, according to the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The floods, which have also affected refugees in northeastern Kenya’s Dadaab camp, have damaged businesses, swept away homes and food supplies, closed more than 200 schools, destroyed community water points, and increased chances of disease outbreaks including cholera and malaria.

The flooding comes as many countries are just recovering from the devastating drought and famine that swept the Horn and East Africa region in the last two years. The drought, exacerbated by El Nino, curtailed crop production in Kenya, drove food prices higher, increased inflation, and put a strain on economic growth. It also forced over 1.3 million Somalis to leave their homes last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The current torrents show the poor planning and the lack of disaster preparedness among governments in the region. As such, countries experience a vicious cycle that alternates between droughts and floods, reacting to events instead of being proactive about attaining solutions.

In the aftermath of rains, for instance, roads are deemed impassable, drainage systems clog, transport networks break down, and rivers burst their banks blocking any humanitarian efforts. Both climatic conditions also exacerbate hunger and poverty, especially among pastoralists, who lose their herds for lack of water during dry periods and are swept away when it pours.

Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change compared to other continents. Even while emitting a small number of greenhouse gases, the continent is experiencing droughts, heatwaves, floods, and rising sea levels more frequently. To manage this challenge would require countries to invest in strategic approaches that would understand shortcomings, collaborate with research institutions to better understand climate phenomena, and create models that that would help prepare for and reduce the effects of disasters.

These are efforts and plans better started now—since the rains, at least this time, are not abating anytime soon.

On April 6, the Africa Security Initiative in the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a discussion with experts on the challenges Somalia faces now and potential paths forward.

Brookings Senior Fellow Michael O’Hanlon remarked that Somalia “has essentially been in one degree or another of chaos and civil war” ever since former President Siad Barre was deposed in 1991. Amidst ongoing conflict, he pointed to areas of hope today: There is stability in Puntland and Somaliland; the federal government in Mogadishu was formed peacefully and through at least quasi-democratic means; and there has been progress in security and socio-economic matters since the height of al-Shabab’s rule almost a decade ago.

Stephen Schwartz—appointed in 2016 as the first U.S. ambassador to Somalia since 1991—described the challenges he saw when he arrived in mid-2016: rampant corruption, a lack of social trust, persistent insecurity, inadequate government revenue and capacity, and limited government presence in much of the country. And he pointed to progress, including presidential elections and the peaceful transition of power from former president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to the current president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. While the vote “was not comprehensive and universal,” Ambassador Schwartz explained, “people from every part of the country were able to vote for parliament in some numbers.” The new parliamentarians organized a free and fair vote for president and conducted it well and transparently, according to Schwartz, ultimately choosing a very strong candidate. The new government enjoyed a high level of legitimacy and inspired hope. “The Somalia of today is vastly better and more hopeful than the one of 10 years ago or 20 years ago,” Schwartz concluded.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, spoke of her December 2017 fieldwork in Somalia in preparation for a United Nations University report on amnesty, leniency, and defectors’ program in Somalia (forthcoming in May). She explained: “Al-Shabab is only one of at least 60 warring actors in Somalia, and so Somalia will not achieve peace unless it starts doing a much deeper reckoning with the multiplicity of armed actors there.” Related Content Seeking solutions for Somalia 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM EDT Washington, DC Past Event Sub-Saharan Africa What’s next for Somalia Africa in focus Figures of the week: Piracy and illegal fishing in Somalia

Although al-Shabab is estimated to number only between 2,000 and 3,000 active fighters, it controls vast segments of Somalia and is present throughout, including in Mogadishu where it regularly conducts attacks as well as collects taxes. While clan rivalries have divided other groups, al-Shabab manages to raise above clan politics. Al-Shabab also frequently outperforms the federal government, states, and powerbrokers in delivering better security, such as long roads, and reliable and not corrupt—if sometimes brutal—justice, particularly in resolving property disputes.

Although the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) formally has about 22,000 forces in Somalia, Felbab-Brown explained that it’s not clear how troops are actually deployed. She also pointed to AMISOM’s inability to hold territories nominally cleared of al-Shabab and its minimal interaction with local populations. Similarly, the Somali National Army (SNA) remains critically weak, Felbab-Brown explained, even though the international community funds it with some $240 million per year. Among 29,000 SNA troops, she added, “maybe there are some 12,000 SNA soldiers that have a weapon, that have some ammunition, and that have some level of capacity to perform on the battlefield.” But even that force remains debilitated by corruption and clan-based rifts, with physical infighting among the clan and commander factions within the SNA not unusual.

Landry Signé is a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Global Economy and Development Program and Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings. Agreeing that there are signs of hope in Somalia, he also presented a number of troubling indicators: Freedom House gives Somalia the worst possible score on civil and political rights, for instance. In this area, “we are still very far from a strong improvement, and the score has not changed since 1999,” said Signé. On other measures, like state fragility, Somalia ranks among the worst as well.

Prof. Signé emphasized that Somalia’s challenges are often intertwined. Much comes down to “the limited ability of the state to provide basic public services, and goods to the citizens, including security, health, education, and even territorial integrity,” he concluded. As such, solutions “can only be at the nexus between security, state capacity, domestic resource mobilization, and accountability.”

Signé further elaborated on five critical solutions for Somalia:

Security reforms: Somalia ranks seventh in the world in terms of highest impact of terrorism, so security reforms are vital for protecting citizens and ensuring territorial integrity. State capacity and effectiveness: Building an effective and non-corrupt state, with strong rule of law and an effective public administration that successfully delivers basic public goods and services is critical for nation-building. Domestic resource mobilization: Mobilizing domestic revenues—and thus reducing reliance on foreign aid—is critical to accomplishing the above goals. In addition, when citizens pay taxes, they demand more accountability. Economic reforms: Young people represent more than 70 percent of Somalia’s population, and the unemployment rate is as high as 67 percent. So economic reforms, especially those aimed at creating jobs for young people, are key to avoid vulnerability to violent extremism, especially where over 50 percent of the population lives below poverty line. More economic freedom, increased agricultural productivity, diversification, industrialization, and better deterrents to and management of shocks (which create food insecurity and poverty) are key. Accountability: Since Somalia is heterogeneous and fractured along ethnic, clan, and cultural lines, an inclusive and accountable government is vital for peace. Accountability has five dimensions: personal accountability by leaders; peer accountability; vertical accountability embodied in free and fair elections; horizontal accountability through strong and independent institutions providing checks and balances; and diagonal accountability through a vibrant civil society.

In closing, Ambassador Schwartz proposed several low-cost ways for Washington to aid stability in Somalia, including—crucially—providing budget support to the financially struggling Somali federal government. An investment of about $100 million annually for up to five years would immediately kick start the federal government’s ability to operate and pay salaries, begin revenue-sharing with federal member states, and build institutions to provide security and services to the population. The financial assistance would accompany a robust public financial management program, with appropriate accountability controls, and would foster national unity by building an important linkage between the federal government and the member state governments.","Somalia, facing severe challenges, also shows signs of hope",https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/03/somalia-facing-severe-challenges-also-shows-signs-of-hope/
20,somalia,"A thousand little lines etched onto her face quietly tell a story of struggle and resilience, of dreams fulfilled and not — of a life not to be forgotten.

In the eyes of a woman he met halfway around the world in Somalia, Canadian artist Yasin Osman saw his own grandmother.

Only it wasn't. Osman's own ayeeyo (grandmother) had just passed, her words echoing in his mind, inspiring him to use his photography to show a part of Somalia most of the world had never seen or bothered to see.

""Remember me,"" the woman told him as they parted.

A chance to shine a light

Just months earlier, Osman was sitting with his grandmother in the United Kingdom where she lived during their first visit together in nearly a decade. They spoke of the future, Osman weighing leaving his job as an early childhood educator to pursue photography full time.

His grandmother motioned to the television screen, where a Somali journalist was telling a positive story about her home country.

""I will pray for you,"" Osman's grandmother told him, on one condition. She would support his career choice if he promised to use his gift of photography to do good for Somalia.

This photo of a woman who Osman met in Somalia and says looked just like his grandmother is the headline on his new exhibit. (CBC) It was to be one of their final conversations.

Traveling to Somalia wasn't in Osman's immediate plans. But when he returned to Toronto following his grandmother's death, he quit his job and set about looking for ways to fulfil his promise.

It wasn't long before he came across the an online famine relief campaign a called Love Army for Somalia and started messaging back and forth with Jerome Jarre, one of the social media celebrities involved, sending samples of his work. Jarre, remembers Osman, was immediately drawn to his work, and invited him to come to Somalia to help document the effects of the drought.

It was a chance to shine a light on stories of Somalis that rarely made headlines.

Shoot For Peace

An only child raised by a single mother in Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood, Osman knew all too well the dark shadow cast by negative stereotypes, teasing about Somalis being pirates, the assumptions that his was a community infiltrated by gangs.

""When I grew up, there was a lot of gun violence in Regent Park and so how I wanted to tackle that issue was by using my gift — I believe every single person in this world has a gift — and I wanted to share my gift by teaching young kids about photography.""

Creating this exhibit and making this a tribute to her... this was kind of like a love-letter to her, to say, 'I did what you told me. And I hope you're proud of me.' - Yasin Osman, on his exhibit Dear Ayeeyo

That desire is what sparked Shoot For Peace, a weekly program for children in Osman's childhood neighbourhood to learn to express themselves through the art of photography. Every Sunday beginning in the fall of 2015, Osman would get together with a group of kids, letting them take snaps of things and people that mattered to them.

""It didn't cost us money to just walk around the neighbourhood with a camera... And it was amazing because the kids were slowly opening up.""

But it was when one of the young boys came up to Osman and said he didn't realize he could do anything besides what he'd learned in school, that he might want to become a photographer, that Osman realized how powerful the program could really be.

""Just for him to have that choice, that option of doing something other than what he knew about... It made me really feel like I did the right thing.""

'We are all your brothers'

Fast forward to 2017, Osman found himself on a flight to Mogadishu for his very first visit to Somalia to in his own way to put a human face to a country so much of the world associated with crisis.

""I remember being on the plane and it was a really emotional flight for me because I remember thinking how happy my grandmother would have been if she knew that I fulfilled my promise of going back,"" he said.

An only child raised by a single mother in Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood, Osman knew all too well the dark shadow cast by negative stereotypes on his community. His photo exhibit tries to change that. (CBC) The Somalia he saw was nothing like the stereotypes he'd heard growing up — there were engineers, doctors, teachers, mothers, elders, children, ordinary people that looked like Osman and were working to support their communities.

""When I first got out of the plane and I went into one of the vehicles, the man asked me, 'How many siblings do you have back in Toronto?'""

""I don't have any siblings,"" Osman remembers replying. ""Then he grabbed my hand and he said, 'Stop, don't say that, I am your brother and we are all your brothers.' That really touched me.""

""That's what I wanted to show... I wanted to show the beautiful and amazing and resilient people that we are because a lot of times that's not what's translated into the media.""

Then there was Amir, about six or seven years old. Osman had brought along some treats for the kids and Amir was handing them out to his friends, so Osman said to him, ""Why don't you take some to keep for yourself?""

""And he said to me, 'Why would I keep them for myself when we don't know if tomorrow's coming?'""

And of course there was the ayeeyo who looked so much like his own — a reminder of who and what all this was for.

""So creating this exhibit and making this a tribute to her... this was kind of like a love-letter to her, to say, 'I did what you told me. And I hope you're proud of me.'""",This Canadian artist is shining a light on Somalia with a photo tribute to his grandmother,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/this-canadian-artist-is-shining-a-light-on-somalia-with-a-photo-tribute-to-his-grandmother-1.4650180

UNICEF and partners have treated 54,071 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 2018. This is 19 per cent higher than the same time last year, at the peak of the pre-famine response - highlighting the continuing trend of critical levels of acute malnutrition in country.

UNICEF continues to deliver large-scale integrated basic nutrition services package (BNSP) throughout the country, providing curative and preventive care.

As part of the ongoing national measles vaccination campaign, after successful completion of the campaign in Puntland in January, UNICEF and partners conducted measles campaigns in March in central and southern regions of Somalia, and Somaliland. 2,734,941 children between six months and 10 years were vaccinated (102 per cent of the targeted 2,693,928). Since the start of the year, 4,067 suspected measles cases were reported – 72 percent being children under-five.

During the month of March, the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism verified 317 cases of grave violations affecting 302 children (69 girls) mostly through abduction (158), killing/maiming (89) and child recruitment and use by armed forces and groups (70).

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical due to ongoing impacts of drought, displacement and conflict. As per the FSNAU-FEWSNET 2017 Post Deyr findings, 5.4 million people are still in need of urgent assistance, including 2.8 million children. Malnutrition rates across Somalia are among the worst in the world. Currently, nearly 301,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, including 48,000 who are severely malnourished and face death if urgent treatment is not provided; in total about 1.2 million children under five are projected to be malnourished in 2018 and of them, 232,000 expected to be suffering from life threatening malnutrition. Over 4.4 million people need humanitarian WASH services, with 3.5 out of 5 people without adequate water to meet basic needs. More than 5.7 million people require basic health services, including critical needs in maternal and child health, as one in seven Somali children die before the age of five. Disease outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera and measles continue to represent a major threat to children, with over 1,764 cases of AWD/cholera (56 per cent children under 5) and 4,313 cases of suspected measles reported in 2018. Over 3 million children, out of 4.9 million in country, are estimated to be out of school. More than 2.1 million people have been displaced, including over 1 million in the last year alone; and displacement flows continue at critical levels into areas such as Baidoa in Bay Region, which has received an average of 700 new arrivals per week since mid-January, 2018. Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups continue to exacerbate high levels of acute humanitarian needs. More than 76 percent of recorded gender-based violence (GBV) survivors are reported to be from IDP communities. Grave violations against children continue at worrying rates, with abductions, recruitment and use, and killing/maiming reported as the primary concerns.",UNICEF Somalia Humanitarian Situation Report #3: 1-31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/unicef-somalia-humanitarian-situation-report-3-1-31-march-2018
22,somalia,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Somalia drastically deteriorated in the first half of 2017, leading to a robust scale up of relief operations across the country with the single joint objective – to avert famine. Prolonged drought conditions in a fragile environment led to spikes in food insecurity, surging disease outbreaks and massive internal displacement throughout the year. Underlying vulnerability due to protracted crisis, limited access to basic services and conflict remained the key drivers of humanitarian needs.

Drought conditions, food security and malnutrition

The consecutive failure or below average performance of 2016 and 2017 rains led to the spike in the number of people in need to 6.7 million by mid-2017. This number has since declined to 5.4 million, also due to the collective response of national and international actors that was scaled up and sustained in 2017, with up to 3.2. million reached with assistance on a monthly basis.

The humanitarian situation, however, remained critical at the end of 2017, with some 2.7 million people projected to be in Crisis or Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4) between January and June 2018. The number of children under the age of five who were acutely malnourished was estimated at 301,000, including 48,000 who were severely malnourished and faced an increased risk of disease and death.

Internal displacement remained major protection concern

Internal displacements increased, nearly doubling the pre-crisis displacement figures. More than one million people were displaced by drought and conflict in 2017, bringing the total number of displaced to over 2.1 million. Displaced communities are often living in overcrowded settlements and are disproportionately exposed to protection risks, such as discrimination, child rights violations and gender-based violence (GBV).

Prevalence of disease outbreaks

Disease outbreaks remain prevalent due to limited access to basic services such as health care and sanitation. Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera was reported in 52 districts in 16 regions out of the 18 regions in Somalia. A cumulative total of 78,784 cases with over 1,159 related deaths reported between January and December 2017. By the end of the year, the number of active cases had, however, gone down, thanks to concerted efforts from humanitarian partners. Some 23,002 suspected measles cases were reported, which is alarmingly high compared to previous years. Among these cases, 83 per cent were children under 10 years of age.

Security and access constrains

The operating environment in Somalia remained complex and dangerous. A combination of access-related constraints continued to impede the ability of humanitarian organisations to reach people in need in a timely manner and close to the places of their origin or residence, often tilting response to locations of converged displacement.

The year witnessed rising violence against humanitarians, particularly those with operations in southern and central Somalia. Over 170 violent incidents impacted humanitarian organisations and led to the death of 16 humanitarian workers, injury of 33, physical assault of three, arrests and temporary detention of 22, abduction of 31 and attempted abduction of nine. Nine humanitarian workers, including three international and six national staff, were expelled by the authorities.

Frontline responders continued to be most affected, with hostilities, including improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in the populated areas, impacting humanitarian operations primarily in southern and central regions. Indiscriminate attacks in populated places, causing deaths and injuries, accounted for majority of the humanitarian casualties recorded in 2017 and resulted in destruction of humanitarian facilities and assets.

Nearly 100 incidents related to administrative and bureaucratic impediments were reported. As in previous years, there were demands for multiple registrations, arbitrary taxation, interference in procurement, staff recruitment and contract awards, deduction of project funds for monitoring and evaluation, the ban of movement along certain access roads, and clearance of humanitarian supplies at state boundaries and border points, including ports.

Prospects for recovery

Amidst the crisis, Somalia continued to make progress with the establishment of permanent political institutions, paving the way towards a future with greater peace. However, this is yet to translate into an improvement for the majority of Somalis in terms of food security and nutrition, access to safe water, sanitation, health care, protection and other basic services. Another notable progress is the launch of the Drought Impact Needs Assessment at the end of 2017, paving the way towards the long-term recovery, which will require a collective engagement of humanitarian and development actors through 2018 and beyond.",Somalia Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

The Kenyan government has warned that the activities of foreign powers seeking to undermine the government in Mogadishu are a threat to regional security.

In what appears to be renewed efforts to support the administration of President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo”, Kenya last week took an indirect jab at countries engaged in military or trade deals with Somaliland and Puntland, arguing such agreements could weaken the government in Somalia.

It was Kenya’s first direct comment on a raging battle between Gulf powers, led by the United Arab Emirates, which have engaged in a series of manoeuvres aimed at weakening the Farmajo administration.

PEACE

Officials who spoke to the Sunday Nation say Kenya wants international partners to focus on direct engagement with Mogadishu and support the role of the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) in its efforts to train Somalia’s security forces.

The first hint of the message was delivered last week when President Uhuru Kenyatta suggested some foreign entities were damaging the foundation Amisom had laid in Somalia.

“The region is not at peace. Somalia remains troubled, largely by foreign agents who weaken its government, who divide its people, and who threaten to reverse the gains we have so painfully won under Amisom,” he said in his State of the Nation address on Wednesday.

“Through it all, we remember that if our brothers and sisters in Somalia prosper, we prosper; if they are safe, so are we.

""It has been our policy, then, to help them regain the peace and prosperity they once knew.”

POWER STRUGGLE

The clash between Gulf powers in Somalia is an extension of a battle pitting Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain on the one hand and Qatar and Turkey on the other.

The Saudi bloc imposed a blockade on Qatar last year and embarked on a lobbying campaign to force countries to align with its decision.

Somalia was one of the targets of this effort but the Farmajo government decided to remain neutral. This triggered a series of clashes with the UAE in particular.

The Emiratis have sought to cultivate direct ties with Somaliland and Puntland and reach deals with them for management of ports and security training initiatives, which are seen as undermining the government in Mogadishu.

AL-SHABAAB

Kenya views itself as having a direct stake in Somalia because instability there spells trouble in Kenya, including by putting the vital tourism industry at risk.

“A stable Somalia will allow our tourism to grow. Remember we went there after Al-Shabaab targeted our tourism installations,” Prof Maurice Amutabi, a historian and Vice Chancellor of Lukenya University, said.

“If they have their own security monitoring the guys from their side, it can prevent them from regrouping,” he said, referring to the reasons Kenya Defence Forces joined Amisom.

The President did not give names in his address but his diplomats have told the Sunday Nation that the jab was directed at the Gulf countries that have taken their disputes to the Horn of Africa.

In late April, Kenyan security officials stopped a political meeting by UAE-allied Somali politicians in Eastleigh, Nairobi.

Sources said the meeting at Sir Ali Muslim grounds was cancelled because it was seen as part of an effort by entities targeting the Somali government.

MILITARY TRAINING

However, the lead organiser, Abdirahman Abdishakur, a former Planning minister in Somalia, claimed Kenya cracked under pressure from Mogadishu.

In March, the UAE announced it would start training Somaliland soldiers when the two sides reached various agreements, among them to set up a military base, and have an Emirati company run a port there.

Somali MPs later nullified the agreement, arguing it violated territorial integrity.

Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991, runs its own affairs and even gives its ‘nationals’ passports; but has yet to get international state recognition.

The UAE and its allies like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are involved in a war in Yemen, some 300 kilometres east of Somalia and a military base in Somaliland could aid their war efforts.

However, Somalia is also host to a military base run by Turkey, though this agreement was reached between Ankara and Mogadishu.

IGAD MEETING

So how does that affect the work of Amisom, and Somalia’s stability?

Kenya thinks by dealing with regions, as opposed to the government in Mogadishu, the Gulf powers are fanning turmoil, which would require Amisom to stay there longer.

This was one of the issues discussed at a recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), an eight-member bloc that includes Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.

“During the meeting, emerging regional peace and security as well as the political economy were discussed.

""It was agreed that fresh and rigorous analyses on the manifestation of the Middle East in the region, the situation in Somalia and South Sudan and the effectiveness of Igad be undertaken to inform Kenya’s overall engagement through Igad,” a read-out from the meeting said.

CASH SEIZURE

“It shows that the region is tired and Igad member states are convinced that it is in their best interest to have a peaceful and prosperous Somalia.

""Some Arab countries are undermining the efforts made by Amisom for the last 10 years, specifically the UAE,” Dr Abdiwahab Abdi, a senior analyst on the Horn of Africa with SouthLink Consultancy in Nairobi, argued.

“That will affect the peace and stability in the Horn of Africa,” he added.

The UAE officially denies the charge and its Foreign ministry recently said it recognises one Somalia.

However, it recently terminated a military training in Mogadishu after authorities seized $9.6 million (Sh96 million) in cash in an Emirati aircraft.

SECURITY

Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma, Igad Executive Secretary Mahboub Maalim and other senior officials from Igad countries attended the meeting in Djibouti.

Igad also includes Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda.

Kenya, which has traditionally adopted a stance of non-interference and neutrality in the region, seems to be alarmed that a weakened Amisom at this point could mean a weaker Somalia and hence exposure to more Al-Shabaab attacks.

On Thursday, State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu confirmed Kenya’s opposition to downgrading the mission, arguing the security situation could worsen.

“Kenya is very much committed to Amisom and has used every opportunity to canvass with development partners not to cutback their assistance.

""The President did this as late as last month at a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the margins of the Commonwealth summit,” Mr Esipisu told the Sunday Nation.

“The wearer of the shoe feels the pinch. We live in a tough neighbourhood and know the consequences of an unstable Somalia.

""That’s why the President is committed to doing everything possible to see a stable Somalia.”

STATE VISITS

Kenya will continue with its charm offensive to convince troop contributing countries on the dangers of an early exit, a diplomat added.

Today, President Kenyatta is to host new Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and it is expected the issue of Somalia will feature.

Next weekend, Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh is also expected in the country on the invitation of the President.

Created in 2007 by the African Union Peace and Security Council, Amisom initially had a renewable six-month mandate to stabilise.

Later, the UN Security Council endorsed its existence as a combat mission, with civilian and police departments.

Kenya joined the Mission in 2012, a year after the Kenya Defence Forces entered Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab.

EXIT STRATEGY

The European Union and the US have been its main financiers, with the EU pumping in about Sh100 billion since its inception as Washington provides logistical support.

The mission was projected to exit Somalia by 2022 and financiers have said they will cut funding.

On Friday, Amisom Head Francisco Madeira would not confirm if Somalia will be ready to run its own operations, but said the withdrawal will depend on Mogadishu's capabilities.

“This process will allow us to judge whether Somalis are ready to take over from us.

""We are not interested, and Somalis are not interested either, to leave this place and lose all the gains achieved,” he told Chinese broadcaster CGTN in an interview.

“The idea is to empower Somalis to be able to continue with whatever we have not finished.”

Mr Madeira spoke as Amisom’s main financiers met in Brussels, Belgium, with Amisom officials to discuss the planned exit strategy, which includes a phased reduction of troops by 5,000 a year, ahead of the deadline.",Kenya tells UAE to stop meddling in Somalia affairs,https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Kenya-tells-UAE-to-stop-meddling-in-Somalia-affairs/1066-4547348-gydh7uz/index.html
