0,somalia,"The Gulf impasse caused political turmoil in the African country, with its central government aligning with Qatar and the federal states drifting towards the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The crisis has begun to challenge the country's territorial integrity.

On the evening of May 23, 2017, a quotation appeared on the bottom of Qatar’s official news channel, attributed to the Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani. “Iran,” it said, “is an Islamic power in the region that cannot be ignored.”

In spite of Thani’s insistence that the quotations were fakes, they were the pretext for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to drive a wedge through the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and several other Arab countries blockaded Qatar, sent Qatari nationals home, and broke off diplomatic relations. Leaders from around the world scrambled to mend the rift, foreseeing the likelihood that it might have a negative impact if it spilt over into other countries.

According to Omar Mahmoud, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, Somalia is one those countries – “as Somalia has imported the Gulf crisis,” he says.

The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), has taken a similar stand to many other countries, supporting the Kuwaiti initiative to broker dialogue between the quarrelling GCC states. But Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken an uncompromising stand, lobbying other countries to follow them in a wider attempt to politically isolate Qatar.

The FGS’s awkward neutrality, however, has been interpreted as a “vote for Qatar,” according to Mahmoud, pitting the central government against its member states.

The state leaders have voiced concerns about their ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, aligning themselves more closely with this grouping.

The issue came to the fore when Dubai-based shipping company DP World reached an agreement with the self-declared Republic of Somaliland.

The two parties signed a 25-year lease on the northern port of Berbera, sidestepping Mogadishu to secure the deal. The federal government views the deal as a violation of Somalia’s territorial integrity and constitution.

The UAE, which initiated and brokered the deal, kept 51 percent stake in the Berbera port project; Somaliland kept 30 percent and Ethiopia, having expressed its desire to take part in the project, secured 19 percent.

Somalia's federal government responded by declaring the agreement null and void and took the issue before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Abubakr Osman, Somalia’s Permanent Representative to the UN said the UAE’s plan was a “clear violation of international law.”

“Every company which wants to invest in Somalia must follow the due process as laid down by the law,” President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo” Mohamed told the Somali Parliament.

The deal for Berbera port, the government maintains, is illegal, as foreign affairs are primarily the domain of the central government in Mogadishu, according to the Somali constitution.

But following two decades of weak central governance, Mogadishu has little direct say in the affairs of regional state administrations, including Somaliland, which has declared total independence and doesn’t recognise the sovereignty of Mogadishu over its territories.

The UAE, Mahmoud says, “at times bypassed Mogadishu, and reached out to member states.” Mahmoud adds that this is the case not just in Somaliland, but “also Bosaso, Puntland,” where another Dubai-based company manages the main commercial port.

“So, the question becomes to what extent is the UAE working with Mogadishu on these agreements,” he tells TRT World.

Well, to what extent does the UAE need to?

“We need development, and no sane individual or leader will object to that,” Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, president of Puntland, said following a visit to Dubai. “That is why the support of the UAE is so important,” he continued.

At both the federal and, especially, at the regional level, Somalia’s ties to the Gulf run deep.

Between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, diasporic Somalis sent roughly $35 million in remittances back to Somalia in 2017. Two-thirds of livestock exports, which constitute roughly 40 percent of Somalia’s GDP, have their biggest market in Saudi Arabia. The UAE also finances infrastructure projects, trains and equips troops in the regional administrations as well as donating significant amounts of aid.

When the federal government in Mogadishu refused to be strong-armed into breaking with Qatar, the federal member states – whose multifaceted relationships with the Gulf are vital – broke with the federal government, expressing their solidarity with the Emirati position.

Somaliland, Puntland, South West, Hirshabelle and Galmudug showed their support for the Emirati- Saudi-led blockade by following their lead.

“The federal member states are arguing that a relationship with the UAE and Saudi Arabia would be much more beneficial than losing that and maintaining a relationship with Qatar,” says Mahmoud. “And that’s argued on a number of fronts. Economically, in terms of remittances, in terms of livestock, infrastructure development; so economically there is a big incentive there.”

The DP World agreement in Berbera, for example, operated with a view to expanding the capacity for livestock to be exported from that port. The UAE has also been paying the salaries of the Puntland Maritime Police Force since 2011. When Galmudug broke with Somalia's central government, it cited its “commercial relationship”, “sustainable development” and the “security” support provided by the UAE when explaining its decision.

The combination of a lack of strong central control, and the economic considerations of regional administrations appears to have been enough incentive for them to diverge from the central government on this matter.

As Gulf states jockey for influence, Somalia is increasingly caught in the crosshairs. But tensions between the UAE and Somalia reached a new high when Somali security authorities seized $9.6 million, which arrived in Somalia from Abu Dhabi Airport.

Though Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi, UAE ambassador to Somalia maintained that the money was intended for the Somali Ministry of Defense to contribute to the salaries of Somali troops, a Somali official insisted it was almost 10 times the expected amount, raising suspicions about what the cash was intended for.

The seizure resulted in a standoff that lasted for several hours between airport officials and Emirati officers. ( Feisal Omar/ Reuters )

An investigation followed to determine if the money was intended to “destabilise” the country.

Abdiwahab Sheikh Abdisamad, a Nairobi-based senior consultant at Southlink Consultancy, tells TRT World that because the “central government cannot control the entire region, the UAE has taken advantage of that vulnerability.”

“Somalia has become a theatre in this conflict,” he continued. He believes avoiding the central government to work directly with the regional administrations will undermine progress made to stabilise Somalia and create “further divisions.”

The UAE has responded by closing Sheikh Zayed Hospital, which used to provide free treatment for the residents of Mogadishu and soon after ended its military training mission in Somalia.

“They [the UAE] don’t have consideration for the constitution of Somalia, they don’t consider the rules and regulations of Somalia, nor do they consider the situation on the ground,” Abdisamad said, which is why he believes that the attempt by President Mohamed to distance Somalia from the UAE is an encouraging attempt to show the sovereignty of the centre.

His stance inspired young Somalis globally, who initiated the #UAEhandsoffSomalia and #Somalia_speaks hashtags.

The last time the Gulf states requested Somalia cut ties with another country was 2016, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud cut ties with Iran. President Mohamud’s government received $50 million from Saudi Arabia that day in aid – spoils earned for his eager cooperation.

In this case, the stakes are higher, as Qatar is a valued partner of the FGS, alongside Qatar’s ally Turkey, which has provided an unparalleled level of support to the FGS.

Both relations with the Saudi-UAE-led coalition and Qatar and Turkey are important for Somalia, “but when Somalia recognised that the money coming from the UAE was meant for other purposes than supporting the Somali military, Somalia acted accordingly,” Abdisamad said.

Somalia as a whole and the FGS, in particular, have made great progress in recreating a degree of normalcy in the country. At this very delicate stage, the Somali government, according to Abdisamad, has judged it needs more friends than enemies.

But as the Somali government becomes increasingly bold at determining its foreign policy, the country is also finding its bearings in determining which countries it prefers warm relations with.

“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia,"" he said, ""are much more important today than the financial assistance being provided by the UAE.”

1,somalia,"The export of charcoal from Somalia has been banned, both by a 2012 United Nations Security Council resolution and by the Somali Government, due to its destructive effect

on the environment and its exacerbation of conflict and humanitarian crises.

At the opening of a two-day, UN-supported conference on charcoal in Mogadishu, from 7th to 8th May 2018, the Federal Government of Somalia has called for international, African and Gulf States cooperation in halting the illegal export of charcoal from the country.

An estimated 8.2 million trees were cut down for charcoal in Somalia between 2011 and 2017, increasing land degradation, food insecurity, and vulnerability to flooding and drought. Over 80 percent of charcoal produced in Somalia is exported to the Gulf States and neighbouring countries.

Illegal trade in charcoal is recognized as a key contributor to insecurity in Somalia, providing a major source of funding for militias, terrorist groups, and other actors linked to conflict, who illegally tax exports.

The Deputy Prime Minister of Somalia, Mahdi Mohamed Guled, reaffirmed the Somali government’s commitment to halting illegal trade of charcoal and providing alternative livelihood and energy options. He also called for urgent action and support from the international community and countries that are importing charcoal.

“We need a holistic response to address the issues of charcoal in Somalia. Both the demand and supply side have to be tackled – to do this we need cooperation to implement the UN Security Council Resolution and ensure the environmental, economic and human losses that happen because of illegal charcoal trade are curbed,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.

“The environmental destruction brought on by the charcoal trade contributes to drought, flooding, the loss of livelihoods and increase in food insecurity. Together with conflict, this exacerbates the humanitarian situation in Somalia,” said the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, Peter de Clercq.

“But due to high levels of poverty in Somalia and lack of opportunities, many are forced to turn to unsustainable and illegal livelihoods, such as charcoal production. The people of this country deserve better”.

Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, UN Environment Regional Director for Africa, said the regional partnership is key to stopping the unsustainable production, use and export of charcoal in Somalia. “UN Environment and its partners are supporting the Government of Somalia to develop sound policy frameworks to support the ban and find alternatives to charcoal,” she said.

Participants at the event, which concludes today Tuesday 8 May, are expected to develop a concrete roadmap for action, including enforceable regional policies, to halt charcoal trade, as well as its unsustainable production and use within Somalia.

2,somalia,"Background

The Water Price Monitoring assessment aims to establish a data collection, monitoring and reporting system on water market prices in order to allow humanitarian and development actors to better analyse humanitarian needs in areas particularly affected by drought.

March data collection in Lower Shabelle was conducted through a quantitative survey between 30 - 31 March, focusing only on those water points in the region that are charging for water. The assessment has followed the official district boundaries of the region.

All prices are shown in US Cents for 90L of water. This is the daily amount used by a household of six members, consuming the minimum Sphere standard of 15L water per person per day. Price changes are subject to exchange rate.

Key Findings

• This factsheet presents information collected from 36 water points in Afgooye District, Lower Shabelle Region.

• Prices of water in Lower Shabelle reportedly increased by an average of 9% from February to March.

• The majority (58%) of assessed water points showed no change in price from February to March. Thirty-one percent (31%) showed an increase in price mainly due to more households accessing these water points, while 11% showed a decrease in price mainly due to an increase in water supply following ongoing rains.

• The majority (69%) of assessed water points in Lower Shabelle reportedly have their water treated at the distribution point. The majority of these (84%) have it treated though chlorination, while 16% have it treated through aquatabs.","Somalia Drought Crisis - Water Price Monitoring: Lower Shabelle Region, Somalia, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-drought-crisis-water-price-monitoring-lower-shabelle-region-somalia-march
3,somalia,"It was 1991 when Somali President Siad Barre was ousted, catapulting the country into disarray and prompting emboldened warlords to cleave the country apart.

Although an internationally-backed government was established in 2012 following interventions by Ethiopia and the African Union, the country remains fractured – bedevilled by humanitarian crises and a protracted struggle against Al Shabab militants.

In practice, the authority of the central government does not extend far beyond the capital, Mogadishu. It is within this context that Somalia’s recent row with the UAE should be dissected.

Ten months have passed since the Arab quartet of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar. Hugely reliant on foreign investment and aid, Somalia has imported the crisis.

On April 8, amid rising tension, Somali security forces stormed a UAE jet at Mogadishu airport, seizing $9.6 million (Dh35.3 million) in cash destined for the Puntland Maritime Police Force, an anti-piracy unit of the Somali army backed since 2014 by the Emirates.

In response to the breach of diplomatic protocol, the UAE abruptly ended its military training programme in Somalia. Sheikh Zayed hospital in Mogadishu suspended operations.

Immediately thereafter, Qatar donated 30 buses and two cranes to Mogadishu regional officials. “That is not coincidental,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project director at the International Crisis Group (ICG).

The gesture is emblematic of international pressures weighing on Somalia, thanks to pre-existing relationships and its proximity to the Gulf.

Turkey operates a military base of epic proportions in Mogadishu, whose lucrative port is run by Al Bayrak, a Turkish corporation. Ankara was an early investor in Somalia, though analysts say popular support for Turkey’s presence is dwindling.

Turkey's ally, Qatar, whose airline immediately used Somali airspace when the boycott began last year, has sought to involve itself in Somali politics, according to Faisal Roble, a leading Somalia expert.

Saudi Arabia, which imports 80 per cent of Somalia’s livestock, donated $50m in 2016 after Mogadishu severed ties with Iran. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed visited Riyadh less than a fortnight after his inauguration last year for his first official trip.

Meanwhile, the UAE, which has been training and paying the salaries of 2,407 Somali troops, is most active in the autonomous region of Puntland, whose government yesterday appealed to the Emirates to remain engaged.

“There is a common understanding that Puntland doesn’t get the support it requires from the government,” said Mr Abdi. But the involvement of international players “has driven a wedge between Mogadishu and the different regional states,” he added.

As Somalia’s fortunes have faltered in recent years, economic imperatives have compelled its regions to accept aid and investment from different players. After the Gulf dispute, such investment brought into question the central government’s promise to remain neutral in the Gulf dispute.

The stunning plane seizure follows months of deteriorating ties between Abu Dhabi and Mogadishu.

Somali politicians reacted with fury to the tripartite deal between Dubai’s DP World, the government of breakaway Somaliland and landlocked Ethiopia over control of a strategic port at Berbera. The UAE is also constructing a military base in Somaliland, just 260 km from war-torn Yemen, which contains Africa’s longest runway.

Somali politicians, powerless to dictate Somaliland affairs, claimed the deal was a violation of its sovereignty.

On the other side, Mogadishu’s failure to disavow Qatar may have caused irritation in the UAE. “There are many people here in the UAE who feel deeply invested in Somalia’s future and stability and are saddened by developments,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior Arabian Peninsula analyst at ICG.

4,somalia,"Tensions between Somalia and the United Arab Emirates ratcheted up this week as Mogadishu ditched a military deal with its ally and seized millions of dollars in cash from an Emirati plane.

The escalation came after months of building friction in Somalia as the Gulf crisis pitting Arab powers against each other spills over into the fragile state, whose position of neutrality has not gone down well at home or with its allies.

Rashid Abdi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told AFP that while the UAE and Somalia have traditionally been close, and Mogadishu has vowed to remain neutral over the Gulf divisions, the central government is nevertheless ""perceived to be very much pro-Qatar"".

Some of Somalia's federal states were unhappy with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed's neutral stance, and have broken with the official position to side with the UAE.

Diplomatic tensions first spilled into the open in March after the Dubai-based DP World gave Ethiopia a 19% stake in the Berbera port in breakaway Somaliland - whose independence is not recognised by Mogadishu.

Lawmakers in Somalia, which also has a history of animosity with Ethiopia, adopted a resolution accusing the company of having ""intentionally violated the sovereignty of Somalia"".

Tempers have also flared over a military base being built by the UAE in Somaliland.

'Unnecessary tensions'

On Sunday, Somali security forces stormed onto a UAE civilian aircraft at the international airport, and seized $9.6m in cash held in three unmarked bags.



""The security forces noticed the suspicious bags and handed them over to the concerned departments,"" Somalia's security ministry said in a statement.

However the UAE in a statement accused security forces of holding those on the plane ""at gunpoint"", and said the cash had been allocated to support the Somali army and trainees.

""The current Somali government ... is creating unnecessary tensions with a friend and an ally who supported the stability and security of Somalia during its hardest phases,"" tweeted UAE state minister for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash.

""We call for wisdom and reason"".

Just days later, on Wednesday, Somalia's defence ministry announced it was taking over the management of hundreds of Somali troops who had been trained by the UAE.

The UAE has been running a military camp in Mogadishu where it trains Somali soldiers, who are also paid by Emirati officials.

""As a government, our responsibility is to take care of our armed forces and pay their wages and not to delegate that responsibility to others. We thank the UAE for the training and relentless support it provided,"" Defence Minister Mohamed Mursal told a local news agency.

Experts describe the bloated and largely ineffective Somali army as more a collection of clan militias, with various international militaries providing poorly-coordinated training to different units.

The security of the country, battling the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab extremists, has largely been propped up by AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping force, which is due to withdraw by 2020.

'Vulnerable and weak'

The 10-month Gulf crisis pits Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain against Qatar - which has been accused by its rivals of fostering close links with Tehran and supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar denies the charges.

With close geographic, political, economic and cultural ties with the Gulf, observers warn the Horn of Africa is facing heightened instability as countries come under pressure to pick sides while Arab powers jockey for political influence.

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the 1991 overthrow of president Siad Barre's military regime which ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict.

Abdi warned the Gulf crisis could have a ""serious destabilising impact on Somalia.""

""There's no doubt that the Gulf crisis has spilled over into the Horn. Now countries which are strong can manage this war, but Somalia is very vulnerable and very weak,"" he said.

Heavy rains and severe flash floods have left more than 300 people dead and displaced thousands of others across parts of east Africa, with Kenya and Rwanda being the worst hit.



“We are concerned about the flooding that has displaced so many people in Somalia, Kenya and Rwanda,” said Farhan Aziz Haq, deputy spokesman for the UN secretary general in a statement to the Guardian.

“Our hearts go out to all the people who have been harmed by the rains and flash floods,” he said.

In Kenya ongoing torrential rains have damaged infrastructure, preventing or limiting humanitarian access to many of the affected areas and cutting off people’s access to markets in several places.

“Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that heavy rainfall in Kenya has caused severe flooding in at least 32 counties, out of 47, across the country. An estimated 100 people have lost their lives and 260,000 others have been displaced,” said Haq.

Euloge Ishimwe, of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said it is a “double jeopardy” for the affected communities, as many of them are already struggling to recover from the devastating drought in 2017, after which more than 2.6 million Kenyans were in urgent need of food aid.



“The livelihoods and resilience of the affected communities had already been weakened… With the flooding, we are worried that these communities will be further rendered more vulnerable.”

The extreme weather has compounded a cholera outbreak in the country as well as an epidemic of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus, and is increasing the risk of large-scale outbreaks.

The number of cholera cases reported since the beginning of 2018 stands at 2,943, with 55 deaths, according to the UN’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Unocha).

In a statement, Unocha said education and health facilities have been damaged in the flooding, and the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) said roads and train lines had been destroyed. Extensive damages and losses have been reported to fields and livestock, with at least 8,700 hectares (21,5000) acres of farmland destroyed and more than 19,000 animals killed.

IFRC and KRCS have launched an international emergency appeal for provision of shelter and settlement, health and nutrition, water and sanitation and food for 150,000 people.

On Sunday 6 May, landslips triggered by heavy rains killed at least 18 people in Rwanda, taking the death toll to 201 in the past four months, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (Midimar). Some 5,000 hectares of crops and nearly 10,000 houses were destroyed, as well as roads, churches and bridges.

In Somalia, flash and river flooding has so far affected an estimated 630,000 people, with about 215,000 displaced following the heavy rains across the country in April, according to UN figures.

The Juba and Shabelle, Somalia’s two major rivers, have burst their banks in several locations, causing flooding much earlier in the season than ever before.

Save the Children warned that the Somali families displaced by drought and near-famine conditions last year are now on the move again, with the catastrophic flash flooding leaving them more vulnerable to malnutrition and diseases such as acute watery diarrhoea and cholera.

“The flooding is compounding an already fragile humanitarian situation with an estimated 5.4 million people in need of assistance in Somalia, 2.7 million of whom require urgent life-saving assistance,” said the charity.

“Somalia’s humanitarian response plan is only 18% funded, which is insufficient to support on-going operations to stave off famine as well as a flood response.”

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the floods in Somalia are some of the worst the region has ever seen.

As the rainy season enters peak levels, Uganda’s ministry of disaster preparedness last week issued a public risk alert, warning of episodic flash floods and landslides that would lead to loss of lives and destruction of property in May.

Over 4.4 million people need humanitarian WASH services, with 3.5 out of 5 people without adequate water to meet basic needs. More than 5.7 million people require basic health services, including critical needs in maternal and child health, as one in seven Somali children die before the age of five. Disease outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera and measles continue to represent a major threat to children, with over 1,764 cases of AWD/cholera (56 per cent children under 5) and 4,313 cases of suspected measles reported in 2018. Over 3 million children, out of 4.9 million in country, are estimated to be out of school. More than 2.1 million people have been displaced, including over 1 million in the last year alone; and displacement flows continue at critical levels into areas such as Baidoa in Bay Region, which has received an average of 700 new arrivals per week since mid-January, 2018.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Somalia drastically deteriorated in the first half of 2017, leading to a robust scale up of relief operations across the country with the single joint objective – to avert famine. Prolonged drought conditions in a fragile environment led to spikes in food insecurity, surging disease outbreaks and massive internal displacement throughout the year. Underlying vulnerability due to protracted crisis, limited access to basic services and conflict remained the key drivers of humanitarian needs.

Drought conditions, food security and malnutrition

The consecutive failure or below average performance of 2016 and 2017 rains led to the spike in the number of people in need to 6.7 million by mid-2017. This number has since declined to 5.4 million, also due to the collective response of national and international actors that was scaled up and sustained in 2017, with up to 3.2. million reached with assistance on a monthly basis.

The humanitarian situation, however, remained critical at the end of 2017, with some 2.7 million people projected to be in Crisis or Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4) between January and June 2018. The number of children under the age of five who were acutely malnourished was estimated at 301,000, including 48,000 who were severely malnourished and faced an increased risk of disease and death.

Internal displacement remained major protection concern

Internal displacements increased, nearly doubling the pre-crisis displacement figures. More than one million people were displaced by drought and conflict in 2017, bringing the total number of displaced to over 2.1 million. Displaced communities are often living in overcrowded settlements and are disproportionately exposed to protection risks, such as discrimination, child rights violations and gender-based violence (GBV).

Prevalence of disease outbreaks

Disease outbreaks remain prevalent due to limited access to basic services such as health care and sanitation. Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera was reported in 52 districts in 16 regions out of the 18 regions in Somalia. A cumulative total of 78,784 cases with over 1,159 related deaths reported between January and December 2017. By the end of the year, the number of active cases had, however, gone down, thanks to concerted efforts from humanitarian partners. Some 23,002 suspected measles cases were reported, which is alarmingly high compared to previous years. Among these cases, 83 per cent were children under 10 years of age.

Security and access constrains

The operating environment in Somalia remained complex and dangerous. A combination of access-related constraints continued to impede the ability of humanitarian organisations to reach people in need in a timely manner and close to the places of their origin or residence, often tilting response to locations of converged displacement.

The year witnessed rising violence against humanitarians, particularly those with operations in southern and central Somalia. Over 170 violent incidents impacted humanitarian organisations and led to the death of 16 humanitarian workers, injury of 33, physical assault of three, arrests and temporary detention of 22, abduction of 31 and attempted abduction of nine. Nine humanitarian workers, including three international and six national staff, were expelled by the authorities.

Frontline responders continued to be most affected, with hostilities, including improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in the populated areas, impacting humanitarian operations primarily in southern and central regions. Indiscriminate attacks in populated places, causing deaths and injuries, accounted for majority of the humanitarian casualties recorded in 2017 and resulted in destruction of humanitarian facilities and assets.

Nearly 100 incidents related to administrative and bureaucratic impediments were reported. As in previous years, there were demands for multiple registrations, arbitrary taxation, interference in procurement, staff recruitment and contract awards, deduction of project funds for monitoring and evaluation, the ban of movement along certain access roads, and clearance of humanitarian supplies at state boundaries and border points, including ports.

Prospects for recovery

Amidst the crisis, Somalia continued to make progress with the establishment of permanent political institutions, paving the way towards a future with greater peace. However, this is yet to translate into an improvement for the majority of Somalis in terms of food security and nutrition, access to safe water, sanitation, health care, protection and other basic services. Another notable progress is the launch of the Drought Impact Needs Assessment at the end of 2017, paving the way towards the long-term recovery, which will require a collective engagement of humanitarian and development actors through 2018 and beyond.",Somalia Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Over half a million people affected by flooding

The probability of floods of this current magnitude is once every fifty years, SWALIM.

Flash and river flooding has affected more than 582,000 people and of these over 200,000 have been displaced from their homes following heavy rains received across the country in April, according to UNHCR-led Protection and Return and Monitoring Network (PRMN).

The Gu rainy season (April – June) started early March with consistent, heavy rains in flood-prone areas of southern and central regions. The Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands continued to receive moderate to heavy rains, according to FAOmanaged Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM).

Other central and northern parts of the country are expected to receive moderate to high rains in the first week of May with regions of Puntland being the exception. Overall, rainfall has been above average over broad areas of Somalia and the result has been a rapid increase in river levels causing flash and riverine flooding in many locations.

SWALIM has reported that the probability of floods of this current magnitude is once every fifty years. The Juba and Shabelle rivers have reached bank full levels in several locations causing flooding much earlier in the season than historically observed. Flooding along the two rivers has resulted in the destruction of crops and property and inundation of houses.","Humanitarian Bulletin Somalia, 5 April – 2 May 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/humanitarian-bulletin-somalia-5-april-2-may-2018

“Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,” Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General said, briefing reporters in New York on Monday.

“Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, [health,] shelter and food response in their interventions,” he added.

The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over six million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.

Floods worse than anticipated

The magnitude of rainfall has been much worse than anticipated, said Yngvil Foss, the deputy head at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Somalia.

Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available

“Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available,” she said, noting that UN relief agencies have been able to raise funding over the past week to scale up critical interventions.

The UN World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, delivered 4.5 million metric tons of medicines and other medical supplies to Belet Weyne, the capital of the hard hit HirShabelle province, on 29 April.

Peacekeeping troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) also evacuated more than 10,000 residents of Belet Weyne from inundated parts of the city as well as providing tarpaulins and water to those affected.

More funding urgently needed

However, more funds are urgently needed to help the increasing numbers of internally-displaced.

Yesterday, Somalia's President, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed “Farmajo” visited flood affected areas and appealed to the international community for urgent humanitarian assistance.

Somalia’s Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, totalling $1.5 billion (before the floods), is only 19 per cent funded.

12,somalia,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 600 weapons were stolen in the past week from a former United Arab Emirates-run training center in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu and are for sale in the city, weapons dealers said on Wednesday.

Weapons looted from a former United Arab Emirates (UAE) military training camp are displayed during a Reuters interview in Mogadishu, Somalia April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Feisal Omar

The weapons, including new Kalashnikov assault rifles and Chinese versions of them, were stolen by Somali National Army soldiers who had been trained by the UAE at its facility, three Somali men who purchased weapons from the soldiers told Reuters.

The Gulf nation has trained hundreds of Somali troops since 2014 as part of an effort boosted by an African Union military mission to defeat an Islamist insurgency and secure the country for the Somali government, which is backed by Western nations, Turkey and the United Nations.

The UAE ended the program on April 15, shortly after security forces at Mogadishu’s airport seized millions of dollars and temporarily held a UAE plane.

The escalating diplomatic dispute is one aspect of the fallout in volatile Somalia from a crisis in the Gulf region that has spilled into the Horn of Africa.

Somalia’s relations with the UAE are strained by a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia because Mogadishu has refused to take sides. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have strong trading links with and influence in Somalia, offset by the sway of Qatar and its ally Turkey, one of Somalia’s biggest foreign investors.

Neither Somalia nor the UAE is showing urgent interest in resolving their dispute, said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Somali officials wanted to be seen “standing up” to the UAE, “and the Emirati officials’ position is, ‘If Somalia doesn’t want our money, fine, we’ll take it elsewhere,’” Malley told Reuters in Nairobi after returning from a trip to Mogadishu.

The UAE-trained troops began stealing weapons from the facility shortly after the program was disbanded, the dealers said. The soldiers sold guns directly to the dealers and indirectly via their brokers.

The looting appears to have occurred while the UAE was in the process of emptying its training center.

On Sunday night a ship docked at Mogadishu’s port was loaded with equipment from the UAE’s training center, including several dozen shipping containers of weapons, dozens of armored vehicles fixed with anti-aircraft guns and hundreds of cars, a port staff member told Reuters.

On Monday, gunfire broke out at the former training center where some of the troops were still camped out, and UAE-trained troops who were still there fled with as many weapons as they could, before a rival group took over the facility.

Residents in the area told Reuters they saw UAE-trained forces discarding their military uniforms and fleeing the facility in three-wheeled rickshaws with guns in their laps. [L8N1S0508]

After 90 minutes of sporadic gunfire, the facility was secured by presidential palace guards, a Reuters journalist at the scene said.

UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Officials from Somalia’s defense ministry did not immediately answer phone calls requesting comment on the weapons theft. Defense Minister Mohamed Mursal resigned this week to contest for the vacant position of parliament speaker.

Army commander General Abdiweli Jama Gorod said on Monday that some soldiers who were behind the attempted theft of equipment from the facility had been arrested.

“The Somali national forces now have in hand the few soldiers and officers who were behind today’s incident and we assure we shall bring them before justice,” he said in comments reported by the state-run Somalia News Agency.

Gorod did not answer phone calls on Wednesday afternoon seeking comment.

Due to the diplomatic dispute, the UAE-trained troops are being called “rebels” by some elements of the army, a security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

The dealers showed Reuters five weapons they said they bought from the soldiers. They all bore the marking “SO XDS”, indicating that they belonged to the Somali army.

An arms expert said this was consistent with the previous arrangement between the two countries.

“The weapons belonged to the SNA, which distributed them to the UAE training center. So they are marked SO XDS,” he said.

“About 600 to 700 AK-47 and (other) guns were looted from the former UAE training camps,” weapons dealer Jama Ali told Reuters, speaking from a home in Mogadishu where he and two other men presented the weapons.

Ali said they purchased the weapons for $700, a significant discount on the current price of $1,350 in Mogadishu for a new Kalashnikov. The dealers then began last night reselling the weapons at $1,000 each, he said.

“The best day for business is when there is government infighting,” said Hassan Abuja, another dealer. “Prices of weapons and ammunition go up.”","Exclusive: Weapons stolen from UAE training facility in Somalia, sold on open market",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-arms/exclusive-weapons-stolen-from-uae-training-facility-in-somalia-sold-on-open-market-idUSKBN1HW26I

The recent statement from the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) that American forces had carried out an airstrike destroying an al-Shabaab truck bomb near Jana Cadalle in southern Somalia on April 11 was the third time this month that the US military is reported to have hit the terrorist group in the East African country.

While AFRICOM stressed that the action - and the eight other airstrikes that it has acknowledged since the beginning of this year alone - was taken ""in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia"" (FGS), the truth is that this heightened operational tempo in response to the ongoing threat from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab as well as a smaller ISIS-affiliated group only underscores the ongoing weakness of the internationally-recognized Somali regime.

While it is imperative to keep up military pressure on the militants, ultimately insurgencies like Somalia's can only be defeated by political legitimacy - and, as I pointed out late last year, this is one test that, more than a quarter of century after the collapse of the last central government to really exercise sovereignty over the country, the authorities in Mogadishu still struggle to achieve a passing grade on: recall that the FGS's own auditor estimates that $20 million changed hands in the process that led to the establishment of the current administration in February 2017, a fact that does not exactly stir patriotic adherence to or otherwise bolster the regime's credibility with ordinary Somalis.

Protected in the seaside capital by the 22,000-strong military force of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) - made up of troops from Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda whose salaries are paid by the European Union and whose operations are supported by a United Nations logistical package and various bilateral donors led by the United States - Somalia's political elites wile away their time in internecine power struggles.

Earlier this month, the speaker of the country's parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawari, was forced to resign ahead of a no-confidence vote, after losing out in a fight with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a.k.a. ""Farmajo"" (from the Italian formaggio, or cheese) a dual US-Somali national who worked as a Buffalo-based diversity contracting officer for the New York State Department of Transportation in between stints in politics.

At least this standoff was resolved without recourse to physical violence: just a week before, parliamentary police loyal to the speaker squared off against state security forces aligned with the president in the legislative chamber itself, necessitating an intervention by Ugandan Brigadier Paul Lokech and AMISOM troops under his command to separate the combatants.

Amid this political infighting, extremist Islamist elements - including veterans of some of al-Shabaab's predecessor groups or fellow travelers such as al-Itihaad al-Islamiya (AIAI), the Islamic Courts Union, and al-Islah - have begun to coalesce around a new banner, ""al-Citisam"" (""those who seek protection"" [from God]), with support from certain segments of the FGS. During a trip to the region last month, a well-placed senior African interlocutor with years of diplomatic and intelligence experience in Somalia shared with me a dossier that suggests that al-Citisam's reach may go as far as President Farmajo's chief of staff, Fahad Yasin.

From what I learned, Yasin - who, prior to his entry into politics as the manager of Farmajo's successful bid for the presidency last year, worked for Doha, Qatar-based Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel as a correspondent--has links to several prominent figures in AIAI, which has been designated a terrorist group by the US State Department under the USA PATRIOT Act.

A respected Horn of Africa researcher summarized al-Citisam in this way: ""It is garnering broader alliances of businessmen and clerics, and this had produced telling jokes in Mogadishu: 'al-Shabaab with money is in the making and delivered al-Citisam,' and the group is stealthily trying to capture the state... The importance of al-Citisam lies in the fact that it has the capacity to become a force to be reckoned with quickly, progressively assuming the upper hand among the rank and file of the [Somali Federal Government], although the group's target is the 2020 elections in Somalia...

The whole plan is designed in such a way as to constitute the core of the [Somali National Army, SNA]... When the full training and organization of these [first] 1,000 soldiers is completed, they will take over the running of the security of Villa Somalia... Following the adjustment of Villa Somalia's security arrangements, the next batch of 1,000 soldiers consisting of [former] al-Shabaab operatives will deal with the security of the city."" According to this analyst, recruitment for this plan is being overseen by a committee headed by Sheikh Abdullahi Ahmed Omer, formerly of Jabhatul Islamiya (a.k.a, the Somali Islamic Front, JABISO), a group that merged into the Hizbul Islam insurgency during the Ethiopian intervention in Somalia in 2006.

All this is taking place under the very nose of President Farmajo - perhaps even with his tacit approval. It is worth recalling that Farmajo's 2009 master's thesis at the State University of New York at Buffalo not only claimed that the genocidal Siad Barre regime had ""won the hearts and minds of the people by promoting a new self-reliance and self-supporting mentality"" and lamented the dictatorship's ignominious collapse as ""another unfortunate page in an unfortunate epoch,"" but described US policy in the region as ""failed"" while slavishly praising then-Somali President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, an Islamist, as ""the very best person for today's Somalia.""

This is the context which perhaps sheds some light on an otherwise obscure set of recent developments. On April 8, Somali officials stopped an airplane at Mogadishu's Aden Adde International Airport carrying forty-seven military personnel from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to a statement from the UAE's Foreign Ministry, the Emirati personnel were held at gunpoint and assaulted, while a large amount of cash meant ""to support the Somali army and trainees and pay their salaries"" was seized (the Associated Press reported that the funds totaled $9.6 million). A week later, on April 14, in the northern port city of Bosaso, another Emirati plane, this one carrying trainers for the maritime police force in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, was detained before it was eventually allowed to depart.

Since 2014, the UAE has provided military and police counterterrorism trainers for Somalia and pays the salaries of some 2,407 Somali soldiers (roughly 10 percent of the SNA's official payroll, although a significantly higher proportion of its deployable effectives). In addition, the Emirati government and charities underwrite various aid projects, including the Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Mogadishu (named for the UAE's founding president, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan), which opened in 2015 and has since provided free treatment to hundreds of patients daily.

The UAE is also, after Saudi Arabia and Oman, the largest market for Somalia's primarily agricultural exports, especially livestock and hides. Dubai-based DP World is also committed to investing $442 million in a joint venture with the government in the Somaliland region to manage and develop a multi-use port in Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, one of the largest natural deep harbors on the African continent's eastern littoral. (The government of Ethiopia acquired a 19 percent stake in the project in March 2018, planning to make Berbera the gateway for an inland infrastructure corridor.)

In response, the UAE announced on April 15 that was ending its military-training mission, which up to now has trained thousands of Somali soldiers and police at three training centers that it also constructed. According to the Foreign Ministry in Abu Dhabi: ""The decision comes in response to Somali security forces' seizure of a UAE-registered civil aircraft at Mogadishu Airport and confiscation of money destined to pay the soldiers... The UAE has expressed its denunciation of the seizure incident which flies in the face of diplomatic traditions and ties between world countries and contravenes the agreements signed by both countries.""

On April 21, Somali officials formally took over what had until just days before been the UAE-run training center in Mogadishu (SNA chief Abdullahi Ali Anod claimed that the government will turn the facility into a military academy, although he did not explain how it was going to pay for the transformation). As if on cue, al-Shabaab militants launched a heavy assault in the early hours of April 22 against the army barracks in the capital's Warta Nabada (formerly Wardhigley) district, home of the Villa Somalia presidential compound and the parliament building.

While the attack was repulsed with some casualties, that it could take place in the heart of Mogadishu, a city from which the insurgents were driven more than six years ago by AMISOM, only underscores how badly the FGS forces need the training and support that they won't be getting any more from the Emirati mission--for whose absence the thirty buses donated by the government of Qatar after Mogadishu's rupture with the UAE won't quite make up.

What has transpired is that the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council--especially Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain--has spilled over into a proxy conflict in the Horn of Africa. That much could have been anticipated, but what is both surprising and, from the point of view of the United States and other allies, more worrisome, is that the FGS has apparently taken sides. Moreover, Mogadishu's choice appears to be driven, in some measure, by a cabal within the already-fragile regime with a clear Islamist agenda - as if the very real threat of terrorism in and from Somalia were not more than enough to be concerned about.

15,somalia,"Situation Overview

Due to increased rainfall in the Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia, river water levels, which were extremely low between January and February 2018 have been steadily increasing since March, and have now reached high flood risk/full bank levels and overflowing. The Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands continued to receive moderate to heavy rains during the first week of May. The high level of rainfall seen over the past week were spread across many parts of the country, with the exception of Puntland, where light rains were experienced. The Lower Juba and Middle Juba regions of Jubaland State experienced the highest amounts of rainfall last week, resulting in increased river levels.

According to the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), moderate to heavy rains are projected for the coming week in most places across the country, as well as in the Ethiopian highlands. River levels are expected to remain high along the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Many areas along the Juba river have reached their highest level in recent history. Continued heavy rains and high river levels have led to flooding which currently exceeds a 50 year return period flood magnitude. Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle State has remained at full bank level for the last 14 days, and is expected to remain so for the next couple of days.

Given the rainfall forecast and the current high river levels, riverine flooding is likely to continue and get worse in the coming week. Flood waves from the upper parts of the two rivers in Ethiopia are expected to be transmitted to the two rivers in Somalia, which are already at full capacity, thus posing more risk. The projected moderate to heavy rains are likely to exacerbate ground conditions and trigger further flash and river flooding. Built-up and low-lying areas of Bay and Bakool in South West State will experience flash floods.

Humanitarian impact and needs

Flash and river flooding in several areas in the Banadir region, as well as Hirshabelle, Jubaland, Galmuduug, and South West States, have caused damage to crops, livelihoods and property, and have displaced thousands of people. An estimated 718,000 people have been affected by the flooding. Of these, more than 220,000 are displaced, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).

In Jubaland State, riverine and flash flooding continues to be reported in Gedo, Middle and Lower Juba regions. An estimated 206,000 people have been affected and nearly 95,000 people displaced. Large areas of farmland are flooded, and crops have been washed away by the floods. Most of the farms from Doolow to Gobweyn areas along the Juba river are reportedly under water. Agricultural assets, including irrigation equipment, have also been damaged. The people living in riverine areas have moved to higher grounds. Destruction of shelters and latrines has also been reported. In Afmadow, in Lower Juba, the inland towns located along the Legdhera basin (seasonal river that originates from Kenya and joins the Juba) have also been affected by flooding for first time since 2006, according to local sources.

Waterlogging, lack of access to latrines and destruction of shelter, especially among IDP settlements in Lower Juba, are posing health concerns. Access to food supplies is limited as major supply routes are impassible. Seasonal streams have converged at Diif, in the Gedo region, causing flooding in the town. Coastal towns, such as Kismayo, have also been affected by heavy rains and flash floods.

As of 6 May, in Hirshabelle State, an estimated 204,000 people have been displaced or isolated by flooding, according to the flood response task force in Belet Weyne. More people continue to flee their homes, to safer locations in Ceel Jaale and surrounding areas. Road movement remains limited, thus hindering access to the affected areas, including for the delivery of humanitarian supplies.

In South West State, an estimated 174,000 people have been affected by localized flash flooding in most towns. The worst-affected places are those hosting IDPs in low-lying areas. In Baidoa, half of the estimated 246,000 IDPs are at risk of flash flooding. In addition, the price of camel milk has more than doubled in Baidoa in less than a week, reportedly due to increased levies and blockages imposed by non-state armed actors. Meanwhile, riverine flooding in Lower Shabelle has also displaced nearly 3,000 people from Qoryooley to Marka to seek humanitarian assistance. Some 22 suspected cases of AWD/Cholera have been recorded at Afgooye General Hospital over the past two weeks. Medical supplies are insufficient to meet growing needs. Access to affected villages is limited due both to insecurity and to impassable roads resulting from the rains. Authorities in Lower Shabelle have appealed for assistance.

In Galmudug State, the Disaster Management Agency (GADMA) have reported that some areas in the Hobyo district in Mudug have experienced heavy rains. Overall, 15,180 people have been affected by the rainfall, and more than 6,800 people displaced. In Mudug, two children reportedly drowned near Bacad Weyn village, and lightning killed nearly 100 goats and sheep in the rural areas of Hobyo. Heavy rains also affected over 700 IDPs and damaged nearly 120 improvised IDP shelters in the town. Nearly 500 people were also affected in Garoowaale village and more than 20 latrines were damaged in Wisil village in Hobyo district. In Galgadud, moderate rains affected nearly 500 people in the Dhuusamareeb district.

The Banadir region did not receive significant rainfall over the past week, but humanitarian partners continue to monitor the situation. Some 767 cases of AWD/cholera have been reported there since January.",OCHA Somalia Flash Update #4 - Humanitarian impact of heavy rains | 8 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/ocha-somalia-flash-update-4-humanitarian-impact-heavy-rains-8-may-2018
