Due to increased rainfall in the Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia, river water levels, which were extremely low between January and February 2018 have been steadily increasing since March, and have now reached high flood risk/full bank levels and overflowing. The Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands continued to receive moderate to heavy rains during the first week of May. The high level of rainfall seen over the past week were spread across many parts of the country, with the exception of Puntland, where light rains were experienced. The Lower Juba and Middle Juba regions of Jubaland State experienced the highest amounts of rainfall last week, resulting in increased river levels.

According to the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), moderate to heavy rains are projected for the coming week in most places across the country, as well as in the Ethiopian highlands. River levels are expected to remain high along the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Many areas along the Juba river have reached their highest level in recent history. Continued heavy rains and high river levels have led to flooding which currently exceeds a 50 year return period flood magnitude. Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle State has remained at full bank level for the last 14 days, and is expected to remain so for the next couple of days.

Given the rainfall forecast and the current high river levels, riverine flooding is likely to continue and get worse in the coming week. Flood waves from the upper parts of the two rivers in Ethiopia are expected to be transmitted to the two rivers in Somalia, which are already at full capacity, thus posing more risk. The projected moderate to heavy rains are likely to exacerbate ground conditions and trigger further flash and river flooding. Built-up and low-lying areas of Bay and Bakool in South West State will experience flash floods.

Humanitarian impact and needs

Flash and river flooding in several areas in the Banadir region, as well as Hirshabelle, Jubaland, Galmuduug, and South West States, have caused damage to crops, livelihoods and property, and have displaced thousands of people. An estimated 718,000 people have been affected by the flooding. Of these, more than 220,000 are displaced, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).

In Jubaland State, riverine and flash flooding continues to be reported in Gedo, Middle and Lower Juba regions. An estimated 206,000 people have been affected and nearly 95,000 people displaced. Large areas of farmland are flooded, and crops have been washed away by the floods. Most of the farms from Doolow to Gobweyn areas along the Juba river are reportedly under water. Agricultural assets, including irrigation equipment, have also been damaged. The people living in riverine areas have moved to higher grounds. Destruction of shelters and latrines has also been reported. In Afmadow, in Lower Juba, the inland towns located along the Legdhera basin (seasonal river that originates from Kenya and joins the Juba) have also been affected by flooding for first time since 2006, according to local sources.

Waterlogging, lack of access to latrines and destruction of shelter, especially among IDP settlements in Lower Juba, are posing health concerns. Access to food supplies is limited as major supply routes are impassible. Seasonal streams have converged at Diif, in the Gedo region, causing flooding in the town. Coastal towns, such as Kismayo, have also been affected by heavy rains and flash floods.

As of 6 May, in Hirshabelle State, an estimated 204,000 people have been displaced or isolated by flooding, according to the flood response task force in Belet Weyne. More people continue to flee their homes, to safer locations in Ceel Jaale and surrounding areas. Road movement remains limited, thus hindering access to the affected areas, including for the delivery of humanitarian supplies.

In South West State, an estimated 174,000 people have been affected by localized flash flooding in most towns. The worst-affected places are those hosting IDPs in low-lying areas. In Baidoa, half of the estimated 246,000 IDPs are at risk of flash flooding. In addition, the price of camel milk has more than doubled in Baidoa in less than a week, reportedly due to increased levies and blockages imposed by non-state armed actors. Meanwhile, riverine flooding in Lower Shabelle has also displaced nearly 3,000 people from Qoryooley to Marka to seek humanitarian assistance. Some 22 suspected cases of AWD/Cholera have been recorded at Afgooye General Hospital over the past two weeks. Medical supplies are insufficient to meet growing needs. Access to affected villages is limited due both to insecurity and to impassable roads resulting from the rains. Authorities in Lower Shabelle have appealed for assistance.

In Galmudug State, the Disaster Management Agency (GADMA) have reported that some areas in the Hobyo district in Mudug have experienced heavy rains. Overall, 15,180 people have been affected by the rainfall, and more than 6,800 people displaced. In Mudug, two children reportedly drowned near Bacad Weyn village, and lightning killed nearly 100 goats and sheep in the rural areas of Hobyo. Heavy rains also affected over 700 IDPs and damaged nearly 120 improvised IDP shelters in the town. Nearly 500 people were also affected in Garoowaale village and more than 20 latrines were damaged in Wisil village in Hobyo district. In Galgadud, moderate rains affected nearly 500 people in the Dhuusamareeb district.

The Banadir region did not receive significant rainfall over the past week, but humanitarian partners continue to monitor the situation. Some 767 cases of AWD/cholera have been reported there since January.",OCHA Somalia Flash Update #4 - Humanitarian impact of heavy rains | 8 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/ocha-somalia-flash-update-4-humanitarian-impact-heavy-rains-8-may-2018

At stake: not just the busy waters off the Somali coast but the future stability of the country itself.

Somalia has been at war for decades and until the last few years it has struggled to attract foreign investment. But rivalries in the nearby Arabian peninsula are resulting in serious inflows into Somalia.

A year ago, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates government signed a $336 million contract to expand the port of Bosaso, north of Mogadishu in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland.

Less than a year before that, another UAE-owned firm took control of the Berbera port in the breakaway northern region of Somaliland and pledged up to $440 million to develop it. In March, Ethiopia took a stake in the port for an undisclosed sum.

At the same time, Turkey, an ally of UAE rival Qatar, is ramping up a multi-billion dollar investment push in Somalia. A Turkish company has run the Mogadishu port since 2014, while other Turkish firms have built roads, schools, and hospitals.

The rivalries have intensified since June, when the most powerful Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Iran and Islamist militants.

That Middle Eastern feud is driving the desire to control the Horn of Africa and its waters, according to diplomats, businessmen, scholars and Somali officials.

Somalia is close to vital oil routes and its ports could also serve landlocked Ethiopia, which has a population of 100 million.

Gulf nations have had trade and religious ties with Somalia for centuries, but those relationships are now up in the air as new rivalries emerge.

“Somalia has been caught in the middle of this effort to try to expand influence, commercial and military, along the coast,” said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE increasingly view the Somali coastline - and Djibouti and Eritrea to the north - as their “western security flank”, according to a senior western diplomat in the Horn of Africa region.

Qatar and Turkey, whose investments are almost all in Mogadishu, are focused on supporting President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He and his chief of staff are widely viewed in Somalia and by western diplomats as loyal to Doha after receiving funds for their 2017 election campaign.

A Qatari official told Reuters Doha had provided $385 million in infrastructure, education and humanitarian assistance to the central Somali government.

The official said making deals directly with regional governments in Somalia, as the UAE has done, undermined the central government.

Somali finance minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh agreed.

“The Gulf region has a lot of money and if they want to invest in Somalia we welcome them with open arms,” he told Reuters. “But it’s a question of going through the right doors.”

The federal government in Mogadishu has long been at odds with the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. The latter operates virtually as an independent state and has for years sought to secede from Somalia, but has not won international recognition.

DETRIMENTAL EFFECT

Less than a decade ago there was virtually no commercial interest in Somalia.

That began to change in 2011 when al Qaeda-backed al Shabaab militants retreated from Mogadishu. Months later, Turkey launched famine relief operations, opening the door for projects that now make it Somalia’s biggest foreign investor.

The government hopes new investment, especially in infrastructure, can help the country rebuild.

Better tax collection is boosting government revenues, but this only covers public sector salaries. Huge amounts of capital are needed for roads, schools and other basics. Middle Eastern companies and charities could provide some of it.

However, the money could also destabilize the country further by deepening tensions between the central government, aligned with Turkey and Qatar, and Puntland and Somaliland, which both receive money from the UAE.

“These investments are having a detrimental effect on our political stability and worsening the relationship between our federal government and the regions,” said former national security adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali.

“This could cause a constitutional crisis that only al Shabaab will benefit from.”

The Gulf crisis has already deepened rifts in Somalia. The central government has stayed neutral, to the annoyance of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which Puntland and Somaliland have backed against Qatar.

“Getting out of this mess is very difficult,” Sheikh-Ali said. “Without unity we cannot.”

The Somali presidency and the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Western nations fear the Gulf rivalries playing out in Somalia could sideline their multi-billion dollar, U.N.-led efforts to build a functional Somali army to fight Shabaab before the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers in 2020.

Political crises between Mogadishu and the regional authorities are undermining government efforts to strengthen financial systems and embark on other core tasks of a state, diplomats say.

TROUBLE

The Gulf rivalry is also being felt on the ground in Somalia.

In mid-April, Somalia and the UAE ended military cooperation. Since 2014, the UAE had trained and paid the salaries of Somali troops in Mogadishu and built an anti-piracy force in Puntland. Hundreds of weapons were looted from the training center in Mogadishu as it shut down.

This came after Somali security forces seized nearly $10 million flown in from the UAE to pay soldiers and temporarily held the plane which brought the cash. The UAE also closed a hospital that offered free care.

Last week Puntland officials traveled to Dubai to meet UAE counterparts and P&O, the state firm developing its port.

“Investing millions of dollars in Somalia at this critical juncture in history is very important for us,” Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said.

Similarly, Somaliland officials hosted UAE diplomats last week to discuss “enhancing bilateral ties”.

“For Somalis themselves, this kind of geopolitical game of chess, where Somalia is solely a proxy conflict to the trouble in the Gulf, this is obviously bad news,” said Harry Verhoeven, professor at Georgetown University in Qatar.

4,somalia,"Mogadishu, 7 May 2018 - At the opening of a two-day, UN-supported conference on charcoal in Mogadishu, the Federal Government of Somalia has called for international, African and Gulf States cooperation in halting the illegal export of charcoal from the country. The export of charcoal from Somalia has been banned, both by a 2012 United Nations Security Council resolution and by the Somali Government, due to its destructive effect on the environment and its exacerbation of conflict and humanitarian crises.

An estimated 8.2 million trees were cut down for charcoal in Somalia between 2011 and 2017, increasing land degradation, food insecurity and vulnerability to flooding and drought. Over 80 percent of charcoal produced in Somalia is exported to Gulf States and neighbouring countries. Illegal trade in charcoal is recognised as a key contributor to insecurity in Somalia, providing a major source of funding for militias, terrorist groups, and other actors linked to conflict, who illegally tax exports.

In his opening address, the Deputy Prime Minister of Somalia, Mahdi Mohamed Guled, reaffirmed the Somali government’s commitment to halting illegal trade of charcoal, and providing alternative livelihood and energy options. He also called for urgent action and support from the international community and countries that are importing charcoal.

“We need a holistic response to address the issues of charcoal in Somalia. Both the demand and supply side have to be tackled – to do this we need cooperation to implement the UN Security Council Resolution and ensure the environmental, economic and human losses that happen because of illegal charcoal trade are curbed,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.

“The environmental destruction brought on by the charcoal trade contributes to drought, flooding, the loss of livelihoods and increase in food insecurity. Together with conflict, this exacerbates the humanitarian situation in Somalia,” said the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, Peter de Clercq. “But due to high levels of poverty in Somalia and lack of opportunities, many are forced to turn to unsustainable and illegal livelihoods, such as charcoal production. The people of this country deserve better”.

Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, UN Environment Regional Director for Africa, said regional partnership is key to stopping the unsustainable production, use and export of charcoal in Somalia. “UN Environment and its partners are supporting the Government of Somalia to develop sound policy frameworks to support the ban and find alternatives to charcoal,” she said.

Participants at the event, which concludes on Tuesday 8 May, are expected to develop a concrete road map for action, including enforceable regional policies, to halt charcoal trade, as well as its unsustainable production and use within Somalia. The high-level summit is supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), with funding from Sweden, the European Union and Italy.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Somalia drastically deteriorated in the first half of 2017, leading to a robust scale up of relief operations across the country with the single joint objective – to avert famine. Prolonged drought conditions in a fragile environment led to spikes in food insecurity, surging disease outbreaks and massive internal displacement throughout the year. Underlying vulnerability due to protracted crisis, limited access to basic services and conflict remained the key drivers of humanitarian needs.

Drought conditions, food security and malnutrition

The consecutive failure or below average performance of 2016 and 2017 rains led to the spike in the number of people in need to 6.7 million by mid-2017. This number has since declined to 5.4 million, also due to the collective response of national and international actors that was scaled up and sustained in 2017, with up to 3.2. million reached with assistance on a monthly basis.

The humanitarian situation, however, remained critical at the end of 2017, with some 2.7 million people projected to be in Crisis or Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4) between January and June 2018. The number of children under the age of five who were acutely malnourished was estimated at 301,000, including 48,000 who were severely malnourished and faced an increased risk of disease and death.

Internal displacement remained major protection concern

Internal displacements increased, nearly doubling the pre-crisis displacement figures. More than one million people were displaced by drought and conflict in 2017, bringing the total number of displaced to over 2.1 million. Displaced communities are often living in overcrowded settlements and are disproportionately exposed to protection risks, such as discrimination, child rights violations and gender-based violence (GBV).

Prevalence of disease outbreaks

Disease outbreaks remain prevalent due to limited access to basic services such as health care and sanitation. Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera was reported in 52 districts in 16 regions out of the 18 regions in Somalia. A cumulative total of 78,784 cases with over 1,159 related deaths reported between January and December 2017. By the end of the year, the number of active cases had, however, gone down, thanks to concerted efforts from humanitarian partners. Some 23,002 suspected measles cases were reported, which is alarmingly high compared to previous years. Among these cases, 83 per cent were children under 10 years of age.

Security and access constrains

The operating environment in Somalia remained complex and dangerous. A combination of access-related constraints continued to impede the ability of humanitarian organisations to reach people in need in a timely manner and close to the places of their origin or residence, often tilting response to locations of converged displacement.

The year witnessed rising violence against humanitarians, particularly those with operations in southern and central Somalia. Over 170 violent incidents impacted humanitarian organisations and led to the death of 16 humanitarian workers, injury of 33, physical assault of three, arrests and temporary detention of 22, abduction of 31 and attempted abduction of nine. Nine humanitarian workers, including three international and six national staff, were expelled by the authorities.

Frontline responders continued to be most affected, with hostilities, including improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in the populated areas, impacting humanitarian operations primarily in southern and central regions. Indiscriminate attacks in populated places, causing deaths and injuries, accounted for majority of the humanitarian casualties recorded in 2017 and resulted in destruction of humanitarian facilities and assets.

Nearly 100 incidents related to administrative and bureaucratic impediments were reported. As in previous years, there were demands for multiple registrations, arbitrary taxation, interference in procurement, staff recruitment and contract awards, deduction of project funds for monitoring and evaluation, the ban of movement along certain access roads, and clearance of humanitarian supplies at state boundaries and border points, including ports.

Prospects for recovery

Amidst the crisis, Somalia continued to make progress with the establishment of permanent political institutions, paving the way towards a future with greater peace. However, this is yet to translate into an improvement for the majority of Somalis in terms of food security and nutrition, access to safe water, sanitation, health care, protection and other basic services. Another notable progress is the launch of the Drought Impact Needs Assessment at the end of 2017, paving the way towards the long-term recovery, which will require a collective engagement of humanitarian and development actors through 2018 and beyond.",Somalia Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
6,somalia,"Tensions between Somalia and the United Arab Emirates ratcheted up this week as Mogadishu ditched a military deal with its ally and seized millions of dollars in cash from an Emirati plane.

The escalation came after months of building friction in Somalia as the Gulf crisis pitting Arab powers against each other spills over into the fragile state, whose position of neutrality has not gone down well at home or with its allies.

Rashid Abdi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told AFP that while the UAE and Somalia have traditionally been close, and Mogadishu has vowed to remain neutral over the Gulf divisions, the central government is nevertheless ""perceived to be very much pro-Qatar"".

Some of Somalia's federal states were unhappy with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed's neutral stance, and have broken with the official position to side with the UAE.

Diplomatic tensions first spilled into the open in March after the Dubai-based DP World gave Ethiopia a 19% stake in the Berbera port in breakaway Somaliland - whose independence is not recognised by Mogadishu.

Lawmakers in Somalia, which also has a history of animosity with Ethiopia, adopted a resolution accusing the company of having ""intentionally violated the sovereignty of Somalia"".

Tempers have also flared over a military base being built by the UAE in Somaliland.

'Unnecessary tensions'

On Sunday, Somali security forces stormed onto a UAE civilian aircraft at the international airport, and seized $9.6m in cash held in three unmarked bags.



""The security forces noticed the suspicious bags and handed them over to the concerned departments,"" Somalia's security ministry said in a statement.

However the UAE in a statement accused security forces of holding those on the plane ""at gunpoint"", and said the cash had been allocated to support the Somali army and trainees.

""The current Somali government ... is creating unnecessary tensions with a friend and an ally who supported the stability and security of Somalia during its hardest phases,"" tweeted UAE state minister for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash.

""We call for wisdom and reason"".

Just days later, on Wednesday, Somalia's defence ministry announced it was taking over the management of hundreds of Somali troops who had been trained by the UAE.

The UAE has been running a military camp in Mogadishu where it trains Somali soldiers, who are also paid by Emirati officials.

""As a government, our responsibility is to take care of our armed forces and pay their wages and not to delegate that responsibility to others. We thank the UAE for the training and relentless support it provided,"" Defence Minister Mohamed Mursal told a local news agency.

Experts describe the bloated and largely ineffective Somali army as more a collection of clan militias, with various international militaries providing poorly-coordinated training to different units.

The security of the country, battling the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab extremists, has largely been propped up by AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping force, which is due to withdraw by 2020.

'Vulnerable and weak'

The 10-month Gulf crisis pits Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain against Qatar - which has been accused by its rivals of fostering close links with Tehran and supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar denies the charges.

With close geographic, political, economic and cultural ties with the Gulf, observers warn the Horn of Africa is facing heightened instability as countries come under pressure to pick sides while Arab powers jockey for political influence.

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the 1991 overthrow of president Siad Barre's military regime which ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict.

Abdi warned the Gulf crisis could have a ""serious destabilising impact on Somalia.""

""There's no doubt that the Gulf crisis has spilled over into the Horn. Now countries which are strong can manage this war, but Somalia is very vulnerable and very weak,"" he said.

7,somalia,"It was 1991 when Somali President Siad Barre was ousted, catapulting the country into disarray and prompting emboldened warlords to cleave the country apart.

Although an internationally-backed government was established in 2012 following interventions by Ethiopia and the African Union, the country remains fractured – bedevilled by humanitarian crises and a protracted struggle against Al Shabab militants.

In practice, the authority of the central government does not extend far beyond the capital, Mogadishu. It is within this context that Somalia’s recent row with the UAE should be dissected.

Ten months have passed since the Arab quartet of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar. Hugely reliant on foreign investment and aid, Somalia has imported the crisis.

On April 8, amid rising tension, Somali security forces stormed a UAE jet at Mogadishu airport, seizing $9.6 million (Dh35.3 million) in cash destined for the Puntland Maritime Police Force, an anti-piracy unit of the Somali army backed since 2014 by the Emirates.

In response to the breach of diplomatic protocol, the UAE abruptly ended its military training programme in Somalia. Sheikh Zayed hospital in Mogadishu suspended operations.

Immediately thereafter, Qatar donated 30 buses and two cranes to Mogadishu regional officials. “That is not coincidental,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project director at the International Crisis Group (ICG).

The gesture is emblematic of international pressures weighing on Somalia, thanks to pre-existing relationships and its proximity to the Gulf.

Turkey operates a military base of epic proportions in Mogadishu, whose lucrative port is run by Al Bayrak, a Turkish corporation. Ankara was an early investor in Somalia, though analysts say popular support for Turkey’s presence is dwindling.

Turkey's ally, Qatar, whose airline immediately used Somali airspace when the boycott began last year, has sought to involve itself in Somali politics, according to Faisal Roble, a leading Somalia expert.

Saudi Arabia, which imports 80 per cent of Somalia’s livestock, donated $50m in 2016 after Mogadishu severed ties with Iran. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed visited Riyadh less than a fortnight after his inauguration last year for his first official trip.

Meanwhile, the UAE, which has been training and paying the salaries of 2,407 Somali troops, is most active in the autonomous region of Puntland, whose government yesterday appealed to the Emirates to remain engaged.

“There is a common understanding that Puntland doesn’t get the support it requires from the government,” said Mr Abdi. But the involvement of international players “has driven a wedge between Mogadishu and the different regional states,” he added.

As Somalia’s fortunes have faltered in recent years, economic imperatives have compelled its regions to accept aid and investment from different players. After the Gulf dispute, such investment brought into question the central government’s promise to remain neutral in the Gulf dispute.

The stunning plane seizure follows months of deteriorating ties between Abu Dhabi and Mogadishu.

Somali politicians reacted with fury to the tripartite deal between Dubai’s DP World, the government of breakaway Somaliland and landlocked Ethiopia over control of a strategic port at Berbera. The UAE is also constructing a military base in Somaliland, just 260 km from war-torn Yemen, which contains Africa’s longest runway.

Somali politicians, powerless to dictate Somaliland affairs, claimed the deal was a violation of its sovereignty.

On the other side, Mogadishu’s failure to disavow Qatar may have caused irritation in the UAE. “There are many people here in the UAE who feel deeply invested in Somalia’s future and stability and are saddened by developments,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior Arabian Peninsula analyst at ICG.

“Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, [health,] shelter and food response in their interventions,” he added.

The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over six million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.

Floods worse than anticipated

The magnitude of rainfall has been much worse than anticipated, said Yngvil Foss, the deputy head at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Somalia.

Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available

– Yngvil Foss, UN aid official

“Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available,” she said, noting that UN relief agencies have been able to raise funding over the past week to scale up critical interventions.

The UN World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, delivered 4.5 million metric tons of medicines and other medical supplies to Belet Weyne, the capital of the hard hit HirShabelle province, on 29 April.

Peacekeeping troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) also evacuated more than 10,000 residents of Belet Weyne from inundated parts of the city as well as providing tarpaulins and water to those affected.

More funding urgently needed

However, more funds are urgently needed to help the increasing numbers of internally-displaced.

Yesterday, Somalia's President, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed “Farmajo” visited flood affected areas and appealed to the international community for urgent humanitarian assistance.

Somalia’s Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018, totalling $1.5 billion (before the floods), is only 19 per cent funded.

Flash and river flooding has affected more than 582,000 people and of these over 200,000 have been displaced from their homes following heavy rains received across the country in April, according to UNHCR-led Protection and Return and Monitoring Network (PRMN).

The Gu rainy season (April – June) started early March with consistent, heavy rains in flood-prone areas of southern and central regions. The Juba and Shabelle basins in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands continued to receive moderate to heavy rains, according to FAOmanaged Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM).

Other central and northern parts of the country are expected to receive moderate to high rains in the first week of May with regions of Puntland being the exception. Overall, rainfall has been above average over broad areas of Somalia and the result has been a rapid increase in river levels causing flash and riverine flooding in many locations.

SWALIM has reported that the probability of floods of this current magnitude is once every fifty years. The Juba and Shabelle rivers have reached bank full levels in several locations causing flooding much earlier in the season than historically observed. Flooding along the two rivers has resulted in the destruction of crops and property and inundation of houses.","Humanitarian Bulletin Somalia, 5 April – 2 May 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/humanitarian-bulletin-somalia-5-april-2-may-2018

The weapons, including new Kalashnikov assault rifles and Chinese versions of them, were stolen by Somali National Army soldiers who had been trained by the UAE at its facility, three Somali men who purchased weapons from the soldiers told Reuters.

The Gulf nation has trained hundreds of Somali troops since 2014 as part of an effort boosted by an African Union military mission to defeat an Islamist insurgency and secure the country for the Somali government, which is backed by Western nations, Turkey and the United Nations.

The UAE ended the program on April 15, shortly after security forces at Mogadishu’s airport seized millions of dollars and temporarily held a UAE plane.

The escalating diplomatic dispute is one aspect of the fallout in volatile Somalia from a crisis in the Gulf region that has spilled into the Horn of Africa.

Somalia’s relations with the UAE are strained by a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia because Mogadishu has refused to take sides. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have strong trading links with and influence in Somalia, offset by the sway of Qatar and its ally Turkey, one of Somalia’s biggest foreign investors.

Neither Somalia nor the UAE is showing urgent interest in resolving their dispute, said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

Somali officials wanted to be seen “standing up” to the UAE, “and the Emirati officials’ position is, ‘If Somalia doesn’t want our money, fine, we’ll take it elsewhere,’” Malley told Reuters in Nairobi after returning from a trip to Mogadishu.

The UAE-trained troops began stealing weapons from the facility shortly after the program was disbanded, the dealers said. The soldiers sold guns directly to the dealers and indirectly via their brokers.

The looting appears to have occurred while the UAE was in the process of emptying its training center.

On Sunday night a ship docked at Mogadishu’s port was loaded with equipment from the UAE’s training center, including several dozen shipping containers of weapons, dozens of armored vehicles fixed with anti-aircraft guns and hundreds of cars, a port staff member told Reuters.

On Monday, gunfire broke out at the former training center where some of the troops were still camped out, and UAE-trained troops who were still there fled with as many weapons as they could, before a rival group took over the facility.

Residents in the area told Reuters they saw UAE-trained forces discarding their military uniforms and fleeing the facility in three-wheeled rickshaws with guns in their laps. [L8N1S0508]

After 90 minutes of sporadic gunfire, the facility was secured by presidential palace guards, a Reuters journalist at the scene said.

UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Officials from Somalia’s defense ministry did not immediately answer phone calls requesting comment on the weapons theft. Defense Minister Mohamed Mursal resigned this week to contest for the vacant position of parliament speaker.

Army commander General Abdiweli Jama Gorod said on Monday that some soldiers who were behind the attempted theft of equipment from the facility had been arrested.

“The Somali national forces now have in hand the few soldiers and officers who were behind today’s incident and we assure we shall bring them before justice,” he said in comments reported by the state-run Somalia News Agency.

Gorod did not answer phone calls on Wednesday afternoon seeking comment.

Due to the diplomatic dispute, the UAE-trained troops are being called “rebels” by some elements of the army, a security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

The dealers showed Reuters five weapons they said they bought from the soldiers. They all bore the marking “SO XDS”, indicating that they belonged to the Somali army.

An arms expert said this was consistent with the previous arrangement between the two countries.

“The weapons belonged to the SNA, which distributed them to the UAE training center. So they are marked SO XDS,” he said.

“About 600 to 700 AK-47 and (other) guns were looted from the former UAE training camps,” weapons dealer Jama Ali told Reuters, speaking from a home in Mogadishu where he and two other men presented the weapons.

Ali said they purchased the weapons for $700, a significant discount on the current price of $1,350 in Mogadishu for a new Kalashnikov. The dealers then began last night reselling the weapons at $1,000 each, he said.

“The best day for business is when there is government infighting,” said Hassan Abuja, another dealer. “Prices of weapons and ammunition go up.”","Exclusive: Weapons stolen from UAE training facility in Somalia, sold on open market",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-arms/exclusive-weapons-stolen-from-uae-training-facility-in-somalia-sold-on-open-market-idUSKBN1HW26I

UNICEF and partners have treated 54,071 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 2018. This is 19 per cent higher than the same time last year, at the peak of the pre-famine response - highlighting the continuing trend of critical levels of acute malnutrition in country.

UNICEF continues to deliver large-scale integrated basic nutrition services package (BNSP) throughout the country, providing curative and preventive care.

As part of the ongoing national measles vaccination campaign, after successful completion of the campaign in Puntland in January, UNICEF and partners conducted measles campaigns in March in central and southern regions of Somalia, and Somaliland. 2,734,941 children between six months and 10 years were vaccinated (102 per cent of the targeted 2,693,928). Since the start of the year, 4,067 suspected measles cases were reported – 72 percent being children under-five.

During the month of March, the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism verified 317 cases of grave violations affecting 302 children (69 girls) mostly through abduction (158), killing/maiming (89) and child recruitment and use by armed forces and groups (70).

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical due to ongoing impacts of drought, displacement and conflict. As per the FSNAU-FEWSNET 2017 Post Deyr findings, 5.4 million people are still in need of urgent assistance, including 2.8 million children. Malnutrition rates across Somalia are among the worst in the world. Currently, nearly 301,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, including 48,000 who are severely malnourished and face death if urgent treatment is not provided; in total about 1.2 million children under five are projected to be malnourished in 2018 and of them, 232,000 expected to be suffering from life threatening malnutrition. Over 4.4 million people need humanitarian WASH services, with 3.5 out of 5 people without adequate water to meet basic needs. More than 5.7 million people require basic health services, including critical needs in maternal and child health, as one in seven Somali children die before the age of five. Disease outbreaks such as acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera and measles continue to represent a major threat to children, with over 1,764 cases of AWD/cholera (56 per cent children under 5) and 4,313 cases of suspected measles reported in 2018. Over 3 million children, out of 4.9 million in country, are estimated to be out of school. More than 2.1 million people have been displaced, including over 1 million in the last year alone; and displacement flows continue at critical levels into areas such as Baidoa in Bay Region, which has received an average of 700 new arrivals per week since mid-January, 2018. Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups continue to exacerbate high levels of acute humanitarian needs. More than 76 percent of recorded gender-based violence (GBV) survivors are reported to be from IDP communities. Grave violations against children continue at worrying rates, with abductions, recruitment and use, and killing/maiming reported as the primary concerns.",UNICEF Somalia Humanitarian Situation Report #3: 1-31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/unicef-somalia-humanitarian-situation-report-3-1-31-march-2018
13,somalia,"To many people across the world, charcoal is a basic commodity that improves their livelihood. They not only use it for their domestic use but also as a source of income.

However, in Somalia, the commodity has been a source of conflict and strife.

Somalia and Land

According to a report by the UN, Somalia National Programme for the United Nations Convention to combat desertification, there is a great connection between the people of Somalia and their land.

The community is largely nomadic, moving from one place to another to search for pasture for their animals.

Historically, the lands were sustainable this way because, by moving from one pasture to the next, the community would allow the grassland to naturally regenerate.

But over time, with the replacement of people and donkeys carrying goods by trucks, the demand for food and consumable products increased leading to further degradation of land.

Enter the “Black Gold”

The degradation of land was further enhanced by the increased production of charcoal as an economic option. It was also the main source of energy.

The civil war of 1991 and the breakdown of state institutions resulted into the unsustainable use, trade and production of charcoal, which had been banned in the country in 1969.

The trade was taken up by militias and illegal groups such as al Shabaab, which has control of political power and economic resources within the region.

According to statistics, 98 percent of Somali people use charcoal in their homes, but a high percentage of the charcoal production is meant for export to neighbouring countries as well as the Gulf region.

The increased demand for charcoal locally and regionally has led to the proliferation of land and resource, thus leading to scarcity. It has also contributed to the increased risk of drought (Somalia only has two rainy seasons in a year) and the resultant flooding due to lack of vegetation cover.

Conflict

The decreased resource has fueled different forms of conflicts and violence within the region.

For starters, there has been an ongoing conflict between clans over land use, leading to escalated violence when it comes to entitlement to the development and use of resources. The other manifestation of violence happens at border areas, where political rivalry and grazing rights interlink.

According to the report on Somalia of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea, al Shabaab requires extensive labour in their production and trade of charcoal. In 2017, the militia group recruited children in various regions, going to the extent of abducting elders, teachers and family members. In the end, families were forced to flee or send their children to safer zones.

In 2015, for example, 2,009 deaths were recorded in South Central Somalia region.

The charcoal industry is considered one of the most lucrative in the region, earning traders as much as $120 million in exports. Al Shabaab and other militant groups make more than $10 million a year, resulting to an even increased effort to control the charcoal stockpiles.

Environmental Concerns

Aside from the loss of human lives and the violence, charcoal production has affected the environment in different ways.

According to Peter de Clercq, the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, 8.2 million trees were cut down between 2011 and 2017 to make charcoal.

“Every 30 seconds, a tree is cut down to make charcoal in this country,” he said at the 2018 International Conference on Charcoal in Mogadishu on Monday.

The conference was held to address the issue of unsustainable charcoal use, production and trade in Somalia.

Somalia’s deputy prime minister, Mahdi Mohamed Guuleed, expressed the commitment of the government to address the charcoal problem in various ways including looking for alternative sources of energy to replace charcoal as well as adopt and implement regulation of the product.

“[we’ll also] provide alternative sources of livelihood for the people and implement reforestation and restorative environmental programs,” Guuleed said.",How this basic commodity is fuelling conflict and violence in Somalia,https://face2faceafrica.com/article/how-this-basic-commodity-is-fuelling-conflict-and-violence-in-somalia
14,somalia,"Background

The Water Price Monitoring assessment aims to establish a data collection, monitoring and reporting system on water market prices in order to allow humanitarian and development actors to better analyse humanitarian needs in areas particularly affected by drought.

March data collection in Lower Shabelle was conducted through a quantitative survey between 30 - 31 March, focusing only on those water points in the region that are charging for water. The assessment has followed the official district boundaries of the region.

All prices are shown in US Cents for 90L of water. This is the daily amount used by a household of six members, consuming the minimum Sphere standard of 15L water per person per day. Price changes are subject to exchange rate.

Key Findings

• This factsheet presents information collected from 36 water points in Afgooye District, Lower Shabelle Region.

• Prices of water in Lower Shabelle reportedly increased by an average of 9% from February to March.

• The majority (58%) of assessed water points showed no change in price from February to March. Thirty-one percent (31%) showed an increase in price mainly due to more households accessing these water points, while 11% showed a decrease in price mainly due to an increase in water supply following ongoing rains.

• The majority (69%) of assessed water points in Lower Shabelle reportedly have their water treated at the distribution point. The majority of these (84%) have it treated though chlorination, while 16% have it treated through aquatabs.","Somalia Drought Crisis - Water Price Monitoring: Lower Shabelle Region, Somalia, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-drought-crisis-water-price-monitoring-lower-shabelle-region-somalia-march
15,somalia,"The Gulf impasse caused political turmoil in the African country, with its central government aligning with Qatar and the federal states drifting towards the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The crisis has begun to challenge the country's territorial integrity.

On the evening of May 23, 2017, a quotation appeared on the bottom of Qatar’s official news channel, attributed to the Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani. “Iran,” it said, “is an Islamic power in the region that cannot be ignored.”

In spite of Thani’s insistence that the quotations were fakes, they were the pretext for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to drive a wedge through the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and several other Arab countries blockaded Qatar, sent Qatari nationals home, and broke off diplomatic relations. Leaders from around the world scrambled to mend the rift, foreseeing the likelihood that it might have a negative impact if it spilt over into other countries.

According to Omar Mahmoud, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, Somalia is one those countries – “as Somalia has imported the Gulf crisis,” he says.

The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), has taken a similar stand to many other countries, supporting the Kuwaiti initiative to broker dialogue between the quarrelling GCC states. But Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken an uncompromising stand, lobbying other countries to follow them in a wider attempt to politically isolate Qatar.

The FGS’s awkward neutrality, however, has been interpreted as a “vote for Qatar,” according to Mahmoud, pitting the central government against its member states.

The state leaders have voiced concerns about their ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, aligning themselves more closely with this grouping.

The issue came to the fore when Dubai-based shipping company DP World reached an agreement with the self-declared Republic of Somaliland.

The two parties signed a 25-year lease on the northern port of Berbera, sidestepping Mogadishu to secure the deal. The federal government views the deal as a violation of Somalia’s territorial integrity and constitution.

The UAE, which initiated and brokered the deal, kept 51 percent stake in the Berbera port project; Somaliland kept 30 percent and Ethiopia, having expressed its desire to take part in the project, secured 19 percent.

Somalia's federal government responded by declaring the agreement null and void and took the issue before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Abubakr Osman, Somalia’s Permanent Representative to the UN said the UAE’s plan was a “clear violation of international law.”

“Every company which wants to invest in Somalia must follow the due process as laid down by the law,” President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo” Mohamed told the Somali Parliament.

The deal for Berbera port, the government maintains, is illegal, as foreign affairs are primarily the domain of the central government in Mogadishu, according to the Somali constitution.

But following two decades of weak central governance, Mogadishu has little direct say in the affairs of regional state administrations, including Somaliland, which has declared total independence and doesn’t recognise the sovereignty of Mogadishu over its territories.

The UAE, Mahmoud says, “at times bypassed Mogadishu, and reached out to member states.” Mahmoud adds that this is the case not just in Somaliland, but “also Bosaso, Puntland,” where another Dubai-based company manages the main commercial port.

“So, the question becomes to what extent is the UAE working with Mogadishu on these agreements,” he tells TRT World.

Well, to what extent does the UAE need to?

“We need development, and no sane individual or leader will object to that,” Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, president of Puntland, said following a visit to Dubai. “That is why the support of the UAE is so important,” he continued.

At both the federal and, especially, at the regional level, Somalia’s ties to the Gulf run deep.

Between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, diasporic Somalis sent roughly $35 million in remittances back to Somalia in 2017. Two-thirds of livestock exports, which constitute roughly 40 percent of Somalia’s GDP, have their biggest market in Saudi Arabia. The UAE also finances infrastructure projects, trains and equips troops in the regional administrations as well as donating significant amounts of aid.

When the federal government in Mogadishu refused to be strong-armed into breaking with Qatar, the federal member states – whose multifaceted relationships with the Gulf are vital – broke with the federal government, expressing their solidarity with the Emirati position.

Somaliland, Puntland, South West, Hirshabelle and Galmudug showed their support for the Emirati- Saudi-led blockade by following their lead.

“The federal member states are arguing that a relationship with the UAE and Saudi Arabia would be much more beneficial than losing that and maintaining a relationship with Qatar,” says Mahmoud. “And that’s argued on a number of fronts. Economically, in terms of remittances, in terms of livestock, infrastructure development; so economically there is a big incentive there.”

The DP World agreement in Berbera, for example, operated with a view to expanding the capacity for livestock to be exported from that port. The UAE has also been paying the salaries of the Puntland Maritime Police Force since 2011. When Galmudug broke with Somalia's central government, it cited its “commercial relationship”, “sustainable development” and the “security” support provided by the UAE when explaining its decision.

The combination of a lack of strong central control, and the economic considerations of regional administrations appears to have been enough incentive for them to diverge from the central government on this matter.

As Gulf states jockey for influence, Somalia is increasingly caught in the crosshairs. But tensions between the UAE and Somalia reached a new high when Somali security authorities seized $9.6 million, which arrived in Somalia from Abu Dhabi Airport.

Though Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi, UAE ambassador to Somalia maintained that the money was intended for the Somali Ministry of Defense to contribute to the salaries of Somali troops, a Somali official insisted it was almost 10 times the expected amount, raising suspicions about what the cash was intended for.

The seizure resulted in a standoff that lasted for several hours between airport officials and Emirati officers. ( Feisal Omar/ Reuters )

An investigation followed to determine if the money was intended to “destabilise” the country.

Abdiwahab Sheikh Abdisamad, a Nairobi-based senior consultant at Southlink Consultancy, tells TRT World that because the “central government cannot control the entire region, the UAE has taken advantage of that vulnerability.”

“Somalia has become a theatre in this conflict,” he continued. He believes avoiding the central government to work directly with the regional administrations will undermine progress made to stabilise Somalia and create “further divisions.”

The UAE has responded by closing Sheikh Zayed Hospital, which used to provide free treatment for the residents of Mogadishu and soon after ended its military training mission in Somalia.

“They [the UAE] don’t have consideration for the constitution of Somalia, they don’t consider the rules and regulations of Somalia, nor do they consider the situation on the ground,” Abdisamad said, which is why he believes that the attempt by President Mohamed to distance Somalia from the UAE is an encouraging attempt to show the sovereignty of the centre.

His stance inspired young Somalis globally, who initiated the #UAEhandsoffSomalia and #Somalia_speaks hashtags.

Don't come in through the window, come in through the door. #UAEhandsOffSomalia — Abdi Addow 🕊 (@AbdiAddow1) April 9, 2017

The last time the Gulf states requested Somalia cut ties with another country was 2016, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud cut ties with Iran. President Mohamud’s government received $50 million from Saudi Arabia that day in aid – spoils earned for his eager cooperation.

In this case, the stakes are higher, as Qatar is a valued partner of the FGS, alongside Qatar’s ally Turkey, which has provided an unparalleled level of support to the FGS.

Both relations with the Saudi-UAE-led coalition and Qatar and Turkey are important for Somalia, “but when Somalia recognised that the money coming from the UAE was meant for other purposes than supporting the Somali military, Somalia acted accordingly,” Abdisamad said.

Somalia as a whole and the FGS, in particular, have made great progress in recreating a degree of normalcy in the country. At this very delicate stage, the Somali government, according to Abdisamad, has judged it needs more friends than enemies.

But as the Somali government becomes increasingly bold at determining its foreign policy, the country is also finding its bearings in determining which countries it prefers warm relations with.

“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia,"" he said, ""are much more important today than the financial assistance being provided by the UAE.”
