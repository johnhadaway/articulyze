Soumaila T. Diarra

BAMAKO, Mali — A militia in Mali claims it found the vehicle used by four American soldiers killed in an ambush by Islamist militants in neighboring Niger last fall. The discovery indicates how fighters linked to the Islamic State likely traveled between the two countries.

As the militia of ethnic Tuareg soldiers discuss how to return the vehicle to U.S. authorities, the Islamic State is pushing deeper into this poor, West African country and raising fears of more violence.

Mali's minister of foreign affairs, Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly, said he was concerned that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, would redeploy to Africa as the U.S-led coalition quashes the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria.

""The current momentum in the Middle East can have consequences for the stability of Mali"" and the surrounding region here, Coulibaly said.

Mali already has an active chapter of al-Qaeda, which drove a car bomb into a military base near Timbuktu on April 14, killing a United Nations peacekeeper and wounding seven French soldiers.

""Three days don’t go by without hearing the news of an assassination by the terrorists,” said Hamady Touré, a commercial spice salesman. “The worst thing is that vehicles carrying civilians drive on explosive devices that the terrorists place.”

Those concerns mount despite an international response to the terrorist threat in Mali. The U.N. sent 15,000 peacekeepers to Mali five years ago. France has 4,000 troops in this former French colony. Five nearby countries — Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger — created a joint force of 5,000 troops to secure their borders against militants.

The Tuareg militia that claims it found the Americans’ four-wheel-drive Toyota in March also said it is an important defense against ISIS.

“The main target of these armed terrorists is none other than the local authorities and religious leaders,” said Fahad Almahmoud, a Tuareg militia spokesman.

The Tuareg soldiers are now allies of Mali’s government, but until three years ago they fought against the regime for an independent country.

Tiébilé Dramé, an opposition politician, said the government shouldn’t depend on militias and needs to do more. He said more terrorists appear to be moving into Mali despite the international help, so ordinary citizens see little reason to believe in their leaders.

""The fault is the current governance is bad,” Dramé said. “More than 500 schools are closed in the center of the country because of poor security.”

Mali's security situation has been precarious the past several years. In November 2015, heavily armed gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, the Mali capital, killing 20 people. A year ago, several local extremist groups announced they had banded into a bigger organization affiliated with al-Qaeda.

A U.N. report in March said the militias here have too much power. The report said the Tuaregs and another militia allied with the Malian government conducted extra-judicial executions, made illegal arrests, recruited child soldiers and had other human rights violations in northern Mali.

“It is necessary that both the government and the armed groups investigate serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law,"" said Mongi Hamdi, a U.N. special representative in Mali when the report was published. “This is in the interest of victims’ rights and for the reconciliation and establishment of a lasting peace in Mali.”

In the south, Mali's army and the Dozo — traditional armed hunters who act as an independent defense force — have been accused of similar abuses against the Fulani ethnic community, a Muslim group often loyal to extremists.

""The Malian army is making summary executions of civilians suspected of terrorism,” said Nouhoum Cissé, a member of a Fulani defense organization. When a Fulani appears in the central part of the country, ""you can be suspected of terrorism,” he said.

Malians and Fulanis lived together in harmony for centuries but are now poised to kill each other, Cissé said. He said terror attacks have also driven the indigenous Dogon people to create self-defense militias. Dogon and Fulani groups have clashed as a result.

“The question is who benefits from this situation. It does not benefit the Dogon. It does not benefit the Fulani,” Cissé said. “Those who benefit are the terrorist groups.”

Chad is a low-income, land-locked country that suffers from chronic food insecurity due to the effects of regional conflict, frequent drought, lack of income-generating opportunities and limited access to social services. An estimated 4.4 million people in Chad require humanitarian assistance, according to the UN.

More than 510,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) reside in Chad as a result of ongoing conflict in the region, primarily in the Central African Republic (CAR), Nigeria and Sudan. The influx of Chadian returnees from conflict-affected countries also strains local resources and contributes to increased food insecurity among vulnerable communities.","Chad: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - Updated April 18, 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-food-assistance-fact-sheet-updated-april-18-2018

The new arrivals add to some 24,000 Malian refugees who have found refuge in Burkina Faso since the eruption of conflict in Mali in 2012. The new arrivals living in makeshift shelters are to be relocated to safer areas. The refugees urgently need basic relief items and long-term support, especially the youth.

4,chad+country,"GENEVA / N’DJAMENA (30 April 2018) – The UN Working Group on mercenaries has called for more financial and other resources to stop armed conflict in Chad and surrounding countries and to put an end to human rights abuses committed by multiple actors, some of whom are foreign fighters and alleged mercenaries.

The abuses identified include killings and torture. More resources will help millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the fighting, they said.

In a statement at the end of a nine-day visit to the country the UN experts said the activities of armed groups, including Boko Haram, have provoked a huge humanitarian crisis and it is essential for human rights to be put at the centre of efforts to combat them.

“Boko Haram has destroyed communities that have lived and obtained their livelihoods in the Lake Chad region for many years. They have killed around 30,000 people, caused the internal displacement of around two million others and left around 10 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance,” said Patricia Arias, a member of the Working Group delegation.

“Scores of human rights abuses including killings, torture and abductions have been inflicted on the local population, including women and children. Women have been subjected to sexual violence and used as suicide bombers,” she said.

“The Lake Chad region, which is now the centre of Boko Haram attacks and violence, is the site of a humanitarian crisis that affects not only Chad but neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. But the entire country is also challenged by a number of armed conflicts in which foreign fighters and mercenaries are engaged,” she added.

The experts said many people were forcibly recruited into Boko Haram, including nationals of the countries bordering Lake Chad. However, they noted that mercenaries from countries outside the region had also joined the group, reportedly to provide training.

The UN experts say understanding the motivations of people joining extremist groups and engaging in mercenary activities is critical. More than half of the population of Chad are under 18 years old, and about 40 percent live in poverty.

“With such a high poverty rate there are serious risks of young people joining groups like Boko Haram and Daesh for financial and material gains, and in the Lake Chad region, where some of the poorest and most marginalised communities are, the risk is even higher,” said Ms Arias.

However, the Working Group made clear that the security threat was not only focused on the Lake Chad region. In the north, the conflict involving Daesh in Libya had heightened concerns particularly after its recent alliance with elements of Boko Haram.

In the east, the conflict in Sudan had resulted in an influx of thousands of refugees into Chad, while to the south violence in the Central African Republic had had the same effect. During our visit we heard Chad described as “an island surrounded by an ocean of wars”, the experts noted.

“Trans-border criminal activities by armed groups are rampant in parts of the country known as ‘no man’s land’, which are vast open areas that provide routes for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.”

As a result of the violence and armed conflicts, Chad is now hosting more than 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, around 70,000 Chadian citizens have returned mostly from the Central African Republic and are gathered at sites around the country, including N’Djamena.

“The humanitarian situation coupled with security threats is simply overwhelming,” said Saeed Mokbil, another member of the Working Group. “The 2015 suicide bombings by Boko Haram and incidents of internal armed rebellion in N’Djamena have also highlighted the volatile situation in the country,” he stressed.

“Security measures are therefore imperative, but they must be implemented in line with human rights standards. This includes ensuring people arrested for their alleged connection with armed groups like Boko Haram are not held without due process. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure human rights; including fair trial guarantees for detainees in places like Koro Toro are fully respected.

“Promoting development, alleviating poverty, building peace and social cohesion are important in providing durable solutions for the local population. These all require strong regional and international support. Humanitarian agencies seriously need more resources and funding in order to carry out critical programmes to support affected populations,” said Mr. Mokbil.

The Working Group commended positive initiatives by the Chadian authorities, including the ratification of the OAU Convention on the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa. A new penal code adopted last year includes a specific provision criminalising mercenarism. But, so far, there have been no prosecutions under it.

The delegation members held meetings in N’Djamena and visited the returnee and refugee site at Gaoui. They met Government representatives, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organisations and victims of human rights abuses.

The Working Group will present a full report on the findings of its visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

Full statement in French and English

The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination was established in July 2005 by the then Commission on Human Rights. Its mandate was further extended by the Human Rights Council in 2008. The Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world. The Chairperson-Rapporteur is Mr. Gabor Rona (United States of America). Other members are Ms. Elzbieta Karska (Poland) Ms. Patricia Arias (Chile), Mr. Anton Katz (South Africa), and Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen).

The Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

Over 3,000 children from Jebel Marra assisted to take Grade 8 examinations.

The UN commemorated the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action on 4 April.

First convoy of Sudanese refugees from Chad

For the last 15 years, Adam El-Nour Abakar, 45 years old, was in exile in Chad. Last week, Adam and his family returned to their home in Kebkabiya village, in North Darfur with their five Children, all of whom were born in Chad.

“I’m so happy to return to my country with my family. I really feel comfortable and content. I cannot thank UNHCR and the Governments of Chad and Sudan enough for facilitating our return to Sudan,” said Abakar, with a deep sigh.

Adam and his family are part of a first convoy of 53 Sudanese refugees, who returned to Sudan from eastern Chad on 14 April, after more than a decade in exile. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the Commissioner of Refugees (COR), Hamad El-Gizouli, welcomed the returning Sudanese refugees at the reception centre in Tina, North Darfur. Besides three months of food rations, the returnees were provided with a reintegration package and transportation of personal belongings and livestock to their home villages in North Darfur. The return follows the signing of a Tripartite Voluntary Repatriation Agreement in Khartoum on 31 May 2017, between the Governments of Sudan and Chad and UNHCR. Mr. El-Gizouli described the return as a historic moment. He reiterated the importance the Sudanese Government attaches to the voluntary return of refugees, and the hope that these returnees will be able to rebuild their lives as Sudanese citizens.

Sudan and Chad—with assistance from UNHCR and its partners—plan to repatriate 20,000 refugees from Chad this year. At least 300,000 Sudanese refugees are in Chad, many of whom fled Sudan following the conflicts in Darfur between 2003 and 2004. With the new stability and improved general security in Darfur, many have indicated an interest in returning, according to UNHCR.

7,chad+country,"Oxfam is inherently hypocritical. The core pillar of the humanitarian principle, humanity, emphasizes that the goal of aid should be to alleviate human suffering. As opposed to carrying out the supposedly humanitarian goals of its mission, Oxfam directly perpetuates human suffering. If a humanitarian organization is unable to fulfill its core mandate, that agency must be held accountable for its actions. For that reason, donors must reduce their funding of organizations that are guilty of abuse in crises.

The pattern of sexual exploitation and abuse in the humanitarian sphere has persisted for decades. In 2016, World Vision reported 10 incidents of “sexual exploitation or abuse of a child.” In 2002, Save the Children and the UNHCR investigated abuse. Out of a total of 1,500 surveyed, researchers documented 67 allegations of abuse, some of which included “trading humanitarian commodities and services … in exchange for sex with girls under 18.” Other reports documented cases where children traded “sex with aid workers and peacekeepers in exchange for food” and carried out “lesbian sexual displays.” UN peacekeepers are also part of the problem, causally using the term “peacekeeper babies” for children of native women they impregnate. Clearly this problem has persisted without resolution, and is not a singular, isolated incident.

Within Oxfam specifically, the individual actors that perpetrated the abuse were previously on record for sexual exploitation. The organization admits that Roland van Hauwermeiren, the Oxfam country director in Haiti, “[hired] sex workers in Chad in 2006 — the year that hundreds of thousands of refugees from a genocidal war in Sudan created a public health crisis in Chad.” After being allowed to serve as Haiti’s country director even though Oxfam was aware of the atrocities in Chad, van Hauwermeiren and other aid workers ran a self-proclaimed “whorehouse,” where “girls [wore] Oxfam T-shirts, running around half-naked.” On top of that, Oxfam tried to cover up the scandal by limiting the investigation into van Hauwermeiren. The evidence clearly incriminates Oxfam as an organization. Not only did the organization ignore previous inhumane actions, it tried to hide the evidence.

It is indisputable that Oxfam authorities were completely aware of the atrocities committed by the country director for Haiti. Deputy Chief Executive Penny Lawrence resigned earlier this year, feeling “ashamed” and taking “full responsibility.” Whatever shred of legitimacy came with the argument that this was an isolated incident unknown to the leaders of the organization is gone. These heinous facts demand immediate change within the humanitarian sphere.

The cluster system, a method for organizing aid by creating general categories such as health and shelter, and the institutions backing it continue to grapple with the concept of accountability. Sanctions against poor practices by humanitarian actors are rarely implemented. A variety of watchdog organizations, such as Report the Abuse — dissolved in 2017 — and Code Blue, have been formed to curb abuse but have failed to yield significant results. In the words of the founder of Code Blue, Paula Donovan: ""the world was horrified for a short period of time. Aid groups would say it's terrible, we're going to strengthen our systems and everybody is appeased.” Empty rhetoric and investigative bureaucracy will not bring about any more change than it already has.

Cutting funding to aid organizations who perpetuate human rights abuses is the solution to this problem. The argument that reducing the donations to major NGOs like Oxfam will only hurt the recipients of aid is an unsubstantiated ploy to keep control in the grasp of the “Humanitarian Club,” a group of humanitarian actors composed of the UN and the most powerful international NGOs. There are plenty of local NGOs working on sustainable grassroots efforts to relieve burdened populations. At the moment, these groups receive less than 0.6 percent of global aid. Increasingly, global humanitarian crises are becoming more complex, and the major actors are unable to respond to every situation. Local groups are uniquely able to respond quickly to disasters and shape each response in a culturally sensitive fashion.

Following humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence, aid workers in the field consider accountability the fifth humanitarian principle, and it is intrinsic in these groups’ responses, as they are part of the communities they seek to help. The humanitarian system should focus on transitioning funding away from larger groups that have a record of exploitation towards localized efforts. Humanitarian experts have called for the empowerment of local organizations for some time. Punishing bad actors is the perfect opportunity to support others who have demonstrated a commitment to long-term sustainability and development efforts.

Overall, the facts are clear. Major aid organizations are not doing enough to eliminate exploitation of impacted communities. There is a recurring trend of abuse by humanitarian workers against local populations. The system must find a way to punish these sorts of behaviors. Funding, the instrument that is necessary for the existence of these organizations, can be used as a powerful tool to initiate real change. If Oxfam is faced with the question of its own survival, it will definitely investigate the root of the problem and launch reforms that it has neglected in the past.

Operational Context

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

The experts said many people were forcibly recruited into Boko Haram, including nationals of the countries bordering Lake Chad. However, they noted that mercenaries from countries outside the region had also joined the group, reportedly to provide training.

The UN experts say understanding the motivations of people joining extremist groups and engaging in mercenary activities is critical. More than half of the population of Chad are under 18 years old, and about 40 percent live in poverty.

'With such a high poverty rate there are serious risks of young people joining groups like Boko Haram and Daesh for financial and material gains, and in the Lake Chad region, where some of the poorest and most marginalised communities are, the risk is even higher, said Ms Arias.

However, the Working Group made clear that the security threat was not only focused on the Lake Chad region. In the north, the conflict involving Daesh in Libya had heightened concerns particularly after its recent alliance with elements of Boko Haram.

In the east, the conflict in Sudan had resulted in an influx of thousands of refugees into Chad, while to the south violence in the Central African Republic had had the same effect. During our visit we heard Chad described as 'an island surrounded by an ocean of wars, the experts noted.

'Trans-border criminal activities by armed groups are rampant in parts of the country known as ‘no man's land', which are vast open areas that provide routes for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.

As a result of the violence and armed conflicts, Chad is now hosting more than 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, around 70,000 Chadian citizens have returned mostly from the Central African Republic and are gathered at sites around the country, including N'Djamena.

'The humanitarian situation coupled with security threats is simply overwhelming, said Saeed Mokbil, another member of the Working Group. 'The 2015 suicide bombings by Boko Haram and incidents of internal armed rebellion in N'Djamena have also highlighted the volatile situation in the country, he stressed.

'Security measures are therefore imperative, but they must be implemented in line with human rights standards. This includes ensuring people arrested for their alleged connection with armed groups like Boko Haram are not held without due process. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure human rights; including fair trial guarantees for detainees in places like Koro Toro are fully respected.

'Promoting development, alleviating poverty, building peace and social cohesion are important in providing durable solutions for the local population. These all require strong regional and international support. Humanitarian agencies seriously need more resources and funding in order to carry out critical programmes to support affected populations, said Mr. Mokbil.

The Working Group commended positive initiatives by the Chadian authorities, including the ratification of the OAU Convention on the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa. A new penal code adopted last year includes a specific provision criminalising mercenarism. But, so far, there have been no prosecutions under it.

The delegation members held meetings in N'Djamena and visited the returnee and refugee site at Gaoui. They met Government representatives, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organisations and victims of human rights abuses.

The Working Group will present a full report on the findings of its visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

Operational Updates","WFP Chad Country Brief, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/wfp-chad-country-brief-february-2018
13,chad+country,"Just days after President Donald Trump said he wanted to pull American troops out of Syria, the United States, with the help of France and the United Kingdom, launched airstrikes on three sites in the western side of the country. The operation lasted one night and was meant to both punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians and prevent such attacks from happening again in the future. Trump wasted little time in declaring “mission accomplished,” but the reality is that it will have little effect on the outcome of the complex Syrian conflict, now in its seventh year with no end in sight. The airstrikes—and Trump’s own justifications for them—exposed the hypocrisy of current U.S. policy toward refugees, specifically those from Syria.

Trump blamed “Animal Assad” for the attack, and Russia and Iran for backing the Syrian president in creating a “humanitarian disaster.” And in deciding how the United States would respond militarily, Trump said at a Cabinet meeting, “We’re talking about humanity. And it can’t be allowed to happen.” It was a rare acknowledgment by Trump of a humanitarian crisis in Syria at the hands of its president, as well as the vulnerable people dying. But if Trump really cared for their safety—or, as he put it, their humanity—there’s another, incredibly easy way to help: he can admit more Syrian refugees into the United States.

That’s hardly happening right now. Since the start of the year, the United States has resettled just 11 refugees from Syria, according to State Department data. Last year, 3,024 were allowed into the United States. And in 2016, the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, the United States resettled 15,479 Syrian refugees. All of these figures are a drop in the bucket when compared to the 5.6 million Syrians who have fled their country since the start of the war. Most are still in the Middle East with hardly any chance of being resettled to a third country. But still, the United States was just ramping up its Syrian refugee admissions when Trump’s travel ban—implemented in the first week of his presidency in January 2017—shut the door on them.

The travel ban has been through three iterations, each with varying restrictions for refugees and travelers from select countries, most of them majority Muslim. The third ban, for which the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on April 25, does not deal with refugees per se; still, it bars nearly all people from six countries, including Syria. (Chad was removed from the list last month.) Separately, in October, Trump implemented new vetting rules, effectively halting the entry of refugees from 11 countries deemed as “high risk.” Just what that extra vetting entails is unclear, but refugee resettlement groups have blamed it for the very low arrival figures.

Under Trump, the United States has also lowered its annual, overall refugee admissions ceiling from Obama’s high of 85,000 in 2016 to just 45,000. Because of the new restrictions, the actual number of admissions will likely come in closer to 21,000, the International Rescue Committee says.

It’s as if the Trump administration doesn’t believe there’s a refugee crisis — or doesn’t believe the United States has any obligation to take in any refugees. Still, there’s at least some acknowledgment by administration officials of their suffering. Defense Secretary James Mattis recently told the House Armed Services Committee, “I’ve seen refugees from Asia to Europe, Kosovo to Africa. I’ve never seen refugees as traumatized as coming out of Syria. It’s got to end.”

Until that happens, the Trump administration needs to be more transparent about what the new vetting measures entail, so that refugees awaiting approval to come to the United States—a process which can take two years or longer—have some chance at surmounting it. It is also important that the United States grant more visa waivers to refugees, who have already been through a thorough vetting process. The Supreme Court justices on April 25 asked the government’s attorney whether the visa waiver process under the travel ban was little more than “window dressing.” He responded it wasn’t. If that’s true, more refugees should be allowed into the country despite the ban.

Of course, letting in more Syrians will do nothing to end the war. But neither will limited military actions like those Trump took recently. If Trump’s tweets on Syrians’ humanity are to be taken at face value, it’s clear he and other members of the administration feel some responsibility for their welfare. Getting more of them here safely would be a good place to start.
