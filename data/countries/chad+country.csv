1,chad+country,"Oxfam is inherently hypocritical. The core pillar of the humanitarian principle, humanity, emphasizes that the goal of aid should be to alleviate human suffering. As opposed to carrying out the supposedly humanitarian goals of its mission, Oxfam directly perpetuates human suffering. If a humanitarian organization is unable to fulfill its core mandate, that agency must be held accountable for its actions. For that reason, donors must reduce their funding of organizations that are guilty of abuse in crises.

The pattern of sexual exploitation and abuse in the humanitarian sphere has persisted for decades. In 2016, World Vision reported 10 incidents of “sexual exploitation or abuse of a child.” In 2002, Save the Children and the UNHCR investigated abuse. Out of a total of 1,500 surveyed, researchers documented 67 allegations of abuse, some of which included “trading humanitarian commodities and services … in exchange for sex with girls under 18.” Other reports documented cases where children traded “sex with aid workers and peacekeepers in exchange for food” and carried out “lesbian sexual displays.” UN peacekeepers are also part of the problem, causally using the term “peacekeeper babies” for children of native women they impregnate. Clearly this problem has persisted without resolution, and is not a singular, isolated incident.

Within Oxfam specifically, the individual actors that perpetrated the abuse were previously on record for sexual exploitation. The organization admits that Roland van Hauwermeiren, the Oxfam country director in Haiti, “[hired] sex workers in Chad in 2006 — the year that hundreds of thousands of refugees from a genocidal war in Sudan created a public health crisis in Chad.” After being allowed to serve as Haiti’s country director even though Oxfam was aware of the atrocities in Chad, van Hauwermeiren and other aid workers ran a self-proclaimed “whorehouse,” where “girls [wore] Oxfam T-shirts, running around half-naked.” On top of that, Oxfam tried to cover up the scandal by limiting the investigation into van Hauwermeiren. The evidence clearly incriminates Oxfam as an organization. Not only did the organization ignore previous inhumane actions, it tried to hide the evidence.

It is indisputable that Oxfam authorities were completely aware of the atrocities committed by the country director for Haiti. Deputy Chief Executive Penny Lawrence resigned earlier this year, feeling “ashamed” and taking “full responsibility.” Whatever shred of legitimacy came with the argument that this was an isolated incident unknown to the leaders of the organization is gone. These heinous facts demand immediate change within the humanitarian sphere.

The cluster system, a method for organizing aid by creating general categories such as health and shelter, and the institutions backing it continue to grapple with the concept of accountability. Sanctions against poor practices by humanitarian actors are rarely implemented. A variety of watchdog organizations, such as Report the Abuse — dissolved in 2017 — and Code Blue, have been formed to curb abuse but have failed to yield significant results. In the words of the founder of Code Blue, Paula Donovan: ""the world was horrified for a short period of time. Aid groups would say it's terrible, we're going to strengthen our systems and everybody is appeased.” Empty rhetoric and investigative bureaucracy will not bring about any more change than it already has.

Cutting funding to aid organizations who perpetuate human rights abuses is the solution to this problem. The argument that reducing the donations to major NGOs like Oxfam will only hurt the recipients of aid is an unsubstantiated ploy to keep control in the grasp of the “Humanitarian Club,” a group of humanitarian actors composed of the UN and the most powerful international NGOs. There are plenty of local NGOs working on sustainable grassroots efforts to relieve burdened populations. At the moment, these groups receive less than 0.6 percent of global aid. Increasingly, global humanitarian crises are becoming more complex, and the major actors are unable to respond to every situation. Local groups are uniquely able to respond quickly to disasters and shape each response in a culturally sensitive fashion.

Following humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence, aid workers in the field consider accountability the fifth humanitarian principle, and it is intrinsic in these groups’ responses, as they are part of the communities they seek to help. The humanitarian system should focus on transitioning funding away from larger groups that have a record of exploitation towards localized efforts. Humanitarian experts have called for the empowerment of local organizations for some time. Punishing bad actors is the perfect opportunity to support others who have demonstrated a commitment to long-term sustainability and development efforts.

Overall, the facts are clear. Major aid organizations are not doing enough to eliminate exploitation of impacted communities. There is a recurring trend of abuse by humanitarian workers against local populations. The system must find a way to punish these sorts of behaviors. Funding, the instrument that is necessary for the existence of these organizations, can be used as a powerful tool to initiate real change. If Oxfam is faced with the question of its own survival, it will definitely investigate the root of the problem and launch reforms that it has neglected in the past.

2,chad+country,"Throughout the history of mankind, people around the world have left their homes, fleeing armed conflict, persecution, poverty or simply seeking better opportunities. Migration can be voluntary or involuntary, but most of the time a combination of choices and constraints lead some to leave, while others stay behind. What needs do people have while on the road? Are those needs different based on the reason for leaving home? What distinguishes someone who is displaced internally from someone who has crossed an international border? How can humanitarian actors, States and the international community best protect and assist those who flee, whether within their own State, while in transit, or in the destination country? This edition of the Review attempts to unpack and address these and other related questions, while providing insights into different humanitarian approaches to the needs and vulnerabilities of migrants and internally displaced persons.

EDITORIAL: MIGRATION AND DISPLACEMENT: HUMANITY WITH ITS BACK TO THE WALL

Crowds of people on the move with their bundles of possessions, young men frantically scaling fences, boatloads of women and children pummelled by the waves, bodies washed up the beach, camps with endless rows of tents and chaotic shanty towns stretching as far as the eye can see, transit centres where hopes fade, humiliated workers forced to do jobs nobody else wants, mothers waiting a lifetime in vain for news of daughters or sons who left to seek their fortune elsewhere. These are some of the images that might come to mind when picturing the plight of uprooted people around the world. Vincent Bernard, Editor-in-Chief

""ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW"": TESTIMONIES OF THE FAMILIES OF MISSING MIGRANTS IN ZIMBABWE

Every day, people all over the world leave their homes in search of a better life. On the road, many go missing. The mandate of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence includes, in certain contexts, protection of vulnerable migrants. The ICRC missing migrants pilot project aims to locate or clarify the fate of Zimbabwean migrants who went missing in South Africa, on behalf of their families. The ICRC aims to work with South African and Zimbabwean authorities to support and enhance existing systems, tools and resources used for locating missing relatives, living or dead. Additionally, the ICRC carries out and supports the activities of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the region to restore contact between and where possible reunify family members, in particular children, who have been separated by conflict, migration, displacement or natural or man-made disasters.The Review has chosen to open this issue with the stories of family members of missing migrants in Zimbabwe. The section aims to show the everyday struggle, sometimes lasting for many years, of those that live with continuous uncertainty regarding the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. As a result of the disappearances associated with migration, families searching for missing relatives often face a range of needs and challenges. These persons chose to share their life stories with the Review, allowing our readers to understand the intricate balance of uncertainty, hope and the “need to know” that family members of missing migrants live with every day. The testimonies were given to the ICRC in Zimbabwe in November 2017. In order to protect the families, their names have been omitted.

INTERVIEW WITH FILIPPO GRANDI

The tradition of providing refuge to people who are fleeing and in need of protection is a long-standing one, present throughout history and in various contexts, and now embedded in international law. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2016, reaffirmed international refugee protection standards and provided a model for a more comprehensive response to large-scale refugee movements, based on shared global responsibility for refugees. It represented a critical development at a time when international cooperation aimed at preventing, responding to and resolving conflicts is proving inadequate, and an increasing number of people are being internally displaced, forced across borders or left in protracted exile as a result of conflict, violence and persecution. In this interview, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees shares his thoughts on some of today’s most significant forced displacement challenges, and the prospects presented by the New York Declaration.

MOBILISING THE MOVEMENT: AUSTRALIAN RED CROSS, MIGRATION, AND THE ROLE OF THE RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT MOVEMENT AROUND HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

Established in war, embedded in communities and operational in every major natural and man-made disaster, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) – including 191 National Societies – is uniquely positioned to address the humanitarian needs of migrants at all points of their journey. With migration on the rise and an area of intense debate, this article examines the work of Australian Red Cross and the collective efforts of the International Federation of Red Cross Red and Red Crescent Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Asia Pacific Migration Network, particularly across 2015–17, to support the Movement in the region in providing assistance and protection to those who are most vulnerable. It considers the progress made so far, and the potential of the Movement to engage more effectively and collaboratively on opportunities and challenges into the future.

BRITISH RED CROSS RESPONSE TO YOUNG MIGRANTS IN CALAIS, FRANCE

In 2016, thousands of young migrants were stranded in Calais, France, in the “Jungle” refugee camp. This paper aims to provide an overview of the British Red Cross’s response and of how the organization engaged in numerous activities to secure their safety, culminating in a transfer of children to the United Kingdom.

ASSISTANCE FOR AND PROTECTION OF MIGRANTS: EXPERIENCE OF THE HONDURAN RED CROSS

The Honduran Red Cross began working in the area of migration in July 2012, when it set up the Migrant Assistance Module in Corinto for Honduran migrants returning over land at the Honduran–Guatemalan border. The Honduran Red Cross has helped hundreds of returning and irregular migrants, thanks to agreements with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Migration Institute. It has also worked with other National Red Cross Societies in the region, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which have helped it to strengthen its capacity and build a comprehensive vision for the protection and assistance of migrants. This article summarizes the action that the Honduran Red Cross has undertaken with respect to migration and explores the services provided at the Corinto module, the Honduran Red Cross’s subsequent management of the Returning Migrant Assistance Centre in Omoa and other care centres for migrants returning because of their irregular status, and the development and implementation of projects on migration and related topics.

DISPLACEMENT IN NIGERIA: SCENES FROM THE NORTHEAST

Now in its ninth year, the armed conflict in Nigeria has forced more than 2 million people from their homes, with more than 1.5 million of these displaced within the country. The regionalized conflict – which since 2013 has affected the neighbouring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger – has caused a protracted humanitarian crisis with some of the highest human costs in the world. In the following gallery, photographer Newsha Tavakolian gives us a glimpse into the lives of displaced persons in northeastern Nigeria.

BETWEEN HOSPITALITY AND ASYLUM: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON DISPLACED AGENCY

This article aims at positioning the agency of the displaced within the longue durée, as it is exposed in contexts of hospitality and asylum, by articulating its key modes: contingent, willed and compelled. Using the ancient world as its starting point, the article exposes the duplicity in conceiving of the current condition of displacement as transient or exceptional. As such, it argues for the urgent need of a shift in the perception of displaced persons from that of impotent victims to potent agents, and to engage with the new forms of exceptional politics which their circumstances engender.

ADDRESSING THE PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE NEEDS OF MIGRANTS: THE ICRC APPROACH TO MIGRATION

The vulnerability of migrants and the threats to which they are exposed during their journey, on land, at sea, or in countries where they have settled, raise serious humanitarian concerns that cannot be ignored. In view of the transregional nature of migration, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) draw on their presence all along migration routes to contribute to the humanitarian response and alleviate the suffering of vulnerable migrants. The Movement’s proximity to vulnerable migrants through its solid and experienced network of responders along migratory routes is one of its specific advantages. The aim of this article is to explain the ICRC’s view on and approach to migration. It underlines that the ICRC’s response is dictated by humanitarian needs, and stresses that these needs can be greatly reduced when States abide by their commitments under international law and adopt and implement policies that take into account the protection and assistance needs of migrants. It acknowledges the diverse and complex human realities behind migration and outlines the main protection and assistance concerns of migrants in countries and regions where the ICRC operates.

THE PROTECTION OF MIGRANTS UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW

The movement of migrants across international borders may result in grave humanitarian consequences and protection and assistance needs for those involved. Although many reach their destinations safely, others may find themselves in a country experiencing armed conflict – either because they live there or are travelling through there – and may endure great difficulties and be particularly vulnerable. In these situations, as civilians, migrants are protected under international humanitarian law (IHL) against the effects of hostilities and when in the hands of a party to the conflict. This article will provide an overview of the protection afforded by IHL to migrants as civilians in international and non- international armed conflicts. It will then examine more closely certain particularly relevant rules for the issue of migration, notably those related to the movement of migrants, family unity, and missing and dead migrants. In this way, this article will show that IHL provides important legal protections for migrants finding themselves in situations of armed conflict.

SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE IFRC’S APPROACH TO MIGRATION AND DISPLACEMENT

This article provides an overview of the development of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies’ (IFRC) approach to migration and displacement. The focus of the IFRC and its member National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (National Societies) in this regard has traditionally been on refugees and other so-called “displaced persons” – that is, people who have been compelled to flee their place or country of origin and for this reason are deemed to be particularly vulnerable. However, this focus has been extended recently, in the course of the past decade, to cover all people who find themselves in a vulnerable situation in the context of migration. The IFRC Migration Policy, which was adopted in 2009, has offered much-needed guidance to National Societies in dealing with all migrants, including irregular migrants. However, it is argued that there is a need today – taking into consideration the increasing number of displaced people worldwide and the numerous contexts in which National Societies are dealing with refugees, internally displaced persons or cross-border disaster-displaced persons – to better understand the programmatic aspects that are specific to displacement compared with migration. This is a necessary condition in view of the development of more adequate and effective responses to the vulnerabilities and needs of migrants and displaced persons.

MIGRATION AND DATA PROTECTION: DOING NO HARM IN AN AGE OF MASS DISPLACEMENT, MASS SURVEILLANCE AND “BIG DATA”

This article considers the key data protection challenges facing humanitarian organizations providing assistance to refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants. These challenges are particularly significant for several reasons: because data protection has come relatively late to the humanitarian sector; because humanitarian organizations are under pressure to innovate rapidly; because the global communications architecture on which many of these innovations depend is inherently vulnerable to State surveillance; and because States are deploying increasingly sophisticated and coercive means to prevent irregular forms of migration and/or subjecting humanitarian organizations to surveillance and disruption. The first part of the article outlines the fundamental rights challenges presented by contemporary data-driven migration control paradigms. The second outlines concerns about “data-driven humanitarianism” and “mass surveillance” to show how humanitarian organizations risk inadvertently exacerbating these problems. The third assesses specific data protection challenges that humanitarian organizations face and the policies and practices they have developed in response. The article concludes with some brief observations on the technical and political dynamics shaping their efforts to comply with their legal and ethical obligations, and calls for the sector to work together to extend data protection norms and outlaw cyber-attacks by State actors.

OBLIGATIONS OF TRANSIT COUNTRIES UNDER REFUGEE LAW: A WESTERN BALKANS CASE STUDY

A significant increase in the number of arrivals of refugees and migrants in Europe along the Western Balkans route brought several Balkan countries into the spotlight of international refugee protection in 2015 and 2016. Out of hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants recorded entering the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia, only a handful remained to seek asylum from their authorities. Under the circumstances, the applicability of the 1951 Refugee Convention with respect to refugees refraining from seeking asylum was brought into question, as well as the extent of transit countries’ legal obligations under refugee law. Based on the Western Balkans experience, the present article seeks to re-examine the relationship between the concept of asylum and the regime of the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Convention’s scope of application in “transit countries”, and minimal standards stemming from positive law regarding the treatment of refugees and migrants in a transit context.

IN THE NAME OF (DE)SECURITIZATION: SPEAKING SECURITY TO PROTECT MIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS?

This article examines how the protection of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) is spoken about and framed. Today it is evident that the dominant responses of sovereign States to each of these groups is heavily reliant on the language of security and (de)securitization, and this article openly conceptualizes ongoing attempts to protect migrants, refugees and IDPs as a series of overlapping (de)securitized “games”. At least three arguments follow from this claim. First, adopting this approach serves as a reminder that the ways in which different groups of people are spoken about often constitutes a dividing line between life and death. Second, the language games of (de)securitization are not identical when it comes to protecting different groups. Third, using securitization as the theoretical point of departure provides a timely reminder that none of the three categorizations listed above is guaranteed to apply. On the contrary, the adoption of each linguistic label – migrant, refugee, IDP – is subject to and dependent upon audience acceptance. Remembering the latter dimension is imperative to fully comprehend the ongoing contestations and countermoves in response to people moving in search of security. By way of conclusion, the article contends that far more attention must be paid to broader understandings of acceptance and love to ensure the protection of migrants, refugees and IDPs.

PROTECTING INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS: THE VALUE OF THE KAMPALA CONVENTION AS A REGIONAL EXAMPLE

This article examines the value of the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention) in the general quest for the regional and global protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs). It contends that the absence of a globally binding legal instrument for the protection of IDPs underlines the importance of the Kampala Convention and the possible contribution it can make to global and regional efforts to create a binding legal framework for the protection of IDPs. While recognizing some challenges that may impact the full implementation of the Convention, the article concludes by noting its various positive elements that are invaluable in overall efforts to create a comprehensive global legal framework to enhance protection of IDPs.

SPECIFICITIES AND CHALLENGES OF RESPONDING TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN URBAN SETTINGS

The world is rapidly urbanizing, and so is internal displacement. However, knowledge about the specific situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in urban settings and how it differs from, and impacts on, their host communities is still limited, and responses continue to be inadequate. This article analyzes the particular needs of urban IDPs by taking into account how the various contexts and patterns of urban internal displacement contribute to shaping people’s experience. It discusses three key challenges that humanitarian actors are faced with in developing effective responses: identifying and reaching IDPs in urban settings, addressing their urgent protection concerns, and supporting their local integration. It concludes by pointing out the need for methodological and operational guidance on how to bring together area-based approaches that account for the impact of displacement on entire urban communities, and tailored approaches addressing IDPs’ specific needs in urban settings. The need for stocktaking exercises and more effective sharing of experiences among practitioners, municipal authorities and policy-makers is also underlined.

DO NO HARM: A TAXONOMY OF THE CHALLENGES OF HUMANITARIAN EXPERIMENTATION

This article aims to acknowledge and articulate the notion of “humanitarian experimentation”. Whether through innovation or uncertain contexts, managing risk is a core component of the humanitarian initiative – but all risk is not created equal. There is a stark ethical and practical difference between managing risk and introducing it, which is mitigated in other fields through experimentation and regulation. This article identifies and historically contextualizes the concept of humanitarian experimentation, which is increasingly prescient, as a range of humanitarian subfields embark on projects of digitization and privatization. This trend is illustrated here through three contemporary examples of humanitarian innovations (biometrics, data modelling, cargo drones), with references to critical questions about adherence to the humanitarian “do no harm” imperative. This article outlines a broad taxonomy of harms, intended to serve as the starting point for a more comprehensive conversation about humanitarian action and the ethics of experimentation.

NOTE ON MIGRATION AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REFOULEMENT, ICRC, 2018

Throughout history, high numbers of persons have left, or have been forced to leave, their countries of origin. In order to protect migrants or refugees against being returned to places in which their fundamental rights are in danger, States have developed the principle of non-refoulement. This principle, reflected in different bodies of international law, protects any person from being transferred (returned, expelled, extradited—whatever term is used) from one authority to another when there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to violations of certain fundamental rights. The principle is multi-faceted and its scope and application vary from context to context in accordance with the applicable law. The present note recalls the legal basis of the principle of non-refoulement in different bodies of international law, examines its scope of application, and presents how certain aspects of the principle have been interpreted by States, courts, human rights treaty bodies, or expert organizations. The note also explains – where relevant – which understanding of the principle of non-refoulement the ICRC follows in its dialogue with States.

ICRC POLICY PAPER ON IMMIGRATION DETENTION

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has worked on behalf of detained irregular migrants for many years as part of its activities for detainee populations in general, but has only recently started implementing specific programmes for detained migrants in countries of transit and destination. The ICRC visits detained migrants in both criminal and dedicated immigration detention facilities. During these visits, as with all detainees, the ICRC assesses whether detained migrants are treated humanely, held in conditions that preserve their dignity and afforded due process of law. The ICRC also evaluates whether they are able to maintain contact with the outside world, such as with their families and consular authorities, if they wish to do so. As part of its dialogue with the authorities, the ICRC also raises protection issues related to return to ensure that the authorities fulfil their obligations under relevant international law – in particular with respect to the principle of non-refoulement.

TRANSLATING THE KAMPALA CONVENTION INTO PRACTICE: A STOCKTAKING EXERCISE

In 2016, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carried out a study to take stock of current progress in implementing the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (the Kampala Convention). As the first ever legally binding international instrument of its kind, the Kampala Convention represents a significant step forward in reaffirming the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the face of a growing displacement problem in Africa. The stocktaking exercise grew because of the recognition of the value of the Kampala Convention and the urgent need to make it as effective as possible. The ICRC was involved from the outset in the drafting of the Kampala Convention and, since its adoption, has been working on promoting its ratification and implementation. The stocktaking exercise, therefore, is part of the ICRC's continuous support to the Kampala Convention. It is also an additional step within the framework of the ICRC's long-term operational engagement in addressing the needs of the displaced and their host communities affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence in Africa. At the origin of the stocktaking exercise was also the observation that several States have undertaken – or are undertaking – important action to domesticate and operationalize the Kampala Convention, but they have tended to do so in isolation. The ICRC felt there was a need to compile the diverse experiences of States in order to bolster efforts to fully implement the Convention, by allowing States to learn from each other about how the Convention can work best. The study examined the practice of twenty-five African countries in which the ICRC is operating – these include not only States party to the Kampala Convention, but also other States not yet party who have taken action on internal displacement in the form of normative, policy or concrete measures. The focus has been on those obligations that are based in international humanitarian law or touch on humanitarian issues that the ICRC encounters in operations across Africa. The findings were published in a report that identifies lessons learned, best practices and key challenges in States' efforts to meet their obligations towards IDPs, as provided in the Kampala Convention. The report offers recommendations to States and other actors concerned (African Union, Regional Economic Communities, UN agencies, civil society organizations, etc.) on how to translate the Kampala Convention into real improvements for IDPs. The report is being used by ICRC delegations in Africa in bilateral discussions with States on their obligations to protect and assist IDPs, and to provide them with durable solutions. It is also used to support the adoption by States of national legal frameworks and policies as part of their responses to situations of internal displacement. At the continental level, the report informs the ICRC's long-standing cooperation with the African Union and sub-regional forums (e.g. the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the Economic Community of West African States) on promoting ratification of the Kampala Convention and strengthening its implementation. For example, the report served as a starting point for discussions among experts during the first meeting of the Conference of States Party to the Kampala Convention that was held in Harare in April 2017. According to the framework of the Plan of Action adopted by the Conference, the ICRC is to support further initiatives to enhance awareness of the Kampala Convention and facilitate the sharing of experience and expertise among States on its implementation. The report's findings and recommendations are also proving to be useful in the ICRC's dialogue with States in other regions beyond Africa, insofar as they provide examples of measures that States can adopt to address internal displacement more effectively at the national and regional levels.

FORCED TO FLEE: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE ON INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT, MIGRATION AND REFUGEE CRISES, SOAS UNIVERSITY OF LONDON, ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL, UNIVERSITY OF EXETER, BRITISH RED CROSS AND ICRC

""Forced to Flee"" was a multidisciplinary two-day conference on internal displacement, migration and refugee crises, jointly organized by SOAS University of London, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the University of Exeter, the British Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It brought together some sixty researchers, independent and UK government policy-makers, and senior humanitarian practitioners.

AIDE-MEMOIRE: OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE ON MAINTAINING THE CIVILIAN AND HUMANITARIAN CHARACTER OF SITES AND SETTLEMENTS

In light of the growing complexity of humanitarian crises today and the continued need for effective cooperation among humanitarian actors, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) launched a consultative process in September 2016 to collect operational practices with regard to maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites and settlements for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. Exchanges with field staff from both organizations targeted five ongoing operations–in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan – and included a one-day workshop in Geneva on 20 April 2017 in which the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) also participated. A wider set of stakeholders was consulted as well, during a roundtable organized under the auspices of the Global Protection Cluster (GPC) on 21 April.This aide-memoire draws on the above-mentioned consultations to provide operational guidance for humanitarian actors in maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites and settlements (hereinafter referred to as sites) in situations of armed conflict. Part 1 of this guidance sets out the necessary context and principles with regard to the civilian and humanitarian character of sites. It provides a description of the main operational challenges and dilemmas that humanitarian actors confront and examines the content of applicable legal frameworks. Part 2 offers measures for humanitarian actors to consider – within the remit of their respective expertise, experience and mandates – when working toward maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of sites. These measures include efforts to engage actors beyond the humanitarian community in the spirit of complementarity and in respect of humanitarian principles.

WHAT’S NEW ON HOW DOES LAW PROTECT IN WAR? ONLINE: ANNUAL UPDATE ON CASE STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2017

It contains comprehensive bibliographic resources and links each theme to a range of related case studies and documents. The section on ""The Practice"" comprises more than 300 case studies and documents regrouped by theme, region or type of document. They allow practice-oriented learning of IHL rules and interactive discussions through a series of questions. The ""Pedagogical Resources"" section provides useful advice on how to teach IHL, as well as twenty-nine model course outlines and other useful resources. The ""A to Z"" section presents 422 notions linked to IHL, their legal sources, the case studies where they are addressed, and bibliographic resources for delving further into those notions. A search engine allows users to find rapidly the relevant pedagogical material they need on the platform.

BOOK REVIEW: REFUGEES IN EXTENDED EXILE: LIVING ON THE EDGE

Statistics show that long-term displacement is the new normal. In the absence of solutions to their exile, people remain trapped in permanent temporariness for years – or decades in the case of Somalians, Afghans or Palestinians. The traditional “durable solutions” bringing exile to an end are elusive: only a few hundred thousand refugees return home every year, few States hosting refugees in the global South are willing to allow them to settle permanently in their country, and less than 1% of the refugee population are being offered resettlement in a third country.

3,chad+country,"ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK, South Africa, May 3 (Reuters) - Almost 50 years after they were hunted to local extinction, black rhinos will again roam the wilds of the Central African nation of Chad, the latest chapter in a movement to bring big mammals back to former ranges on the continent.

On Thursday, six rhinos were flown to Chad’s Zakouma National Park from the South African city of Port Elizabeth, sedated and confined in specially-crafted crates to ensure they don’t cause a commotion mid-air.

The initiative comes against the backdrop of a poaching crisis that saw more than 1,000 rhinos slain in South Africa last year to meet red-hot demand for their horns in Asia, where they are prized for their alleged medicinal properties.

With 18,000 white rhinos and 2,000 of the smaller black rhino, South Africa is home to about 80 percent of the global population of the pachyderms, making it the springboard for reintroduction efforts elsewhere.

""By establishing a viable and secure population of rhino in Chad, we are contributing to the expansion of the rhino population in Africa, and the survival of a species that has faced high levels of poaching,"" said South African Environment Minister Edna Molewa.

No rhino has been seen in Chad since the early 1970s.

African Parks, a non-government organization which runs Chad's Zakouma and other reserves, has also reintroduced rhinos and lions from South Africa to Rwanda and is planning to relocate lions to Malawi.

""We have been using the history of conservation success in South Africa to repopulate other areas in Africa,"" Andrew Parker, director of conservation at African Parks, told Reuters as a hulking rhino lumbered about its holding pen below him.

The Chad-bound rhinos were in the fortified enclosures or ""bomas"" for three months in preparation for their long haul.

The animals have been fed lucerne, a kind of super-nutritious hay, the past few weeks. It will be initially provided to them in Chad as they adjust their diet to new trees and shrubs.

Security has been tight: the animals’ location was kept under wraps, they will be given a police escort to the airport, and in Chad they will be dehorned and fitted with transponders.

Jumbo-sized logistics and planning go into such an operation: the animals were tranquilised in Marakele National Park in northern South Africa and then brought to Addo, which has better facilities.

Cranes hoisted the crates containing the rhinos onto flat-bed trucks and they will be monitored carefully by vets on the plane for the 15-hour trip which involves two stops.

The hope is that the two bulls and four cows will establish a breeding herd which will be the most northern wild population of the species in Africa.

4,chad+country,"On May 2, 2018, gunmen with grenades attacked the Notre-Dame de Fatima church, a Roman Catholic church, in Bangui in the Central African Republic (CAR). 15 people were killed, and dozens injured. The attack comes a few weeks after 28 people were killed in violent clashes after an operation launched by UN peacekeepers and local security forces in the neighbouring Bangui district of PK5. This sectarian violence has been escalating since February 2018. The recent attacks are nothing new as religious (and ethnic) conflicts have haunted the country for several years, reaching a peak at the end of 2012. Prior to 2012, 85% of the population of the Central African Republic was Christian with a 15% percent Muslim minority. This has changed significantly over the years.

In late 2012, an umbrella terror group Séléka, predominately Muslim, supported by Chadian and Sudanese foreign fighters, begun to occupy towns in the northern part of CAR. A short-lived peace agreement collapsed in March 2013 and the terror group took control of the capital of CAR, Bangui, ousting President François Bozizé. The sectarian violence and targeted killings, motivated by religion, escalated after the 2013 coup. Reported atrocities included summary executions, rape, sexual abuse, enforced disappearance, illegal detention and torture. The terror group was formally dissolved in September 2013 by its leader and (self-proclaimed) President Michel Djotodia in light of the international condemnation of the crimes perpetrated by the group. Nonetheless, the ex-Séléka fighters, now members of multiple smaller groups, continued to engage in atrocities. In retaliation to those atrocities, in June 2013, a self-defence militia (primarily Christian), former Central African Armed Forces (FACA) soldiers, and other non-Muslims, so-called anti-balaka, united their forces. These ex-Séléka and anti-balaka have been engaged in fighting a religious war in the Central African Republic since September 2013. The conflict escalated after anti-balaka attacked Muslim neighbourhoods in Bangui on December 5, 2013, resulting in a full-blown religious conflict that affected the whole nation.

In December 2014, the International Commission of Inquiry on the Central African Republic released a report confirming that there had been a ‘pattern of ethnic cleansing committed by the anti-balaka in the areas in which Muslims had been living.’ This finding followed the January 2014 violence unleashed by anti-balaka fighters who had begun to kill Muslims based on their religious identity. This violence led to the forcible displacement of 99% of the Muslim population of Bangui. Furthermore, 80% of the Muslim population of CAR has since fled to Cameroon and Chad. Reports suggested that out of 436 mosques in the country, 417 were destroyed. The return of Muslim minorities back to CAR has been very slowly ever since and the remaining Muslim minorities predominately live in the peacekeeper-protected enclaves. Some of those who have returned back to their homes report being forced to convert by anti-balata soldiers. UN peacekeepers have also reported seeing the returning Muslim minorities subjected to harassment and abuse.

Religious identity continues to be one of the most significant predictors of violence in the Central African Republic. Many Muslim communities remain displaced and in the western parts, Muslims cannot practice their faith freely. The CAR Government has initiated some work to ensure renewed interfaith cooperation and address the growing tensions between religious communities. However, without adequate reconciliation efforts, this has not achieved the desired results. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) found that the situation in CAR merits the designation of a country of particular concern (CRC). In its 2018 report, USCIRF reported that Muslim minorities in CAR had been subjected to marginalisation even before the recent conflict arose. Muslims continue to suffer from systemic discrimination in a wide range of areas including their access to education and identity documents. The ongoing violence has resulted in over 2.3 million people requiring humanitarian assistance. It has created more than 450,000 refugees and almost 350,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). Thousands lost their lives.

The recent attacks and the escalation of violence in the Central African Republic is nothing new. The religious conflict is deeply rooted and had not yet been adequately addressed. The conflict cannot be analysed in this vacuum. Any response to the attacks needs to take into consideration the historic internal conflict. Any future progress towards peace in CAR must incorporate comprehensive plans to combat sectarian violence. It must accommodate interfaith dialogue and reconciliation. Above all, it must ensure that human rights are afforded to all, including the right to freedom of religion and belief to the minority Muslim groups.

More needs to be done to help Muslim minorities in the Central African Republic. This includes ensuring that the refugees and IDPs are allowed to return to their homes, that they are provided adequate protection and that they are guaranteed basic rights in equality with other majority groups. The CAR Government must also ensure that the religious war between ex-Séléka and anti-balaka fighters is adequately investigated and that prosecutions are pursued against these parties for their role in the sectarian violence in CAR. Combating impunity can greatly support reconciliation and community cohesion efforts.",The Religious War In The Central African Republic Continues,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/05/09/the-religious-war-in-central-african-republic-continues/
5,chad+country,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said that Nigeria had initiated measures to mitigate the negative effects of the shrinking Lake Chad on the people of the area.

The president, who was represented by the Borno Governor, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, stated this in Maiduguri while declaring open the First Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum.

The president, who also sought the support of the international community in addressing effects of climate change, said Nigeria was working diligently to address the plight of the people living on the Nigeria’s side of the lake.

Buhari, who noted that the Lake Chad issues must be treated with the required urgency, called on all stakeholders to share the mission of rescuing the Lake Chad Basin from extinction.

He said there was the need to find workable solutions in resuscitating the lake to the benefit of all member-countries in the region.

He added that the people living in the basin depended on the lake for agriculture, fisheries and livestock for their economic well-being.

Buhari said: “The Lake Chad is very dear to our heart as it is a source of livelihood to over 45 million people living in the Basin.

‘‘This Lake, which is one of the oldest Lakes in Africa, is shared by Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

He noted that the Lake Chad region was formerly an “oasis in the desert”, a hub of economic activities and food security, providing a source of happiness and contentment that contributed to the stability of the sub-region.

He said: “Unfortunately, the ‘oasis in the desert’ is almost a desert now, due to the drying up of Lake Chad occasioned by the effects of global warming and population explosion.”

Edward Kallon, the United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative in Nigeria, said despite the progress made on the security and humanitarian front in recent years, more needed to be done to assure the people of the Lake Chad Basin of their safety.

Kallon said: “The people of this region have suffered for far too long and we need to redouble our collective efforts to address the underlying causes of the crisis.’’

Kallon noted that the forum would enhance the effective participation of local communities defining pathways to the crisis facing the region.

He said: “We must further more enhance cooperation around stabilisation, peace building and conflict prevention.’’

Kallon, who also advocated a multi-pronged approach to Lake Chad Basin crisis, urged the governor to support UN to address the crisis.",Buhari pledges to mitigate effects of drying Lake Chad -,https://theeagleonline.com.ng/buhari-pledges-to-mitigate-effects-of-drying-lake-chad/

Turkish charity organization Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH, has opened a water well in the Abeche region of the central African country of Chad, the aid group said in a statement Tuesday.

IHH said the 120-meter deep well can provide water for up to 5,000 people and it is the 332nd water well that IHH has dug in Chad.

The charitable group has opened nearly 6,800 wells in 36 countries since 2000 in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and helped millions of people access to clean water.

An inauguration ceremony was held on Monday which was attended by Abeche Governor Khadidje Assamah.

IHH said it planned to open 5 more water wells in the Abeche region.

9,chad+country,"On Monday 20 April 2018, Mr. Karl Martin Oskar Ekblad, Head of Resettlement and Special Operations at the Swedish Migration Agency, led a Swedish delegation on a fact-finding mission in Chad, to assess the importance of Sweden’s resettlement programme and make recommendations on how to expedite and ameliorate its operations.

Mr. Ekblad was accompanied by the Deputy Director, Division for Migration and Asylum Policy at Sweden’s Ministry of Justice, Ms. Kerstin Maria Ingemarsdotter Lindblad, as well as some colleagues:

Ms. Victoria Louise Weber, Mr. Velibor. Ljepoja, and Mr. Carl Magnus Rosenberg, Mr. Christof Portman travelled from UNHCR Geneva to join the delegation, which met with the UNHCR Chad, the National Commission for the Reception and Reintegration of Refugees and Returnees (CNARR), and IOM.

The tour with a briefing with UNHCR Representative for Chad, Mr Mbili Ambaoumba, where Mr.

Ekblad expressed the commitment of Sweden to the protection of refugees. “We have a small team and limited resources but we do want to ensure that we are giving our best and that the beneficiaries of our resettlement programme get the best experience possible,” he said. “Not enough is known and reported about the central African region, and we hope to get a better insight into the refugee crises and surrounding conflicts here, so that our interventions can be better informed.” Speaking to the delegation, Mr Ambaoumba expressed his satisfaction with the work of the Swedish Migration Agency.

“UNHCR welcomes the resettlement efforts made by the government of Sweden through Swedish Migration Agency, which have been underpinned by expedience and professionalism in the rapid approval of all cases that UNHCR Chad has submitted. Resettlement is not only an effective durable solution but also a powerful protection tool, providing a safety net for refugees traumatised by all kinds of violence and for complex medical cases” he said.

The delegation then met with some refugees to get a first-hand information about the challenges of some of the potential beneficiaries of their settlement programme, before holding a closed session with Mr. Mahamat Nour Abdoulaye, the Permanent Secretary Permanent Secretary of CNARR.

Mr. Abdoulaye conceded that the lack of legislation in Chad is a cause for concern, but reiterated the commitment of Chad to the protection and assistance of refugees, made evident by the work already undertaken by CNARR, in collaboration with actors such as UNHCR.

“Chad has acceded to the Geneva Convention and seven years ago we commenced the process to integrate that commitment in local law through refugee legislation. In the meantime, we have not ceased to work to address the refugee crisis in the region. Chad is a landlocked country, and all our neighbours face serious security problems which result in the influx of asylum seekers. CNARR has therefore had to remain grounded and active to ensure that we provide the best assistance and protection possible to refugees, but also bearing in mind the security challenges that come with it. We are indeed grateful for the cooperation of countries such as Sweden, for providing more options to resettle these refugees. The numbers keep rising and we all need to do more, obviously.”

During the tour, Madame Juliet Garr, Resettlement Officer at UNHCR, also shed light on UNHCR’s resettlement programme in Chad.

She revealed that there are more than 400 000 refugees in Chad - as of December 2017, UNHCR counted 411,482 (31 Dec 2017). More than 80% of them are found in various locations and camps along the Eastern border with Sudan – Iriba, Farchana and Goz Beida.

These refugees find themselves in one of the most complex and underreported humanitarian scenarios in the world. Chad itself is facing recession since 2015, following fall in the price of oil. Meanwhile, 80% of the country is locked in arid or semi-arid conditions, resulting in severe pressure on basic resources and stiff competition with host populations. And while ongoing regional conflicts have perpetuated an influx of refugees, low development and harsh climatic condition present logistical challenges to humanitarian intervention, exacerbated by mixed migration flows.

According to UNHCR estimates, 57,277 persons are in need of resettlement from Chad. Given the quotas from resettlement countries – USA, Sweden, Netherland, Canada, France, Norway and Finland - UNHCR was only able to submit 1,131 cases in 2017. Of these, 264 cases have been accepted, 11 rejected and 856 still pending. UNHCR expects to submit 1,950 cases in 2018.

Mr Ekblad revealed that Sweden is a relatively new player in the resettlement field, but the Swedish refugee quota has increased from 1,900 to 5,000 places since 2016, making it the third largest recipient country.",Swedish migration agency mission to Chad examines resettlement programme,https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/swedish-migration-agency-mission-chad-examines-resettlement-programme

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
11,chad+country,"N’Djamena – On 28 April, 56 Chadian men – including 17 unaccompanied children – were assisted by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, after an operation conducted two days earlier by police forces at the Libyan border.

The operation targeted a network of traffickers transporting individuals to Libya, and led to the arrest of several criminals suspected of migrant trafficking. The 56 persons on board the two vehicles which were transporting them were found in bad physical condition, and were immediately transferred to the IOM sub-office in Faya, 300 kilometres from the Libyan border.

The 17 children were taken care of by the Chadian Red Cross, and the 39 adults received assistance (food and emergency shelter) from IOM. Individuals with serious health conditions (dehydration) were immediately referred to the nearest health centre. In coordination with the local authorities, IOM is now seeking to provide safe travel conditions to all those who wish to return home.

“When we were stopped by the police, we didn’t understand what was happening,” said Mahamet, a Chadian man rescued during the operation. “We didn’t know where we were. When we arrived at the IOM office, the situation was explained to us. We didn’t even know that our own security could be in danger when continuing this journey. When I left home, I didn’t know how difficult this would be. We were so thirsty and hungry, having sat in the blazing sun for hours. I cannot wait to return home. This has been a horrible experience.”

IOM Chad provided the emergency assistance with the financial support of US Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) but additional funds should be mobilized to respond to the increasing migratory pressure in the country.

“In recent weeks, more and more vulnerable migrants like this group are being referred to IOM Chad as movements through Chad are continuously increasing, and migrants often find themselves in life-threatening situations when crossing the desert unprepared,” said Anne Kathrin Schaefer, Chief of Mission of IOM Chad. “While IOM Chad is ready to support, our means and resources are extremely limited and we cannot cope with the increasing demands for humanitarian assistance.”

Recent migration trends in Chad and the security situation in the Lake Chad basin region have increased the pressure on local actors and international agencies such as IOM who do not have the required means to efficiently manage migration flows towards North Africa. In 2018, two Flow Monitoring Points (FMP) were put in place by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) teams in Zouarke and Faya, two areas considered as the key transit points for migration flows towards Niger and Libya. Data collected in these two new FMPs as well as the existing one in Kalait will provide more accurate information on movements towards and from Chad.

In addition, the Tibesti Region in northern Chad, at the border with Libya, continues to attract sub-Saharan workers particularly due to the presence of gold mines considered by some people as an opportunity to make some money before continuing their journey up to Libya. Victims of trafficking were reported by the local authorities who indicated that some of the people transported by traffickers paid by “recruiters” were forced to work in the mines without payment to fully reimburse transportation and “placement” fees.

Financial support to Chad is therefore urgently needed to ensure a global approach to migration management, as well as the dignity and protection of returning migrants and migrants in transit countries.

Operational Context

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

13,chad+country,"GENEVA / N’DJAMENA (30 April 2018) – The UN Working Group on mercenaries has called for more financial and other resources to stop armed conflict in Chad and surrounding countries and to put an end to human rights abuses committed by multiple actors, some of whom are foreign fighters and alleged mercenaries.

The abuses identified include killings and torture. More resources will help millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the fighting, they said.

In a statement at the end of a nine-day visit to the country the UN experts said the activities of armed groups, including Boko Haram, have provoked a huge humanitarian crisis and it is essential for human rights to be put at the centre of efforts to combat them.

“Boko Haram has destroyed communities that have lived and obtained their livelihoods in the Lake Chad region for many years. They have killed around 30,000 people, caused the internal displacement of around two million others and left around 10 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance,” said Patricia Arias, a member of the Working Group delegation.

“Scores of human rights abuses including killings, torture and abductions have been inflicted on the local population, including women and children. Women have been subjected to sexual violence and used as suicide bombers,” she said.

“The Lake Chad region, which is now the centre of Boko Haram attacks and violence, is the site of a humanitarian crisis that affects not only Chad but neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. But the entire country is also challenged by a number of armed conflicts in which foreign fighters and mercenaries are engaged,” she added.

The experts said many people were forcibly recruited into Boko Haram, including nationals of the countries bordering Lake Chad. However, they noted that mercenaries from countries outside the region had also joined the group, reportedly to provide training.

The UN experts say understanding the motivations of people joining extremist groups and engaging in mercenary activities is critical. More than half of the population of Chad are under 18 years old, and about 40 percent live in poverty.

“With such a high poverty rate there are serious risks of young people joining groups like Boko Haram and Daesh for financial and material gains, and in the Lake Chad region, where some of the poorest and most marginalised communities are, the risk is even higher,” said Ms Arias.

However, the Working Group made clear that the security threat was not only focused on the Lake Chad region. In the north, the conflict involving Daesh in Libya had heightened concerns particularly after its recent alliance with elements of Boko Haram.

In the east, the conflict in Sudan had resulted in an influx of thousands of refugees into Chad, while to the south violence in the Central African Republic had had the same effect. During our visit we heard Chad described as “an island surrounded by an ocean of wars”, the experts noted.

“Trans-border criminal activities by armed groups are rampant in parts of the country known as ‘no man’s land’, which are vast open areas that provide routes for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.”

As a result of the violence and armed conflicts, Chad is now hosting more than 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, around 70,000 Chadian citizens have returned mostly from the Central African Republic and are gathered at sites around the country, including N’Djamena.

“The humanitarian situation coupled with security threats is simply overwhelming,” said Saeed Mokbil, another member of the Working Group. “The 2015 suicide bombings by Boko Haram and incidents of internal armed rebellion in N’Djamena have also highlighted the volatile situation in the country,” he stressed.

“Security measures are therefore imperative, but they must be implemented in line with human rights standards. This includes ensuring people arrested for their alleged connection with armed groups like Boko Haram are not held without due process. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure human rights; including fair trial guarantees for detainees in places like Koro Toro are fully respected.

“Promoting development, alleviating poverty, building peace and social cohesion are important in providing durable solutions for the local population. These all require strong regional and international support. Humanitarian agencies seriously need more resources and funding in order to carry out critical programmes to support affected populations,” said Mr. Mokbil.

The Working Group commended positive initiatives by the Chadian authorities, including the ratification of the OAU Convention on the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa. A new penal code adopted last year includes a specific provision criminalising mercenarism. But, so far, there have been no prosecutions under it.

The delegation members held meetings in N’Djamena and visited the returnee and refugee site at Gaoui. They met Government representatives, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organisations and victims of human rights abuses.

The Working Group will present a full report on the findings of its visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

Full statement in French and English

The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination was established in July 2005 by the then Commission on Human Rights. Its mandate was further extended by the Human Rights Council in 2008. The Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world. The Chairperson-Rapporteur is Mr. Gabor Rona (United States of America). Other members are Ms. Elzbieta Karska (Poland) Ms. Patricia Arias (Chile), Mr. Anton Katz (South Africa), and Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen).

The Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.
