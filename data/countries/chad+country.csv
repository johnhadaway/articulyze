0,chad+country,"Oxfam is inherently hypocritical. The core pillar of the humanitarian principle, humanity, emphasizes that the goal of aid should be to alleviate human suffering. As opposed to carrying out the supposedly humanitarian goals of its mission, Oxfam directly perpetuates human suffering. If a humanitarian organization is unable to fulfill its core mandate, that agency must be held accountable for its actions. For that reason, donors must reduce their funding of organizations that are guilty of abuse in crises.

The pattern of sexual exploitation and abuse in the humanitarian sphere has persisted for decades. In 2016, World Vision reported 10 incidents of “sexual exploitation or abuse of a child.” In 2002, Save the Children and the UNHCR investigated abuse. Out of a total of 1,500 surveyed, researchers documented 67 allegations of abuse, some of which included “trading humanitarian commodities and services … in exchange for sex with girls under 18.” Other reports documented cases where children traded “sex with aid workers and peacekeepers in exchange for food” and carried out “lesbian sexual displays.” UN peacekeepers are also part of the problem, causally using the term “peacekeeper babies” for children of native women they impregnate. Clearly this problem has persisted without resolution, and is not a singular, isolated incident.

Within Oxfam specifically, the individual actors that perpetrated the abuse were previously on record for sexual exploitation. The organization admits that Roland van Hauwermeiren, the Oxfam country director in Haiti, “[hired] sex workers in Chad in 2006 — the year that hundreds of thousands of refugees from a genocidal war in Sudan created a public health crisis in Chad.” After being allowed to serve as Haiti’s country director even though Oxfam was aware of the atrocities in Chad, van Hauwermeiren and other aid workers ran a self-proclaimed “whorehouse,” where “girls [wore] Oxfam T-shirts, running around half-naked.” On top of that, Oxfam tried to cover up the scandal by limiting the investigation into van Hauwermeiren. The evidence clearly incriminates Oxfam as an organization. Not only did the organization ignore previous inhumane actions, it tried to hide the evidence.

It is indisputable that Oxfam authorities were completely aware of the atrocities committed by the country director for Haiti. Deputy Chief Executive Penny Lawrence resigned earlier this year, feeling “ashamed” and taking “full responsibility.” Whatever shred of legitimacy came with the argument that this was an isolated incident unknown to the leaders of the organization is gone. These heinous facts demand immediate change within the humanitarian sphere.

The cluster system, a method for organizing aid by creating general categories such as health and shelter, and the institutions backing it continue to grapple with the concept of accountability. Sanctions against poor practices by humanitarian actors are rarely implemented. A variety of watchdog organizations, such as Report the Abuse — dissolved in 2017 — and Code Blue, have been formed to curb abuse but have failed to yield significant results. In the words of the founder of Code Blue, Paula Donovan: ""the world was horrified for a short period of time. Aid groups would say it's terrible, we're going to strengthen our systems and everybody is appeased.” Empty rhetoric and investigative bureaucracy will not bring about any more change than it already has.

Cutting funding to aid organizations who perpetuate human rights abuses is the solution to this problem. The argument that reducing the donations to major NGOs like Oxfam will only hurt the recipients of aid is an unsubstantiated ploy to keep control in the grasp of the “Humanitarian Club,” a group of humanitarian actors composed of the UN and the most powerful international NGOs. There are plenty of local NGOs working on sustainable grassroots efforts to relieve burdened populations. At the moment, these groups receive less than 0.6 percent of global aid. Increasingly, global humanitarian crises are becoming more complex, and the major actors are unable to respond to every situation. Local groups are uniquely able to respond quickly to disasters and shape each response in a culturally sensitive fashion.

Following humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence, aid workers in the field consider accountability the fifth humanitarian principle, and it is intrinsic in these groups’ responses, as they are part of the communities they seek to help. The humanitarian system should focus on transitioning funding away from larger groups that have a record of exploitation towards localized efforts. Humanitarian experts have called for the empowerment of local organizations for some time. Punishing bad actors is the perfect opportunity to support others who have demonstrated a commitment to long-term sustainability and development efforts.

Overall, the facts are clear. Major aid organizations are not doing enough to eliminate exploitation of impacted communities. There is a recurring trend of abuse by humanitarian workers against local populations. The system must find a way to punish these sorts of behaviors. Funding, the instrument that is necessary for the existence of these organizations, can be used as a powerful tool to initiate real change. If Oxfam is faced with the question of its own survival, it will definitely investigate the root of the problem and launch reforms that it has neglected in the past.

The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
2,chad+country,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said that Nigeria had initiated measures to mitigate the negative effects of the shrinking Lake Chad on the people of the area.

The president, who was represented by the Borno Governor, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, stated this in Maiduguri while declaring open the First Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum.

The president, who also sought the support of the international community in addressing effects of climate change, said Nigeria was working diligently to address the plight of the people living on the Nigeria’s side of the lake.

Buhari, who noted that the Lake Chad issues must be treated with the required urgency, called on all stakeholders to share the mission of rescuing the Lake Chad Basin from extinction.

He said there was the need to find workable solutions in resuscitating the lake to the benefit of all member-countries in the region.

He added that the people living in the basin depended on the lake for agriculture, fisheries and livestock for their economic well-being.

Buhari said: “The Lake Chad is very dear to our heart as it is a source of livelihood to over 45 million people living in the Basin.

‘‘This Lake, which is one of the oldest Lakes in Africa, is shared by Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

He noted that the Lake Chad region was formerly an “oasis in the desert”, a hub of economic activities and food security, providing a source of happiness and contentment that contributed to the stability of the sub-region.

He said: “Unfortunately, the ‘oasis in the desert’ is almost a desert now, due to the drying up of Lake Chad occasioned by the effects of global warming and population explosion.”

Edward Kallon, the United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative in Nigeria, said despite the progress made on the security and humanitarian front in recent years, more needed to be done to assure the people of the Lake Chad Basin of their safety.

Kallon said: “The people of this region have suffered for far too long and we need to redouble our collective efforts to address the underlying causes of the crisis.’’

Kallon noted that the forum would enhance the effective participation of local communities defining pathways to the crisis facing the region.

He said: “We must further more enhance cooperation around stabilisation, peace building and conflict prevention.’’

Kallon, who also advocated a multi-pronged approach to Lake Chad Basin crisis, urged the governor to support UN to address the crisis.",Buhari pledges to mitigate effects of drying Lake Chad -,https://theeagleonline.com.ng/buhari-pledges-to-mitigate-effects-of-drying-lake-chad/
3,chad+country,"N’Djamena – On 28 April, 56 Chadian men – including 17 unaccompanied children – were assisted by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, after an operation conducted two days earlier by police forces at the Libyan border.

The operation targeted a network of traffickers transporting individuals to Libya, and led to the arrest of several criminals suspected of migrant trafficking. The 56 persons on board the two vehicles which were transporting them were found in bad physical condition, and were immediately transferred to the IOM sub-office in Faya, 300 kilometres from the Libyan border.

The 17 children were taken care of by the Chadian Red Cross, and the 39 adults received assistance (food and emergency shelter) from IOM. Individuals with serious health conditions (dehydration) were immediately referred to the nearest health centre. In coordination with the local authorities, IOM is now seeking to provide safe travel conditions to all those who wish to return home.

“When we were stopped by the police, we didn’t understand what was happening,” said Mahamet, a Chadian man rescued during the operation. “We didn’t know where we were. When we arrived at the IOM office, the situation was explained to us. We didn’t even know that our own security could be in danger when continuing this journey. When I left home, I didn’t know how difficult this would be. We were so thirsty and hungry, having sat in the blazing sun for hours. I cannot wait to return home. This has been a horrible experience.”

IOM Chad provided the emergency assistance with the financial support of US Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) but additional funds should be mobilized to respond to the increasing migratory pressure in the country.

“In recent weeks, more and more vulnerable migrants like this group are being referred to IOM Chad as movements through Chad are continuously increasing, and migrants often find themselves in life-threatening situations when crossing the desert unprepared,” said Anne Kathrin Schaefer, Chief of Mission of IOM Chad. “While IOM Chad is ready to support, our means and resources are extremely limited and we cannot cope with the increasing demands for humanitarian assistance.”

Recent migration trends in Chad and the security situation in the Lake Chad basin region have increased the pressure on local actors and international agencies such as IOM who do not have the required means to efficiently manage migration flows towards North Africa. In 2018, two Flow Monitoring Points (FMP) were put in place by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) teams in Zouarke and Faya, two areas considered as the key transit points for migration flows towards Niger and Libya. Data collected in these two new FMPs as well as the existing one in Kalait will provide more accurate information on movements towards and from Chad.

In addition, the Tibesti Region in northern Chad, at the border with Libya, continues to attract sub-Saharan workers particularly due to the presence of gold mines considered by some people as an opportunity to make some money before continuing their journey up to Libya. Victims of trafficking were reported by the local authorities who indicated that some of the people transported by traffickers paid by “recruiters” were forced to work in the mines without payment to fully reimburse transportation and “placement” fees.

Financial support to Chad is therefore urgently needed to ensure a global approach to migration management, as well as the dignity and protection of returning migrants and migrants in transit countries.

Turkish charity organization Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH, has opened a water well in the Abeche region of the central African country of Chad, the aid group said in a statement Tuesday.

IHH said the 120-meter deep well can provide water for up to 5,000 people and it is the 332nd water well that IHH has dug in Chad.

The charitable group has opened nearly 6,800 wells in 36 countries since 2000 in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and helped millions of people access to clean water.

An inauguration ceremony was held on Monday which was attended by Abeche Governor Khadidje Assamah.

IHH said it planned to open 5 more water wells in the Abeche region.

Operational Context

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

Enlarge this image erhui1979/Getty Images erhui1979/Getty Images

It's a problem that has come seemingly out of nowhere. Over the last five years a worrisome number of low-income countries have racked up so much debt they are now at high risk of being unable to pay it back — with potentially devastating consequences not just for their economies but for their citizens, many of whom are already living in extreme poverty.

That's the sobering finding of a report by the IMF. And it's got some prominent experts calling for urgent action. Among them is Masood Ahmed. Twenty years ago, as a top official at the International Monetary Fund, he spearheaded a historic agreement to wipe the slate clean for 36 poor countries that were being crushed by their loan interest and repayment bills. NPR spoke with Ahmed — who is now president of the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Global Development — to find out how this latest debt debacle was set in motion, why it has him so alarmed, and what can be done to avert it. (This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.)

Just how far and how fast has this problem spread?

To get a sense, says Ahmed, consider that of the 59 countries the IMF classifies as ""low-income developing countries,"" 24 are now either in a debt crisis or at high risk of tipping into one. ""That's 40 percent of poor countries,"" says Ahmed, ""and it's nearly double the number five years ago.""

Those in most trouble include two countries that have already defaulted on some of their loans: the Republic of Congo and Mozambique. Ahmed notes that these are not loans taken out by individual citizens. ""This is money borrowed by governments,"" he says. ""So the definition of a debt crisis is that they are not able to meet their obligations. They are already unable to pay the interest on their debt or to keep to the repayment schedule they had agreed to.""

Six more countries are also already considered in ""debt distress"" because even though they haven't outright defaulted they've reached a point where they are making only intermittent loan payments or cutting deep into their operations budget to pay off their debt. These are Chad, Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. The remaining 16 are considered at high risk of falling into debt distress soon based on the IMF's analysis of the amount of debt they've taken on compared with how much income their economies can actually be expected to generate in the near future. These too are mostly countries in sub-Saharan Africa such as Ghana, Zambia and the Central African Republic. But the list also includes seven nations from other regions, such as Afghanistan, Haiti, Tajikistan and Yemen.

What happens when a country can't pay its debt? What are the consequences for ordinary citizens?

Ahmed notes that even extremely poor countries offer all sorts of services to their citizens — keeping public order, maintaining health clinics and schools, providing food to people at risk of famine, investing in new infrastructure that can help grow the economy and so on. And even before reaching the point of actual default, governments with unsustainable levels of debt must begin diverting ever more of their budget away from such services so they can meet their debt payments.

The most vulnerable citizens are often the first to suffer. ""For instance, people who show up to their local [public] health clinic that is already only open once a week may now find that it also doesn't have medicines,"" says Ahmed. ""Or that school that was going to open this year to meet the needs of a particular neighborhood, it gets postponed.""

So this is very much an on-the-ground crisis. ""It's easy for us to think of these as abstract financial numbers. But it's very important to recognize that behind these numbers are the lives of people who are already living in very difficult circumstances.""

And what if a government does default?

It gets far worse because the entire economy can be thrown into paralysis. When a government can't meet its existing debt obligations, explains Ahmed, ""that makes it very hard to access new money."" Lenders that provide this type of financing aren't going to want to throw good money after bad. And to keep up daily operations, governments need continual access to credit. Ahmed adds that these operations often include not just the provision of services to citizens but business activities that generate much of a government's income — extracting and exporting natural resources like copper or oil, for instance. These kinds of operations can become impossible without day-to-day credit. ""Just like for a small business, you need to be able to borrow on a day-to-day basis for your cash flow,"" he says.

And as the day-to-day turns into year-to-year?

The consequences can be just as debilitating, says Ahmed. Once a country has defaulted it can forget about taking out loans or floating bonds to fund investments in infrastructure or other measures that would help grow its economy long term. Pretty much every type of lender that poor countries rely on is going to balk. This includes even international financial organizations, such as the World Bank, whose mission is to provide poor countries with low-interest loans or outright grants to help them develop. The thinking of officials at the World Bank, says Ahmed, is going to be, ""I don't want the money to just go to another creditor.""

And so a kind of deadly feedback loop could be created: The country's debts would prevent its economy from creating the growth needed to pay off those very debts.

What about that massive debt forgiveness for 36 countries that you helped broker back in the 1990s — the ""debt relief"" campaign made so famous by celebrities like the rock star Bono. Wasn't that agreement supposed to end debt crises like these once and for all?

Yes, says Ahmed. And for about 10 years the agreement was, in fact, remarkably successful. All sides had recognized their sins — the governments of the borrowing countries that had taken on the excessive debt and also the lenders that had pushed what had been in many cases clearly unsustainable loans — including governments of rich countries like the U.S., commercial banks from those countries and even the IMF and World Bank. In exchange for writing off the debt everyone vowed to be more responsible.

""But after a decade, memories start to get cloudy,"" says Ahmed. ""And these commitments are, of course, not binding. If a country wants to go out and borrow money, they're going to go out and borrow.""

And in recent years a whole new class of lenders emerged to offer up easy credit — most notably the government of China and various associated Chinese banks and development agencies. ""You had Chinese financial institutions and China as a country really expanding its presence and its financial role in developing countries,"" says Ahmed. ""I find really striking [that] between 2013 and 2016 China's share of the debt of poor countries increased by more than the share of all these traditional lenders [who had made the loans back in the 1990s] put together.""

Another factor: In the years since the 2008 financial crisis, interest rates in wealthier countries have been stuck at very low levels. ""So people who have assets and want to invest their money all wanted to look for opportunities."" These include managers of investments funds, pension funds and the like from wealthy countries. They had not historically been major sources of financing for poor countries. But in recent years they started snapping up bonds issued by African countries — whose economies at the time seemed to be growing at a healthy rate. These bonds offered much higher rates of return than bonds from wealthy nations.

Surely the borrowing nations also face some responsibility?

""Some countries quite frankly just took advantage of the availability of money,"" says Ahmed. He points to cases of outright fraud and corruption in Mozambique, Moldova and Gambia — in which government officials borrowed money on behalf of their nations, then apparently pocketed it for themselves.

Then there are cases of countries that derive most of their income from exporting a few commodities — for instance, Zambia, which relies on copper. In recent years, the prices for many commodities fell sharply and stayed flat — depressing their national income.

""Suddenly you find that what you thought was a level of debt you could manage is harder to maintain,"" Ahmed says. Adding to the problem, instead of cutting their national budgets to account for the lost revenue, these countries turned to borrowing to make up the difference.

And then there were the cases of simply less-than-ideal management. ""I'm thinking of countries like Ghana and Ethiopia,"" says Ahmed, ""where they just felt, you know, people are willing to give us the money, let's do it."" And then they failed to use the money for productive investments. ""In many of these countries about half the increase in borrowing was not associated with an increase in investment. It was just used to spend more on current spending, things like salaries.""

So is there a fix?

Ahmed says it's clear some kind of debt restructuring and forgiveness is going to be needed. It will require getting all the creditors to the table to agree on the terms. ""And that is not an easy thing to do.""

Back in the 1990s it took years of grinding negotiations. This time around the process is likely to be even more complicated because so many of the creditors are new to the game. ""The IMF is still a very good place from which to have this conversation,"" he says. But it is essential to bring in China and let it play a leadership role.

Given the challenges, this effort needs to start now, he says. Yet there seems to be a lack of urgency among world leaders. While IMF officials will be discussing the debt issue in Washington this Saturday as part of their annual spring meetings, it's just one of a host of topics on the agenda.

What's more, while the amount of debt involved may be crippling to poor countries, it's just a drop in the bucket of the global economy. This debt crisis is not going to cause a worldwide financial meltdown. So unlike the classic debtors in financial crises who benefit from being too big to fail, these nations could find themselves too poor to warrant a bailout.",A Debt Crisis Seems To Have Come Out Of Nowhere,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/04/20/604169277/a-debt-crisis-seems-to-have-come-out-of-nowhere

10,chad+country,"GENEVA / N’DJAMENA (30 April 2018) – The UN Working Group on mercenaries has called for more financial and other resources to stop armed conflict in Chad and surrounding countries and to put an end to human rights abuses committed by multiple actors, some of whom are foreign fighters and alleged mercenaries.

The abuses identified include killings and torture. More resources will help millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the fighting, they said.

In a statement at the end of a nine-day visit to the country the UN experts said the activities of armed groups, including Boko Haram, have provoked a huge humanitarian crisis and it is essential for human rights to be put at the centre of efforts to combat them.

“Boko Haram has destroyed communities that have lived and obtained their livelihoods in the Lake Chad region for many years. They have killed around 30,000 people, caused the internal displacement of around two million others and left around 10 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance,” said Patricia Arias, a member of the Working Group delegation.

“Scores of human rights abuses including killings, torture and abductions have been inflicted on the local population, including women and children. Women have been subjected to sexual violence and used as suicide bombers,” she said.

“The Lake Chad region, which is now the centre of Boko Haram attacks and violence, is the site of a humanitarian crisis that affects not only Chad but neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. But the entire country is also challenged by a number of armed conflicts in which foreign fighters and mercenaries are engaged,” she added.

The experts said many people were forcibly recruited into Boko Haram, including nationals of the countries bordering Lake Chad. However, they noted that mercenaries from countries outside the region had also joined the group, reportedly to provide training.

The UN experts say understanding the motivations of people joining extremist groups and engaging in mercenary activities is critical. More than half of the population of Chad are under 18 years old, and about 40 percent live in poverty.

“With such a high poverty rate there are serious risks of young people joining groups like Boko Haram and Daesh for financial and material gains, and in the Lake Chad region, where some of the poorest and most marginalised communities are, the risk is even higher,” said Ms Arias.

However, the Working Group made clear that the security threat was not only focused on the Lake Chad region. In the north, the conflict involving Daesh in Libya had heightened concerns particularly after its recent alliance with elements of Boko Haram.

In the east, the conflict in Sudan had resulted in an influx of thousands of refugees into Chad, while to the south violence in the Central African Republic had had the same effect. During our visit we heard Chad described as “an island surrounded by an ocean of wars”, the experts noted.

“Trans-border criminal activities by armed groups are rampant in parts of the country known as ‘no man’s land’, which are vast open areas that provide routes for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and humans.”

As a result of the violence and armed conflicts, Chad is now hosting more than 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, around 70,000 Chadian citizens have returned mostly from the Central African Republic and are gathered at sites around the country, including N’Djamena.

“The humanitarian situation coupled with security threats is simply overwhelming,” said Saeed Mokbil, another member of the Working Group. “The 2015 suicide bombings by Boko Haram and incidents of internal armed rebellion in N’Djamena have also highlighted the volatile situation in the country,” he stressed.

“Security measures are therefore imperative, but they must be implemented in line with human rights standards. This includes ensuring people arrested for their alleged connection with armed groups like Boko Haram are not held without due process. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure human rights; including fair trial guarantees for detainees in places like Koro Toro are fully respected.

“Promoting development, alleviating poverty, building peace and social cohesion are important in providing durable solutions for the local population. These all require strong regional and international support. Humanitarian agencies seriously need more resources and funding in order to carry out critical programmes to support affected populations,” said Mr. Mokbil.

The Working Group commended positive initiatives by the Chadian authorities, including the ratification of the OAU Convention on the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa. A new penal code adopted last year includes a specific provision criminalising mercenarism. But, so far, there have been no prosecutions under it.

The delegation members held meetings in N’Djamena and visited the returnee and refugee site at Gaoui. They met Government representatives, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society organisations and victims of human rights abuses.

The Working Group will present a full report on the findings of its visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018.

Full statement in French and English

The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination was established in July 2005 by the then Commission on Human Rights. Its mandate was further extended by the Human Rights Council in 2008. The Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world. The Chairperson-Rapporteur is Mr. Gabor Rona (United States of America). Other members are Ms. Elzbieta Karska (Poland) Ms. Patricia Arias (Chile), Mr. Anton Katz (South Africa), and Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen).

The Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.

The Nigerian President stated this while declaring open the Lake Chad Basin Governors' Forum in Maiduguri, Borno State on Tuesday.



The lake borders the Central Africa Republic, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria.



Represented by the Governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima at the occasion, Buhari said: ""Lake Chad is very dear to our hearts because it is a source of livelihood to over 45 millions people living in the basin""



While noting that the Lake Chad Basin was one of the oldest in Africa, he said that all people living in the area depends on it for agriculture, fishery and livestock for their economic well-being.



""Unfortunately, what used to be the oasis of the desert is almost a desert now due to the drying up of the Lake Chad as a result of global warming and hazards of population explosion,"" Buhari lamented.



He said the government had initiated several measures to ensure a better life for people at the Nigerian side of the basin.



He vowed to ensure the restoration of the glory of the Lake Chad basin.



In his remark, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Edward Kallon noted that despite the progress made on the security and humanitarian front in recent years, more needed to be done to assure the people of Lake Chad Basin of their safety, livelihood and prosperity.



""The people of this [Lake Chad] region has suffered for far too long and we need to redouble our collective effort to address the underlying causes of this crisis,"" he added.

Chad is an arid, low-income and land-locked country, suffering from chronic food insecurity, denoting alarming levels of hunger. The Global Hunger Index for 2017 places Chad second last out of 119 countries. The economy entered recession and GDP fell from almost USD 14 billion in 2014 to less than USD 10 billion in 2016 due to a sharp decrease in oil prices.

Households are dependent on farming and livestock for their livelihoods. Out of its 14.5 million people, 52.5 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty line (World Bank 2011) and only 52 percent of the school-age population is enrolled in school (2008–2012 UNICEF).

Chad hosts over half a million displaced persons in need of assistance: refugees from Sudan, C.A.R. and Nigeria, Chadian returnees from C.A.R. and people displaced by insecurity in the Lake region. To support long-term displaced population, WFP Chad will gradually shift from relief to resilience. WFP has been in Chad since 1968.

13,chad+country,"ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK, South Africa, May 3 (Reuters) - Almost 50 years after they were hunted to local extinction, black rhinos will again roam the wilds of the Central African nation of Chad, the latest chapter in a movement to bring big mammals back to former ranges on the continent.

On Thursday, six rhinos were flown to Chad’s Zakouma National Park from the South African city of Port Elizabeth, sedated and confined in specially-crafted crates to ensure they don’t cause a commotion mid-air.

The initiative comes against the backdrop of a poaching crisis that saw more than 1,000 rhinos slain in South Africa last year to meet red-hot demand for their horns in Asia, where they are prized for their alleged medicinal properties.

With 18,000 white rhinos and 2,000 of the smaller black rhino, South Africa is home to about 80 percent of the global population of the pachyderms, making it the springboard for reintroduction efforts elsewhere.

""By establishing a viable and secure population of rhino in Chad, we are contributing to the expansion of the rhino population in Africa, and the survival of a species that has faced high levels of poaching,"" said South African Environment Minister Edna Molewa.

No rhino has been seen in Chad since the early 1970s.

African Parks, a non-government organization which runs Chad's Zakouma and other reserves, has also reintroduced rhinos and lions from South Africa to Rwanda and is planning to relocate lions to Malawi.

""We have been using the history of conservation success in South Africa to repopulate other areas in Africa,"" Andrew Parker, director of conservation at African Parks, told Reuters as a hulking rhino lumbered about its holding pen below him.

The Chad-bound rhinos were in the fortified enclosures or ""bomas"" for three months in preparation for their long haul.

The animals have been fed lucerne, a kind of super-nutritious hay, the past few weeks. It will be initially provided to them in Chad as they adjust their diet to new trees and shrubs.

Security has been tight: the animals’ location was kept under wraps, they will be given a police escort to the airport, and in Chad they will be dehorned and fitted with transponders.

Jumbo-sized logistics and planning go into such an operation: the animals were tranquilised in Marakele National Park in northern South Africa and then brought to Addo, which has better facilities.

Cranes hoisted the crates containing the rhinos onto flat-bed trucks and they will be monitored carefully by vets on the plane for the 15-hour trip which involves two stops.

The hope is that the two bulls and four cows will establish a breeding herd which will be the most northern wild population of the species in Africa.
