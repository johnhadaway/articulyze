0,yemen,"TEHRAN – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that Tehran is ready to offer any diplomatic assistance to help resolve the ongoing Yemeni crisis if Saudi Arabia considers a political solution.

Speaking to BBC Arabic in an interview published on Sunday, Zarif said Iran would certainly support a political solution.

He added, “Any approach should be based on inter-Yemeni talks.”

“We believed in the beginning that a political solution should be reached in Yemen. Long before the Yemeni crisis escalated we proposed to Saudi Arabia to help a political approach.”

“The answer was that the affairs of the Arab world did not concern us…. It is a pity that Saudi Arabia and its allies always rejected a political solution and were hoping for victory in a military conflict,” the chief diplomat regretted.

He added, “The current situation is the outcome of the wrong choices Saudi Arabia has made. We do not want to hurt our neighbors. We believe their security is ours. But we are not responsible for their wrong choices.”

A new front has opened in the destruction of archaeological heritage in the Middle East. Across northern Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State (IS) group devastated antiquities during its reign of terror starting in 2014, pulverizing classical statues such as those of Palmyra in Syria and bulldozing a 3000-year-old ziggurat at Iraq’s Nimrud. The IS group has now been routed by Iraqi and Syrian forces, curbing the destruction but giving archaeologists a firsthand look at an aftermath that is grimmer than many had expected. Meanwhile, the assault on antiquity has extended to Yemen, 2000 kilometers to the south, another archaeological treasure house riven by conflict.

“Our immortal history has been wasted by wars,” lamented Mohanad Ahmad al-Sayani, chair of Yemen’s General Organization of Antiquities and Museums in Sana’a.

In Yemen, the cultural losses have gone largely unnoticed by the wider world but are keenly felt by archaeologists. Although the country has been far less studied than Mesopotamia, it played a critical role in the rise of empires and economies in the region starting around 1000 B.C.E., researchers said at a meeting here last week of the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East.

By 1200 B.C.E., the kingdom of Saba in what is now central Yemen controlled the export of frankincense, derived from a tree that grew only along the country’s southern coast. The prized resin was burned for a millennium and a half in temples from Persia to Rome. The vast wealth of Saba—home to the biblical Queen of Sheba—funded impressive temples, cities, and engineering marvels. Among them was the Marib Dam, built on Wadi Adhanah in the eighth century B.C.E. to help expand agriculture in this arid region; some claim it is the world’s oldest dam.

Today, Yemen is racked by civil war and Islamic extremists who, in a campaign against heresy, have destroyed ancient mosques in the port city of Aden, and a multidomed shrine in the Hadhramaut region.

Yemen’s cultural heritage damaged in war Bombs dropped by a Saudi-led coalition have damaged the ancient Marib Dam, a museum in Dhamar, and medieval castles in Aden and Sana’a.

Bombs dropped by the Saudi-led coalition have wreaked the most damage, Al-Sayani said. The Marib Dam, in an unpopulated area far from the capital, was struck in 2015, leaving a deep gash in the well-preserved northern sluice gate. The regional museum of Dhamar in the southwest, which contained thousands of artifacts from the Himyarite Kingdom, was completely destroyed. The Himyarites conquered Saba in 280 C.E., took over the frankincense monopoly, and became key players in the expanding Indian Ocean trade between the Roman Empire and India until Ethiopian forces overthrew them in 525 C.E.

Al-Sayani showed images from a dozen flattened or severely damaged sites, including medieval castles such Aden’s Sira Fortress, and the centuries-old al-Qassimi neighborhood in Sana’a. More than 60 sites have been destroyed or severely damaged since the conflict began in 2015, Al-Sayani said, chiefly from Saudi bombings. Although some were strategic targets, he charged that the Saudi attacks were a conscious campaign to wreck Yemen’s heritage and demoralize its citizens. “After 3 years of assessing the damage, I believe the bombing is being done with a purpose, since many of these sites are not suitable or useful for military use,” he says.

The destruction seems deliberate, agrees archaeologist Sarah Japp of Berlin’s German Archaeological Institute. “The Saudis were given information on important cultural heritage sites, including exact coordinates,” by UNESCO, said Japp, who was based in Sana’a before the war. UNESCO intended to protect the sites, but she fears that the data may instead have been used for targeting. “There is no reason to say all of these [bombings] are just accidents.” The Saudi embassy in Berlin and officials in Riyadh did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Meanwhile, 2000 kilometers to the north in Syria and Iraq, the damage wrought by years of IS group control is only now coming into focus. “It is nothing short of a catastrophe,” said Michel al-Maqdissi, former head of excavations in Syria’s antiquities department in Damascus, who now works at the Louvre in Paris and maintains contacts in Syria.

Some of the worst reports come from Mari, a 60-hectare site on the banks of the Euphrates River that 4000 years ago was one of the world’s largest cities. Just north of Sumer and the Akkadian Empire, Mari served as a key trading center for Mesopotamian goods and Anatolian metals and stone, and once boasted the best preserved early palace in the Middle East.

But no longer. Archaeologist Pascal Butterlin of Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, who worked at Mari for years and has gathered information from Syrian sources, displayed an image of the palace from the ground that shows near total destruction of Mari’s central area. The site’s ancient statues were removed to museums long ago, so the reasons behind the destruction remain murky, although the IS group’s desire to profit from antiquities is well-known. A nearby large mound called Tell Medkouk was bulldozed completely to unearth objects for looting. From satellite data on the center of Mari, Butterlin estimates that looters dug some 1500 pits, many of them more than 5 meters deep and 6 meters wide. The vehicle tracks “make it look like they had traffic jams there,” he said. He suspects that thousands of looted cuneiform tablets, small figurines, and bronze objects won’t show up on the art market for years, as sellers wait for international outrage to cool.

The situation is even worse at Dura-Europos, which until recently was a remarkably well-preserved city upstream of Mari. From the first century B.C.E., this city lay on the frontier of the Roman and Persian empires, which took turns controlling it, and once held both one of the world’s oldest Jewish synagogues and oldest Christian churches. “The scale of the disaster there is profound,” said Chekmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist now at the University of Strasbourg in France. “There are innumerable pits—some 9500—and the necropolis is gone.”

Across the border in Iraq, the old city of Mosul once boasted a host of Islamic and Christian monuments, many destroyed or damaged during the IS group’s 3 years of control. But the worst devastation came last summer, when more than 30,000 bombs and missiles hit historic buildings during the battle for the city, said Karel Nováček of the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Czech Republic. “The old city was annihilated,” he said at the meeting. He charges that the destruction continues, as Iraqi construction crews clear the wreckage without trying to preserve what’s left or tally the damage.

“The heritage management is nonexistent,” he said. “We need careful removal of the rubble, but that is not happening.” His team is assembling what data they can from old reports and photographs that could provide some basis for reconstructing historic sites. He plans to lead an on-the-ground assessment in June, in hopes of providing Iraqis a chance to mend what they can of their battered cultural heritage.","War savages ancient sites in Yemen and Iraq, destroying archaeological record",http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/war-savages-ancient-sites-yemen-and-iraq-destroying-archaeological-record

The Logistics Cluster facilitates the cargo transport via sea on board the WFP-chartered vessel VOS Apollo. The vessel operates on a weekly rotation from Djibouti to Aden.

In March, the UN carried out a brief mission to Mukalla, Hadramout, during the last week of March. The delegation, composed by 18 passengers, travelled on board the VOS Apollo from Aden to Mukalla port on 26 March and returned on 31 March. In light of this, no passengers nor cargo were transported on the Djibouti - Aden - Djibouti legs to ease the rollout of the mission.

A second WFP-chartered vessel, VOS Theia, was chartered to support the Logistics Cluster Yemen operation. The vessel can transport both cargo (600 mt) and passengers (27 per leg). VOS Theia sailed for the first time from Djibouti on 15 March, transporting 93 mt/344 m3 of humanitarian cargo on behalf of PU-AMI, UNICEF and WHO, and berthed in Hodeidah on 17 March. Following this first trip, a schedule will be defined based on the sailing and operating times; currently, a minimum of two voyages per month are foreseen.","Yemen - Humanitarian Imports Overview, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-imports-overview-march-2018
3,yemen,"President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday defended French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, but said he was concerned by the humanitarian situation and would host a conference on the issue before the summer.

""Between now and the summer a joint conference will be held on Yemen to clarify what is being done and what needs to be done,"" Macron said at a news conference alongside visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

When asked about civilian casualties, Prince Mohammed said the coalition was doing everything to avoid civilian casualties in Yemen, but that mistakes were inevitable in conflicts.

Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back arms support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which are leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital

Sanaa.

The Yemen conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million, with no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough to ease the crisis.

Seventy-five percent of French people want Macron to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a YouGov poll found.

""Since the start of the conflict in Yemen, France has adopted a very specific process whereby all sales of military equipment are analysed on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of reinforced criteria that reflect respect for international

humanitarian law and the risk of harm to civilian populations,"" said Macron.

France is the world's third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers.

The comments came at the end of Prince Mohammed’s three-day official visit to France, which saw French and Saudi companies signing draft agreements worth a total of €14.5 billion ($18 billion), according to a French-Saudi business forum.

The memoranda of understanding cover sectors including petrochemicals, water treatment, tourism, health, agricultural and cultural activities, business leaders and representatives of both governments said in a statement.

Rights group files lawsuit in Paris court

On Tuesday, a human rights group filed a lawsuit in a Paris court against Prince Mohammed, accusing him of complicity in torture and inhumane treatment in Yemen.

The complaint on behalf of Taha Hussein Mohamed, director of the Legal Center for Rights and Development (LCRD), said the prince, who is Saudi Arabia’s defence minister, was responsible for attacks that hit civilians in Yemen.

The rights group, based in the Houthi-controlled Yemeni capital Sanaa, says on its website it monitors and documents rights’ violations in Yemen.

“He ordered the first bombings on Yemeni territory on March 25, 2015,” the group’s lawyers, Joseph Breham and Hakim Chergui, said in the complaint seen by Reuters.

“The existence of indiscriminate shelling by the coalition armed forces affecting civilian populations in Yemen can be qualified as acts of torture,” they wrote.

The complaint also accuses the coalition of depriving millions of people of access to basic necessities due to indiscriminate bombings and a naval blockade of Yemeni ports. The war has pushed the country to the brink of famine.

Saudi Arabia could participate in Syria strikes

While the war in Yemen drags on, the Saudi crown prince said his kingdom could also take part in military action against Syria after an alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma killed at least 40 people over the weekend.

""If our alliance with our partners requires it, we will be present,"" said Prince Mohammed.

Earlier Tuesday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters that a number of countries were holding consultations on how to respond to a chemical weapons attack in Syria and called for those responsible to be held accountable.

""Our position is that those responsible have to be held accountable and brought to justice,"" he said.

As the US and its European allies contemplates a response to the Douma attack, Macron said France will target the Syrian government's chemical weapons capabilities if the international community decides to strike the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

""Our decision will not target allies of the regime or attack anyone but rather attack the regime's chemical capabilities,"" he told a press conference, insisting he did ""not want an escalation"".

Macron said France's information had shown ""that chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"".

The Syrian government and Russia has said there was no evidence that a gas attack had taken place and the claim was bogus.

Hours after the Assad regime invited international inspectors to send a team to Syria, the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it would soon deploy a fact-finding mission to Douma.

4,yemen,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The spokesman for a Saudi-led coalition said on Tuesday that its military campaign in Yemen was not aimed at establishing a permanent presence along the country’s West coast but at restoring its internationally recognized government.

A Yemeni official had told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates would likely seek to remain deployed along the country’s Red Sea coast, where it is currently fighting an offensive against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.

“Saudi Arabia and UAE are very worried about Iran’s influence, so they are seeking to keep some military presence on the Yemeni coasts even if the civil war ends,” said the official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

In a response to a request for comment, the coalition denied the allegation.

“The coalition is working by all means to restore Yemen’s legitimacy so it can become stable and secure”, spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement.

“The Yemeni Republic will restore its role in protecting its lands and territorial waters, as well as contributing to the maintenance of regional and international security,” he added.

The kingdom and its mostly Gulf Arab allies intervened in a civil war in Yemen in 2015 to roll back the Houthis after they had pushed the government into Saudi exile.

Coalition and Yemeni forces have been making modest territorial gains in recent months against the group in an armed push moving northward from the Bab al-Mandab strait toward the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah.

5,yemen,"In early April 2018, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres reported that the Yemen crisis had become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Approximately three quarters (equivalent to over 22 million) of Yemen’s population were in dire need of humanitarian assistance and protection. Of this 22 million, 11.3 million are children. Nearly every child in Yemen is affected by the crisis.

At the 2018 High-Level Pledging Event in Geneva for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, which was convened by the UN and the governments of Sweden and Switzerland, Guterres outlined the needs of the Yemeni people. In accordance with the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen, close to $3 billion is required to help more than 13 million people across Yemen.

Guterres identified that about 18 million people in Yemen are food insecure, with the number having increased by a million since the conference in 2017. This number includes 8.4 million people who ‘do not know how they will obtain their next meal.’ As a recent CNN article reported, ‘both sides are using food as a weapon of war.’

Not only is food an issue, millions of people in Yemen do not even have access to safe drinking water. Last year alone, this resulted in over a million cases of diarrhoea and cholera. In December 2017, the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that over a million cases of cholera had been reported since spring 2017 making this the worst cholera outbreak in two decades. Children under the age of 5 accounted for a quarter of all reported cholera cases. The World Health Organisation confirmed over 2,200 cholera-related deaths in statistics gathered to December 2017. The risk of another cholera epidemic remains high.

In all walks of life in Yemen, even treatable illnesses become a ‘death sentence.’ According to Guterres, one child under the age of five dies of preventable causes every ten minutes. In the time it takes to read this article, a Yemeni child has died from an illness that would not result in fatalities in other countries. Children are the main victims of the Yemeni conflict and the humanitarian crisis. UNICEF reported that over 5,000 children were killed or injured, an average of five children every day since the escalation of hostilities in March 2015. Over 1.8 million children are acutely malnourished. 400,000 of them are fighting for their lives, according to January 2018 reporting of UNICEF. As confirmed by Guterres, ‘nearly half of all children aged between six months and 5 years old are chronically malnourished and suffer from stunting, which causes development delays and reduced ability to learn throughout their entire lives.’ The use of child soldiers is widespread. Many children are forced, by the dire situation, to work to support their families. Young girls are subjected to forced marriage. The most recent assessment suggests that over two-thirds of girls under the age of 18 are married, with a large percentage of them being under the age of 15. Over two million children do not attend school. As Edward Santiago from Save the Children concluded in early 2016 ‘an entire generation of children – the future of Yemen – is being abandoned to their fate.’ Two years after that statement, the situation of children in Yemen has only deteriorated to the point that their future seems bleak.

While the conference focused predominately on the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it cannot be forgotten that the conflict remains ongoing. Until it is concluded, there will be no sustainable solution to this humanitarian crisis, driven by conflict.

The conflict began with the Houthis, a minority Shia group which took over the US-backed government and the capital. Very quickly, the conflict escalated to involve multiple actors and gave fertile ground for terror groups such as al-Qaeda and Daesh to flourish in the region. Civilians continue to be the indiscriminate victims of the ongoing conflict. They are subjected to ‘indiscriminate attacks, bombing, snipers, unexploded ordnance, cross-fire, kidnapping, rape and arbitrary detention.’ Women and girls face sexual and gender-based violence. Guterres reported a 30% increase in women and girls seeking assistance available to the victims of sexual and gender-based violence.

While the ongoing conflict was not discussed at the 2018 High-Level Pledging Event in Geneva for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, it did advocate for an ‘urgent cessation of hostilities and a political solution for Yemen’. Two of the most generous donors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, pledged $1 billion combined. This is a great support from the region. However, it cannot be forgotten that both countries continue to play a part in the conflict. Guterres reportedly suggested that the military and humanitarian action should be kept separate. Should it? Perhaps not in light of the evidence that, only a few days ago, a Saudi-led air strike killed several civilians, including children. Few could also forget that in late 2017, Saudi Arabia failed to fulfil its promise to reopen humanitarian aid corridors. Is it still charity then?",Yemen Became The World's Worst Humanitarian Crisis,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2018/04/05/yemen-became-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis/
6,yemen,"A ship unloads a cargo of wheat at the Red Sea port of Hodeida, Yemen, April 1. The port, controlled by Shiite Houthi rebels, is key to feeding the capital, Sanaa, and Houthi regions. Some 17.8 million Yemenis are considered 'food insecure.'

—By the third anniversary of Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen last week, the coalition it leads – backed by the United States and Britain – had carried out 16,749 airstrikes against one of the poorest nations on earth. The United Nations blames coalition bombs for causing two-thirds of the more than 10,000 deaths in the conflict.

Shiite Houthi rebels marked the three-year anniversary of a war the UN blames for creating the ""worst man-made humanitarian crisis in the world” by launching seven missiles deep into Saudi territory. Three fell on the capital Riyadh, killing one civilian, in the most extensive counter-strike of its kind.

But two days later, while Yemenis braced for a military response, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave a strong indication that the kingdom has also begun to focus on humanitarian needs in the war, which has created widespread hunger and a raging cholera epidemic.

The crown prince presented $930 million from Saudi Arabia and its chief coalition partner, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to UN Secretary-General António Guterres in New York – a sum that meets nearly one-third of a $2.96 billion UN appeal for 2018.

That philanthropic largess will be welcomed tomorrow in Geneva, where the UN is convening a high-level pledging conference for Yemen. The cash is part of a $1.5 billion package announced by Saudi Arabia in late January, which is meant to include the expansion of Yemen’s port capacity and opening of 17 “safe passage corridors” for aid supplies, mostly in non-Houthi areas.

But Yemenis affected by the war and analysts alike say the Saudi donation aims more at repairing the kingdom’s own damaged reputation than at ending a war where it plays the decisive role. Indeed, the Saudis have also hired American and British firms to wage a concerted public relations campaign.

“The money the Saudis are giving is like make-up on its face,” says Abdulrashid Al-Faqih, executive director of the Mwatana Organization for Human Rights in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which has been under Houthi control since 2015.

“All the warring parties are responsible for this suffering, but first is the Saudi- and UAE-led coalition,” says Mr. Al-Faqih. “What would be better than this [money] would be if Saudi Arabia stopped the war in Yemen. It’s not enough for Yemen to receive humanitarian aid as long as the war continues.”

April Longley Alley, project director for the Arabian Peninsula for the International Crisis Group (ICG), articulates only a slightly more positive view of the Saudi initiative, though she reaches a similar conclusion.

Humanitarian 'Band-Aid'

“Over the last several months, it’s very clear the Saudis are taking the reputational damage seriously, and they are mobilizing resources to address it,” she says. “This is especially true around their humanitarian plan for Yemen that they just announced.

“In some respects, it’s very good, right? They are now focusing on the humanitarian crisis…. The UN has a humanitarian plan. It needs to be funded. That’s a very positive development,” says Ms. Alley, speaking from Dubai after visiting Yemen’s southern, coalition-controlled port city of Aden.

“But the larger picture has to be that humanitarian aid is a Band-Aid, and the reason we need that humanitarian aid is because of the conflict,” she says. “So as long as the conflict continues, it’s just going to create more of a need.”

The Saudi-led military intervention was initially meant to last just three months, to reverse a Houthi takeover of Yemen and restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

But as “Operation Decisive Storm” dragged on it was renamed “Operation Restoring Hope.” Mr. Hadi is still the nominal president, but rules from exile in Riyadh, and steady coalition bombing has devastated civilian infrastructure, from hospitals and factories to bridges – and led to war crimes charges.

A strict air, land and sea blockade – which Saudi Arabia promised to ease last November, with little follow-through so far – has meant that critical food and goods are too expensive for most. The UN says a “record” 22.2 million Yemenis, some 75 percent of the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018, 3.4 million more people than last year.

Children face trauma

Marie-Christine Heinze, a Yemen expert and president of the Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient (CARPO), a think tank in Bonn, Germany, argues that despite the Saudi humanitarian plan, the kingdom is not likely to scale down its military campaign.

“They continue the blockade, they continue to bombard civilian infrastructure, all of which continues to impact the humanitarian situation on the ground.... I don’t see this as a change,” says Ms. Heinze.

More broadly, the scale of bombing has “traumatized a whole population,” especially a generation of children, she says.

“Even if the war came to an end tomorrow, we would have to deal with the consequences of this for decades,” says Heinze. “You also have the conflict on the local level, the sectarian undertones, the hatred, the propaganda that is now not only dividing regions, north and south, but dividing governorates, villages, whole communities, dividing families – that’s going through the social texture in a way that [can’t] be easily mended.”

More than 79 percent of children experienced “severe symptoms” of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as being “unable to cry or unable to feel happy,” according to an independent survey published by CARPO. More than 900 Yemeni children were examined after the first year of the Saudi intervention, during which the coalition bombed Sanaa several times a day.

By comparison only children in northern Iraq, in the aftermath of Saddam Hussein’s genocidal Anfal campaign against Iraqi Kurds in 1988, registered similar levels of PTSD, according to this study. Today that impact would be greater, since Yemen’s children have been subject to two more years of conflict.

Yet the coalition air war – supported by American and British intelligence and advisers, and critically by US aircraft mid-air refueling capacity – is just one factor in Yemen’s suffering.

Food security

“Yemen is one of the most food insecure countries in the world,” where vulnerable populations in one out of three districts “are facing heightened risk of famine and require integrated response efforts to avert a looming catastrophe,” the UN states in its current appeal.

The conflict “exacerbated the poverty and vulnerabilities that were entrenched in Yemen before 2015,” says the UN. The result today is that 17.8 million Yemeni are “food insecure,” with 8.4 million of those “severely food insecure and at the risk of starvation.”

Such figures, and the widespread perception that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the bulk of Yemen’s civilian agony with little military result, has stung in Riyadh. Crown Prince Mohammed, 32, is the Saudi defense minister and architect of the war. He is nearing the end of a three-week visit to the US, where he met President Trump, lobbied for support for his shock-therapy reform program at home, and defended the Yemen war.

He told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that the Houthis are “using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy,” and charged that the Houthis “block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and a humanitarian crisis.”

Early in the prince’s visit, the Senate narrowly defeated a bipartisan bill to end US refueling of coalition jets and intelligence support. Defense Secretary James Mattis argued that both the refueling and US advice on how to target were aimed a “reducing the risk of civilian casualties” by preventing “rash or hasty” decision by pilots running low on fuel during bombing runs.

It’s not clear how the announced Saudi plan will mesh with the multibillion dollar UN aid strategy.

Those Saudi steps are “very problematic” because they are not yet defined, says the ICG’s Alley. In the case of the ports they appear to be a bid to shift away from reliance on the crucial, Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, which feeds the capital and Houthi regions.

“Three years in, there is no longer a Yemeni state, per se. There is no longer one country, [it] has fragmented along historical divides, and you have various power centers,” she says. “This is a largely stalemated, grinding war of attrition on many of these fronts…. It’s a multi-layered conflict, even inside Yemen.”

Civilian casualties

Saudi Arabia has addressed criticism of the war in other ways. A reporter for The Wall Street Journal was allowed rare access last month to the command center in Riyadh, for example, from which Yemen military operations are conducted.

Saudi officers spoke of trying to minimize civilian casualties in its mostly combat missions over Yemen.

“We’ll watch for hours, days sometimes, and not strike to protect civilians,” Maj. Gen. Abdullah al-Ghamdi was quoted as saying, while watching a live feed from a drone over Yemen that he said showed a group of fighters hiding in a compound.

The Houthi missile strike was a “message” to Saudi Arabia on the war anniversary, Alley says.

“The perception from their side is that, until Saudi Arabia feels pain from its side domestically, they are not going to be serious about negotiations,” she says. “That’s the Houthi perspective.”

For human rights activist Al-Faqih, in Sanaa, the deaths of civilians on any side is condemned. But the Houthi’s seven-missile strike a week ago pales in comparison to the coalition’s near-17,000 airstrikes – a figure from the Yemen Data Project.

“The airstrikes were almost all focused on destroying the interests of people, like attacking factories, the markets,” says Al-Faqih. “The military campaign conducted by the coalition is against the people, it’s not really against Houthis – it’s against Yemenis.”

High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian crisis in Yemen

Co-hosted by the United Nations, Switzerland and Sweden, the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen was held in Geneva on 3 April. The event brought together participants from 64 Member States, regional organizations, UN agencies, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and Yemeni national NGOs. Participants pledged a total of US$2.01 billion for the humanitarian response in Yemen. If fully disbursed through the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP), these pledges will account for almost 70 per cent of the YHRP funding requirements this year. The pledges were made by 40 Member States and organizations, including the Central Emergency Response Fund. Donors recognized the effectiveness of pooled funds, with 13 donors pledging contributions to the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.

The Geneva event was also intended to raise awareness of the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Yemen; advocate for urgent action by the international community to address growing and acute humanitarian needs; highlight the capacity and commitment of humanitarian partners to meet all targets in the 2018 YHRP; promote respect for International Humanitarian Law and human rights; advocate for protection of civilians and humanitarian personnel; safe and unimpeded access and accountability; and advocate for an urgent cessation of

Unverified reports from local authorities indicate that while about 500 households have returned to Al Dhaher and Shada’a districts, more than 600 households have recently been displaced from Razih and Monabbih to Sahar, As Safa’a and Sa’adah districts.

During the reporting period, humanitarian partners continued the distribution of cash assistance through local implementing partners in Sa’ada and Al Jawf governorates, targeting 37,600 beneficiaries in Sa’ada and 50,000 in Al Jawf. The distribution will continue until the end of April.

Distribution of emergency shelter assistance to 500 displaced households from Kitaf in Nasreen area, Sa’adah district, is ongoing.

Aden Hub: The number of IDPs who are reported to have fled to the southern governorates since last December has increased to over 9,500 households with a surge of new arrivals reported over the last week. Notable were 244 new households arriving in Abyan governorate and another 298 households reported in the district of Al Mukha in Taizz. All appear to be fleeing the front lines in southern Al Hudaydah and in Taizz governorates. Rapid response partners are coordinating the verification/assessment and the response to the new arrivals.

A health assessment in Usaylan and Bayhan districts in Shabwah governorate has found that limited health services are being provided to recently displaced people. The Health Cluster is working with partners to address the gaps. Other recent assessments show varying needs across southern governorates. In the Al Mishkafa IDP temporary settlement in Lahj governorate, key needs include health, water and sanitation, and shelter. City. Airstrikes were also reported in Jabal Ras, At Tuhayat,

Zabid, Bayt Al Faqih, and Hays districts, with no reported civilian casualties. In Hajjah governorate, local authorities reported that 142 families have fled military operations in Midi district to neighbouring Abs. Fighting and airstrikes were also reported in Haradh and Bani Qais districts. Humanitarian partners are planning a vaccination campaign following reports of an increase in suspected measles cases. Between 1 January and 31 March, 131 suspected cases were reported in Hudaydah with two associated deaths. A malaria spraying campaign is also planned in Al Luheyah and Az Zuhrah districts where reports of increased cases have been received. Malaria is endemic along the Red Sea coast of Yemen.

Ibb Hub: Staff at Al Mudhaffar hospital in Taizz governorate have called for urgent support to keep the hospital functioning and for their salary payments to be reinstated after almost 15 months. The hospital receives 350-500 patients every day, but lacks fuel, oxygen and medical and therapeutic supplies. WHO is planning to support the hospital from its office in Aden.

An assessment in Al Mukha and Dhubab districts in Taizz has identified water and sanitation, shelter, food and health needs. The assessment which was conducted by Adenbased partners recommended interventions including multi-purpose cash assistance, maintenance of wells, general food distribution and other responses related to protection and shelter. One partner is verifying needs amongst 3,000 households in Al Mukha and Dhubab before initiating the distribution of non-food items.

Sana’a Hub: Although Sana’a hub saw aerial attacks, including in areas not too far from the international airport and in Faj Attan area in As Sabain district in Sana’a city on 4 and 5 April; the Protection Cluster’s weekly monitoring report for 22-28 March notes a decrease in incidents to five compared to eight in the previous reporting period.

Of these, four incidents were reported in Sirwah in western Marib and included airstrikes and shelling. No civilian casualties were reported, but 20 farms and six houses were understood to be damaged. In Al Bayda and Amran governorates, fighting and airstrikes reportedly resulted in casualties. The fighting also temporarily blocked the road from Al Bayda to Marib.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 04 – 09 April 2018 | Issue 10,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-04-09-april-2018-issue-10
8,yemen,"(CNN) The war in Yemen is now the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people -- three-quarters of the population -- in desperate need of aid and protection,United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said.

As the conflict enters its fourth year, millions are without access to clean drinking water and the country is at high risk of a cholera epidemic, Guterre said at a donor conference in Geneva on Tuesday.

He said over 8 million people in the country ""did not know where they will obtain their next meal,"" and that ""every ten minutes, a child under five dies of preventable causes.""

With many struggling to support their families, child marriage rates have also risen. ""Nearly two-thirds of girls are married before the age of 18, and many before they are 15,"" said Guterres.

The month of March marked important events in Yemen-U.S. relations. It was just three years ago that a Saudi-led coalition began its offensive against Houthi rebels in Yemen. That offensive, marked by destruction of schools and hospitals, bombings of funerals and weddings, and a blockade of life’s essentials, has been aided and abetted by the U.S. military from the beginning, and continues today.

The month of March also marked attempts by our Congress to reverse our unauthorized complicity in this war. In the House, Rep. Davie Loebsack thankfully agreed on March 15 to co-sponsor a resolution calling for an end to our unauthorized military actions in Yemen. In the Senate, a similar resolution was brought to the Senate floor on March 20. Regrettably, our Iowa senators voted to table (kill) the resolution, denying a vote on the resolution itself. They were among the 55 senators who refused to take up the resolution.

The month of April may see more cholera, starvation and war in Yemen. It could also see the U.S. Senate forced to take up the question again, with the opportunity to halt our disgraceful complicity In this war. Sens. Ernst and Grassley frequently refer to their duty to support the Constitution. They could start by exercising their Constitutional responsibility in matters of war. Experts have indicated that if the U.S. stopped its aid to the Saudi coalition, the war could end and relief could resume.

10,yemen,"The Better Business Bureau is advising Nova Scotians to suppress their curiosity when they see an unfamiliar international number come up on their phones, warning that there's a scam waiting on the other end of the line.

Recently, many Nova Scotians missed calls that appeared to be from Yemen.

Peter Moorhouse, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau serving the Atlantic provinces, said those missed calls weren't an accident — they were part of a scam that they first issued warnings about in 2014.

""When [people] call back, very often what happens is it sounds like they're on hold.... They've unknowingly connected to a service that the charges [from] are going to show up on their next phone bill.""

Charges can run to hundreds of dollars

Moorhouse said the scam involves robocalls that may or may not be from Yemen — scammers could be using technology to mask the actual origin of the calls — that hang up after one ring. These robocalls are programmed by a computer and dial hundreds of numbers a minute, targeting particular areas, hence the wave of calls to 902 numbers.

""The company is making money through a pay-per-minute phone service, so the scammers have one of those services set up and you're connecting to it when you call [back].

Moorhouse said it's too soon to tell the impact of this most recent wave of calls, but ""in the past we've heard of charges as low as $19.95 appearing on the next phone bill, and as high as a few hundred dollars if someone had stayed on the phone for quite a long time, so the risk is there.... It's really best not to call these numbers back.""

If it's important, they'll leave a message

Jessica Gunson, with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, said the centre has also received reports of receiving missed calls from numbers with a Yemen area code.

Their advice, like the Better Business Bureau, is to ignore it.

""We always recommend, don't answer a call that you don't recognize the number. Don't call the number back. If it's something very urgent and someone needs to get a hold of you, they will either call back or they will leave you a message.""","Mysterious missed calls from Yemen a scam, Better Business Bureau warns",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/missed-calls-from-yemen-scam-warns-better-business-bureau-1.4612928
11,yemen,"ADEN, 9th April, 2018 (WAM) -- Saeed Al Ali, Director of the Emirates Red Crescent, ERC, in Aden, and Major General Abu Bakr Hussein Salem, Governor of Abyan, discussed the humanitarian and services needs of Abyan Governorate, in the presence of Eng. Saleh Baleedi, Director of the Water and Sanitation Institution of the Governorate and Relief Coordinator.

Both sides talked about the support provided by the ERC, the humanitarian arm of the UAE, to Abyan, especially in terms of electricity, water and health, as well as its urgent humanitarian aid.

Salem praised the UAE’s support for Yemen’s liberated governorates, including Abyan, which it provided for through the ERC, as per the directives of the wise leadership, led by President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to assist the Yemeni people.

He added that the local authorities in Abyan are ready to cooperate with ERC teams, which will start their work in the coming days, to assess the needs of the governorate. Both sides have already discussed the need for a cleaning fund and waste removal equipment, he further added.

Baleedi highlighted the key support offered by the ERC to the institution in 2016, including its emergency projects in the districts of Zinjibar and Khanfar, which involved extending water supply networks, restoring control valve rooms, providing four engines, maintaining the interior of the control centre of the main generator that supplies Khanfar, as well as constructing a base to guard the water wells of Zinjibar.

Baleedi added that these projects have positively affected the lives of local residents, by restoring water wells that have not worked for many years and providing water to every home in Zinjibar and Khanfar.

He explained that the work for the Year of Zayed 2018 will begin with a water project in Lawdar, which has a sizeable population, as well as digging of new wells in Al Hadan, constructing storage tanks and establishing supply lines.

Baleedi predicts that completion of the water project in Lawdar will represent progress and provide comfort to the district’s citizens, who were deprived of such projects over previous years.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. On Thursday, the Trump administration told Congress it’s approved a $1.3 billion artillery sale to Saudi Arabia. This is the second weapons deal between the U.S. and Riyadh in as many months and has sparked concern from human rights groups, who warn the deals may make the United States complicit in war crimes committed in the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. Lawmakers have 30 days to act before the sale is final.

The announcement comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wraps up his whirlwind tour of the United States, where he reportedly met everyone from President Donald Trump to Microsoft’s Bill Gates to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Time magazine’s cover features a photo of bin Salman’s face with the words “Charm Offensive.” The magazine notes that by the end of his visit, the 32-year-old prince will have visited five states, plus the District of Columbia, four presidents, five newspapers, numerous business tycoons, and celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey.

One topic that’s received relatively little media attention during his trip is his role in escalating Saudi Arabia’s military involvement in Yemen. Last month marked three years since the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition began its military offensive in Yemen, leading to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. During a CBS interview on 60 Minutes, host Norah O’Donnell briefly questioned Prince Mohammed bin Salman about Yemen.

NORAH O’DONNELL: Do you acknowledge that it has been a humanitarian catastrophe—5,000 civilians killed and children starving there?

CROWN PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN: [translated] It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia ceases using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community. They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and a humanitarian crisis.

AMY GOODMAN: The U.S.-backed, Saudi-led airstrikes and naval blockade have destroyed Yemen’s health, water, sanitation systems, sparking a massive cholera outbreak—it’s believed a million Yemenis have cholera—and pushing millions of Yemenis to the brink of starvation. More than 15,000 people have died since the Saudi invasion in 2015. Last month, back-to-back airstrikes from a Saudi-led military coalition tore through a residential neighborhood in the coastal city of Hudaydah, killing 12 civilians, including seven children. This is Mohamed al-Helleisy, who was injured in the attack.

MOHAMED AL-HELLEISY: [translated] We were sitting down, and the planes were flying above us. As soon as I decided to go to sleep, a rocket hit us. I only gained consciousness when the whole building was collapsing on us. I started digging in the rubble and burnt my leg in the process. Then the second rocket hit us.

AMY GOODMAN: Last month, 10 Senate Democrats joined a majority of Republicans in a 44-to-55 vote that rejected a bill seeking to end U.S. military involvement in the Saudi-led war.

Well, for more, we’re joined by Iona Craig, journalist who was based in Sana’a from 2010 to '15 as the Yemen correspondent for The Times of London. She joins us here in New York. She's in town today to receive the George Polk Award for documenting, in a story for The Intercept, the destruction and civilian casualties of a covert U.S. Navy SEAL raid on a remote village in Yemen. It was last year. It was when the Trump administration first came into power.

Iona Craig, welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s nice to have you in studio. Congratulations on your George Polk Award.

IONA CRAIG: Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to start off by talking about this latest news. I’m not sure where Mohammed bin Salman is now—in Houston or in Hollywood—as he continues this, what was called the “charm offensive,” and the lack of critical media coverage of him. But talk about Saudi Arabia’s role in the catastrophe that is Yemen today, and the U.S. role.

IONA CRAIG: Well, the war in Yemen started, really, back in 2014, but it escalated massively once the Saudis got involved, which was on March 26, 2015, so over three years ago now. And as a result of that, the import restrictions they’ve imposed on the country, the bombing campaign that has destroyed the infrastructure across the country, the economic collapse that has followed that now means that 22 million people are in need of humanitarian aid. According to U.N. figures, the majority of casualties in the war have been down to the Saudi-led bombing campaign. And you’ve got, you know, 8 million people facing famine. So, the humanitarian situation is disastrous. There is no immediate prospect to even political talks going on or a solution to this conflict right now.

And the U.S. involvement in that, as we’ve seen in the last few days, is the continuation of supporting the Saudi coalition, particularly by weapon sales. The latest one is artillery, so it’s for the ground war. It’s for howitzers specifically. But prior to that, it has been a continuation of selling bombs for the air campaign, in refueling the fighter jets, in helping with intelligence to select targets in the bombing campaign, where there have been many claims of violations of international humanitarian law. I mean, there was this one brief period at the end of the Obama administration when there was the suspension of precision-guided weapon sales to Saudi Arabia, but that was then quickly lifted. And despite the fact that lawmakers have been trying to put more pressure on the issue of this support for the Saudi coalition—and there has been more public awareness—this doesn’t seem to materialize in any indication that either the U.S., the British or the French are going to withdraw that support or even question the Saudis heavily or put pressure on them heavily about the conflict in Yemen and the impact they’ve been having there.

AMY GOODMAN: So, give us some of the figures. A million people are believed to have cholera?

IONA CRAIG: Over a million suspected cases of cholera, more than a thousand deaths. When I was last in Yemen, those numbers, although they were still growing, the rate of cholera was actually reduced, because of the intervention by U.N. agencies and NGOs in Yemen. Diphtheria has become an issue more recently, in the last few months. Because of the healthcare collapse, less than 40 percent of the hospitals are now operating in the country. Several have been—many have been bombed. The people can’t access healthcare, so you’ve now got issues of people dying from preventable diseases. So when you talk about 15,000 deaths in the war, that’s in the violence, if you like, of the conflict, whereas many, many more people are dying as a result of the healthcare collapse, from the humanitarian crisis, and starvation, particularly, amongst children and amongst the very old, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: General Joseph Votel, the head of the U.S. Central Command, recently admitted the Pentagon isn’t fully aware of what exactly Saudi Arabia is doing with U.S. bombs in Yemen. Votel made the admission during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. Your response?

IONA CRAIG: Well, the issue with that is, it’s about end use of these weapons, when it comes to issues of violations of international humanitarian law, when you’ve got mass civilian casualties, where we know U.S. bombs have been used, because you can pick up the remnants on the ground. I’ve been into a house in Sana’a that was a residential home where two children were killed, and found the bomb remnants there, traced the serial numbers, and they were American-made. And so, it’s very easy now for the people on the ground to do exactly that. So they know where these weapons are coming from.

And for the U.S. not to know what the end use is, where these bombs are ending up, in the sense of causing potential violations of international humanitarian law, does make the U.S. complicit. And people should be deeply concerned about that. And although the Saudis have said that they will carry out their own investigations into these strikes where there have been claims of violations of international humanitarian law, there have been no real independent inquiries now onto what’s going on on the ground. And for the U.S. not to know where their weapons are ending up, when quite clearly they have been killing civilians, should be a deep concern to everybody.

AMY GOODMAN: You come here soon after that Senate vote took place, 55 to 44 rejecting a bill seeking to end U.S. military involvement in the Saudi-led war. Among those leading this were Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Senator Sanders of Vermont. How much responsibility does the U.S. have here in this humanitarian catastrophe?

IONA CRAIG: Well, the real issue over the War Powers Resolution was: Are the U.S. involved in active hostilities in Yemen, or are they involved in potential active hostilities? And I think the issue is—from what I’ve seen, is yes, as far as the potential is concerned. There have been—you know, the U.S. Navy warship was targeted by the Houthis. They certainly see the U.S. as a belligerent. There’s been a U.S. drone taken down in Yemen. The U.S. obviously is heavily involved in the bombing campaign being able to operate, because of the refueling of fighter jets that the U.S. is responsible for, and in intelligence, which is quite an essential part of it, in order to select targets in the air campaign.

The U.S. did provide the Saudis with a no-strike list, if you like, of targets that shouldn’t be hit. And there have been clear cases where that has been violated, if you like, where targets have been hit which have been on that no-strike list. But the U.S.—the bombing campaign wouldn’t be able to operate without the U.S. support.

But it’s really unclear, as well, how much the U.S. is involved, let’s say, in the blockade aspect of it, in the import restrictions, because you’ve got U.S. warships in the Red Sea now, where they weren’t stationed before. Yes, they were involved in anti-piracy further south, off the south coast of Yemen. But where they were targeted by the Houthis was in the Red Sea, and that’s the crucial area where imports need to go into the country, on the western Red Sea coast into Hudaydah, in order to bring commercial goods into the country, when Yemen, even in peacetime, imported 90 percent of its food. And so, that raises real questions about the U.S. involvement in this de facto blockade, in these import restrictions that are having such devastating consequences for the civilian population.

AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about Mohammed bin Salman here. Talk about the media fawning over the man who’s been really in charge, now the crown prince, of the attacks on Yemen. What is the media missing?

IONA CRAIG: Well, I think the media is helping in the cycle of support, really, for the Saudi-led coalition, in doing very little critical reporting, very little serious questioning of both Mohammed bin Salman and the coalition at large. Mohammed bin Salman was the minister of defense, of course, back in 2015, and was really the one who launched this campaign into Yemen in the first place, back in March of that year. And there has a real, it appears, reluctance, both diplomatically, politically, to put serious pressure on the Saudi-led coalition, in order to maintain both strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia but also these financial benefits that come out of the weapons sales.

And the media has really been part of that, without being seriously critical or, in interviews with Mohammed bin Salman, when they’ve happened, without really pushing him or the Saudi coalition on those aspects of what is happening on the ground in Yemen. It feeds into this continuous cycle of very rarely pushing the Saudi coalition or the Saudis on their activities in Yemen. And so we’re kind of helping that noncritical aspect of support for the Saudis’ intervention in Yemen and the ongoing war.

AMY GOODMAN: Mohammed bin Salman in Hollywood, in Houston?

IONA CRAIG: Yes. I mean, when—it was interesting, actually, when he was in New York at the U.N., because that came over the same time as the anniversary, if you like, of the Saudis’ intervention. And on that day, the Houthis fired multiple ballistic missiles into the kingdom, as a mark of that anniversary, if you like. And when the Houthis had done that in the past, of firing missiles, the Saudis have responded immediately with heavy bombing, particularly on the capital Sana’a and in the north, where the Houthi stronghold is, in Saada. That didn’t happen this time. And I think my perhaps skeptical assessment of that was that Mohammed bin Salman, once he was in New York, did not want to have an issue over mass civilian casualties in Yemen or any airstrikes that cause civilian casualties, like we’ve seen in the last few days, whilst he was either in Washington or in New York, obviously, pushing forward this PR campaign that he’s been doing over the last few weeks in the U.S.",Trump Inks Arms Deal with Saudis as Humanitarian Crisis Rages in Yemen & Saudi Prince Tours U.S.,https://www.democracynow.org/2018/4/6/trump_inks_arms_deal_with_saudis
13,yemen,"A Yemeni human rights group has filed a lawsuit in a Paris court against the visiting Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, accusing him of complicity in torture in their country, in what may prove an embarrassment for the French government as it welcomes its powerful guest.



A French lawyer representing the Legal Center for Rights and Development filed the suit against the crown prince, currently in France on an official visit, for his leading role in the Saudi-led coalition’s airstrikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.



The criminal lawsuit claims Bin Salman knowingly targeted civilians.



Joseph Breham, one of the lawyers involved, said French courts had “universal jurisdiction” to investigate the case since the lawsuit was filed on Monday while the prince was on French soil. However, he acknowledged Bin Salman could not be arrested by French authorities because of his diplomatic immunity.

The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said the lawsuit was ridiculous. He told reporters in Paris that the Houthis were to blame for stealing humanitarian aid, using human shields and reneging on peace agreements, and that “the lawsuit should be filed against them”. He insisted Saudi actions in Yemen had complied with international humanitarian law.

The legal complaint will automatically trigger the opening of a formal judicial inquiry by a French investigating judge.

“Mr Bin Salman’s immunity does not prevent judges from investigating the case nor, when he has no longer a rank as head of state or when he comes on a private visit to France, from questioning him at that time, or eventually from trying and convicting him,” Breham said.

The lawsuit claims that “massive and indiscriminate attacks” against civilians in Yemen represented torture as defined by the United Nations’ committee against torture, as they caused “pain and widespread suffering” among the country’s people.



Press reports, experts and non-governmental organisations have documented multiple violations of international humanitarian law by the Saudi-led coalition, resulting in the deaths of many civilians, including from the bombings of homes, markets, hospitals, businesses and schools, the lawsuit said.



Bin Salman, who was defence minister when Saudi Arabia launched the war in Yemen, allegedly provided the means and instructions for these crimes of torture to be committed, the lawyer said.

Bin Salman, who arrived in France on Sunday for several days, is to have dinner with President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday evening at the Élysée Palace.

Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back arms support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which are leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa.

The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million, with no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough to ease the crisis.

Seventy-five percent of French people want Macron to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a YouGov poll found. Several rights groups also have warned of possible legal action if the government does not halt its sales.

“Since the start of the conflict in Yemen, France has adopted a very specific process whereby all sales of military equipment are analyzed on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of reinforced criteria that reflect respect for international humanitarian law and the risk of harm to civilian populations,” Macron said at a news conference alongside Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

France is the world’s third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers.

Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defense and economy ministries.

Details of licenses are not public and, once approved, are rarely reviewed.

Stressing concerns over the humanitarian situation, Macron said he would host a conference in the coming months to see what more could be done, although he backed the Saudi-led coalition’s actions in Yemen.

“France’s position is clear: full support for the security of Saudi Arabia, condemnation of the ballistic activity coming from the Houthis, willingness to find a political solution to the conflict and strong humanitarian demands on civilian populations,” Macron said.

A Yemeni rights group on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed in France, accusing him of complicity in torture and inhumane treatment in Yemen, lawyers said.

When asked about civilian casualties, Prince Mohammed said his country was working to modernize its rules of engagement to avoid civilian casualties, but said that in “military operations throughout history, whatever the country, there were mistakes.”","France's Macron defends Saudi arms sales, to hold Yemen conference",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-saudi-yemen/frances-macron-defends-arms-sales-to-hold-yemen-conference-idUSKBN1HH30P

(CNN) The Middle East today is poised between multiple wars fueling extremism and a burgeoning younger generation looking for a new start.

Prince Mohammed has presented himself as a voice of moderation at home. But abroad, the story is different.

When the White House rolls out the red carpet for the newly empowered crown prince this week, President Trump must prioritize holding him accountable for his country's conduct on the world stage, starting with Yemen.

Yemen presents a catastrophic case study of what can happen when the center cannot hold. The country is consumed by at least five ""mini-states"" at varying degrees of conflict with one another. Their conduct is ruthless and feeds radicalism, but the main players are deaf to pleas from the outside world to end the killing.

Saudi Arabia is not the only culprit in Yemen's descent into hell, but it is the most powerful player. While the Houthis are also guilty, nothing justifies the Saudi-led three-year bombing campaign that has destroyed hospitals and schools and killed countless civilians.

Since December's White House call to end the suffering, the Saudi-led coalition has, according to the Yemen Data Project, carried out over 860 airstrikes in Yemen - one strike roughly every 100 minutes. More than one-third of these have struck civilians, including markets, farms and schools.

Riyadh has generously pledged almost $1 billion to the UN aid appeal for Yemen. But Saudi Arabia cannot play both arsonist and firefighter. Its behavior is damaging Saudi and American reputations, without making the region more secure. Instead, al Qaeda exploits the chaos to expand its foothold in Yemen, and Iran gains clout.

Saudi Arabia's de facto and longstanding blockade of Yemen's main Hodeidah port is, in spite of recent modifications, still preventing large quantities of food, fuel and medicine from reaching millions of people. Commercial flights to the country's main Sana'a airport have been similarly blocked for over 18 months.

A UN panel of experts recently accused Saudi Arabia of using the threat of starvation as a weapon of war.

Our staff from the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council work every day to navigate a byzantine set of inspections and impediments to assist communities in desperate need. Just to travel between the country's two main cities, Aden to Sana'a, humanitarian agencies have to pass through more than 70 checkpoints. And spiking fuel prices due to low supply make the drive more expensive than ever. Several major medical suppliers have already stopped direct deliveries to Yemen, forcing organizations like ours to find alternative and complicated arrangements.

President Trump needs to make Saudi conduct in Yemen a priority in his talks. Three concrete steps are essential.

First, Trump must bring Saudi Arabia to its senses: Piling human suffering on the people of Yemen is not strategic or defensible. Instead, commercial, civilian and humanitarian supplies need to flow freely to all parts of Yemen. This includes granting visas to aid workers and letting UN inspectors do their jobs. It also means demanding a permanent opening all Red Sea ports to commercial imports. The White House's past efforts that resulted in the blockade's temporary lifting proved half measures at best.

Second, President Trump must publicly commit US support to international efforts to restart peace talks. This includes empowering the new UN Special Envoy, and a new UN Security Council resolution that reflects current conflict dynamics, offers a more realistic framework for negotiations without preconditions and demands an immediate ceasefire. Without a political settlement, the human suffering will plummet to new depths and continue to overwhelm responders like IRC and NRC.

Finally, Yemen needs more than a war economy. Aid organizations cannot be a substitute. This means replenishing hard currency reserves in Yemen's Central Bank as promised, and paying essential civil servants.

The US has a unique ability to influence Riyadh's actions. There have been some good words, but so far no effect.

WASHINGTON — After U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier this week called Yemen “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” leading aid boss David Miliband has warned things could get even worse as humanitarian groups continue to be stymied by access issues that prevent them reaching those most in need.

“It’s got bad, but it could get worse,” said Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, during a conversation on Yemen at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s important that in the humanitarian world we don’t only work on things that have gotten really, really bad, but we’re working on things that could get worse.”

Some of the most dire civilian consequences from the war in Yemen aren’t coming from air strikes and direct armed conflict, but from lack of access to necessary food and health services. According to the IRC, more people have died in Yemen from starvation and preventable diseases than from conduct of war. Seventy-nine percent of the population in Yemen is now in need of humanitarian aid and 9.3 million people are being denied life-saving health services to which they have the right under international law.

Food and medical supply shortages caused by a Saudi Arabia-led coalition blockade of Red Sea ports have deadly consequences when basic medical supplies cannot enter the country, leaving state-run facilities without what they need to fight both communicable and non-communicable disease.

“This humanitarian disaster is not an accident. People talk about ‘access’ problems, as if the problem is that people are hard to reach. No. The problem is that they are made hard to reach,” Miliband said. “The conflict is in fact notable for its crimes as well as its tragedy. This is a man-made conflict with very deep roots and very, very acute consequences.”

Once goods do make it inside the country, a gauntlet of checkpoints drastically slows down the ability of humanitarian organizations to efficiently disperse aid to people who need it the most. Miliband said that for IRC teams to travel the 300 miles from Aden to Sana’a, they must pass through more than 70 checkpoints — an average of one checkpoint every 4.3 miles. It can take three to six weeks of planning to get one IRC truck on the road.

Along with widespread destruction of the country’s basic infrastructure, the rising price of gas makes pumping water more expensive. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation has led to the largest cholera outbreak in history, with more than 1 million suspected cases. Humanitarian organizations are forced to spend more funds on trucking water around the country, depleting already strapped budgets, because more than half of the Yemeni population doesn’t have access to clean water.

Because of the blockade, Yemeni fuel imports have dropped by half. Miliband said $50,000 previously covered 90 days of supply transport for IRC, but now it only covers 20 days.

“We are stretched liked every other humanitarian organization on the ground by a really extraordinary and acute degree of need, of political crisis, and frankly of conflict,” Miliband said.

On Tuesday, the U.N. raised $2.01 billion in humanitarian aid at a high-level pledging conference in Geneva. That fell short of the $2.96 billion goal, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledging $500 million each. The U.K. pledged $239.7 and the U.S. pledged $87 million.",IRC's Miliband warns Yemen crisis could worsen as access woes deepen,https://www.devex.com/news/irc-s-miliband-warns-yemen-crisis-could-worsen-as-access-woes-deepen-92491

• More than 1.2 million people in need are located in the most inaccessible parts of Yemen

• A fire at a WFP warehouse in Al Hudaydah destroyed over 3,420 MT of relief food items

More than 9.2 million people in need in areas with high access constraints

In February 2018, focus group discussions were conducted with partner organisations, including UN agencies, INGOs and national NGOs, about access challenges in Yemen. The exercise, which was first conducted in August 2017, indicates that more than 1.2 million people in need are located in the most inaccessible areas of Yemen, with an additional eight million in areas where humanitarian actors face obstacles on a regular basis. This combined total of 9.2 million marks a slight increase compared to August 2017, when 8.9 million people were assessed to be in areas with high or medium access constraints.

Overall, access constraints were reported in 90 per cent of districts, with the most prevalent being related to administrative, security or infrastructure-related challenges. Armed conflict remains one of the main drivers of access constraints, both in terms of the type and severity of access difficulties. In conflict-affected areas along the western coast, for instance, partners reported an increase in interference by local authorities in the humanitarian activities compared to August 2017, including in terms of the types of the permitted activities.

Participants identified administrative restrictions to be a growing challenge for humanitarian operations. In August 2017, for instance, INGOs principally reported difficulties with sub-agreements with implementing partners. In February 2018, UN agencies, international and national NGOs all reported difficulties with sub-agreements in 34-45 per cent of districts. The Humanitarian Access Working Group and humanitarian partners continue to review the results of focus group discussions, with a view towards adjusting operational and advocacy strategies to reach people in need across Yemen.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Hudaydah Hub: Investigations are underway to establish the cause of a fire that destroyed a warehouse in Al Hudaydah port on 31 March. WFP is assessing the extent of damage but initial reports indicate that the fire destroyed over 3,420 MT of relief food items.

The intensity of fighting along the coastal areas of Hudaydah has reduced slightly, especially in Al Khawkhah and Hays districts, but civilian casualties were reported from aerial bombardment, according to partners. Fighting continues in Haradh and Midi districts, Hajjah governorate. Humanitarian partners registered 341 newly displaced families in Jabal Ras district and verified another 662 in Hudaydah city. As of 27 March, nearly 7,000 newly displaced families were being assisted.

Aden Hub: An inter-agency mission to Mukalla from 26-31 March enabled UN heads in Aden to engage with local authorities in Hadramaut governorate. Priority lists presented to the UN did not change from recent interactions, and highlighted concerns for food security, malnutrition, IDP arrivals and large-scale returns from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The mission found that there is a large number of national NGOs ready to collaborate with the UN, both in implementing projects and to build their capacity to become implementing partners.

About 1,200 community volunteers and 255 religious leaders (male and female) continue to engage with IDPs and host communities across the southern governorates, promoting life-saving water and sanitation practices and immunization; raising awareness about child recruitment, as well as cholera and diphtheria in 18 districts. Over 92,300 people have been reached.

Ibb Hub: Humanitarian partners report the distribution of shelter and non-food items to 216 households in Maqbanah district, Taizz governorate. During the reporting period, 15 displaced children were enrolled in school. Meanwhile Cluster partners are responding to the needs of new arrivals in Wadi Kabeer in Mukha district, where recent rapid assessments reported new conflict-related displacement of about 136 households.

Authorities in some areas of Taizz governorate have been able to control the prices of cooking gas, bringing down the price of a 20-litre cooking gas cylinder from 2,500 YER to 2,300 YER (approx. 5US$). There are, however, areas where the price remains as high as 8,000–10,000 YER (approx. 20US$ in the black market) for a 20-litre cylinder of cooking gas.

Sa’ada Hub: A sharp escalation in airstrikes was reported in Sa’ada and Al Jawf governorates. On 29 March, at least 14 airstrikes struck the vicinity of Sa’adah city. At least seven civilians, including five women were reportedly killed. Several other airstrikes were reported in various districts during the reporting period, with civilian casualties and damage to residential houses.

Humanitarian partners in Al Jawf governorate report that only 64 out of 107 health facilities are functional. In Sa’ada, only 108 out of 170 are functional. The nonfunctionality of these facilities and security concerns have affected the overall humanitarian response.

Sana’a Hub: Fighting was reported in Qayfah area in Al Qurayshyah and Wald Rabi’ districts in Al Bayda governorate, Sirwah district in Marib gvernorate and Nihm district, in Sana’a governorate; with casualties. Airstrikes were reported in Marib, Amran and Sana’a governorates. Despite the violence, humanitarian partners continued to implement various programmes.

In Dhamar governorate, dialysis medical supplies sufficient for 1,000 dialysis/renal failure treatment sessions were delivered to Dhamar General Hospital. The facility is equipped to accommodate 70 patients per day but receives almost 400 patients, mostly IDPs. Renal failure is not among the priority areas in the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, but the Health Cluster is seeking ways to support the 32 dialysis centres in the country.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 26 March – 03 April 2018 | Issue 9,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-26-march-03-april-2018-issue-9

Re “Senators Uphold Trump’s War Powers,” rejecting a measure “to halt American military support for the deadly Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen” (news article, March 21):

When they met in Washington recently, President Trump could have pressed hard for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to end Saudi airstrikes and blockades in Yemen. But Mr. Trump, who had tried to head off the congressional measure, celebrated arms sales to Saudi Arabia, though according to an official he “did raise humanitarian concerns in Yemen.”

I cannot so easily ignore the human toll of the war in my country. All sides have committed violations against civilians, but Saudi Arabia’s 16,000 airstrikes have caused the vast majority of the thousands of civilian deaths. Its blockade has obstructed humanitarian and commercial shipments, sending over eight million Yemenis to the brink of starvation and causing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.

Some opponents of the Senate resolution argued that the Senate needed to wait and more fully debate America’s role in this terrible conflict. But three years of war in my country have made clear that Yemen can’t wait much longer for America to realize it has been on the wrong side of history.
