The U.S. tries to distance itself from Saudi war crimes in Yemen—but it’s always been America’s war too.

Without first seeking congressional approval, the United States launched into action alongside the Saudis, offering logistical support and training to the Saudi military.

The U.S. government has long sought to distance itself from the morally inexcusable war on Yemen—but this public relations effort is even more difficult after The New York Times reported on May 3 that, in December of last year, U.S. Special Forces (commonly known as the Green Berets) deployed to Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen. Though Saudi Arabia and the UAE are occupying parts of Yemen, the countries rely on Yemeni, Latin American, Sudanese, Blackwater and even al-Qaeda mercenaries to fight on the ground. Mercenaries also include former U.S. Military officer Stephen Toumajan, who commands the UAE’s military helicopter branch. The Saudi-Yemeni border, on the other hand, represents the only front where Yemeni and Saudi soldiers are engaged in direct on-the-ground combat. By placing American special forces at the Saudi-Yemeni border, the United States is engaged in direct combat with Yemen’s Houthis.

Not only does this reality contradict the Pentagon’s previous statements about its involvement in Yemen, it also brings into question the U.S. government’s intended goals. Is the U.S. military so committed to achieving Saudi Arabia’s mission to regain control of Yemen that it is willing to risk American lives? Alternatively, if the U.S. is advising and training soldiers, repairing and refueling aircraft, patrolling Yemeni waters alongside Saudi Arabia and now fighting Yemenis on the ground, is it really just Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen?

Following the latest revelations of the increased U.S. role in Yemen, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he would seek “further clarification on these activities,” while Rep. Mark Pocan urged Congress to “stop this secret, unconstitutional war.” Yet members of Congress ought to consider that this has always been America’s war—from the very beginning.

Under the pretense of restoring Yemen’s United Nations-recognized president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadito power and curtailing Iran’s supposed influence in Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition—including the United States—launched a brutal military campaign on March 26, 2015. Arms dealers across the world rushed to capitalize on a golden opportunity: customers with deep pockets.

Despite purchasing the latest “smart” bombs that, in theory, should minimize civilian casualties, the Saudi-led coalition continues to kill staggering numbers of civilians in Yemen. These include indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure that have led to the collapse of the health, economic and educational sectors in Yemen. Recently, airstrikes targeted a wedding party that left the bride and 32 others dead, while the injured endured an hour-long journey to the nearest Doctors Without Borders-supported hospital using donkeys. Saudi Arabia and its allies are also using starvation as a weapon by imposing a land air and sea blockade that keeps food and medicines out, while trapping people in. Despite committing apparent war crimes in Yemen, they continue to be assisted militarily by members of the international community.

Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States continue to sell billions of dollars' worth of arms to the Saudi-led coalition despite warnings from human rights groups about their use against Yemeni civilians. But immoral as they are, selling weapons to warring parties does not in itself constitute the seller’s military entanglement in the buyer’s war. In this regard, however, the United States distinguishes itself from most countries not officially in the Saudi-led coalition. As we enter the fourth year of the war on Yemen, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the United States is, in fact, at war with Yemen.

Without first seeking congressional approval, the United States launched into action alongside the Saudis, offering logistical support and training to the Saudi military. Specifically, the U.S. Army trains Saudi soldiers, advises military personnel, and helps maintain, repair and update vehicles and aircraft sold to the Saudis. The U.S. Army also refuels Saudi aircraft mid-air in Yemeni airspace. This support is not without compensation: The U.S. Army boasts123 contracts in Saudi Arabia totaling more than $120 million per month.

This level of involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen prompted members of Congress to invoke the War Powers Resolution twice since October 2017—once in the House and once more in the Senate—to challenge the unauthorized U.S. role in Yemen. The House measure (H.Con.Res.81) was stripped of its privileged status and was therefore not granted a vote in Congress. The Senate bill (S.J.Res.54), introduced by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), fared better in that it was not stripped of its status. However, rather than voting to extricate the United States from hostilities in Yemen, Senators instead voted to table the bill. The extent of U.S. support to the Saudi-led Coalition, however, continues to be uncovered.

As the U.S. Congress fails to take responsibility for withdrawing U.S. support from the Saudi-led war, the world’s worst humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East. With more than 80 percent of the population in need of humanitarian aid, most Yemenis are unable to find food, water, medicine, fuel and other basic necessities of life. While some reports indicate at least 10,000 civilians have been killed in the war, a less-reported figure is the death of 113,000 children—63,000 in 2016 and another 50,000 in 2017—whose lives were cut short due to malnutrition and preventable diseases such as cholera. The crisis in Yemen is the direct result of a three-year bombing campaign and blockade imposed on Yemen by U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As Yemen’s wealthiest neighbors continue to destroy it, the United States has responded by secretly increasing its military role.

1,yemen,"TEHRAN, May 04 (MNA) – Senior Adviser to Iranian Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Hossein Jaberi Ansari, who is currently leading an Iranian delegation in talks with four European states on Yemen crisis in Italy, said that ending crisis in Yemen is one of the regional policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Iran’s senior negotiator in talks on regional crises made the above remark after a meeting with the Secretary General of the EU diplomatic service, Helga Schmid and director general of the Italian, German, French and British foreign ministries for political and security affairs and said, “the meeting was mainly centered on developments in Yemen.”

Main goal behind the talks between Iran and four European states was to explore avenues to end Yemen crisis and find a way out of the situation in the impoverished states, Jaberi said, describing Thursday’s discussion on Yemen as good.

“Yemeni crisis has taken up terrible humanitarian dimensions, as we witness a widespread human catastrophe and the silent death of a nation,” he said, reiterating Iran’s endeavors to bring the crisis to an end.

This was the second such a session held after a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on February, 2018, focusing on political and humanitarian situation in Yemen.

Participants in the meeting agreed to hold the next round of the talks in Brussels in following the fasting month of Ramadhan in the second half of the June.

• Deconfliction requests increased in April compared to March.

100,000 PEOPLE DISPLACED TO SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES BY SIX MONTHS OF CONFLICT

Over the last six months, the intensification of the conflict in Yemen’s western coast has prompted the displacement of 100,000 new IDPs in areas reached by humanitarian partners based in the Aden hub. Since December 2017, displacement has been reported in Abyan, Lahj and Aden governorates, with close to 5,000 families now residing in coastal areas of Taizz and Al Hudaydah.

The new IDPs have mostly originated from conflict areas of Al Hudaydah, Taizz and Shabwah governorates.

Humanitarian partners coordinated rapid assessments to areas with new arrivals and responses to basic needs have taken place in Al Khawkhah, Hays and Al Mokha. However, humanitarian access in districts like Mawza remains difficult. Preparations to respond to additional needs generated by continued fighting in Taizz are ongoing and locations for pre-positioning relief stocks have been identified.

The rapid increase in IDP numbers, although expected, has stretched the capacity of the Aden Humanitarian Coordination Team which had to expand operations into new areas in Abyan, Lahj and Shabwah governorates.

Funding and partnerships will be required by the clusters to sustain and complement the existing relief operations and respond to additional population movements.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Sana’a Hub: The Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster reports that 294 families (approximately 2,000 people) who were recently displaced from Al Jawf Governorate to Harf Sufyan District in Amran Governorate will receive non-food items and emergency shelter kits as emergency assistance. In Al Bayda Governorate, fighting was reported in Nati’ and Al Qurayshiyah districts. An assessment by a local NGO of 224 recently displaced households found IDPs living in open areas in urgent need of clean drinking water and latrines, shelter, food and education. The district health unit in Nati’, which was damaged in recent fighting, needs to be rehabilitated.

Ibb Hub: Clashes have again erupted in Taizz City between government forces and armed groups, forcing several markets to close. Clashes were also reported in Maqbanah district, and north and east of Taizz City. Humanitarian partners fear that clashes could potentially displace up to 22,000 families. During the reporting period, a food distribution programme for 28,000 families was suspended following the killing of an ICRC worker on 21 April in the outskirts of Taizz City. Other humanitarian agencies continue to respond to various needs in Taizz and Ibb governorates. On 2 May, two trucks carrying nutrition supplies that were held in Al Hoban, At Ta’iziyah district, on 26 April, were released.

Al Hudaydah Hub: Partners are preparing to deliver two-month food assistance to targeted families among the estimated 900 families living near active military lines in Al Hayma, At Tuhayat District, and to support two nearby health units. Another 113 newly displaced families from Al Hudaydah, Sana’a and Taizz governorates have reportedly arrived in Al Hudaydah City. In Al Mahweet Governorate, 45 displaced families from Nihm District (Sana’a Governorate) have been identified in Shibam Kukaban districts. Following reports of increase in dengue and malaria cases in Al Hudaydah; Al Thawrah and Olfi hospitals will be supported to treat complicated cases; local health facilities will also be supported with supplies to ensure case management.

Sa’ada Hub: Heavy rains and flooding in Al Jawf Governorate on 23-24 April affected about 800 households in Bart Al Anan District. Water wells and farm land were inundated and partially damaged.

Humanitarian partners are discussing how to respond to the urgent needs of those affected, particularly the need to provide shelter assistance, medicines, water, food and cash. During the reporting period, aerial bombardment and fighting intensified in Sa’ada, casualties were reported.

4,yemen,"Conflict Background

Yemen has a weak, highly decentralized central government that has struggled to rule the northern Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the southern People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Since the unification of these entities in 1990, Yemen has experienced three civil conflicts. As the poorest country in the Arab world, Yemen faces serious food and water shortages for a population dispersed over mountainous terrain. The country’s weaknesses have been exploited by Saudi Arabia which shares a porous border with Yemen. Further, the instability of Yemen’s central government has created a power vacuum filled by foreign states and terrorist groups. The central government has never had effective control of all Yemeni territory.

Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was president of Yemen for 34 years, secured his power through playing factions within the population off one another. The Yemeni conflict is not solely a result of a Sunni-Shia conflict, although sectarianism plays a role. The 2011 Arab Spring re-energized the Houthi movement, a Zaydi Shia movement, which led to the overthrow of the Saleh government. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi took office as interim president in a transition led by a coalition of Arab Gulf states and backed by the United States. Hadi has struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including insurgency, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to former president Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.",A Conflict Overlooked: Yemen in Crisis,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/conflict-overlooked-yemen-crisis
5,yemen,"In 2015, Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi established his government in the southern city of Aden after being forced by Houthi rebels to flee the capital, Sanaa.

As the threat of the rebels grew, southern forces closed ranks around Hadi to defend the coastal city and other areas in the south with the support of a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia.

However, from the very beginning, this was a forced alliance in a region where separatist feeling prevailed even before the war. The south was an independent state until unification with the north in 1990.

Today, after three years of conflict and despite the expulsion of the Houthis from most of the southern territory, distrust among separatists towards Hadi has only grown.

In January, the Southern Transitional Council (STC) broke its alliance with the Yemeni government and, after several days of clashes, the Security Belt - STC militias - took control of Aden. Since then, the flags of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen have once again been seen flying in the city, signalling renewed aspirations for southern independence.

In the south, the conflict with the Houthis feels increasingly distant. However, the region is affected by the threat of al-Qaeda, a problem that has taken root in some southern areas experiencing frequent deadly attacks.

Caught in the long-running conflict, civilians keep bearing the brunt. More than 40,000 displaced people, who arrived in Aden from other areas of the war-torn country, scrape by in slums and makeshift desert settlements, abandoned to their own fate.

The difficulty of accessing potable water has led to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Children are particularly affected. The health crisis is aggravated by the lack of medical personnel in public hospitals, where workers have not been paid for several months.

Years of fighting and corruption have also led to oil scarcity at public petrol stations, which has in turn triggered huge price rises at private ones and on Aden's black market. As a result, power cuts are frequent and residents are often unable to run generators due to the fuel scarcity.",Struggle and survival in war-torn Yemen,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/struggle-survival-war-torn-yemen-180429125920605.html

Al Hudaydah: Health sources reported that at least 20 civilians were killed and 47 were injured by airstrikes on a wedding ceremony in Bani Qais District in Hajjah Governorate on 22 April. Other sources have up to 40 people killed. The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. In Abs District, an airstrike on an IDP house reportedly killed five civilians including one woman and injured one man from the same family. WFP distributed 2,700 food baskets through an implementing partner in Al Khawkhah District. Following the identification of seven positive cholera cases in Al Hudaydah city, ICRC conducted a verification test to all suspected water sources used by patients and found one borehole contaminated by the cholera vibrio. The borehole was immediately closed and the Rapid Response Team was activated to ensure chlorination of all water sources across the Governorate.

Aden: Partners continued to assist the current IDP caseload. Although the humanitarian response has improved through stronger coordination with subnational clusters, some gaps remain in Shabwah,

Hadramaut and Al Maharah Governorates. OCHA is working with sub-national clusters to address those gaps. Additionally, in order to effectively respond to increased displacement in areas along Yemen’s western coast, humanitarian partners have started to pre-position different type of stocks including energy biscuits, hygiene kits, drinking water, transitional shelter and non-food items to be dispatched to selected service points in Hays and Al Khawkhah within 24 hours. During the reporting period, a rapid need assessment was conducted in Khanfir, Zingibar, Lawdar Districts in Abyan Governorate and Al Had District in Lahj Governorate. Findings indicate that there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance in the sectors of water, sanitation and hygiene, food and shelter. However, there is no need for rapid health response as it is being covered by existing health facilities services and mobile clinics. A multi-sector assessment conducted in Al Khawkhah District in Al-Hudaydah Governorate concluded the need for sustained interventions in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and nonfood items, protection, food and health. A multi-sector assessment in Bayhan District, Shabwah Governorate reported that there are 700 displaced families. More than 90 per cent of the IDPs lack access to water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and non-food items ad face specific protection concerns.

Sana’a: Ground fighting in Al Bayda Governorate escalated during the reporting period, resulting in the displacement of approximately 50 families. OCHA is working with shelter cluster to ensure that the needs are addressed. The latest report of the Civilian Impact Monitoring Project (CIMP) covering Amanat Al Asimah (Sana’a City), Sana’a and Marib Governorates indicates that the number of civilian impact incidents fell again for the third consecutive week, from four to two. One of the incidents was in Al Haymah Ad Dakhiliyah District in western Sana’a, and the other was in Bani Al Harith in the north of the capital city. Both incidents were caused by airstrikes. Although there were no civilian fatalities, three civilians were reportedly injured and civilian infrastructure was damaged. Authorities in Sana’a have formally informed the World Health Organization that the implementation of the cholera vaccination campaign in the areas under their control is rejected.

Sa’ada: The protection cluster reports that in the period from 12 to 18 April, the number of civilian impact incidents in Sa’ada increased from 23 to 30. Although the number of incidents increased, the number of civilian casualties decreased, dropping from 41 to 12. Contrary to previous weeks, casualties were the result of shelling (67%) or small arms fire (23%). Airstrikes also hit water infrastructure and a school in Razih District, potentially leaving 3,000 households with restricted access to basic services.

UNICEF issued a statement on the recent incident that targeted a water project in Sa’ada Governorate on 13 April. The Al-Hamazat water system in the Sehar District in Sa’ada Governorate was completely destroyed in an attack that left 7,500 people, including IDP families, without water. During the attack, the nearby solar energy system which provides power to the water system was also severely damaged. The water system had already been destroyed in 2015 and was later rebuilt in 2017. UNICEF stressed that damage to water infrastructure jeopardizes efforts to prevent another cholera outbreak in Yemen.

Ibb: Western frontlines in Taizz Governorate witnessed a military escalation during the reporting period. On 20 April, 20 people were reportedly killed when their vehicles were hit by airstrikes in Mawza District.The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. A multicluster rapid assessment in Mawza District of Taizz Governorate found that humanitarian situation of some 655 IDP families displaced within the district since May 2017 is dire with 98 per cent of the IDPs scattered in open areas, living in shelters made from straw without any basic water sanitation and hygiene services. The report indicates also that women and children (less than 12 years old) are the majority of the IDPs. WFP reported completing the in-kind food distribution cycle of March, targeting approximately 527,000 people in Taizz Governorate and 344,880 people in Ibb Governorate. A distribution of non-food items by UNHCR to 71 households in Dhu-Sufar District in Ibb Governorate was postponed to next week due to access constraints. The two main hospitals (AlJamhoury and Al- Thawrah) in Taizz city have closed their dialysis departments due to lack of supplies.

The head of ICRC’s detention program in Yemen, was deadly shot in an attack on his vehicle by unknown armed men on 21 April in Taizz Governorate. The humanitarian community has widely condemned the killing; in his statement of 22 April the UN SecretaryGeneral reminded all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law concerning the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts and called for a prompt, effective and transparent investigation.

• Continued fighting in Yemen’s western governorates of Al Hudaydah and Taizz has displaced more than 19,000 households.

• The losses caused by the fire in the WFP warehouse in Al Hudaydah on 31 March amount to USD 5 million. A fire reportedly broke out in a WFP mobile storage unit for non-food items in Al Hudaydah city on 16 April. Initial reports indicate that the fire has caused minimal damage.

• A WHO-chartered cargo plane delivered 19 tons of medical supplies to Sana’a Airport.

PROTRACTED VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO PUSH YEMENIS INTO DISPLACEMENT

The Shelter/NFI/CCCM cluster reports that as of 12 April protracted violence in the Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates has displaced 19,145 households of whom 9,838 have been assisted. This new wave of displacement further adds up to the three million Yemenis who have already faced the shock of having to flee their homes, two million of whom remain displaced across the country. 89 percent of IDPs in Yemen have been displaced for more than one year.

According to the Protection Cluster, displaced people increasingly face protection risks, including those living in public buildings, collective centres or spontaneous settlements. Deteriorating shelter conditions, such as overcrowding and unsanitary IDP settlements, have led to increased spread and susceptibility to communicable diseases. Many IDPs are in need of shelter, food, water, sanitation and access to health services. They are vulnerable to exploitation, indebtedness, and negative coping mechanism, such as begging, child labour, recruitment by armed groups and early marriage.

As conditions deteriorate in Yemen, humanitarian partners have prioritised assistance for some of the most vulnerable communities, including IDPs, returnees and host communities. In 2018, a total of 266,000 IDP households are targeted to receive assistance as part of the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, including rental subsidies, core relief items, emergency shelter and legal aid. USD 198.7 million and unimpeded access are required.

Multi-cluster humanitarian response to new displacement driven by the conflict in Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates is still ongoing. However, a lack of implementing partners on the ground and the authorities’ delay in releasing the necessary approvals have negatively affected the response.

In between January and March 2018, the Shelter/NFI/ CCCM cluster reached approx. 227,000 people as per the breakdown below.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah: WFP reported that the estimated value of the assistance destroyed in the fire that occurred in its warehouse in Al Hudaydah city on 31 March amounts to US$5 million. The lost supplies were meant to contribute to the rations of at least 1.8 million beneficiaries for a month’s period. WFP is using reserves to partially cover the gap and prevent any disruption to the monthly distribution process. A new fire broke out on 16 April in a WFP mobile storage unit for non-food items in Al Hudaydah city, no significant damage was reported. At least two humanitarian organisations reached and responded in Al Khawkhah district during the reporting period. However, access to the eastern part of Hays district remains challenging due to continued shelling. In Al Hudaydah city, humanitarian partners have provided NFI, cash and hygiene assistance to some 1,500 families, including IDPs. In Hajjah governorate, 158 families among the most vulnerable in Abs district received cash assistance.

Aden: Queues have been witnessed at private fuel stations in the governorate, while government-run fuel stations are not functioning. Fuel is available in the unofficial market at a higher price. In nearby governorates, however, fuel is available with no change in price. Cut-off hours of electricity have increased during the reporting period to 6-8 hours a day, compared to two hours a day in the previous weeks. According to a displacement tracking exercise, 305 new IDP households were reported in Aden in the past week. Reportedly, 244 other new IDP families have been displaced in the districts of Khanfir, Lawdar and Zingibar in Abyan governorate and 61 in Tuban and Al Had districts in Lahj governorate. 299 suspected diphtheria cases were reported in the hub as of 8 April, including 141 cases in Al Dhale’e, 67 in Aden, 12 in Lahj, seven in Abyan and one case in Shabwah.

Sana’a: On 11 April, a WHO-chartered cargo plane delivered 19 tons of medical and therapeutic items to Sana’a International Airport. The items will be distributed across Yemen. The road from Sana’a to Sayun in Hadramaut governorate, mainly used by civilians planning to travel abroad through Sayun Airport, has been temporarily cut off due to ground clashes in Al Bayda governorate.

Humanitarian partners have also reported access constraints in Hamdan and Bani Matar districts (Sana’a governorate) and in Harib district (Marib governorate) by local authorities restricting their movement and ability to implement programmes.

Sa’ada: Airstrikes and ground fighting continued across the districts bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and along frontlines in Al Jawf governorate, resulting in several civilian casualties, including children. ACTED and DRC reported that airstrikes on 9 April hit targets within a short distance from their premises in Sa’ada city while 56 staff were working. Both premises are deconflicted.

Four water projects were completed in the districts of Bart Al Anan and Rajuzahin Al Jawf governorate. The intervention, which involved rehabilitating and protecting water sources and installing solar systems for generating power will serve 10,000 beneficiaries. Three additional water projects in the districts of As Safra and Sahar will benefit some 17,000 beneficiaries.

Ibb: Clashes continued along the frontlines in Taizz governorate, including in Salah, Dimnat Khadir and Hayfan districts. On 10 April, at least 15 people, including children, were reportedly killed when an airstrike hit their house in Dimnat Khadir district. Around 50 families have been displaced from As Silw district in Taizz governorate to Dimnat Khadir district in the same governorate and Dhi As Sufal district in Ibb governorate.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

A deepening humanitarian crisis

The year 2017 was marked by a steady deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The unabating conflict, the steady economic decline and the resulting collapse of basic social services further aggravated the vulnerability of millions of people whose coping mechanisms had been under pressure for two years. Displacement, food insecurity, disease and malnutrition continued to be the primary drivers of needs. As the year unfolded, a cholera outbreak, the worst recorded in history, spread across the entire country affecting more than one million people. By the end of the year the number of people in need had increased by 2 million, resulting in 20.8 million people requiring some form of humanitarian assistance and protection, 11.3 million of whom were in acute need.

Violations of IHL threaten the protection of civilians

The conduct of hostilities continued to be brutal, air strikes and fighting continued to inflict heavy casualties, damage public and private infrastructure, and impede delivery of humanitarian assistance. Serious concerns regarding the conduct of the conflict, in which all parties appeared to have committed violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law continued to be raised. of 31 December 2017, health facilities had reported nearly reported 9,245 conflict related deaths and over 52,807 injuries. These figures significantly undercount the true extent of casualties given diminished reporting capacity of health facilities and people’s difficulties accessing healthcare. The conflict and violence engulfed the country in a vast protection crisis in which millions of people faced tremendous threats to their safety and wellbeing, and the most vulnerable struggled to survive.

Forced displacement and returns

Conflict continued to be the main driver of displacement. Since the escalation of the conflict in March 2015, more than 3 million people were displaced within Yemen, including 2 million who remained displaced by the end of 2017. While over 1 million former IDPs had provisionally returned to their areas of origin, the sustainability of these returns remained highly precarious due to lack of livelihoods opportunity, exhausted coping mechanism and crumbling access to social services in areas of return. Substantial numbers of returnees were found to be living in damaged houses, unable to afford repairs and facing serious protection risks. Nearly 70 per cent of returnees were in Aden, Sana’a or Taiz while half of the IDPs were sheltering in Hajjah, Taizz and Sana’a, living with host families or in rented accommodation.

Collapse of basic services and institutions

Essential basic services and the institutions that provide them continued to collapse under the weight of conflict, displacement and economic decline. As the public budget deficit grew by more than 50 per cent salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers were paid erratically, often leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – nearly 30 per cent of the population – without a regular income at a time of shortages and rising prices. The ability of public institutions to provide services contracted at a time while needs were surging. The inability of the health services to contain localized cases of cholera will result in the unfolding of an unprecedented outbreak.

Economic decline and access to markets

Economic decline and import restrictions continued to impact the availability and price of basic goods in markets.

Due to the intensification of the conflict, and restrictions of movement in active conflict areas, the formal market systems were disconnected and commodity movements were disrupted resulting in to scarcity and escalation of prices of essential food and non-food commodities. The closure of Yemen’s ports (sea, land and airports) on 6 November 2017 by the Saudi-led Coalition, resulted in the sharp rise within a 24 hours period in the prices for food, fuel and water had soared, putting them out of reach of vulnerable populations.",Yemen Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
10,yemen,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The first vaccine campaign against cholera in Yemen has started, 18 months after war and a sanitation crisis triggered an epidemic, but the World Health Organization said it did not yet have permission nationwide to do the vaccinations.

Some senior Houthi officials, whose forces control the capital Sanaa, have objected to vaccinations and this has already delayed the program by nearly a year, aid workers say.

There have been more than one million suspected cases of cholera in Yemen, and 2,275 recorded deaths since Nov 2016, the WHO says.

The oral vaccination campaign, which began in four districts in Aden on Sunday targeting 350,000 people, coincides with the rainy season, which health workers fear could spread the disease further.

“We have plans in place for extending that to all of the at-risk zones and we are still negotiating with health authorities in the north of the country, in Sanaa, in order to plan those campaigns,” Michael Ryan, WHO Assistant Director-General, told a news briefing on Monday.

“As of yet we don’t have established dates for those campaigns, but we are ready to move... just as soon as we get those necessary approvals,” he added.

WHO cholera expert Lorenzo Pizzoli said in a tweet from Aden on Sunday that the campaign hoped to cover at least four million people in areas at risk.

The disease is spread by faeces in sewage contaminating water or food, and it can kill because patients quickly lose fluids through vomiting and diarrhea.

Caught early it can be treated with oral rehydration salts.

“Cholera is still present and this is the classic situation where we’ve had a first big wave last year, and we fully expect another wave this year. That wave could be as large or potentially even larger,” Ryan said.

Water sanitation and treatment systems have been destroyed in many parts of Yemen, and access to health care remains extremely limited, he added.

Yemen’s war, a proxy conflict between Iran-aligned Houthis and the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led alliance, has killed more than 10,000 people since 2015 and displaced more than two million.

In July 2017, the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision - which manages a global stockpile - earmarked one million cholera vaccines for Yemen. But the WHO and local authorities together decided to scrap a vaccination plan on logistical and technical grounds and the doses were diverted to South Sudan.

The largest cholera vaccination drive in history, targeting more than two million people across Africa, is now being carried out in five countries - Zambia, Uganda, Malawi, South Sudan and Kenya - the WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance said on Monday.",Cholera vaccination campaign starts in Yemen after year delay: WHO,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cholera/cholera-vaccination-campaign-starts-in-yemen-after-year-delay-who-idUSKBN1I8162

Humanitarian Context:

Yemen is experiencing a serious protection crisis as all civilian populations, including persons of concern, face grave risks to their safety, well-being and human rights. A lack of financial support will translate into a lack of capacity to monitor and advocate for the protection of refugees and asylum-seeker.

The situation in Fara Al-Udayn district of Ibb governorate remains stable for any humanitarian interventions although it is located nearby Al Jarrahi district which is considered as a conflict – affected area and targeted by a huge number of air strikes.

A huge number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have fled to Mudhikhera district of Ibb governorate due to the heavy conflicts in Taizziah district of Taizz governorate. The current situation in Mudhikhera is stable even though a large number of affected nearby IDPs keep moving to the district in order to find essential healthcare services as well as safety.

There have been many prevailing cases of diphtheria in As Sabra district of Ibb governorate in the past few days; however, they weren’t associated with deaths. As Sabra is mostly affected by the huge number of IDPs coming from conflict-affected places such as Al-Hudaydah & Taizz governments.

In Taizz Governorate, the security situation is exacerbating these days to such a level that prevents the arrival of emergency humanitarian assistance to the poor along with too many afflicted IDPs who are situated in various areas of the governorate. On top of that, populations face a shortage of water and fuel resources. Not to mention the majority of students who are deprived from studying at school because they cannot even afford to buy the basic necessities of life. Finally, a massive number of SAM and MAM cases for children under five and pregnant lactating women are found within the governorate.",Yemen: Monthly Situation Report No 1 (April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-monthly-situation-report-no-1-april-2018

• Humanitarian partners are concerned at the safety of more than 4,000 civilians near the frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate.

• Updated casualty figures compiled by WHO from health facilities indicate that nearly 9,500 people were killed and 55,000 more were injured over the last three years.

• The purchasing power of the Yemeni currency is now below half of what it used it to be.

CONCERNS AT THE SAFETY OF CIVILIANS LIVING NEAR FRONTLINES IN AL HUDAYDAH GOVERNORATE

Humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of more than 4,000 civilians living near active frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate. Local partners report that families are currently sheltering around Hays, At Tuhayat and Al Garrahi Districts where sporadic armed clashes have continued. During the reporting period, fighting was also reported in Al Khawkhah District.

Fighting in Al Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates has resulted in scores of people killed and injured and has displaced more than 130,000 people since December 2017.

Humanitarian partners are assisting some of the displaced in the areas covered by Al Hudaydah hub, but as shown in the map, a significant number of districts have high access constraints. Southern districts of Al Hudaydah Governorate and northern districts of Hajjah Governorate, where the conflict is most active, are among the hardest to reach.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah Hub: On 24 April, airstrikes reportedly hit a fuel station located in Abs District, killing 20 people and injuring 30 others. The INGO Action Contre La Faim reported supporting 663 newly displaced families from Hays district hosted in Al Garrahi District with nonfood item (NFI) packages. UNHCR supported 1,200 vulnerable displaced families living in Al Qanawes District with NFI packages. A total of 714 households of these received emergency shelter kits. UNHCR also provided 240 vulnerable displaced families in Al Hudaydah City with rental subsidies covering three months.

Aden Hub: The total number of families reportedly displaced to Aden Hub since December 2017 has reached 9,536 households as of 22 April. According to a displacement tracking report, the number of IDPs increased by 102 households over the last week, 75 of which were reported in Tuban and Tur Al Bahah Districts in Lahj Governorate and 27 in Zingibar District in Abyan Governorate. Displacement figures remain unchanged in Al Mukha and Dhubab Districts in Taizz Governorate, that is 618 and 55 households respectively.

Aden Governorate reportedly suffered from sewage overflow, especially Mualla, Sheihk Othamn, Mansorah and Dar Saad Districts. Government efforts yielded in the provision of new four suction tankers with a total cost of US$1 million. In Al Buraiqeh District, CARE has started rehabilitating a water network to help cover the water shortage in IDP settlements in Aden Governorate.

Ibb Hub: In Taizz Governorate, heavy clashes between government forces and Ansar Allah reportedly continued in Maqbanah, Mawza and Dimnat Khadir districts. Following the killing of an ICRC staff last week, clashes erupted between government forces and armed groups, including ISIS, in Taizz city. In the latter, shortages of drinking water continued as fuel could not be delivered to the water department due to the ongoing clashes.

UNICEF reported the delivery of nutrition supplies to Government Health Offices both in Ibb and Taizz governorates. The supplies are to be distributed to 82 health facilities in Ibb and to 86 health facilities in Taizz.

UNHCR completed the distribution of non-food items to 37 families (293 individuals) in Dhi AsSufal District of Ibb Governorate.

Sa’ada Hub: Escalated airstrikes and ground fighting continued across the districts bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Sa’ada Governorate and the frontlines in Al Jawf Governorate. Civilian casualties were reported.

According to local authorities, about 1,270 households have been displaced in the last few months in Kitaf Wa Al Boqe’e, Shada’a, Qatabir, and Ghamr districts in Sa’ada Governorate. UNHCR reported the distribution of 1,000 non-food item packages and 500 emergency shelter kits in Bquim and Razih Districts.

Sana’a Hub: The Protection Cluster reported that the number of civilian impact incidents in the Sana’a hub fell during the period from 19 to 25 April, although airstrikes hit an electricity power station in the south of Sana’a City. Five civilians were injured in the airstrike, and the damages caused to the facility will potentially affect 320 people.

During the reporting period, the Dhamar Customs Office held three trucks carrying nutrition assistance items from Aden to Sana’a. The items were to be warehoused in Sana’a before being dispatched to Al Hudaydah Governorate. The Nutrition Cluster and OCHA are following up with the local authorities.

The 26 March 2018 saw the third anniversary of the Yemen conflict, which continues to heavily impact the lives of children. As fighting continued this month, 16 children were reportedly killed and 39 were injured.

UNICEF launched a report highlighting the negative effects of conflict on children's education. It also appealed to warring parties to put an end to the war and all grave violations against children.

An Integrated Response, Preparedness and Prevention Plan for Acute Watery Diarreah/Cholera is now in place, and thanks to UNICEF support, a total of 736 WASH Rapid Response Teams, with nationwide coverage, are now on stand-by to respond to a potential outbreak in the coming months.

This month, UNICEF supported a six-day diphtheria campaign in 39 high- risk districts where it. It reached over 1.9 million children, covering 75 per cent of the target.

UNICEF provided psychosocial support to at least 12,011 people in March, including 6,123 children, through community based and mobile child friendly spaces in 9 governorates.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Despite attempts by the new UN envoy, Martin Griffiths, to renew stagnated peace talks, fighting continued throughout March. Marking the third anniversary of the start of the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention in Yemen, the Houthis fired a set of ballistic missiles towards cities in Saudi Arabia, where at least one person was reportedly killed by shrapnel in Riyadh. In Sana'a, the most affected governorate by active fighting, airstrikes intensified in the city and ground clashes continued along the Nihm frontline northeast of the capital. Meanwhile in the Southern governorates and the city of Aden, violent crime and assassinations are on the increase, with several attacks carried-out by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) killing and injuring security forces and civilians.

Children continue to bear the heaviest toll of the conflict. 16 children were killed and 38 injured during March, bringing the cumulative totals for 2018 up to a 110 and 192 respectively.1 The conflict also continues to heavily impact children's right to an education. Many teachers' salaries remain unpaid (61 per cent) and over three years of conflict is now compromising the education of over 4.5 million children. Whilst no data available concerning the attendance of teachers, it is reported than in some school's teachers work only a few hours a day, and in others, parents are grouping together to collect fees for teachers.

The consequences of this has a varying impact across the country. The cumulative total of suspected cholera cases reported since April 2017 to 31 March 2018 is 1,085,305 with 2,270 associated deaths across the country.2 Children under 5 years old represent 28.8 per cent of total suspected cases, but the number of weekly new cases continues to decline for the 29th consecutive week. As of the end of the reporting month, the total number of reported probable diphtheria cases has now reached 1,522 (a 25 per cent increase from the previous month) with 85 deaths (a 10 per cent increase) and a case fatality rate of 5.5 per cent.",UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (March 2018) [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018-enar

16,yemen,"International Non-Government Organisations working in Yemen condemn in the strongest terms the abhorrent attack on an ICRC vehicle that resulted in the killing of an employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross earlier today, 21 April 2018. We are deeply shocked by the death of Hanna Lahoud, a member of the humanitarian community who gave his life delivering assistance to people in dire need of aid. Our deepest condolences go to Hanna’s family, friends and colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross.

“As a very close knit international community, we are all saddened by the death of our colleague, Hanna,“ said Shane Stevenson, Country Director of Oxfam in Yemen. “Our most sincere sympathies go to Hanna’s family and colleagues at ICRC. We are appalled by this brutal attack on a fellow humanitarian who gave his life working to help others in need. Aid workers need security and protection to deliver life-saving aid, and we remain committed to the cause for which Hanna gave his life.”

Humanitarian organisations in Yemen work in accordance with humanitarian principles of humanity, independence, neutrality and impartiality to deliver aid to populations affected by violent conflict. More than three quarters of Yemen’s population is in need of humanitarian assistance or protection that alleviates suffering and promotes dignity in the context of a war that is depriving many of the things they need to stay alive. An attack on humanitarian workers; UN, ICRC or non-government organisation – it is not only an attack on a humanitarian worker but also on the rights of people affected by conflict to receive assistance and protection.

INGOs in Yemen call on all parties to the conflict, authorities in Yemen and the international community to take concrete steps that guarantee the protection of humanitarian personnel and materials, as is provided for under International Humanitarian Law. We will not allow violence of this kind to deter our efforts to support highly vulnerable people in Yemen but need absolute assurance we can do so with safety.
