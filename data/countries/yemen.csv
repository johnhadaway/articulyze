Al Hudaydah: Health sources reported that at least 20 civilians were killed and 47 were injured by airstrikes on a wedding ceremony in Bani Qais District in Hajjah Governorate on 22 April. Other sources have up to 40 people killed. The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. In Abs District, an airstrike on an IDP house reportedly killed five civilians including one woman and injured one man from the same family. WFP distributed 2,700 food baskets through an implementing partner in Al Khawkhah District. Following the identification of seven positive cholera cases in Al Hudaydah city, ICRC conducted a verification test to all suspected water sources used by patients and found one borehole contaminated by the cholera vibrio. The borehole was immediately closed and the Rapid Response Team was activated to ensure chlorination of all water sources across the Governorate.

Aden: Partners continued to assist the current IDP caseload. Although the humanitarian response has improved through stronger coordination with subnational clusters, some gaps remain in Shabwah,

Hadramaut and Al Maharah Governorates. OCHA is working with sub-national clusters to address those gaps. Additionally, in order to effectively respond to increased displacement in areas along Yemen’s western coast, humanitarian partners have started to pre-position different type of stocks including energy biscuits, hygiene kits, drinking water, transitional shelter and non-food items to be dispatched to selected service points in Hays and Al Khawkhah within 24 hours. During the reporting period, a rapid need assessment was conducted in Khanfir, Zingibar, Lawdar Districts in Abyan Governorate and Al Had District in Lahj Governorate. Findings indicate that there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance in the sectors of water, sanitation and hygiene, food and shelter. However, there is no need for rapid health response as it is being covered by existing health facilities services and mobile clinics. A multi-sector assessment conducted in Al Khawkhah District in Al-Hudaydah Governorate concluded the need for sustained interventions in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and nonfood items, protection, food and health. A multi-sector assessment in Bayhan District, Shabwah Governorate reported that there are 700 displaced families. More than 90 per cent of the IDPs lack access to water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and non-food items ad face specific protection concerns.

Sana’a: Ground fighting in Al Bayda Governorate escalated during the reporting period, resulting in the displacement of approximately 50 families. OCHA is working with shelter cluster to ensure that the needs are addressed. The latest report of the Civilian Impact Monitoring Project (CIMP) covering Amanat Al Asimah (Sana’a City), Sana’a and Marib Governorates indicates that the number of civilian impact incidents fell again for the third consecutive week, from four to two. One of the incidents was in Al Haymah Ad Dakhiliyah District in western Sana’a, and the other was in Bani Al Harith in the north of the capital city. Both incidents were caused by airstrikes. Although there were no civilian fatalities, three civilians were reportedly injured and civilian infrastructure was damaged. Authorities in Sana’a have formally informed the World Health Organization that the implementation of the cholera vaccination campaign in the areas under their control is rejected.

Sa’ada: The protection cluster reports that in the period from 12 to 18 April, the number of civilian impact incidents in Sa’ada increased from 23 to 30. Although the number of incidents increased, the number of civilian casualties decreased, dropping from 41 to 12. Contrary to previous weeks, casualties were the result of shelling (67%) or small arms fire (23%). Airstrikes also hit water infrastructure and a school in Razih District, potentially leaving 3,000 households with restricted access to basic services.

UNICEF issued a statement on the recent incident that targeted a water project in Sa’ada Governorate on 13 April. The Al-Hamazat water system in the Sehar District in Sa’ada Governorate was completely destroyed in an attack that left 7,500 people, including IDP families, without water. During the attack, the nearby solar energy system which provides power to the water system was also severely damaged. The water system had already been destroyed in 2015 and was later rebuilt in 2017. UNICEF stressed that damage to water infrastructure jeopardizes efforts to prevent another cholera outbreak in Yemen.

Ibb: Western frontlines in Taizz Governorate witnessed a military escalation during the reporting period. On 20 April, 20 people were reportedly killed when their vehicles were hit by airstrikes in Mawza District.The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. A multicluster rapid assessment in Mawza District of Taizz Governorate found that humanitarian situation of some 655 IDP families displaced within the district since May 2017 is dire with 98 per cent of the IDPs scattered in open areas, living in shelters made from straw without any basic water sanitation and hygiene services. The report indicates also that women and children (less than 12 years old) are the majority of the IDPs. WFP reported completing the in-kind food distribution cycle of March, targeting approximately 527,000 people in Taizz Governorate and 344,880 people in Ibb Governorate. A distribution of non-food items by UNHCR to 71 households in Dhu-Sufar District in Ibb Governorate was postponed to next week due to access constraints. The two main hospitals (AlJamhoury and Al- Thawrah) in Taizz city have closed their dialysis departments due to lack of supplies.

The head of ICRC’s detention program in Yemen, was deadly shot in an attack on his vehicle by unknown armed men on 21 April in Taizz Governorate. The humanitarian community has widely condemned the killing; in his statement of 22 April the UN SecretaryGeneral reminded all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law concerning the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts and called for a prompt, effective and transparent investigation. The Government of Yemen has condemned the incident that happened in an area under its control and committed to exposing the perpetrators.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 17 – 23 April 2018 | Issue 12,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-17-23-april-2018-issue-12
1,yemen,"Conflict Background

Yemen has a weak, highly decentralized central government that has struggled to rule the northern Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the southern People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Since the unification of these entities in 1990, Yemen has experienced three civil conflicts. As the poorest country in the Arab world, Yemen faces serious food and water shortages for a population dispersed over mountainous terrain. The country’s weaknesses have been exploited by Saudi Arabia which shares a porous border with Yemen. Further, the instability of Yemen’s central government has created a power vacuum filled by foreign states and terrorist groups. The central government has never had effective control of all Yemeni territory.

Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was president of Yemen for 34 years, secured his power through playing factions within the population off one another. The Yemeni conflict is not solely a result of a Sunni-Shia conflict, although sectarianism plays a role. The 2011 Arab Spring re-energized the Houthi movement, a Zaydi Shia movement, which led to the overthrow of the Saleh government. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi took office as interim president in a transition led by a coalition of Arab Gulf states and backed by the United States. Hadi has struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including insurgency, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to former president Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.",A Conflict Overlooked: Yemen in Crisis,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/conflict-overlooked-yemen-crisis
2,yemen,"Yemen is facing the world’s largest food security crisis. Ongoing conflict, now entering its fourth year, has led to a severe economic decline and collapsed essential services, taking an enormous toll on the population and exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The expansion of the conflict has also led to large-scale displacement and high rates of malnutrition.

The agriculture sector is among the worst hit by the current crisis and local food production has been severely compromised. The absence of veterinary services, coupled with scarcity and the high cost of drugs and animal feed has contributed to poor production. The country’s low food self-sufficiency has been worsened by the conflict, which has disrupted economic activities, led to the suspension of safety net programmes and the implementation of import restrictions.

Agriculture must be an integral part of the humanitarian response to prevent Yemen’s dire food security situation from worsening. FAO’s programmes in Yemen aim to save livelihoods through the provision of supplies, knowledge and training to support the most vulnerable Yemeni communities to enhance their resilience and improve their food security and nutrition.

To achieve lasting impact on food security and nutrition and to restore and strengthen the agricultural livelihoods of vulnerable families, FAO has developed two plans to guide its response over the next three years.

Plan of Action 2018–2020

Over three years, FAO requires USD 228.5 million to improve the food security and nutrition of 9.1 million people (1.3 million households), and to safeguard, protect and restore Yemen’s agriculture sector.

Emergency Livelihoods Response Plan 2018

As part of the first pillar of the Plan of Action, in 2018, FAO requires USD 57.1 million to deliver emergency agricultural interventions for 5.7 million people (818 500 households) to improve their food security and nutrition.

• Six months of conflict have displaced over 100,000 people into areas covered by the Aden hub.

• Decline in food and fuel imports reported in April.

• UNHAS continues to provide critical air service, more than 1,000 aid workers were transported in the month of April

• Deconfliction requests increased in April compared to March.

100,000 PEOPLE DISPLACED TO SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES BY SIX MONTHS OF CONFLICT

Over the last six months, the intensification of the conflict in Yemen’s western coast has prompted the displacement of 100,000 new IDPs in areas reached by humanitarian partners based in the Aden hub. Since December 2017, displacement has been reported in Abyan, Lahj and Aden governorates, with close to 5,000 families now residing in coastal areas of Taizz and Al Hudaydah.

The new IDPs have mostly originated from conflict areas of Al Hudaydah, Taizz and Shabwah governorates.

Humanitarian partners coordinated rapid assessments to areas with new arrivals and responses to basic needs have taken place in Al Khawkhah, Hays and Al Mokha. However, humanitarian access in districts like Mawza remains difficult. Preparations to respond to additional needs generated by continued fighting in Taizz are ongoing and locations for pre-positioning relief stocks have been identified.

The rapid increase in IDP numbers, although expected, has stretched the capacity of the Aden Humanitarian Coordination Team which had to expand operations into new areas in Abyan, Lahj and Shabwah governorates.

Funding and partnerships will be required by the clusters to sustain and complement the existing relief operations and respond to additional population movements.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Sana’a Hub: The Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster reports that 294 families (approximately 2,000 people) who were recently displaced from Al Jawf Governorate to Harf Sufyan District in Amran Governorate will receive non-food items and emergency shelter kits as emergency assistance. In Al Bayda Governorate, fighting was reported in Nati’ and Al Qurayshiyah districts. An assessment by a local NGO of 224 recently displaced households found IDPs living in open areas in urgent need of clean drinking water and latrines, shelter, food and education. The district health unit in Nati’, which was damaged in recent fighting, needs to be rehabilitated.

Ibb Hub: Clashes have again erupted in Taizz City between government forces and armed groups, forcing several markets to close. Clashes were also reported in Maqbanah district, and north and east of Taizz City. Humanitarian partners fear that clashes could potentially displace up to 22,000 families. During the reporting period, a food distribution programme for 28,000 families was suspended following the killing of an ICRC worker on 21 April in the outskirts of Taizz City. Other humanitarian agencies continue to respond to various needs in Taizz and Ibb governorates. On 2 May, two trucks carrying nutrition supplies that were held in Al Hoban, At Ta’iziyah district, on 26 April, were released.

Al Hudaydah Hub: Partners are preparing to deliver two-month food assistance to targeted families among the estimated 900 families living near active military lines in Al Hayma, At Tuhayat District, and to support two nearby health units. Another 113 newly displaced families from Al Hudaydah, Sana’a and Taizz governorates have reportedly arrived in Al Hudaydah City. In Al Mahweet Governorate, 45 displaced families from Nihm District (Sana’a Governorate) have been identified in Shibam Kukaban districts. Following reports of increase in dengue and malaria cases in Al Hudaydah; Al Thawrah and Olfi hospitals will be supported to treat complicated cases; local health facilities will also be supported with supplies to ensure case management.

Sa’ada Hub: Heavy rains and flooding in Al Jawf Governorate on 23-24 April affected about 800 households in Bart Al Anan District. Water wells and farm land were inundated and partially damaged.

Humanitarian partners are discussing how to respond to the urgent needs of those affected, particularly the need to provide shelter assistance, medicines, water, food and cash. During the reporting period, aerial bombardment and fighting intensified in Sa’ada, casualties were reported. On 30 April, more than 40 airstrikes were reported, half of them had struck Baqim District.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 1 – 7 May 2018 | Issue 14,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-1-7-may-2018-issue-14

5,yemen,"“I met teenagers in utter distress from what they had experienced already in their young lives,” said Mohammed Abdiker, Director of Operations and Emergencies at the International Organization for Migration (IOM), following a visit to Yemen this past week.

“They are just a commodity to smugglers,” he added, “something to make quick and easy money from and, if they die, the smugglers do not care as there are thousands of other people willing to pay for their services and risk their lives to simply build their parents a house, put their brother through school, or for any opportunity at all.”

The total number of migrants currently in Yemen is unknown, but nearly 100,000 arrived in 2017.

Migrants often leave their homes on foot and walk through Djibouti. From there, they take boats across the Gulf of Aden to the Aden, Lahj, Shabwah, and Hadramout Governorates in Yemen and then attempt to head north to the border with Saudi Arabia.

Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world; it is obviously not a safe route for migrants – UN migration agency

Some take irregular work in Yemen to make money to fund the rest of their journey while others get caught up in the on-going conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels, sustaining injuries - or dying in crossfire.

Some also end up in detention centres.

At various stages of their journey, these migrants face the risk of being exploited by ruthless smugglers and other criminals, including enduring physical and sexual abuse; torture for ransom; arbitrary detention for long periods of time; or grueling forced labour, without wages.

Last August, scores of Ethiopian and Somali teenagers dreaming of a better life were forced into the sea by smugglers off the coast of Yemen and drowned.

Mr. Abdiker believes without prosecuting those criminals, any humanitarian assistance would be just “a Band Aid.”

In 2017, IOM helped some 2,900 migrants and refugees return home from Yemen: 73 per cent of them were Somalis, 25 per cent Ethiopians, and 2 per cent other nationalities.

This year so far, IOM has helped 197 Ethiopians - together with 939 Somali migrants and refugees - return home voluntarily.

“Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world; it is obviously not a safe route for migrants, nor is it safe for Yemenis themselves in many areas,” said Mr. Abdiker.

He said that more and more Yemenis who have fled, are returning from Saudi Arabia due to tightening regulations there.

Both migrants coming to Yemen, and Yemenis returning home, are in desperate need of greater support from the international community, and “neither group should feel forced to transit through or return to a conflict zone,” he added.","Smugglers see thousands of migrants in Yemen as ‘a commodity’, UN agency warns",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1009122
6,yemen,"A young mother in Yemen stood on the scale for a doctor. Even wearing her long, black clothing she weighed only 38 kilograms.

The mother, Umm Mizrah, is pregnant, but starving. She is giving all her food to her children.

The doctor’s office was filled with pictures of starving babies who have come through Al-Sadaqa Hospital in Aden.

They are suffering because of a three-year civil war in Yemen that has left millions of people near death from starvation.

Mothers like Umm Mizrah miss meals, they sleep to escape the pain in their stomachs. They hide thin bodies in their heavy, black abayas.

The doctor asked the mother to get back on the scale holding her son, Mizrah. At the age of 17 months, he was 5.8 kilograms. That weight is about half the normal weight for his age.

He was suffering from “acute malnutrition.” His legs and feet were swollen. He was not eating enough protein.

Millions of Yemenis suffer from lack of food

The United Nations says 2.9 million women and children in Yemen are acutely malnourished.

Nearly one third of Yemen’s population, or 8.4 million people, are fed with food aid or else they would go hungry. That number has grown by 25 percent over the past year.

Aid agencies say that parts of Yemen could soon start to see widespread death from famine. More and more people need aid that is already failing to reach people.

The war is between Yemen’s Shiite Houthi rebels who control the country’s north, and the Saudi-led coalition that supports the government. The coalition is supported by the United States. It has tried to defeat the rebels with a bombing campaign in support of the Yemeni government.

The Associated Press reports that the number of dead is unknown. Officials are not able to get numbers.

However, the aid organization Save the Children estimated late last year that 50,000 children may have died in 2017 of extreme hunger or disease.

‘World’s largest humanitarian emergency’

Stephen Anderson is the Yemen director of the World Food Program. He said, “Unfortunately, now Yemen is considered to be the world’s largest humanitarian emergency.”

Even before the war, the Arab world’s poorest nation struggled to feed itself. It is a country of deserts and mountains with little water. Only 2 to 4 percent of the land is farmed. Almost all of its food and supplies must be imported.

The war has destroyed almost everything needed to secure food supplies. Bombing by the coalition has destroyed hospitals, schools, farms, factories, bridges and roads.

The coalition has also put an embargo on Houthi-controlled areas. These areas include the Red Sea port of Hodeida. Little food gets in. Coalition forces permit UN approved ships and aid only, often with delays.

The United States gives a lot of assistance to the coalition campaign. The U.S. has provided intelligence and billions of dollars in arms. It also provides help in planning and organizing.

The State Department adds that the U.S. has provided nearly $854 million to ease the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

In many places there is food in the markets, but people do not have money. The currency has collapsed, there are few jobs, and those with jobs are often not paid.

Umm Mizrah and her husband have three young daughters in addition to Mizrah. They usually eat one meal a day, often just bread and tea. The Associated Press identified her by a false name to protect her privacy.

When the doctor in Aden told her malnutrition could cause her baby to die, she was frightened. But, the parents felt helpless.

“I don’t know what is right,” she said quietly. “He was playful and doing fine then he started to get sick and stopped breastfeeding and playing.”

The AP traveled across southern Yemen, an area held by the government. Reporters visited places among the 107 areas that the U.N. warns are most likely to face a severe lack of food.

All are living with pain and fear.

RIYADH: The King Salman Center for Humanitarian Aid and Relief (KSRelief) is funding oxygen stations at 11 hospitals across Yemen, including Houthi-occupied territories.

The stations will ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply and are part of KSRelief’s humanitarian efforts in the war-torn country.

Dr. Abdullah Al-Moallem, director for health and environment aid at KSRelief, told Arab News: “This dedicated medical project for 11 oxygen stations will produce and ensure centralized oxygen supply to 11 hospitals in parts of Yemen, including Sanaa and other Houthi-occupied territories.

“This indicates that we are impartial and looking forward to future cooperation and humanitarian efforts to all Yemeni people, irrespective of any differences.”

Houthi seizures in Taiz had resulted in scarcity of the oxygen supplies, Al-Moallem said.

KSRelief was working with the World Health Organization (WHO) on the $1.45 million project, he said.

A contract outlining the partnership was signed under the supervision of Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, adviser at the Royal Court and the supervisor general of the KSRelief, and by Ahmed bin Ali Al-Baiz, assistant general supervisor for Operations and Programs at KSRelief, and WHO representative in Yemen Nevio Zagaria.

KSRelief has also launched rapid response efforts and stepped up its medical relief and health assistance. Three specialized medical teams will provide treatment to injured Yemenis, pro-legitimate government or Houthi supporters.

Specialized medical teams will visit three different regions in Yemen and provide medical assistance to help the injured.

• Humanitarian partners are concerned at the safety of more than 4,000 civilians near the frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate.

• Updated casualty figures compiled by WHO from health facilities indicate that nearly 9,500 people were killed and 55,000 more were injured over the last three years.

• The purchasing power of the Yemeni currency is now below half of what it used it to be.

CONCERNS AT THE SAFETY OF CIVILIANS LIVING NEAR FRONTLINES IN AL HUDAYDAH GOVERNORATE

Humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of more than 4,000 civilians living near active frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate. Local partners report that families are currently sheltering around Hays, At Tuhayat and Al Garrahi Districts where sporadic armed clashes have continued. During the reporting period, fighting was also reported in Al Khawkhah District.

Fighting in Al Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates has resulted in scores of people killed and injured and has displaced more than 130,000 people since December 2017.

Humanitarian partners are assisting some of the displaced in the areas covered by Al Hudaydah hub, but as shown in the map, a significant number of districts have high access constraints. Southern districts of Al Hudaydah Governorate and northern districts of Hajjah Governorate, where the conflict is most active, are among the hardest to reach.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah Hub: On 24 April, airstrikes reportedly hit a fuel station located in Abs District, killing 20 people and injuring 30 others. The INGO Action Contre La Faim reported supporting 663 newly displaced families from Hays district hosted in Al Garrahi District with nonfood item (NFI) packages. UNHCR supported 1,200 vulnerable displaced families living in Al Qanawes District with NFI packages. A total of 714 households of these received emergency shelter kits. UNHCR also provided 240 vulnerable displaced families in Al Hudaydah City with rental subsidies covering three months.

Aden Hub: The total number of families reportedly displaced to Aden Hub since December 2017 has reached 9,536 households as of 22 April. According to a displacement tracking report, the number of IDPs increased by 102 households over the last week, 75 of which were reported in Tuban and Tur Al Bahah Districts in Lahj Governorate and 27 in Zingibar District in Abyan Governorate. Displacement figures remain unchanged in Al Mukha and Dhubab Districts in Taizz Governorate, that is 618 and 55 households respectively.

Aden Governorate reportedly suffered from sewage overflow, especially Mualla, Sheihk Othamn, Mansorah and Dar Saad Districts. Government efforts yielded in the provision of new four suction tankers with a total cost of US$1 million. In Al Buraiqeh District, CARE has started rehabilitating a water network to help cover the water shortage in IDP settlements in Aden Governorate.

Ibb Hub: In Taizz Governorate, heavy clashes between government forces and Ansar Allah reportedly continued in Maqbanah, Mawza and Dimnat Khadir districts. Following the killing of an ICRC staff last week, clashes erupted between government forces and armed groups, including ISIS, in Taizz city. In the latter, shortages of drinking water continued as fuel could not be delivered to the water department due to the ongoing clashes.

UNICEF reported the delivery of nutrition supplies to Government Health Offices both in Ibb and Taizz governorates. The supplies are to be distributed to 82 health facilities in Ibb and to 86 health facilities in Taizz.

UNHCR completed the distribution of non-food items to 37 families (293 individuals) in Dhi AsSufal District of Ibb Governorate.

Sa’ada Hub: Escalated airstrikes and ground fighting continued across the districts bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Sa’ada Governorate and the frontlines in Al Jawf Governorate. Civilian casualties were reported.

According to local authorities, about 1,270 households have been displaced in the last few months in Kitaf Wa Al Boqe’e, Shada’a, Qatabir, and Ghamr districts in Sa’ada Governorate. UNHCR reported the distribution of 1,000 non-food item packages and 500 emergency shelter kits in Bquim and Razih Districts.

Sana’a Hub: The Protection Cluster reported that the number of civilian impact incidents in the Sana’a hub fell during the period from 19 to 25 April, although airstrikes hit an electricity power station in the south of Sana’a City. Five civilians were injured in the airstrike, and the damages caused to the facility will potentially affect 320 people.

During the reporting period, the Dhamar Customs Office held three trucks carrying nutrition assistance items from Aden to Sana’a. The items were to be warehoused in Sana’a before being dispatched to Al Hudaydah Governorate. The Nutrition Cluster and OCHA are following up with the local authorities.

9,yemen,"TEHRAN - Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the Iranian foreign minister’s special assistant in political affairs, said on Thursday that Iran is making efforts to help end the crisis in Yemen.

“One of the objectives behind the Islamic Republic of Iran’s regional policies is making efforts to end this [Yemeni] crisis,” Jaberi Ansari told IRNA after a consultation meeting in Rome between Iran and EU/E4 on regional issues.

“Developments in Yemen was the main theme of the meeting,” he noted.

Jaberi Ansari added, “We had good discussions with the European representatives about various humanitarian, political and military dimensions of the Yemeni crisis.”

According to a press release issued by the EU website, the meeting was chaired by EEAS Secretary General Helga Schmid and attended by E4 countries (France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom) at the level of political directors. The Iranian delegation was led by Jaberi Ansari.

“This is the second edition of talks in this format after the meeting in the margins of the Munich Security Conference in February 2018. The discussions, focused on the political and humanitarian situation in Yemen, were productive. The participants agreed to meet again in this format in Brussels in the near future,” the statement said.

10,yemen,"Ranging from the humanitarian to the political, the nation of 26 million people has proven itself to be resilient in the face of these wide-ranging and often very apparent challenges.Yet perhaps the most pressing challenge, which genuinely has the potential to truly plunge the country into darkness for decades and make any effort at post-conflict reconstruction infinitely more difficult, is the least reported.The collapse of Yemen's economy and the absence of a functional central bank in particular, if left unresolved, could further worsen all of the country's underlying problems.The UN has described Yemen as 'the world's worst humanitarian disaster' and the international community pledged $2bn in humanitarian aid just last month, but without a viable banking system underpinned by a secure currency, all such efforts are in vain.The primary factor underscoring Yemen's humanitarian crisis is not linked to the availability of food, as markets are generally well stocked, but rather the increase in prices and affordability of food, impacted by the widespread loss of livelihoods and the extremely weak Yemen rial (YER).

For the first two years of the conflict, Yemen's Central Bank remained in Sanaa despite the exodus of the internationally recognised government of President Hadi.



Mohamed Bin Humam, a much-respected bureaucrat and the long-time governor of the Central Bank sought to navigate the difficult political lines in the conflict by paying the salaries of officials employed by both the internationally recognised government and the Houthi rebel group.



Central banks are crucial to the financial stability of countries - they control the flow of currency, manage inflation levels and support domestic commercial banks who in turn deal directly with the public.



Bin Humam's decision was arguably intended as a stop-gap to prevent the entire collapse of the economy and preserve what little confidence there was in the Yemeni riyal.

Demanding the creation of a new central bank with no or very little money was a recipe for economic disaster

However, unfortunately the reserves of the Central Bank, estimated to be the region of US$3-4 billion, ended before the war did. Accessing the reserves of the Central Bank located within their territory allowed the Houthis to greatly strengthen their power. In response, Hadi's government in exile, with little financial incentive left in light of the depletion of Yemen's reserves, made the decision relocate the Central Bank to his interim capital, Aden.

It is important to make clear that Yemen's Central Bank was, even in the best of times, far from perfect.



The country's economic mismanagement and historic debt accumulated by the merger of the northern Yemen Arab Republic and the southern People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1990 were ongoing issues which hampered its performance.



Yet President Hadi's decision to 'relocate' the Central Bank in September 2017 effectively meant that the previous Central Bank in Sanaa would cease to exist, and in turn, a new Central Bank would emerge.



Yemeni villagers receive food handouts as prices in shops soar [AFP]

The decision is better described as the legal and physical dissolution of the existing Central Bank rather than a relocation or transfer.



Indeed, the new Bank needed to be housed in new premises and new officials were appointed to run the new entity who, in actual fact, remained outside of Aden for some time following its establishment.



At the time, the move was criticised as being overtly political with no real positive economic justification. The concern was that it would only hamper confidence in the YER even further and potentially put inexperienced officials into a critical driving seat with disastrous results.



But for Hadi and his government, it was part of a longer term strategy to recapture political and economic control of the country. By moving the Central Bank to Aden, it set the groundwork for the rest of the establishment of a transitional state in the South.

Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis

It was a means by which Hadi could legitimise his governance and provide basic services to the citizens and state, the Central Bank's main customer. Hadi's government also needed a Central Bank, however nominal, under its control in order to pay salaries of state employees, receive foreign aid from international donors and support the war effort more generally.

In reality, the problems with this decision were evident.



Demanding the creation of a new central bank with no or very little money from scratch in a city which the government held a fragile hold over was a recipe for economic disaster.



The original officials appointed to roles in the new Bank appeared to be inept with no high-level experience of running a central bank, let alone one in the midst of conflict. Most recently, this has led to the replacement of the governor in February 2018.



Since the move, the YER has lost more than half its value against the dollar and soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis.

The YER is the backbone of the country's economy and it is used to buy everything from spare parts to basic foodstuffs, its collapse would bear unimaginable consequences for the daily life of civilians.



If the currency did collapse, the only real alternative would be the adoption of the US dollar or another stable foreign currency, similar to the strategy adopted by Zimbabwe during its hyper-inflation crisis in 2000s.



But for Yemen, this might not even be possible since the country is heavily dependent on foreign imports, requiring - as it does - some 95 percent of all its foodstuffs from outside the country.

Imports are purchased on the international markets in dollars, which means that there is lack of the US dollar in circulation in Yemen, especially as those holding large quantities of YER are seeking the stability of the USD creating a flight on capital in the country.

In addition, Yemeni businesses who trade internationally have been forced to use the services of intermediaries and often pay upfront for any orders, as opposed to the usual trade terms which permit deferred payments.



Although intermediary services have been useful in allowing Yemeni businesses to import goods in the country during this time of crisis, they are expensive, and inflated prices are ultimately are passed on, causing price hikes for the end consumer.

With Yemen's currency facing a 300 percent depreciation against the dollar in less than three years since the conflict started, limited, - or effectively no - credibility on the international markets, and rising prices for basic foodstuffs, it was only a matter of time before a major currency crisis occurred.



Indeed, some five months following the move to Aden, a massive run on the YER occurred at the beginning of 2018 which led the Yemeni prime minister to publically plead with Saudi Arabia to provide $US 2 billion in urgent capital reserves to the new Central Bank.



Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr argued that the reserves were needed to shore the currency up in order to prevent economic collapse, saying ""Saving the rial means saving Yemenis from inevitable hunger"".



On 17 January 2018, King Salman dutifully responded and confirmed that a deposit of $US 2 billion would be paid to the new Central Bank immediately to support the international recognised government.



The YER rebounded almost overnight and exchange rate high of $520 to each one YER was reduced. It was hoped that the salaries of state employees, and health workers fighting against cholera in particular, would be restored.



This would, it was hoped, have a knock-on impact by enabling desperately needed consumer spending in the domestic market. However, for some two months following the announcement by the King, the new Central Bank allegedly did not receive the promised deposit from the Saudis. It does now seem that some, if not all of the $2 billion has been received, but the systemic capacity of the new entity remains a major point of contention.

When Yemen's Central Bank moved, none of its existing and most importantly, none of its experienced staff moved with it. Yemen's new Bank has an evident knowledge gap internally which needs to be filled as soon as possible in order to make the most of the Saudis capital injection.

If the currency did collapse, the only real alternative would be the adoption of the US dollar

Indeed, one of the most obvious weaknesses of the new Bank is the failure of its leadership operate inside the country. The Central Bank's leadership has been operating from abroad (with senior management largely based in Amman and Riyadh) which is not conducive to effective central bank management as it not possible for a central bank to function without a physical presence.



The new Bank's problems are also compounded by issues outside of its control, including the stability of its temporary headquarters in Aden, the professionalism of the internationally-recognised government and the activities of the Houthis in the North who equally rely on the YER and therefore, could derail any positive developments.



For their part, in the absence of a central bank under their control, they have increasingly relied on domestic commercial banks who now act as their defacto central bank for northern region.



The Houthis continue to use the YER, with the US Treasury reporting that Houthi allies - Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - have been involved printing counterfeit YER bank notes potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.



The Houthis continued use of the YER means that regardless of what the new Central Bank chooses to do, it mustn't be a central bank just for Aden or Hadi's government, but one for all Yemenis.

Indeed, the use of the YER by the Houthis has already raised key challenges for the new Bank when determining the circulation of the YER notes in the country.



Putting the allegedly influx of counterfeit YER notes to one side, the new Bank must be able to control the supply of paper notes in the country, something it is clearly unable to do so since it's government has no reach in the more heavily populated north.



This inability to control paper money supply is reflected by the indecision of the new Bank when deciding how to release the millions of YER paper notes printed in Moscow by the Russian state.



These Russian-printed notes remain in the new Bank's premises in Aden and reportedly have no date for release as of yet.



Meanwhile, the actions of Hadi's internationally-recognised government have also undermined the legitimacy of the new Bank. Hadi's government has allegedly maintained accounts with Saudi domestic commercial banks for use by officials with no transparency or accountability.

The new Central Bank must be able to control the supply of paper notes in the country, something it is clearly unable to do

In particular, it is said that the internationally-recognised government holds an account at Ahli Bank in Saudi Arabia, where revenues from oil exports have been deposited. The cornerstone of the central bank and government relationship is that the state is the exclusive customer of the central bank.



By banking elsewhere, directly in name of the government, Hadi's government is directly undermining the role of the new Central Bank and potentially increasing the likelihood of corruption due to the lack of regulatory oversight over the accounts.

Most recently, however, there appears to be some progress with the development of Yemen's new Central Bank systemic capacity.



The new governor, Mohamed Zemam, recently concluded consultations with the International Monetary Fund, with the US confirming its continued support.



In addition, under Zemam's leadership, the new Bank has decided to return food subsidies which should help lower food prices for civilians.



Zemam has also made gestures towards creating a new Bank for all Yemenis, though it remains to be seen whether this will become reality.



The collapse of Yemen's economy is now in the hands of the new Central Bank, and as Voltaire stated during the French Revolution, with great power comes great responsibility.



Zemam now resides over an uneasy economic compromise with each decision he takes, having the potential to plunge the country into an inescapable darkness.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

A deepening humanitarian crisis

The year 2017 was marked by a steady deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The unabating conflict, the steady economic decline and the resulting collapse of basic social services further aggravated the vulnerability of millions of people whose coping mechanisms had been under pressure for two years. Displacement, food insecurity, disease and malnutrition continued to be the primary drivers of needs. As the year unfolded, a cholera outbreak, the worst recorded in history, spread across the entire country affecting more than one million people. By the end of the year the number of people in need had increased by 2 million, resulting in 20.8 million people requiring some form of humanitarian assistance and protection, 11.3 million of whom were in acute need.

Violations of IHL threaten the protection of civilians

The conduct of hostilities continued to be brutal, air strikes and fighting continued to inflict heavy casualties, damage public and private infrastructure, and impede delivery of humanitarian assistance. Serious concerns regarding the conduct of the conflict, in which all parties appeared to have committed violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law continued to be raised. of 31 December 2017, health facilities had reported nearly reported 9,245 conflict related deaths and over 52,807 injuries. These figures significantly undercount the true extent of casualties given diminished reporting capacity of health facilities and people’s difficulties accessing healthcare. The conflict and violence engulfed the country in a vast protection crisis in which millions of people faced tremendous threats to their safety and wellbeing, and the most vulnerable struggled to survive.

Forced displacement and returns

Conflict continued to be the main driver of displacement. Since the escalation of the conflict in March 2015, more than 3 million people were displaced within Yemen, including 2 million who remained displaced by the end of 2017. While over 1 million former IDPs had provisionally returned to their areas of origin, the sustainability of these returns remained highly precarious due to lack of livelihoods opportunity, exhausted coping mechanism and crumbling access to social services in areas of return. Substantial numbers of returnees were found to be living in damaged houses, unable to afford repairs and facing serious protection risks. Nearly 70 per cent of returnees were in Aden, Sana’a or Taiz while half of the IDPs were sheltering in Hajjah, Taizz and Sana’a, living with host families or in rented accommodation.

Collapse of basic services and institutions

Essential basic services and the institutions that provide them continued to collapse under the weight of conflict, displacement and economic decline. As the public budget deficit grew by more than 50 per cent salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers were paid erratically, often leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – nearly 30 per cent of the population – without a regular income at a time of shortages and rising prices. The ability of public institutions to provide services contracted at a time while needs were surging. The inability of the health services to contain localized cases of cholera will result in the unfolding of an unprecedented outbreak.

Economic decline and access to markets

Economic decline and import restrictions continued to impact the availability and price of basic goods in markets.

Due to the intensification of the conflict, and restrictions of movement in active conflict areas, the formal market systems were disconnected and commodity movements were disrupted resulting in to scarcity and escalation of prices of essential food and non-food commodities. The closure of Yemen’s ports (sea, land and airports) on 6 November 2017 by the Saudi-led Coalition, resulted in the sharp rise within a 24 hours period in the prices for food, fuel and water had soared, putting them out of reach of vulnerable populations.",Yemen Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
12,yemen,"Justin Hefter was heading home from a skiing weekend in Utah in early 2015 when he groggily checked his email during an early-morning Uber ride to the airport.

A woman he’d met three weeks earlier at a Jordan peace-building conference was asking if anyone could help her friend get out of Yemen. She said his life was in danger due to the escalating war.

Hefter’s first reaction was to rummage around for the business card of Mohammed Al Samawi, a peace activist from Yemen he’d spoken with at the Jordan conference. He quickly learned from Megan Hallahan that Al Samawi was, in fact, the friend in peril.

For 13 days in early 2015, four strangers based in San Francisco, New York and Tel Aviv took on the improbable task of getting Al Samawi out of Yemen. Using various technology platforms and social media, they kept in touch with Al Samawi as the sound of bullets and bomb explosions grew louder and closer; his food and water supplies dwindled and his electricity went in and out, threatening to cut off his lifeline to the outside world.

Neither Hefter, who grew up in Highland Park, or the others — Daniel Pincus, Natasha Westheimer and Hallahan — had experience in international diplomacy. Reaching out to anyone who might know someone and doggedly pursuing leads, their appeals reached aid workers, government officials, ex-military personnel and U.S. senators.

The story of how Al Samawi ended up on an Indian Naval ship evacuating Indian citizens from Yemen is told in his book, “The Fox Hunt: A Refugee’s Memoir of Coming to America.”

Released in April, the book could soon be turned into a feature-length movie with Oscar-caliber talent behind it. Josh Singer, who won an Academy Award for the original screenplay for “Spotlight”, and Marc Platt, a producer on Best Picture nominees “La La Land” and “Bridge of Spies”, are among those bringing the story to the screen.

Left physically disabled by a stroke he suffered as a young child, Al Samawi grew up in a devout Yemeni Muslim household. He was taught to believe in the evils of Judaism and raised to view Christians and Jews as enemies. In his book, he describes how his world view shifted after a Canadian teacher provided him a copy of the Bible and he discovered similarities between the teachings in the Bible and the Quran.

He began working for humanitarian organizations and promoting interfaith understanding, which made him a target of telephone death threats before the war put him in imminent danger.

Hefter, a 2007 graduate of Highland Park High School, said he happened to be reading a book about people who turned away from the Holocaust at the time Hallahan’s email arrived requesting help for a friend.

“It would have been so easy to ignore Megan’s email,” said Hefter, who studied public policy at Stanford University and now lives in the San Francisco Bay area.

After all, it was blind-copied to probably hundreds of people on her contact list, he said.

Yemen grapples with border closures that could spur 'the largest famine the world has seen for many decades' »

But turning away from a life in danger would have felt like a betrayal to his own family. His grandfather on his mother’s side lost 76 relatives in the Holocaust, he said.

In hindsight, he also sees how his upbringing influenced his decision to do what he could. In preparation for his own bar mitzvah, he became pen pals with a Croatian Muslim man in his seventies whose family had protected a Jewish family during the Holocaust.

Hefter believes one turning point in the Yemen rescue came when they learned that India was planning to evacuate its own citizens from Yemen by ship. That raised the question: Could they convince someone to include Mohammed Al Samawi in the evacuation?

Hefter said some contacts put him in touch with a man who had connections to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. That person suggested a letter from an influential U.S. Senator like Mark Kirk could help the cause.

“It was an incredible coincidence,” Hefter said, noting he’d worked as an intern during Kirk’s 2006 Congressional campaign.

“The commitment and idealism of Justin Hefter played a major role in my decision to support Mohammed,” said Kirk, in an email Tuesday from Israel. “We had a goal in my Congressional office to save one prisoner of conscience per year. Fortunately, Mohammed was a success story.”

Speaking by phone from California, Hefter conceded Monday that his “crazy optimism” nearly fell apart during the last few hours of the evacuation plan and all four of them were feeling down.

The ship evacuating Indian citizens was to leave at sundown. As the hour approached in Yemen, Al Samawi was at the dock, but had been told his name did not appear on the list of evacuees. Small fishing boats were ferrying those being evacuated to the Indian naval ship.

“It’s the first night of Passover and we’re calling everybody in our network, diplomats around the world,” Hefter, now 29, recalled. “I’m on the phone screaming at people, saying, This guy is going to die unless you do something.”

War, hunger and now cholera: Yemen's crisis worsens »

Al Samawi had pestered someone into giving him the phone number of the captain of the ship. Hefter was elected to place the call.

“I call the captain and he says, Yes, we will send a fishing boat back for Mohammed, then hangs up,” Hefter said.

After an hour of silence and no word from Al Samawi, Hefter tries calling the captain again but no one picks up the phone.

“For every call that didn’t go through, we just assumed that the ship had left,” Hefter recalled. “We figured we’d lost our opportunity and Mohammed was stuck at the port or worse. It was just a horrible feeling.”

The message that Hefter hopes readers or eventual moviegoers take away from the story is the cumulative power of “yes”.

“There were a lot of people who said no, who said what we were trying to do was literally impossible,” Hefter said. “But there were also many people who said yes, even a small yes. Yes, I will forward your request on to somebody who I think can help.”

Hefter said that every time someone expressed a willingness to help, it made is easier for the next person to say yes.

“Even if it didn’t lead anywhere, it gave me hope to keep going and I could inspire hope in Mohammed,” Hefter said.

He added that he wants people to understand that anybody can make a huge impact on the world.

“What they do does not have to be so grand,” Hefter said. “It just has to come from the heart and have a positive intention.”",Highland Park grad plays key role in peace activist's escape from Yemen: 'This guy is going to die unless you do something',http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/highland-park/news/ct-hpn-hphs-grad-key-player-in-yemen-escape-tl-0510-story.html

Humanitarian Context:

Yemen is experiencing a serious protection crisis as all civilian populations, including persons of concern, face grave risks to their safety, well-being and human rights. A lack of financial support will translate into a lack of capacity to monitor and advocate for the protection of refugees and asylum-seeker.

The situation in Fara Al-Udayn district of Ibb governorate remains stable for any humanitarian interventions although it is located nearby Al Jarrahi district which is considered as a conflict – affected area and targeted by a huge number of air strikes.

A huge number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have fled to Mudhikhera district of Ibb governorate due to the heavy conflicts in Taizziah district of Taizz governorate. The current situation in Mudhikhera is stable even though a large number of affected nearby IDPs keep moving to the district in order to find essential healthcare services as well as safety.

There have been many prevailing cases of diphtheria in As Sabra district of Ibb governorate in the past few days; however, they weren’t associated with deaths. As Sabra is mostly affected by the huge number of IDPs coming from conflict-affected places such as Al-Hudaydah & Taizz governments.

In Taizz Governorate, the security situation is exacerbating these days to such a level that prevents the arrival of emergency humanitarian assistance to the poor along with too many afflicted IDPs who are situated in various areas of the governorate. On top of that, populations face a shortage of water and fuel resources. Not to mention the majority of students who are deprived from studying at school because they cannot even afford to buy the basic necessities of life. Finally, a massive number of SAM and MAM cases for children under five and pregnant lactating women are found within the governorate.",Yemen: Monthly Situation Report No 1 (April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-monthly-situation-report-no-1-april-2018
