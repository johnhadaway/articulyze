0,yemen,"The World Health Organization (WHO), in cooperation with Yemeni local health authorities, has launched a wide-scale anti-cholera vaccination campaign in south Yemen, WHO said in a statement Sunday, Xinhua reported.

It said the campaign will last until May 10, and targeted, in its first phase, four districts in Aden city.

The government-run Saba news website quoted deputy health minister Ahmed al-Waledi as saying that the campaign will include Tawahee, Mualla, Khormaksar and Sirah districts.

He said the oral vaccine would target nearly 350,000 children at the age of five.

Though the number of cholera infection cases has declined rapidly in the Yemen, fears grow about a possible new cholera outbreak in this rainy season, according to United Nations humanitarian agencies.

The rainy season began in April and will last until August.

In November 2017, the United Nations reported more than 925,000 suspected cholera cases with over 2,200 associated deaths in the war-torn country since the epidemic started in April of the same year.

The infection rate has since been declining, by around 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent, according to WHO.

Yemen has been locked in a civil war for more than three years between Iranian-allied Houthi rebel group and the internationally-recognized government backed by a Saudi-led coalition forces.

The war has killed more than 10,000 Yemenis, half of them civilians, and triggered the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.

• Humanitarian partners are concerned at the safety of more than 4,000 civilians near the frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate.

• Updated casualty figures compiled by WHO from health facilities indicate that nearly 9,500 people were killed and 55,000 more were injured over the last three years.

• The purchasing power of the Yemeni currency is now below half of what it used it to be.

CONCERNS AT THE SAFETY OF CIVILIANS LIVING NEAR FRONTLINES IN AL HUDAYDAH GOVERNORATE

Humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of more than 4,000 civilians living near active frontlines in Al Hudaydah Governorate. Local partners report that families are currently sheltering around Hays, At Tuhayat and Al Garrahi Districts where sporadic armed clashes have continued. During the reporting period, fighting was also reported in Al Khawkhah District.

Fighting in Al Hudaydah and Taizz Governorates has resulted in scores of people killed and injured and has displaced more than 130,000 people since December 2017.

Humanitarian partners are assisting some of the displaced in the areas covered by Al Hudaydah hub, but as shown in the map, a significant number of districts have high access constraints. Southern districts of Al Hudaydah Governorate and northern districts of Hajjah Governorate, where the conflict is most active, are among the hardest to reach.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah Hub: On 24 April, airstrikes reportedly hit a fuel station located in Abs District, killing 20 people and injuring 30 others. The INGO Action Contre La Faim reported supporting 663 newly displaced families from Hays district hosted in Al Garrahi District with nonfood item (NFI) packages. UNHCR supported 1,200 vulnerable displaced families living in Al Qanawes District with NFI packages. A total of 714 households of these received emergency shelter kits. UNHCR also provided 240 vulnerable displaced families in Al Hudaydah City with rental subsidies covering three months.

Aden Hub: The total number of families reportedly displaced to Aden Hub since December 2017 has reached 9,536 households as of 22 April. According to a displacement tracking report, the number of IDPs increased by 102 households over the last week, 75 of which were reported in Tuban and Tur Al Bahah Districts in Lahj Governorate and 27 in Zingibar District in Abyan Governorate. Displacement figures remain unchanged in Al Mukha and Dhubab Districts in Taizz Governorate, that is 618 and 55 households respectively.

Aden Governorate reportedly suffered from sewage overflow, especially Mualla, Sheihk Othamn, Mansorah and Dar Saad Districts. Government efforts yielded in the provision of new four suction tankers with a total cost of US$1 million. In Al Buraiqeh District, CARE has started rehabilitating a water network to help cover the water shortage in IDP settlements in Aden Governorate.

Ibb Hub: In Taizz Governorate, heavy clashes between government forces and Ansar Allah reportedly continued in Maqbanah, Mawza and Dimnat Khadir districts. Following the killing of an ICRC staff last week, clashes erupted between government forces and armed groups, including ISIS, in Taizz city. In the latter, shortages of drinking water continued as fuel could not be delivered to the water department due to the ongoing clashes.

UNICEF reported the delivery of nutrition supplies to Government Health Offices both in Ibb and Taizz governorates. The supplies are to be distributed to 82 health facilities in Ibb and to 86 health facilities in Taizz.

UNHCR completed the distribution of non-food items to 37 families (293 individuals) in Dhi AsSufal District of Ibb Governorate.

Sa’ada Hub: Escalated airstrikes and ground fighting continued across the districts bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Sa’ada Governorate and the frontlines in Al Jawf Governorate. Civilian casualties were reported.

According to local authorities, about 1,270 households have been displaced in the last few months in Kitaf Wa Al Boqe’e, Shada’a, Qatabir, and Ghamr districts in Sa’ada Governorate. UNHCR reported the distribution of 1,000 non-food item packages and 500 emergency shelter kits in Bquim and Razih Districts.

Sana’a Hub: The Protection Cluster reported that the number of civilian impact incidents in the Sana’a hub fell during the period from 19 to 25 April, although airstrikes hit an electricity power station in the south of Sana’a City. Five civilians were injured in the airstrike, and the damages caused to the facility will potentially affect 320 people.

During the reporting period, the Dhamar Customs Office held three trucks carrying nutrition assistance items from Aden to Sana’a. The items were to be warehoused in Sana’a before being dispatched to Al Hudaydah Governorate. The Nutrition Cluster and OCHA are following up with the local authorities.

Meanwhile, Al Joumhoury Hospital in Sana’a City has warned that it may have to close its dialysis centre due to lack of supplies.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 24 – 30 April 2018 | Issue 13,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-24-30-april-2018-issue-13
2,yemen,"UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah: Health sources reported that at least 20 civilians were killed and 47 were injured by airstrikes on a wedding ceremony in Bani Qais District in Hajjah Governorate on 22 April. Other sources have up to 40 people killed. The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. In Abs District, an airstrike on an IDP house reportedly killed five civilians including one woman and injured one man from the same family. WFP distributed 2,700 food baskets through an implementing partner in Al Khawkhah District. Following the identification of seven positive cholera cases in Al Hudaydah city, ICRC conducted a verification test to all suspected water sources used by patients and found one borehole contaminated by the cholera vibrio. The borehole was immediately closed and the Rapid Response Team was activated to ensure chlorination of all water sources across the Governorate.

Aden: Partners continued to assist the current IDP caseload. Although the humanitarian response has improved through stronger coordination with subnational clusters, some gaps remain in Shabwah,

Hadramaut and Al Maharah Governorates. OCHA is working with sub-national clusters to address those gaps. Additionally, in order to effectively respond to increased displacement in areas along Yemen’s western coast, humanitarian partners have started to pre-position different type of stocks including energy biscuits, hygiene kits, drinking water, transitional shelter and non-food items to be dispatched to selected service points in Hays and Al Khawkhah within 24 hours. During the reporting period, a rapid need assessment was conducted in Khanfir, Zingibar, Lawdar Districts in Abyan Governorate and Al Had District in Lahj Governorate. Findings indicate that there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance in the sectors of water, sanitation and hygiene, food and shelter. However, there is no need for rapid health response as it is being covered by existing health facilities services and mobile clinics. A multi-sector assessment conducted in Al Khawkhah District in Al-Hudaydah Governorate concluded the need for sustained interventions in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and nonfood items, protection, food and health. A multi-sector assessment in Bayhan District, Shabwah Governorate reported that there are 700 displaced families. More than 90 per cent of the IDPs lack access to water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and non-food items ad face specific protection concerns.

Sana’a: Ground fighting in Al Bayda Governorate escalated during the reporting period, resulting in the displacement of approximately 50 families. OCHA is working with shelter cluster to ensure that the needs are addressed. The latest report of the Civilian Impact Monitoring Project (CIMP) covering Amanat Al Asimah (Sana’a City), Sana’a and Marib Governorates indicates that the number of civilian impact incidents fell again for the third consecutive week, from four to two. One of the incidents was in Al Haymah Ad Dakhiliyah District in western Sana’a, and the other was in Bani Al Harith in the north of the capital city. Both incidents were caused by airstrikes. Although there were no civilian fatalities, three civilians were reportedly injured and civilian infrastructure was damaged. Authorities in Sana’a have formally informed the World Health Organization that the implementation of the cholera vaccination campaign in the areas under their control is rejected.

Sa’ada: The protection cluster reports that in the period from 12 to 18 April, the number of civilian impact incidents in Sa’ada increased from 23 to 30. Although the number of incidents increased, the number of civilian casualties decreased, dropping from 41 to 12. Contrary to previous weeks, casualties were the result of shelling (67%) or small arms fire (23%). Airstrikes also hit water infrastructure and a school in Razih District, potentially leaving 3,000 households with restricted access to basic services.

UNICEF issued a statement on the recent incident that targeted a water project in Sa’ada Governorate on 13 April. The Al-Hamazat water system in the Sehar District in Sa’ada Governorate was completely destroyed in an attack that left 7,500 people, including IDP families, without water. During the attack, the nearby solar energy system which provides power to the water system was also severely damaged. The water system had already been destroyed in 2015 and was later rebuilt in 2017. UNICEF stressed that damage to water infrastructure jeopardizes efforts to prevent another cholera outbreak in Yemen.

Ibb: Western frontlines in Taizz Governorate witnessed a military escalation during the reporting period. On 20 April, 20 people were reportedly killed when their vehicles were hit by airstrikes in Mawza District.The UN Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attack calling for an investigation. A multicluster rapid assessment in Mawza District of Taizz Governorate found that humanitarian situation of some 655 IDP families displaced within the district since May 2017 is dire with 98 per cent of the IDPs scattered in open areas, living in shelters made from straw without any basic water sanitation and hygiene services. The report indicates also that women and children (less than 12 years old) are the majority of the IDPs. WFP reported completing the in-kind food distribution cycle of March, targeting approximately 527,000 people in Taizz Governorate and 344,880 people in Ibb Governorate. A distribution of non-food items by UNHCR to 71 households in Dhu-Sufar District in Ibb Governorate was postponed to next week due to access constraints. The two main hospitals (AlJamhoury and Al- Thawrah) in Taizz city have closed their dialysis departments due to lack of supplies.

The head of ICRC’s detention program in Yemen, was deadly shot in an attack on his vehicle by unknown armed men on 21 April in Taizz Governorate. The humanitarian community has widely condemned the killing; in his statement of 22 April the UN SecretaryGeneral reminded all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law concerning the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts and called for a prompt, effective and transparent investigation. The Government of Yemen has condemned the incident that happened in an area under its control and committed to exposing the perpetrators.",Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 17 – 23 April 2018 | Issue 12,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-update-covering-17-23-april-2018-issue-12

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

A deepening humanitarian crisis

The year 2017 was marked by a steady deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The unabating conflict, the steady economic decline and the resulting collapse of basic social services further aggravated the vulnerability of millions of people whose coping mechanisms had been under pressure for two years. Displacement, food insecurity, disease and malnutrition continued to be the primary drivers of needs. As the year unfolded, a cholera outbreak, the worst recorded in history, spread across the entire country affecting more than one million people. By the end of the year the number of people in need had increased by 2 million, resulting in 20.8 million people requiring some form of humanitarian assistance and protection, 11.3 million of whom were in acute need.

Violations of IHL threaten the protection of civilians

The conduct of hostilities continued to be brutal, air strikes and fighting continued to inflict heavy casualties, damage public and private infrastructure, and impede delivery of humanitarian assistance. Serious concerns regarding the conduct of the conflict, in which all parties appeared to have committed violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law continued to be raised. of 31 December 2017, health facilities had reported nearly reported 9,245 conflict related deaths and over 52,807 injuries. These figures significantly undercount the true extent of casualties given diminished reporting capacity of health facilities and people’s difficulties accessing healthcare. The conflict and violence engulfed the country in a vast protection crisis in which millions of people faced tremendous threats to their safety and wellbeing, and the most vulnerable struggled to survive.

Forced displacement and returns

Conflict continued to be the main driver of displacement. Since the escalation of the conflict in March 2015, more than 3 million people were displaced within Yemen, including 2 million who remained displaced by the end of 2017. While over 1 million former IDPs had provisionally returned to their areas of origin, the sustainability of these returns remained highly precarious due to lack of livelihoods opportunity, exhausted coping mechanism and crumbling access to social services in areas of return. Substantial numbers of returnees were found to be living in damaged houses, unable to afford repairs and facing serious protection risks. Nearly 70 per cent of returnees were in Aden, Sana’a or Taiz while half of the IDPs were sheltering in Hajjah, Taizz and Sana’a, living with host families or in rented accommodation.

Collapse of basic services and institutions

Essential basic services and the institutions that provide them continued to collapse under the weight of conflict, displacement and economic decline. As the public budget deficit grew by more than 50 per cent salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers were paid erratically, often leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – nearly 30 per cent of the population – without a regular income at a time of shortages and rising prices. The ability of public institutions to provide services contracted at a time while needs were surging. The inability of the health services to contain localized cases of cholera will result in the unfolding of an unprecedented outbreak.

Economic decline and access to markets

Economic decline and import restrictions continued to impact the availability and price of basic goods in markets.

Due to the intensification of the conflict, and restrictions of movement in active conflict areas, the formal market systems were disconnected and commodity movements were disrupted resulting in to scarcity and escalation of prices of essential food and non-food commodities. The closure of Yemen’s ports (sea, land and airports) on 6 November 2017 by the Saudi-led Coalition, resulted in the sharp rise within a 24 hours period in the prices for food, fuel and water had soared, putting them out of reach of vulnerable populations.",Yemen Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
4,yemen,"The Pentagon is interested in having contractors provide two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters on call to rescue wounded American special operators in and around Yemen if necessary, as well as to perform various other missions. The announcement comes as it becomes increasingly clear that the U.S. military’s own aerial casualty evacuation capabilities are stretched thin and just months after it weathered serious criticism over relying heavily on private companies for these services following a deadly ambush in Niger. U.S. Transportation Command, acting on behalf of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia, posted the notice on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on April 30, 2018. The draft documents say the basic requirements are for the four contractor-operated aircraft to provide casualty and medical evacuation, personnel recovery, and passenger and cargo services.

American special operators publicly returned to Yemen in 2016 after a brief absence, ostensibly to support operations against Al Qaeda- and ISIS-linked terrorists. The new element, known officially as Special Operations Command (Forward) Yemen, is the one the contract announcement specifically names as needing the aviation support. Additional special operations forces have made short-duration raids into the country, as well. The U.S. military has been actively engaged in various counter-terrorism and related training missions in the country since at least 2009. In 2015, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition repeatedly intervened in the country to halt the rise of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, but American personnel on the ground at present are not supposed to be engaged in any operations together with those forces.

US Army A US Army soldier guards a Columbia Helicopters Vertol 107-II helicopter during a training exercise in Afghanistan.

Casualty evacuation and more The April 2018 contract notice says U.S. special operators in the country are now in need of fixed-wing aircraft that can take off and land on runways as short as 3,000 feet, or even less and possibly at night with the crew having to use night vision goggles. The planes may need to “hot refuel” with the engines still running at forward locations. Though the contracting notice doesn’t specify any particular types of aircraft, the fixed-wing types have to be able to fly at least 500 miles without refueling while carrying up to eight passengers or as much as 4,000 pounds of cargo. The contract would have to supply trained medical personnel, as well, to be able to render aid immediately and throughout the flight, presumably as the aircraft flew onward to a location with a more robust medical facility.

TRANSCOM The basic requirements for the two categories of aircraft in the draft contracting documents.

The two helicopters, also with crews capable of night vision goggle operations at night, would need to have unrefueled ranges of a minimum of 400 miles, also while transporting as many as eight individuals or 3,500 pounds of cargo. In addition to emergency medical technicians to see to wounded personnel throughout the operation, the helicopters would also need to be able to hoist personnel or other items over water or in rugged, mountainous terrain, the latter being referred to as “high angle” recoveries. The crews of both the fixed-wing planes and the helicopters need to mobilize within 30 minutes of receiving a notification from U.S. Central Command. Having two of each aircraft type is specifically to allow for one to be fully mission capable at all times, with an alternate in case of unforeseen issues. However, there is no stated requirement, at least in the draft documentation, about how quickly they aircraft need to be able to get to the specified location or complete the mission. Emergency medical professionals generally aim to get injured individuals to the next level of care within the “golden hour.” Though there is some debate about whether a firm 60-minute window makes a difference, it goes without saying that the faster a person with serious, potentially life-threatening injuries can get into a proper medical facility, the better chance they have of making a full recovery.

A large operating area The contracting notice does not say where the U.S. government would base the planes and helicopters and their crews, but identifies a host of potential sites in Bahrain, Djibouti, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. military defines all of these as within “Yemen Area of Responsibility,” or Yemen AOR.

TRANSCOM A list of airports and air bases that contractors could have to operate from in support of operations in Yemen.

The full list in the documents includes, but is not limited to, major American hubs in the region such as Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport in Djibouti – which hosts Camp Lemonnier, the U.S. military’s only formal base in Africa – Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Djibouti, which has long served as an American staging ground for operations in Yemen, seems the most likely “home base,” especially given references in the contract documentation to U.S. Africa Command, which oversees operations in that country.

Google Maps/The War Zone A map showing the various locations identified within the contracting documents, a broad area the US military refers to as the Yemen AOR.

Still, the aircraft would likely make routine use of more forward operating sites situated nearer to the Yemeni border, where the aircraft could stage ahead of planned, short-duration operations or at times when it is otherwise apparent that there are greater risks to American troops. The specified range requirements are otherwise not enough for the aircraft to reach sites in Yemen from many of the designated larger facilities elsewhere in and around the Arabian Peninsula. The documentation also identifies 10 specific locations within Yemen, which the U.S. military defines as the ""Yemen Joint Special Operations Area,"" or Yemen JSOA. These include sites across the country, including the capital Sana’a, the port city of Aden, and the heavily contested city of Hodeidah, also written Al Hudaydah, on the Red Sea, the last of which remains largely under the control of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

Google Maps/The War Zone A close-up map showing the 10 separate locations in Yemen, as well as sites just over the border in Saudi Arabia to the North, Oman to the east, and Djoubti to the southwest.

However, it’s not clear how much coverage four aircraft of any type might be necessarily able to provide across such a wide area. From the draft documentation, it appears clear that the contractors’ primary role would be casualty and medical evacuation, potentially rushing to save seriously wounded individuals. But this mission set, especially, requires good positioning and rapid response to be truly effective. These same issues were at the core of major criticisms about the U.S. military’s response, or lack thereof, to the infamous ambush of American and Nigerien troops in Niger in October 2017. French multi-role combat jets and gunship and transport helicopters were the first air support elements to arrive on scene during that skirmish, which left four U.S. personnel dead. Contractors, working for U.S. Africa Command and situated in the country’s capital Niamey, who were similarly charged with casualty evacuation and personnel recovery missions, only arrived after the fighting had stopped to recover the bodies. No other U.S. military combat aircraft or combat search and rescue elements were in the country, let alone readily available.

A multi-faceted conflict Unlike Niger, where militant groups typically engage in more limited attacks, Yemen is in the midst of a brutal civil war combined with an equally grueling and controversial Saudi-led intervention. Despite their official focus on Al Qaeda- and ISIS-affiliated terrorists, there is a significant risk that U.S. special operations forces could end up drawn into the country’s broader conflict. That the Yemen JSOA apparently contains locations such as Hodeidah, which sits in an area with a heavy Houthi presence, calls into question just how practical it might be for American forces to avoid the Saudi-run campaign, regardless of their stated mission. If nothing else, it indicates that U.S. personnel are coordinating with the Saudis and their partners to a significant degree, otherwise there would be a serious danger of the two sets of operations conflicting with each other. The operating area also prompts questions about whether the U.S. military mission in Yemen is as limited or distinct from the Saudi-led efforts as officials have made it out to be in the past. As of December 2017, the Pentagon said it had a grand total of five personnel in the country, which seems extremely dubious given the apparent breath of the JSOA. Renewed questions about the true nature and purpose of America's involvement in Yemen, especially after a controversial raid in January 2017 left a U.S. Navy SEAL and a number of innocent civilians dead, have prompted challenges from advocacy groups and legislators in the past 18 months. Just recently, though, in March 2018, the U.S. Senate rejected a bill that would have ended indirect American support for the Saudi Arabian effort.

5,yemen,"TEHRAN, May 04 (MNA) – Senior Adviser to Iranian Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Hossein Jaberi Ansari, who is currently leading an Iranian delegation in talks with four European states on Yemen crisis in Italy, said that ending crisis in Yemen is one of the regional policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Iran’s senior negotiator in talks on regional crises made the above remark after a meeting with the Secretary General of the EU diplomatic service, Helga Schmid and director general of the Italian, German, French and British foreign ministries for political and security affairs and said, “the meeting was mainly centered on developments in Yemen.”

Main goal behind the talks between Iran and four European states was to explore avenues to end Yemen crisis and find a way out of the situation in the impoverished states, Jaberi said, describing Thursday’s discussion on Yemen as good.

“Yemeni crisis has taken up terrible humanitarian dimensions, as we witness a widespread human catastrophe and the silent death of a nation,” he said, reiterating Iran’s endeavors to bring the crisis to an end.

This was the second such a session held after a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on February, 2018, focusing on political and humanitarian situation in Yemen.

Participants in the meeting agreed to hold the next round of the talks in Brussels in following the fasting month of Ramadhan in the second half of the June.

6,yemen,"The baby twitches his legs in pain in the video. He's crying but he is so dehydrated his eyes can't produce tears. His inflated belly is as taut as a balloon. It is easy to count the 12 rows of protruding ribs on his rapidly palpitating chest.

The video, filmed by a doctor, shows 8-month-old Fadl suffering not from disease, but from starvation.

Three years into a civil war, Yemen is starving and could soon start to see widespread death from famine. Houthi rebels hold the country's north, and a Saudi-led coalition, armed and backed by the United States, has sought to bomb the rebels into submission with a relentless air campaign in support of the Yemeni government.

Some 400,000 children are fighting for their lives in the direst state of hunger, severe acute malnutrition — the stage of swollen bellies and twig-like arms that are signs the body is eating away at itself for lack of nutrients and protein. In Yemen, around 2.9 million women and children are acutely malnourished, a stage of starvation just short of severe.

Fadl's mother, Fatma Halabi, recalled the life before the war in the western district of Mowza, near Yemen's Red Sea coast. In those days, the family had fish and vegetables often. Her husband, a woodcutter, could make the equivalent of $4 a day.

Mowza was in the hands of Houthi rebels for most of the war. Last year, government forces descended on the area to drive the rebels out. The fighting and airstrikes sent people fleeing, some of them scattering across the Great Valley.

Separated from her husband, Halabi led her four children and two goats across the Great Valley, the arid plain spilling down from the mountains toward the city of Mocha on the Red Sea.

These desolate stretches are historically a site of death. More than 400 years ago, a Muslim ruler forcibly sent almost the entire Jewish population of Yemen here for refusing to convert. Chroniclers say two thirds of them died in the heat and deprivation.

Halabi and the children hid in thorn bushes to avoid artillery and airstrikes along the shifting front line. One day in April last year, she went into labor and, alone, gave birth to Fadl under a tree.

Eventually, she and her husband reunited and settled in an abandoned hut in the valley.

Speaking from inside her makeshift home in February, Halabi sat with a rope cinched around her emaciated waist, even as her blue robe kept sliding off her bony shoulder.

She spoke in short, exhausted sentences. When asked what she had eaten that day, she said, ""Bor,"" the local Arabic word for flour. ""We stay patient,"" she said. ""We have to feed the children."" When she gets hungry, she lies down and tries to sleep.

Often she and her husband eat one meal in the morning, and nothing again until the next day.

Unable to breastfeed Fadl, she gave him goat or camel milk, which lack the nutrients of breast milk or formula. The newborn kept getting fever and diarrhea, so she repeatedly borrowed money to take him to the hospital in Mocha.

The hospital has seen 600 malnutrition cases within 10 months, but is so short on supplies it doesn't even have pain relievers for headaches, said one doctor, Abdel-Rehim Ahmed. It has no therapeutic feeding center. None of its doctors have been trained in treating malnutrition.

And Mocha is swelling with 40,000 displaced people.

Left untreated, prolonged malnutrition causes the body to lose its stock of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The brain struggles to find energy, the heart shrinks, and the skin cracks, exposing the body to infections. The kidney and the liver stop functioning properly, so toxins build up inside the body, leading to a vicious cycle of disease.

Fadl's last visit to the hospital was Nov. 29. At eight months old, he weighed 2.9 kilograms (6 pounds), a third of the normal weight. The circumference of his upper arm, a common measure for malnutrition, was 7 centimeters, less than 3 inches. That indicated severe acute malnutrition.

Unable to pay for a hospital stay, Fadl's parents took him home.

He gave his last breath not long after in the arms of his grandmother. His exhausted parents were asleep on the floor. The grandmother woke them and told them their boy was dead.

The only image of Fadl from his short life of hunger and pain is the video, taken by the head of the nutrition center. His parents don't have mobile phones or a camera.

""Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I remember he's no longer there and I start to cry,"" Halabi said. ""Who wouldn't cry for their children?""

7,yemen,"Turkey may have shifted its priorities away from Yemen, but it can still play a positive role in trying to alleviate some of the human suffering which seems to have no end in sight.

Throughout the years leading up to the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, Turkey’s projection of soft-power was a key pillar of Ankara’s 21st century foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa. The ideology of the Justice and Development (AK) Party appealed to many in Arab countries who sought democratic reforms and political openings for their grassroots movements.

This “Turkish model” gained influence in Yemen, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew popular as he did in other Arab countries in the 2000s.

Yet undoubtedly Ankara’s efforts to expand Turkish soft-power in Yemen faced major setbacks due to the Houthi takeover of Sanaa in 2014, and the subsequent entry of the Saudi-led military coalition into the country’s civil war, of which Ankara has not been a major actor. Nonetheless, Yemen remains important to Turkey’s leadership.

Based on Ankara’s geostrategic interests in the Red Sea and Bab al Mandeb coupled with historical connections rooted in the Ottoman era that bond Turks and Yemenis, Turkey has high stakes in the future outcome of Yemen’s political environment and the unfolding humanitarian disaster.

When the Saudi-led Arab coalition launched Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen in March 2015, Ankara uncovered that it was previously informed of the operation, signaling close cooperation and coordination between Ankara and Riyadh at that point.

Turkey supported the operation for two main reasons. First, from Turkey’s perspective, the Houthis’ rejection of UNSCR 2201 and refusal to withdraw from the governmental institutions in Sana’a meant that the Iran-allied rebels were responsible for Yemen’s deteriorating situation.

Turkey lent support to the internationally-recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Visits to Turkey paid by Hadi and delegations representing his government have underscored Ankara’s support for Hadi.

Moreover, Ankara opposed Tehran’s meddling in Yemeni affairs via Iranian sponsorship of the Houthi rebellion. Erdogan went even further to accuse Iran of trying to dominate the region via sectarian agenda, adding “[Iran] has to withdraw any forces, whatever it has in Yemen, as well as Syria and Iraq and respect their territorial integrity.”

Second, during King Abdullah’s final few years on the throne, Riyadh shifted its regional priorities from concentrating solely on Iran to focusing on both the perceived threats posed by the Islamic Republic in addition to movements like the Muslim Brotherhood in Arab countries, namely Egypt, which disrupted collective efforts in the region to counter Tehran.

The Al Saud rulers’ anti-Muslim Brotherhood agenda also created a rift in the Sunni bloc, allowing Iran to further increase its influence in the Arab countries including Yemen. Yet when King Salman assumed power in January 2015, Riyadh became focused on improving ties with Doha and Ankara to counter Iran, with less concern about the Muslim Brotherhood. The role of Saudi Arabia’s then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was crucial in this regard.

Thus, Ankara’s support for Operation Decisive Storm was logical because, at least from the Turkish government’s perspective, the Saudi-led campaign contributed to a wider effort to resolve Yemen’s conflict and to restore the country’s legitimate state authority back in power.

Furthermore, Ankara vowed to provide the Saudis with intelligence and logistical support in Yemen, yet no direct military support. Ultimately, Turkey’s decision resulted from officials in Ankara believing that Riyadh lacked any clear vision with respect to the Saudi-led coalition’s end game.

From that point on, the Turkish role in the Yemeni crisis has varied in scope and type shifting between security, politics, diplomacy, and humanitarianism depending on the situation on ground and Riyadh’s position vis-a-vis Turkey.

During the first month of the operation, Ankara tried to convert the Saudi military push to a political solution. In this regard, Turkey launched a backdoor diplomatic effort, which also included Pakistan.

After being discussed with Riyadh, Ankara tried to convince Iran to support a deal which included asking Houthis to withdraw from the capital to Saada in northwestern Yemen , allowing the humanitarian aid to freely enter Yemen, and forming a national unity government. However, Iran’s rejection thwarted any such progress.

The divergence of Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s agendas in Yemen proved that Ankara’s overall initial assessment regarding the prospects of the military effort was highly realistic. The military campaign was turning into a vain and chaotic act, which as of now has resulted in an estimated 10,000 civilian deaths and left 17 million at risk of starvation.

In one of his leaked e-mails, the UAE's ambassador, Yousef al Otaiba, to Washington admitted that the coalition has targeted civilians and that the Saudi air force had committed most of the “errant strikes”. Furthermore, Ankara recognised that Abu Dhabi’s growing role, especially in southern Yemen, contrasted with Riyadh’s and truly threatened the national unity of Yemen.

The security landscape within Turkey and the immediate neighbourhood at the end of 2015 and during 2016 has left Ankara viewing the Yemeni crisis as a lower priority.

Nonetheless, Ankara has consistently stressed the importance of preserving Yemen’s territorial integrity and unity. Simultaneously, the Turkish leadership has sought to alleviate the human suffering in Yemen while also promoting a political settlement to the civil war.

Turkey and the governing AK Party’s ideological doctrines have maintained popularity in Yemen. Yet from Ankara’s perspective, projecting Turkish hard power in the war-torn country has not been realistic given such circumstances.

Decision makers thought that investing in humanitarian and diplomatic efforts would best advance Turkey’s interests. Such an effort can still guarantee Turkey a future place in the hearts and minds of the Yemenis while the regional actors that are most involved in Yemen—Iran, Saudi Arabia, and UAE—continue fighting and creating new enemies in the country.

To that end, Turkey has utilised its capacity as a member of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and specifically as one of the 18 members of the OIC Contact Group on Yemen. In June 2015, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attended the OIC Contact Group on Yemen’s meeting in Jeddah, which was the first of four meetings that the group has held thus far.

The Turks have also provided Yemen with emergency assistance as the Arabian country’s humanitarian crisis exacerbates, delivering humanitarian relief to Yemenis via the Port of Aden.

Moreover, Turkey hosted and treated many Yemenis who suffered injuries because of the ongoing armed conflict. In addition to its emergency assistance in 2015 and 2016, and its pledge of $1 million announced in April 2017 at the “High Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen”, Ankara recently sent to Yemen on a vessel containing around 11 thousand tons of humanitarian assistance, worth USD 9 million.

The Qatar effect

The ongoing Qatar crisis has changed the regional geopolitical landscape back to 2013-2014, only for the worse. The GCC’s diplomatic row has created more splits in an already-torn Yemen, cracks in the Yemini government and rifts with the partners including the Islah party and Qatar, which was expelled from the Saudi-led military coalition in the immediate aftermath of the GCC crisis’ eruption.

Not only were the Islah party and Qatar’s efforts important in terms of fighting Houthis and countering Iran’s influence in Yemen, but both were also allies of Turkey. As a result, the GCC crisis further complicated Ankara’s role in Yemen.

The OIC Yemen Contact Group meeting, which was supposed to be held in Istanbul has been postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, the Saudi-led bloc tried to hinder the Turkish humanitarian effort last July by briefly intercepting its humanitarian ship to Aden due to Ankara’s role in supporting Doha.

Even though Ankara constantly condemns Houthi missiles attacks targeting Saudi Arabia, Turkey's foreign policy vis-a-vis Yemen has gone beyond merely condemning Iran or cheering Saudi Arabia.

Now Turkey is keeping a rather low-profile role while focusing instead on the urgency of Yemen’s humanitarian crisis. Indeed, any political solution in which Ankara can play a key role in preparing an end to the civil war would be useful.

Once the dust settles in Yemen’s civil war, Turkey may return to being a far more influential player in the country due to the reach of its soft-power.

Associated Press

The young mother stepped onto the scale for the doctor. Even with all her black robes on, she weighed only 84 pounds. Umm Mizrah is pregnant, but starving herself to feed her children.

And her sacrifice may not be enough to save them.

The doctor’s office is covered with dozens of pictures of emaciated babies who have come through Al-Sadaqa Hospital in Aden, casualties of a three-year war in Yemen that has left millions of people on the edge of famine.

Mothers like Umm Mizrah are often the only defense against the hunger that has killed thousands. They skip meals, they sleep to escape the gnawing in their stomachs. They hide bony faces and emaciated bodies in voluminous black abaya robes and veils.

The doctor asked the mother to get back on the scale holding her son, Mizrah. At 17 months, he was 12.8 pounds – around half the normal weight for his age.

He showed all the signs of “severe acute malnutrition,” the most dire stage of hunger. His legs and feet were swollen, he wasn’t getting enough protein. When the doctor pressed a finger into the skin of his feet, the indentation lingered.

Around 2.9 million women and children are acutely malnourished; another 400,000 children are fighting for their lives, in the same condition as Mizrah.

Nearly a third of Yemen’s population – 8.4 million of its 29 million people – rely completely on food aid or else they would starve. That number grew by a quarter over the past year.

Aid agencies warn that parts of Yemen could soon start to see widespread death from famine. More and more people are reliant on aid that is already failing to reach people. The war, now three years old, drags on interminably between Yemen’s Shiite Houthi rebels who hold the country’s north, and the Saudi-led coalition, armed and backed by the United States, which has sought to bomb the rebels into submission with a relentless air campaign in support of the Yemeni government.

It is unknown how many have died, since authorities are not able to track cases. Save the Children late last year estimated that 50,000 children may have died in 2017 of extreme hunger or disease, given that up to 30 percent of children with untreated cases of severe acute malnutrition die.

“Unfortunately, now Yemen is considered to be the world’s largest humanitarian emergency,” said Stephen Anderson, the Yemen director of the World Food Program. Some 18 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from.

Even before the war, the Arab world’s poorest nation struggled to feed itself. It is a country of deserts and mountains with dwindling water resources where only 2 to 4 percent of the land is cultivated, so almost all of its food and supplies must be imported.

The war has shattered everything that kept Yemen just above starvation. Coalition warplanes blasted hospitals, schools, farms, factories, bridges and roads.

The coalition has also clamped a land-sea-and-air embargo on Houthi-controlled areas, including the Red Sea port of Hodeida, once the entry point of 70 percent of Yemen’s imports. Now far less gets in as coalition ships off shore allow through only UN-inspected and approved commercial ships and aid, often with delays.

The United States gives significant backing to the coalition campaign, providing intelligence and billions of dollars-worth of munitions as well logistical help like air-to-air refueling of coalition warplanes. The U.S. State Department says Washington has provided nearly $854 million to address the humanitarian situation in Yemen.

In many places there is food in the markets, but people simply can’t afford it, since salaries are going unpaid, work is harder to find and the currency has collapsed in value.

Umm Mizrah and her husband, who have three young daughters in addition to Mizrah, usually eat one meal a day, often just bread and tea. The Associated Press is identifying her by the nickname she often goes by – meaning “mother of Mizrah” – to protect her privacy.

When the doctor in Aden told her malnutrition can be fatal, she trembled. The parents felt helpless. Cigarette burns were visible on the baby’s belly. Desperate, the father had turned to a Yemeni folk cure called “maysam,” or “branding” – using burns to expel evil spirits.

“I don’t know what is right,” she said quietly. “He was playful and doing fine then he started to get sick and stopped breastfeeding and playing.”

The AP traveled across southern Yemen, territory held by the coalition-backed government, and visited several districts among the 107 areas nationwide that the U.N. warns are most likely to fall into outright famine.

It is a landscape of desperation.

Death by starvation

A video filmed by a doctor shows 8-month-old Fadl in his last days of life.

The baby twitches his legs in pain. He’s crying but he is so dehydrated his eyes can’t produce tears. His belly is inflated as taut as a balloon. You can easily count the 12 rows of protruding ribs on his rapidly palpitating chest. His desperate parents plastered his head with black henna, a dye that is used as a folk cure.

Fadl was born in the wilderness. His mother, Fatma Halabi, was eight months pregnant when she and thousands of others fled the area around her district of Mowza as government forces descended on the Houthis.

Separated from her husband, Halabi led her four children and two goats across the Great Valley, the arid plain spilling down from the mountains toward the city of Mocha on the Red Sea.

These desolate stretches are historically a site of death. More than 400 years ago, a Muslim ruler forcibly sent almost the entire Jewish population of Yemen here for refusing to convert. Chroniclers say two thirds of them died in the heat and deprivation.

Halabi and the children hid in thorn bushes to avoid artillery and airstrikes along the shifting front line. One day in April last year, she went into labor and, alone, gave birth to Fadl under a tree. And then fainted.

Eventually, she and her husband reunited and settled in an abandoned hut in the valley.

Speaking from inside her makeshift home in February, Halabi sat with a rope cinched around her emaciated waist, her blue robe sliding off her bony shoulder.

She spoke in short, exhausted sentences. When asked what she had eaten that day, she said, “Bor,” the local Arabic word for flour. “We stay patient,” she said. “We have to feed the children.” When she gets hungry, she lies down and tries to sleep.

Often she and her husband eat one meal in the morning, and nothing again until the next day.

Unable to breastfeed Fadl, she gave him goat or camel milk, which lack the nutrients of breast milk or formula. The newborn kept getting fever and diarrhea, so she repeatedly borrowed money to take him to the hospital in Mocha.

The hospital has seen 600 malnutrition cases over the past 10 months, but is so short on supplies it doesn’t even have pain relievers for headaches, said one doctor, Abdel-Rehim Ahmed. It has no therapeutic feeding center. None of its doctors have been trained in treating malnutrition.

And Mocha is swelling with 40,000 displaced people.

Left untreated, prolonged malnutrition causes the body to lose its stock of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The body starts to eat itself. The brain struggles to find energy, the heart shrinks, and the skin cracks, exposing the body to infections. The kidney and the liver stop functioning properly, so toxins build up inside the body, leading to a vicious cycle of disease.

Fadl’s last visit to the hospital was Nov. 29. At eight months old, he weighed 6 pounds, a third of the normal weight. The circumference of his upper arm, a common measure for malnutrition, was less than 3 inches. That indicated severe acute malnutrition.

Unable to pay for a hospital stay, Fadl’s parents took him home.

He gave his last breath not long after in the arms of his grandmother. His exhausted parents were asleep on the floor. The grandmother woke them and told them their boy was dead.

The only image of Fadl from his short life of hunger and pain is the video, taken by the head of the nutrition center. His parents don’t have mobile phones or a camera.

“Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I remember he’s no longer there and I start to cry,” Halabi said. “Who wouldn’t cry for their children?”

‘Liberated’ and still starving

Even in parts of Yemen that are wrested from Houthi rule, starvation persists – or gets worse.

In late February, mothers carrying babies mobbed the nutrition center at the main hospital in al-Khoukha, a little town on the Red Sea, expecting to receive monthly allotments of baby formula and nutrient supplies.

They left empty-handed.

The center ran out of supplies weeks ago. Some of the women, cloaked in black abayas, pushed and shoved feebly. But most were too weak to complain and silently shuffled away.

Al-Khoukha was taken back from the Houthis in December by coalition-backed forces marching up the coast. In rebel hands, the town had been directly connected to the Hodeida port farther north, the biggest entryway for international aid into Yemen.

Now cut off from the port, no supplies have come from the south.

“We have no vaccinations. There are shortages in medicines. The aid stopped,” said Abdullah Doubala, head of al-Khoukha health department. The burden is increasing as families fleeing fighting elsewhere stream into al-Khoukha, bringing more thin and hungry children.

Doctors estimate that 40 percent of the children in the town suffer from malnutrition. Barefoot kids fill the center’s corridors, many visibly emaciated, some with malaria or cholera. Some can barely stand.

Nine-month old Galila, her ribs sharply outlined, her eyes bulging in shrunken sockets, sat in the lap of her mother, Aisha.

The baby girl caught malaria and began to lose weight. Now she is all of 10 pounds, compared to the average of 13-17 pounds for a 9-month-old girl.

Her mother is tiny as well, ravaged by giving up food for a family that is constantly growing.

Aisha has been giving birth each year; Galila is her 14th child. Her husband, a woodcutter, can hardly find any work. Even coming to the hospital is too expensive; if she wants to come, she has to wait for her brother, who has a motorcycle, to take her.

“I eat whatever is available or wait till next day,” Aisha said. “A meal once a day.”

The mothers’ hunger is repeated over and over throughout the war-ravaged country.

A mother’s hunger

It isn’t just those driven from their homes who suffer.

Isolated in a mountain valley, the 450 residents of the village of Qibli are wasting away. Boys and girls running around barefoot in the dirt paths are stunted.

Most of the men here are soldiers, who haven’t been paid for months, or farm laborers, who can no longer find work.

Any money they have goes in search of food. The nearest market is 8 miles away, which means paying high gas prices on top of the cost for the food itself, which have doubled over the past year.

Sitting on the floor of her home, Sherine fed her two children scraps of bread dipped in “besbas,” a sauce of tomato and garlic. She took no bites herself.

Her 1-year-old daughter Amal, has been diagnosed with acute malnutrition and can no longer stand up.

The family lives largely on bread and tea. Her husband is among the ranks of unpaid soldiers. His father, a retired soldier, still gets a meager pension, but uses that to help all his children and grandchildren, a family of 16 in total.

Aid hasn’t come to Qibli since 2016, according to relief volunteer Rashid al-Khoushbi. Only four families in the area were on the World Food Program lists for food aid. Most households here are considered to have a male breadwinner, making them a lower priority.

In the area’s main town, al-Mallah, doctors were nowhere to be seen at the hospital. No one pays them so many staffers often don’t show up.

Sitting in bed, Umm Molham was so weak she could barely lift her 13-month-old son. When the AP met her, she had been at the hospital for three days waiting for someone to examine him.

The toddler had been vomiting, coughing and suffered from diarrhea. The family can only afford to give him formula once a day. His body is emaciated, his eyes sunken.

His mother sat helplessly, the baby in her lap.

“She is not breastfeeding,” said her husband, Anwar Said. “She doesn’t eat well and has no milk.”

Umm Molham didn’t say a word, even when asked questions, lost in her internal world of frailty and hunger.",Yemen on the edge of famine,http://www.concordmonitor.com/One-meal-a-day-Yemeni-mothers-try-to-feed-their-families-17298935
9,yemen,"TEHRAN - Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the Iranian foreign minister’s special assistant in political affairs, said on Thursday that Iran is making efforts to help end the crisis in Yemen.

“One of the objectives behind the Islamic Republic of Iran’s regional policies is making efforts to end this [Yemeni] crisis,” Jaberi Ansari told IRNA after a consultation meeting in Rome between Iran and EU/E4 on regional issues.

“Developments in Yemen was the main theme of the meeting,” he noted.

Jaberi Ansari added, “We had good discussions with the European representatives about various humanitarian, political and military dimensions of the Yemeni crisis.”

According to a press release issued by the EU website, the meeting was chaired by EEAS Secretary General Helga Schmid and attended by E4 countries (France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom) at the level of political directors. The Iranian delegation was led by Jaberi Ansari.

“This is the second edition of talks in this format after the meeting in the margins of the Munich Security Conference in February 2018. The discussions, focused on the political and humanitarian situation in Yemen, were productive. The participants agreed to meet again in this format in Brussels in the near future,” the statement said.

• Continued fighting in Yemen’s western governorates of Al Hudaydah and Taizz has displaced more than 19,000 households.

• The losses caused by the fire in the WFP warehouse in Al Hudaydah on 31 March amount to USD 5 million. A fire reportedly broke out in a WFP mobile storage unit for non-food items in Al Hudaydah city on 16 April. Initial reports indicate that the fire has caused minimal damage.

• A WHO-chartered cargo plane delivered 19 tons of medical supplies to Sana’a Airport.

PROTRACTED VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO PUSH YEMENIS INTO DISPLACEMENT

The Shelter/NFI/CCCM cluster reports that as of 12 April protracted violence in the Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates has displaced 19,145 households of whom 9,838 have been assisted. This new wave of displacement further adds up to the three million Yemenis who have already faced the shock of having to flee their homes, two million of whom remain displaced across the country. 89 percent of IDPs in Yemen have been displaced for more than one year.

According to the Protection Cluster, displaced people increasingly face protection risks, including those living in public buildings, collective centres or spontaneous settlements. Deteriorating shelter conditions, such as overcrowding and unsanitary IDP settlements, have led to increased spread and susceptibility to communicable diseases. Many IDPs are in need of shelter, food, water, sanitation and access to health services. They are vulnerable to exploitation, indebtedness, and negative coping mechanism, such as begging, child labour, recruitment by armed groups and early marriage.

As conditions deteriorate in Yemen, humanitarian partners have prioritised assistance for some of the most vulnerable communities, including IDPs, returnees and host communities. In 2018, a total of 266,000 IDP households are targeted to receive assistance as part of the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, including rental subsidies, core relief items, emergency shelter and legal aid. USD 198.7 million and unimpeded access are required.

Multi-cluster humanitarian response to new displacement driven by the conflict in Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates is still ongoing. However, a lack of implementing partners on the ground and the authorities’ delay in releasing the necessary approvals have negatively affected the response.

In between January and March 2018, the Shelter/NFI/ CCCM cluster reached approx. 227,000 people as per the breakdown below.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Al Hudaydah: WFP reported that the estimated value of the assistance destroyed in the fire that occurred in its warehouse in Al Hudaydah city on 31 March amounts to US$5 million. The lost supplies were meant to contribute to the rations of at least 1.8 million beneficiaries for a month’s period. WFP is using reserves to partially cover the gap and prevent any disruption to the monthly distribution process. A new fire broke out on 16 April in a WFP mobile storage unit for non-food items in Al Hudaydah city, no significant damage was reported. At least two humanitarian organisations reached and responded in Al Khawkhah district during the reporting period. However, access to the eastern part of Hays district remains challenging due to continued shelling. In Al Hudaydah city, humanitarian partners have provided NFI, cash and hygiene assistance to some 1,500 families, including IDPs. In Hajjah governorate, 158 families among the most vulnerable in Abs district received cash assistance.

Aden: Queues have been witnessed at private fuel stations in the governorate, while government-run fuel stations are not functioning. Fuel is available in the unofficial market at a higher price. In nearby governorates, however, fuel is available with no change in price. Cut-off hours of electricity have increased during the reporting period to 6-8 hours a day, compared to two hours a day in the previous weeks. According to a displacement tracking exercise, 305 new IDP households were reported in Aden in the past week. Reportedly, 244 other new IDP families have been displaced in the districts of Khanfir, Lawdar and Zingibar in Abyan governorate and 61 in Tuban and Al Had districts in Lahj governorate. 299 suspected diphtheria cases were reported in the hub as of 8 April, including 141 cases in Al Dhale’e, 67 in Aden, 12 in Lahj, seven in Abyan and one case in Shabwah.

Sana’a: On 11 April, a WHO-chartered cargo plane delivered 19 tons of medical and therapeutic items to Sana’a International Airport. The items will be distributed across Yemen. The road from Sana’a to Sayun in Hadramaut governorate, mainly used by civilians planning to travel abroad through Sayun Airport, has been temporarily cut off due to ground clashes in Al Bayda governorate.

Humanitarian partners have also reported access constraints in Hamdan and Bani Matar districts (Sana’a governorate) and in Harib district (Marib governorate) by local authorities restricting their movement and ability to implement programmes.

Sa’ada: Airstrikes and ground fighting continued across the districts bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and along frontlines in Al Jawf governorate, resulting in several civilian casualties, including children. ACTED and DRC reported that airstrikes on 9 April hit targets within a short distance from their premises in Sa’ada city while 56 staff were working. Both premises are deconflicted.

Four water projects were completed in the districts of Bart Al Anan and Rajuzahin Al Jawf governorate. The intervention, which involved rehabilitating and protecting water sources and installing solar systems for generating power will serve 10,000 beneficiaries. Three additional water projects in the districts of As Safra and Sahar will benefit some 17,000 beneficiaries.

Ibb: Clashes continued along the frontlines in Taizz governorate, including in Salah, Dimnat Khadir and Hayfan districts. On 10 April, at least 15 people, including children, were reportedly killed when an airstrike hit their house in Dimnat Khadir district. Around 50 families have been displaced from As Silw district in Taizz governorate to Dimnat Khadir district in the same governorate and Dhi As Sufal district in Ibb governorate.

JEDDAH: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) on Sunday distributed 6,000 cartons of meat to 108,000 beneficiaries in a number of districts in Yemen’s Al-Jouf Governorate.

The aid comes within the framework of food assistance provided by KSRelief to the Yemeni people.

KSReleif has also stepped up its medical relief efforts in Yemen, with three new medical teams to provide treatment without discrimination.

During his visit to Saudi Arabia, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also commended the Kingdom’s leading and effective role in the region and around the world — and in particular the KSRelief.

He pointed out that the main objective of his visit to Saudi Arabia was to promote the bilateral partnership with KSRelief.

12,yemen,"Highlights

The 26 March 2018 saw the third anniversary of the Yemen conflict, which continues to heavily impact the lives of children. As fighting continued this month, 16 children were reportedly killed and 39 were injured.

UNICEF launched a report highlighting the negative effects of conflict on children's education. It also appealed to warring parties to put an end to the war and all grave violations against children.

An Integrated Response, Preparedness and Prevention Plan for Acute Watery Diarreah/Cholera is now in place, and thanks to UNICEF support, a total of 736 WASH Rapid Response Teams, with nationwide coverage, are now on stand-by to respond to a potential outbreak in the coming months.

This month, UNICEF supported a six-day diphtheria campaign in 39 high- risk districts where it. It reached over 1.9 million children, covering 75 per cent of the target.

UNICEF provided psychosocial support to at least 12,011 people in March, including 6,123 children, through community based and mobile child friendly spaces in 9 governorates.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Despite attempts by the new UN envoy, Martin Griffiths, to renew stagnated peace talks, fighting continued throughout March. Marking the third anniversary of the start of the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention in Yemen, the Houthis fired a set of ballistic missiles towards cities in Saudi Arabia, where at least one person was reportedly killed by shrapnel in Riyadh. In Sana'a, the most affected governorate by active fighting, airstrikes intensified in the city and ground clashes continued along the Nihm frontline northeast of the capital. Meanwhile in the Southern governorates and the city of Aden, violent crime and assassinations are on the increase, with several attacks carried-out by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) killing and injuring security forces and civilians.

Children continue to bear the heaviest toll of the conflict. 16 children were killed and 38 injured during March, bringing the cumulative totals for 2018 up to a 110 and 192 respectively.1 The conflict also continues to heavily impact children's right to an education. Many teachers' salaries remain unpaid (61 per cent) and over three years of conflict is now compromising the education of over 4.5 million children. Whilst no data available concerning the attendance of teachers, it is reported than in some school's teachers work only a few hours a day, and in others, parents are grouping together to collect fees for teachers.

The consequences of this has a varying impact across the country. The cumulative total of suspected cholera cases reported since April 2017 to 31 March 2018 is 1,085,305 with 2,270 associated deaths across the country.2 Children under 5 years old represent 28.8 per cent of total suspected cases, but the number of weekly new cases continues to decline for the 29th consecutive week. As of the end of the reporting month, the total number of reported probable diphtheria cases has now reached 1,522 (a 25 per cent increase from the previous month) with 85 deaths (a 10 per cent increase) and a case fatality rate of 5.5 per cent.",UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (March 2018) [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018-enar

14,yemen,"Conflict Background

Yemen has a weak, highly decentralized central government that has struggled to rule the northern Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the southern People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Since the unification of these entities in 1990, Yemen has experienced three civil conflicts. As the poorest country in the Arab world, Yemen faces serious food and water shortages for a population dispersed over mountainous terrain. The country’s weaknesses have been exploited by Saudi Arabia which shares a porous border with Yemen. Further, the instability of Yemen’s central government has created a power vacuum filled by foreign states and terrorist groups. The central government has never had effective control of all Yemeni territory.

Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was president of Yemen for 34 years, secured his power through playing factions within the population off one another. The Yemeni conflict is not solely a result of a Sunni-Shia conflict, although sectarianism plays a role. The 2011 Arab Spring re-energized the Houthi movement, a Zaydi Shia movement, which led to the overthrow of the Saleh government. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi took office as interim president in a transition led by a coalition of Arab Gulf states and backed by the United States. Hadi has struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including insurgency, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to former president Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.",A Conflict Overlooked: Yemen in Crisis,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/conflict-overlooked-yemen-crisis

RIYADH: Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir on Wednesday met with the new UN Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, in Riyadh.

During the meeting, they discussed the political and humanitarian situation in Yemen and Saudi Arabia’s support for the UN's efforts to alleviate the sufferings of the Yemeni people.

Saudi Arabia is at the forefront of international efforts to provide relief to the Yemenis. On March 28, Saudi Arabia and the UAE donated $930 million to the UN for humanitarian aid in Yemen.

War-ravaged Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the UN, with 75 percent of the population — 22 million people — in need of aid. A severe cholera outbreak has also killed more than 2,000 people and infected 1 million.

On Wednesday, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) distributed 9,000 packs of meat to 27,000 needy families in 11 camps set up for displaced people in Yemen’s Marib province. In addition, a specialized medical team of 25 doctors arrived in Marib to provide health services to all Yemenis.

There are some 2 million Yemenis working in the Kingdom who send more than $10 million remittances to their families in Yemen.

To boost the economy of Yemen, Saudi Arabia has also funded its central bank with $2 billion. According to a recent statement by Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al-Jabir, the Kingdom’s assistance to Yemen totaled about $10.96 billion.

The Kingdom’s total aid to developing countries since 1973 had reached $152 billion, he said.

Earlier, the UN envoy also expressed his aspiration to work with the Yemeni government and engage with all stakeholders without exception to achieve lasting peace in Yemen.",Saudi FM discusses Yemen’s humanitarian aid needs with new UN envoy,http://www.arabnews.com/node/1295596/saudi-arabia
16,yemen,"As the ‘forgotten war’ in Yemen enters its fourth year, the cost of human suffering is turning more and more enormous. Saudi Arabia and UAE's genocidal war against Yemen, assisted by the US and the UK, has taken a devastating toll, particularly on the most vulnerable members of society – the children. Most have been reduced to skin and bones, under conditions of life-threatening malnutrition.

Geert Cappealaere, the UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, recently returned from a field visit to Yemen. Her report has some very hard-hitting observations.

“I wanted to share with you the impact that three years of brutal war and decades of chronic underdevelopment are having on 11 million Yemeni boys and girls,” she observes in her report.

The ongoing crisis is one of the worst humanitarian crisis the world is currently seeing. According to her report, in 2017 alone, a minimum of five children were being killed or seriously injured every single day. The same year also saw outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and diphtheria, killing hundreds of children in its wake.

In 2015, because of Yemen’s underdevelopment, 200,000 children suffered from severe acute malnutrition – life-threatening malnutrition. With three years of war, this has doubled, making Yemen among the three countries with the highest number of acutely malnourished children in the world.

Geert writes that in the past two weeks, the international community, along with the local heroes, the health and humanitarian workers in Yemen, have managed to stem the cholera outbreak after many months. But in a few weeks, the rainy season will start and cholera will hit the children of Yemen once more.

“Three years of war, decades of underdevelopment have done more to children than the confrontation with death, life-threatening preventable diseases,” mentions the report.

Along with the health crisis, the children of Yemen are constantly under an educational crisis. Compared to three years ago, half a million more children are not able to go to school anymore. Close to two million Yemeni boys and girls are not attending school or never had a chance to. The reason being that 2,500 schools in the country have either been destroyed by the war, or are being used for military purposes, or for hosting displaced families.

There is also the other fact that 80 per cent of the population is suffering from severe poverty. And this is just a rough estimate. Thus a large number of parents are sending their children to beg on the streets instead of sending them to schools. They are marrying them off at an early age so that they have ‘one less mouth to feed in the family’.

“Sending your child to beg, sending your child to work, marry your girl at an early age, are not choices that any Yemeni father or mother want to make. It is not a choice, it is forced on them because of this brutal war,” Geert observes in the report.

During her trip, Geert visited a group of 12-13-year-old girls outside San’a, all of whom were livid with anger and frustration at the state of education in their country.

She says that one of the girls, showed her a textbook that was at least 30-40 years old and said, “We need to learn from this? How can we ever become the doctors, the teachers, the engineers that Yemen so badly needs if we need to learn from this?”

Is there a solution to all of this? Yes. And the first one is putting an end to this brutal war in Yemen. It’s a senseless war from a children’s perspective and no single boy or girl understands what this is all about. Second, there can be no negotiations with any party regarding access to safe drinking water or cholera vaccination.

“We are losing time, energy and money on conversations that should never happen. Access to humanitarian supplies, supplies that are needed to be delivered against the acute needs of the population cannot and shall not be negotiated,” notes Geert.

Investment in education is a must if the world does not want to deprive two million children of education. It needs to be prioritised and now.

Yemen was once called “Arabia Felix” – the happy Arabia - but not much of the happiness remains there today. It will only come back to Yemen, if the world agrees to invest in children, stop the brutal war and invest in education.",Saudi and UAE War on the Children of Yemen: A UNICEF Report,https://newsclick.in/saudi-and-uae-war-children-yemen-unicef-report
17,yemen,"Pentagon statement confirms visibility of Yemeni leadership that aggression is American [06/May/2018]







SANAA, May 6 (Saba) - ""The Pentagon's announcement of the presence of US forces directly involved in the coalition aggression against the Yemeni people confirms the clear vision of the Yemeni leadership from the first moment, which considered that the aggression against Yemen is an American aggression in the first place,"" said the spokesman of the armed forces, Brigadier General Sharaf Ghaleb Luqman on Saturday.



Every day, more details are revealed about the nature of the criminal roles of US-backed Saudi-led coalition aggression against Yemen on the level of direct targeting of the Yemeni people in the shelling, siege and on the level of intelligence, logistics and armament of the tools of aggression on Yemen from the labor systems, especially the Saudi regime and the UAE regime, said Brigadier Luqman in a statement combined by Saba.



The presence of US forces represents an additional motivation for the Yemeni people to redouble efforts to confront the forces of invasion and aggression, said Luqman.



The army and committees have full legal and constitutional right to use various means available to defend land, he also said.



The humiliating defeat of America's tools is what forced USA to intervene directly to lift the morale of its customers and those who failed to achieve any of the objectives of the aggression on Yemen.



USA continues to violate these laws and international conventions by interfering in the affairs of a sovereign state and the United Nations must stop and condemn any American escalation.

We are deeply shocked by the death of Hanna Lahoud, a member of the humanitarian community who gave his life delivering assistance to people in dire need of aid. Our deepest condolences go to Hanna’s family, friends and colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross.

“As a very close knit international community, we are all saddened by the death of our colleague, Hanna,“ said Shane Stevenson, Country Director of Oxfam in Yemen. “Our most sincere sympathies go to Hanna’s family and colleagues at ICRC. We are appalled by this brutal attack on a fellow humanitarian who gave his life working to help others in need. Aid workers need security and protection to deliver life-saving aid, and we remain committed to the cause for which Hanna gave his life.”

Humanitarian organisations in Yemen work in accordance with humanitarian principles of humanity, independence, neutrality and impartiality to deliver aid to populations affected by violent conflict. More than three quarters of Yemen’s population is in need of humanitarian assistance or protection that alleviates suffering and promotes dignity in the context of a war that is depriving many of the things they need to stay alive. An attack on humanitarian workers; UN, ICRC or non-government organisation – it is not only an attack on a humanitarian worker but also on the rights of people affected by conflict to receive assistance and protection.

INGOs in Yemen call on all parties to the conflict, authorities in Yemen and the international community to take concrete steps that guarantee the protection of humanitarian personnel and materials, as is provided for under International Humanitarian Law. We will not allow violence of this kind to deter our efforts to support highly vulnerable people in Yemen but need absolute assurance we can do so with safety.

20,yemen,"There is no indication that the American commandos have crossed into Yemen as part of the secretive mission.

But sending American ground forces to the border is a marked escalation of Western assistance to target Houthi fighters who are deep in Yemen.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the Armed Services Committee, on Thursday called the Green Berets mission a “purposeful blurring of lines between train and equip missions and combat.” He cited the report in The Times and called for a new congressional vote on the authorization for the use of military force — a war powers legislation used by three successive presidents in conflict zones around the world.

Beyond its years as a base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen has been convulsed by civil strife since 2014, when the Shiite Muslim rebels from the country’s north stormed the capital, Sana. The Houthis, who are aligned with Iran, ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans’ main counterterrorism partner in Yemen.

In 2015, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began bombing the Houthis, who have responded by firing missiles into the kingdom. Yet there is no evidence that the Houthis directly threaten the United States; they are an unsophisticated militant group with no operations outside Yemen and have not been classified by the American government as a terrorist group.

The Green Berets, the Army’s Special Forces, deployed to the border in December, weeks after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen sailed close to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The Saudi military said it intercepted the missile over the city’s international airport — a claim that was cast in doubt by an analysis of photos and videos of the strike. But it was enough for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to renew a longstanding request that the United States send troops to help the kingdom combat the Houthi threat.

A half-dozen officials — from the United States military, the Trump administration, and European and Arab nations — said the American commandos are training Saudi ground troops to secure their border. They also are working closely with American intelligence analysts in Najran, a city in southern Saudi Arabia that has been repeatedly attacked with rockets, to help locate Houthi missile sites within Yemen.

Along the porous border, the Americans are working with surveillance planes that can gather electronic signals to track the Houthi weapons and their launch sites, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the mission publicly.

During a meeting on Capitol Hill in March, senators pressed Pentagon officials about the military’s role in the Saudi-led conflict, demanding to know whether American troops were at risk of entering into hostilities against the Houthis.

Pentagon officials told the senators what had already been said publicly: that American forces stationed in Saudi Arabia only advised within the kingdom’s borders and were focused mostly on border defense.

“We are authorized to help the Saudis defend their border,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of United States Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 13. “We are doing that through intelligence sharing, through logistics support and through military advice that we provide to them.”

On April 17, Robert S. Karem, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States had about 50 military personnel in Saudi Arabia, “largely helping on the ballistic missile threat.”

The Green Berets have stepped in to deal with an increasingly difficult problem for the Saudi military. Their presence is the latest example of the expanding relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia under President Trump and Prince Mohammed.

Mr. Trump’s first overseas trip after taking office was to Riyadh, nearly one year ago. By contrast, President Barack Obama regularly criticized Saudi Arabia for civilian casualties inflicted by its bombing campaign in Yemen, and blocked arms sales to the kingdom.

In March, as Prince Mohammed met with Mr. Trump and top national security officials in Washington, the State Department approved the sale of an estimated $670 million in anti-tank missiles in an arms package that also included spare parts for American-made tanks and helicopters that Saudi Arabia previously purchased.

“Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they’re going to give the United States some of that wealth hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump said at the time.

He called Prince Mohammed “more than the crown prince now” and displayed a poster featuring military aircraft worth $12.5 billion that the United States had agreed to sell to Saudi Arabia.

The American military’s support for the Saudi campaign against the Houthis is different from the Pentagon’s campaign against other militants in Yemen.

Over the past two years, American-backed government troops from Yemen and the United Arab Emirates have expanded a shadowy war in Yemen’s central and southern regions. The effort has targeted more than 3,000 members of the Qaeda affiliate and its tribal confederates, driving them into the rugged, mountainous interior.

Last year, as part of Mr. Trump’s intensified campaign against terrorist organizations, the United States launched more than 130 airstrikes in Yemen, according to United States Central Command. Most of the strikes targeted Qaeda militants; 10 were launched against Islamic State fighters.

By comparison, the American military launched 38 strikes in Yemen in 2016; airstrikes have continued this year.

Officials said American support for the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, a campaign that includes the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt, was initially outlined in a 2015 document known as the Rice memo, named after Susan E. Rice, who was then Mr. Obama’s national security adviser.

The memo detailed military assistance and was intended to keep the United States out of offensive operations against the Houthis, focusing instead on helping the Saudis secure their border.

Under the Trump administration, the scope of those guidelines appears to have grown — as evidenced by the addition of American surveillance planes and the Green Beret team.

The Saudi air campaign in 2015 initially was aimed at stockpiles of older Soviet ballistic missiles that were first used in Yemen’s 1994 civil war. The Saudi military reckoned those weapons could fall into Houthi hands.

In April 2015, after a month of strikes, the Saudi-led coalition said it had accomplished its goals of destroying the missiles and the equipment used to launch them. But that June, Houthi rebels launched their first salvo of ballistic missiles, aimed at Khamis Mushayt, a Saudi city roughly 60 miles from the Yemen border.

Since then, Houthis have launched dozens of missiles, including shorter-range modified antiaircraft missiles and imported Iranian munitions. The White House and State Department have seized on the attacks to condemn not only the rebels but their Iranian supporters, underscoring the administration’s increasing hard line against Tehran.

“Iran destabilizes this entire region,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to Riyadh on Sunday. “It supports proxy militias and terrorist groups. It is an arms dealer to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.”

Since 2015, Mr. Karem said, Houthi rebels have launched more than 100 ballistic missiles and many more rockets against major population centers, international airports, military installations and oil infrastructure — all within Saudi Arabia.

In the first four months of this year, the Houthis launched more than 30 missiles — roughly on par with the number fired in all of 2017, according to data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Saudi forces trying to counter weapons from Yemen’s west coast — like the Houthi-held port in Al Hudaydah, where officials in Riyadh believe components of the missiles are shipped — have only two viable options, said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

The first is to find the missiles where they are stored, which requires an extensive amount of intelligence, Mr. Knights said. The second is far harder: to attack the launch sites, he said.

“They have a very difficult problem,” Mr. Knights said.

Houthi rebels could hide mobile missile launchers anywhere from inside culverts to beneath highway overpasses. They are easily moved for hasty launches.

Dealing with that problem requires a well-orchestrated system by the Saudi-led coalition, extending from satellites to troops on the ground, to ensure aircraft can find and quickly destroy the missile launchers.

“In a mobile-missile environment, that’s a challenge,” Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, said in an interview.",Army Special Forces Secretly Help Saudis Combat Threat From Yemen Rebels,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/politics/green-berets-saudi-yemen-border-houthi.html
21,yemen,"Yemen’s government-in-exile slammed the United Arab Emirates’ takeover of Socotra, a remote Yemeni island in the Arabian Sea sometimes described as the “ most alien-looking place on Earth.”

The U.A.E. military’s seizure of the seaport and airport on Socotra is an “unjustified” assault on Yemen’s sovereignty, its exiled government said in a statement from Prime Minister Ahmed Bin Dagr’s office. It was a rare criticism of its partner in the fight against Houthi rebels who control large swaths of the country.

The takeover “reflects the disagreement between the legitimate government and our brothers in the U.A.E., and at its core is a dispute over national sovereignty and who has the right to practice it,” the statement said.

The Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates denied the accusation in a statement posted on the official news agency WAM late Sunday.

“The U.A.E plays a parallel role in the Yemeni island of Socotra to maintain security and stability, support development projects, and help the people of the island,” the ministry said. It added that its military presence “comes within the efforts of the Arab Coalition to support the legitimacy at this critical stage in the history of Yemen.”

Tanks Rolling

The U.A.E. deployed more than 50 soldiers, tanks and other military equipment to the island on April 30 and expelled personnel at the seaport and airport, the Yemeni government said. The takeover ratcheted up tensions between the U.A.E. and Yemen’s government-in-exile, which is based in Saudi Arabia. The U.A.E. supports southern separatists in Yemen who engaged in deadly clashes this year with government forces.

Yemen previously had refrained from criticizing the U.A.E. in deference to its participation in the Saudi-led military campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels more than three years ago.

The U.A.E.’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash also defended his country’s action on Twitter, pointing to “family and historic relations” with Socotra and its people.

The Yemeni government said military coordination with the U.A.E. has been “absent” and asked Saudi Arabia to intervene with the U.A.E. to help rectify the situation in Socotra.

The Socotra archipelago of four islands and two islets was listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) in 2008 as a world heritage site because of its rich and distinct flora and fauna, much of which can’t be found anywhere else on the planet.

22,yemen,"Years ago, when Bushra Aldukhainah was a young woman, she loved to spend time with her family in al-Hudaydah, a western coastal city and the location of Yemen’s key Hudaydah port. She remembers walking across the boardwalk area, staring into the blue water as schools of fish swam by and massive boats pushed through the tide.

Now, on most days, Hudaydah port is eerily quiet, as Saudi-led coalition airstrikes bombard the country and an on-again, off-again air and sea blockade cuts off humanitarian aid from its residents, also making travel to and from Yemen difficult.

The Yemen that Aldukhainah once knew is undergoing what United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.

Seventy-five percent of Yemenis in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance as the country enters its fourth year of war.

Yemen has been in a state of war since 2014, after the Houthis,are a militant group operating within Yemen, began in the capital Sanaa, urging Hadi to step down and for the reinstatement of fuel subsidies and a more representative government. Eventually, the Houthis, allied with former president Ali Abdallah Saleh, took over the capital and ousted U.S.-backed President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. In 2015, a Saudi-led coalition began a military campaign to stop their advances. The Houthis responded to the airstrikes by firing their missiles into Saudi Arabia.

The situation in Yemen has morphed over the past few years, said Amanda Catanzono, the senior director for international programs policy and advocacy at the International Rescue Committee. “Yemen was a humanitarian crisis before the conflict … but before the spring of 2015 there was more of a national capacity to respond to emergency needs,” she said. Now, there’s virtually none.

She said it has been difficult to maintain attention on the situation in Yemen. “Distance and complexity are the enemies of action, the enemies of maintaining people’s attention,” she said.

Seventy-five percent of Yemenis in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance as the country enters its fourth year of war. Seventeen million people are food insecure – up a million from last year – and more than 8 million people do not know where their next meal will come from.

Aldukhainah, who works as an area manager for CARE, coordinating humanitarian aid at 10 sites across northern Yemen, said the violence and airstrikes make giving humanitarian aid to those in need extremely difficult.

“I don’t think there’s a safe place in Yemen anymore. Airstrikes are everywhere,” she said, recalling the horror on her coworkers’ faces after a recent return from a field site where they saw dead bodies lined up along the street.

As a third wave of a cholera is set to hit Yemen this month and with the country’s infrastructure devastated, some Yemenis hope a peace plan negotiated by the United Nations will start to turn their country around.

Before the war

Aldukhainah was born in Hara, Yemen, about three hours from the capital of Sanaa, in the mid-1980s. The eldest of 10 siblings with a thirst for education, Aldukhainah completed two master’s degrees — one in India and one in the United Kingdom.

“We have very smart girls in Yemen who love education. I was one of them,” Aldukhainah said.

She had dreams for an education and a successful job. She started at CARE working on the development team, but in 2013, had to put all of her focus on emergency and life-saving operations.

“The first thing my son did was look at me and say, ‘You should have let me take my toys.'”

On April 27, 2015, Aldukhainah woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of bombs. Just the day before, an airstrike targeted an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Hara where Aldukhainah was distributing aid with other CARE humanitarian workers. A month before, in March 2015, another airstrike hit anIDP camp in north Yemen, killing at least 40 people.

“I’ve seen the dead bodies of children and men and women who I knew in [the IDP camp] with my own eyes,” she said. More than 2 million people are internally displaced in Yemen.

“The IDP camps in this war were the first to be targeted, so now people are afraid to even gather in camps and have instead pitched tents in isolated areas,” Aldukhainah said.

After notifying her staff to leave immediately, Aldukhainah fled Hara in Ma’rib governorate for Hajjah city in Hajjah governorate, a congested mountainous city three hours northeast.

Right before they fled, Aldukhainah remembers her son asking her if he could take his toys with him.

“I told him we would come back for them — in a matter of two weeks, a month … I remember the bitterness of leaving home and leaving everything behind us, of being displaced,” she said.

Two months later, Aldukhainah’s house in Yemen was completely destroyed in an airstrike.

“The first thing my son did was look at me and say, ‘You should have let me take my toys,’” she said.

Two months after airstrikes began targeting Hara, bombs also began dropping on Hajjah city. But she stayed to oversee the city, along with nearby Hodaydah and Ma’rib, for CARE.

Aldukhainah’s cousin along with her cousin’s son died in the airstrike. That son was her own son’s best friend, and Aldukhainah says he hasn’t been the same since.

Humanitarian crisis

Yemen was already the poorest country on the Arabian peninsula before the war, with 44 percent of its population undernourished and 5 million people in need of emergency aid. Before the violence, Yemen imported nearly 90 percent of its food staples, and almost all of its fuel and medicine.

Seaports in Yemen were blockaded by Saudi Arabia through part of 2017, but are now open to humanitarian aid and commercial shipments.

Civilians are at greatest risk of violence in Yemen, facing indiscriminate attacks, snipers, cross-fire, kidnapping and arbitrary detention, bombing and rape. In February alone, 53 children were killed and 92 were maimed in 12 governorates in Yemen, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The destruction of basic infrastructure systems as a result of the airstrikes exacerbates the spread of cholera and other disease. Today, a child dies every 10 minutes in Yemen of preventable causes, according to the U.N.

More than half of all health facilities in the country are either closed completely or partially functioning, and most hospital staff are volunteers, not receiving consistent salary payments for more than eight months. And more than 2,500 schools have been damaged and one-quarter of school-aged children are not in school.

“What would you do if you were in this situation. Would you accept it?”

“How many parents have the fear of sending their kids to school. Fear of not knowing if they will come home or not … Just look at this from parent’s perspective, look at how many mothers and fathers must bury their own children in Yemen,” Aldukhainah said.

“What would you do if you were in this situation. Would you accept it?” she said.

There are more than 1 million suspected cholera cases in Yemen. Cholera is a diarrhoeal infection caused by eating contaminated food or water, and is easily preventable with access to clean water but can kill within hours if left untreated. Fourteen and a half million people in Yemen lack access to clean water and safe sanitation services.

“When I was a kid I remembered reading about how cholera impacted people in the past,” Aldukainah said. “But to see it happening right in front of our eyes in Yemen is unbelievable.”

What’s happening now?

Martin Griffiths, the United Nations’ Yemen mediator said last month that he plans to present a new framework for negotiations to end the conflict within the next two months. U.N.-sponsored talks that began in April 2016 collapsed five months later, after another earlier set of negotiations to halt the conflict ended in December 2015 with no resolution.

Catanzano said the existing framework for negotiations, which operates on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2216, is inadequate and outdated because it does not have a binding resolution that addresses the humanitarian situation and does not reflect the violations committed by all sides.

“It’s less about if we’ll get there and more about how quickly we need to get there given the humanitarian situation … we can’t move toward a negotiation with the airstrikes intensifying,” she said, adding that a ceasefire should be the first order of business.

Aldukhainah, for her part, said, “A diplomatic solution is the only way to bring peace to Yemen, to bring everybody to the table and agree to stop killing innocent people.”

Aldukhainah now lives in Hajjah city with her husband and son, who is now 12. It’s been years since she has been able to travel safely throughout the country, but she says she still remembers passing through lush green valleys and flowing rivers when visiting family.

A month ago, Aldukhainah was with her son in Sanaa, right before she was set to board a flight for the U.S.

“He looked at me and said, ‘Mommy, go and save Yemen.’”

At the end of the day, Aldukhainah said, “Yemenis just want to live a normal life with some dignity.”",‘I don’t think there’s a safe place in Yemen anymore’,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/i-dont-think-theres-a-safe-place-in-yemen-anymore
23,yemen,"AMMAN, Jordan — Catholic and other faith-based aid groups are urging an end to fighting in Yemen, where three years of war have created a humanitarian crisis, including “the world’s largest food security emergency,” according to the United Nations.

Children are bearing the brunt of Yemen’s conflict, the U.N. warned, with 80 percent of them in desperate need of aid and 2 million suffering from acute malnutrition.

“We were shocked about the numbers coming out of Yemen on famine and starvation, especially of children under the age of 5,” said Giovanna Reda of the British Catholic aid agency CAFOD, a member of the Caritas network.

Reda expressed concern that if the conflict continues to spiral, it will unfold into a “protracted humanitarian crisis.”

“We are calling for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution to the war,” she said of all parties involved. “People should not be allowed to die because they no longer have food.”

Reda told Catholic News Service that the critical situation prompted her London-based agency to get involved in the impoverished country found at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The civil war there — pitting government troops and Houthi rebels, proxies of Saudi Arabia and Iran — is having a decimating impact, she said.

More than 5,000 children have been killed or injured — an average of five children every day — since the conflict began in March 2015, reported the U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF.

“Even after the conflict ends, the effects of malnutrition, such as stunted growth and delayed cognitive development, may linger,” it said. “In the worst cases, it is fatal.”

“CAFOD and its partners are running programs tackling nutrition and food security for Yemeni communities and local health care centers dealing with malnutrition cases, reaching some 30,000 people,” Reda explained.

“These people are mainly children under 5 as well as pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. This food assistance is helping families most affected by malnutrition, whether it be severe, acute, or moderate acute. From a health point of view, the situation is dangerous,” Reda said of one part of a larger crisis.

A cholera outbreak affected 1 million Yemenis some months ago, while diphtheria has emerged recently.

Aid officials estimate that about 80 percent of Yemen’s 22 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and medical care. The country’s infrastructure has been destroyed and its health services crippled, largely due to bombing. A partial blockade of badly needed medical and other supplies has also been in place.

The Saudi-led coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. The U.N. reported that more than 5,970 civilians have been killed and 9,490 injured so far, with no end in sight to the conflict.

Even before the outbreak of war, Yemen faced tremendous challenges from widespread poverty, food insecurity and a lack of health services.

Reda explained that CAFOD, which is also a member of the Disaster Emergency Committee, a network of 13 British-based agencies, works with partners in Yemen, mainly in the south of the country. However, the nongovernmental agency it cooperates with cannot be named due to security concerns.

Islamic State militants abducted Indian Salesian Father Tom Uzhunnalil March 4, 2016, from a home for the aged and disabled run by the Missionaries of Charity in the southern city of Aden and held him for 18 months until his release. Four Missionaries of Charity and 12 others were murdered in the attack.

Islamic State and al-Qaida are active in parts of Yemen, also hindering humanitarian access to various areas, Reda added.

Meanwhile, an official of World Relief Germany who works in Yemen said the Christian organization has set up an “emergency response network of 2,000 first aid-trained volunteers in 20 out of Yemen’s 22 governorates on both sides of the conflict, to be able to provide basic medical care to Yemenis in their towns as well as to bring them to hospitals which still function.”

He told CNS that the agency based in Amman, Jordan, also took medical supplies into the country, including oral rehydration, for Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health to fight the cholera outbreak.

“We had zero experience airlifting supplies into Yemen, but we knew we were in a strategic place to do so,” said the employee, who asked that his name not be used. “Within six months, we imported 21 metric tons of needed materials with the support of donors in the U.S. and Europe in 2017.”

Assisting Yemen for the past 20 years, World Relief Germany has worked with local partners to provide clean drinking water to internally displaced people and door-to-door hygiene training, best to tackle cholera. Water, sanitation, hygiene and education, especially for children with disabilities, are key aid.

“It’s heartbreaking to see where the level of poverty has gone. Homeless families are now living in rooms in mosques. Houses are full of multiple families living together with the elderly, children, and the disabled,” said the employee, who lived and studied Arabic in Yemen prior to the conflict. “They are reliant on donations for the medicines they need.”

He personally set up a food basket providing several months of staple goods to help those in very vulnerable situations.

“God has created each person on this earth with purpose, dignity and worth. Whenever he sees people suffering, his heart is broken,” he said. “But he has also given people, like myself, resources and abilities, and I need to steward them in such a way that actually supports those in need, whether it is in my own neighborhood or halfway across the world.”",Update: Faith-based groups say fighting created humanitarian crisis in Yemen,https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/04/29/update-faith-based-groups-say-fighting-created-humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen/
