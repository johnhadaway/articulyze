A ST ANDREWS UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC and former Catalan minister will hand herself into Police Scotland today after Spanish judges issued a European Arrest Warrant, prompting fresh concern for democracy in the region and calls for EU sanctions on Spain.

A former education minister in the Catalan Government, the St Andrews academic Clara Ponsati will be arrested pending extradition to Spain where she would face charges of sedition, rebellion and other crimes relating to her role campaigning for Catalonian independence from Spain.



Around 25 Catalonian independence supporters have been charged, including the country's former leader Carles Puigdemont who will appear in a German court later today (Monday 26).

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish Government has ""no power"" to stop the arrest, but maintained that the Scottish Government's views of the country's rights to self-determination remained unchanged.

Speaking to CommonSpace, Chris McEleny, a candidate for the SNP deputy leadership said Scotland should ""not be afraid of our future relationship with the EU,"" adding: ""We must let the Spanish Government know we will not allow political prisoners on our watch.""

McEleny said: ""It’s the policy of the European Union to intervene when necessary to prevent conflict or to respond to emerging or actual crises. What we have in Catalonia and Spain is clearly a democratic crisis.

""A fundamental and overarching objective of the EU is to defend democratic principles and human rights.

""To defend democracy it is time for the European Commission to enact sanctions against Spain."" Chris McEleny, SNP deputy leadership candidate

""Locking up elected leaders for promoting democracy is a clear violation of the founding principles of the EU.""

The councillor, running to replace the party's former leader Angus Robertson against frontrunner Keith Brown MSP and party-worker Julie Hepburn, also said the European Commission should consider sanctions against Spain: ""To defend democracy, and to ensure the people of Catalonia have their internationally recognised right to self-determination, it is time for the European Commission to enact sanctions against Spain.""

Clara Ponsati will be represented by top human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, who has indicated that they will seek to overturn the arrest warrant of human rights grounds, arguing that the arrest amounts to political persecution.

1,spain,"Whilst the UN condemns Saudi Arabia for committing human rights violations in Yemen, the UK, France and Spain supply them with the means of doing so.

In the first week of February alone, 27 Yemenis were killed and 76 injured in the ongoing conflict which has torn apart the region since 2015, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (ONHCR).

On one side is the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who aim to overthrow the government of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The other side, led by Saudi Arabia, is conducting an air campaign to restore Hadi's authority.

The number of civilian casualties reported that week was more than double that of the week prior. Roughly half of these casualties were attributed to the Houthi forces, the other half to the Saudi-led coalition.

Since the Yemen conflict began in 2015, the UK has approved exports of licences to Saudi Arabia worth over £3.7bn (€4.2bn), according to Amnesty International.

In 2016, France sold over €1bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, with Spain and Italy exporting over €100m worth each, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).

During this time, the coalition has bombed schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. The Yemen Data Project has calculated that nearly a third of more than 15,000 air raids in Yemen have targeted non-military sites.

The CAAT says EU member states have continued to support the Saudi air campaign in Yemen by providing arms despite the overwhelming evidence of repeated breaches of humanitarian law.

""From our perspective, we would strongly argue that theys are in breach of the arms trade treaty,"" says Patrick Wilcken, researcher on arms control, security, trade and human rights for Amnesty International UK.

The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is an international treaty that implements standards governing arms transfers.

The UK, Spain, France and Italy have all signed and ratified the treaty. Article 7 of the ATT holds that state parties must complete a risk assessment regarding the likelihood of human rights violations when exporting arms, refusing to export if there is a perceived risk.

""They were one of the early champions of creating the treaty,"" says Wilcken about the UK. ""But most of the civilian casualties come from air strikes, and the main component of UK equipment has been combat aircrafts and related ammunitions.""

Matt Clancy, humanitarian policy spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent says, ""We are concerned about the gap between the duty to ensure respect for international humanitarian law in arms transfers and the actual transfer practices of too many states.""

Earlier in March, the UK drafted a UN resolution - backed by the US and France - condemning Iran for violating an arms embargo in Yemen, by supplying the Houthi rebels with weapons.

The UN Security Council pushed this resolution due to Iran's violation of arms embargoes and their failure to prevent the transfer of banned arms to Houthi rebels, which have been used to target Yemen's neighbours.

""It is a bit rich that they are on one hand arguing that there must be placed an embargo on Iran, but that the Saudi coalition is a far more powerful and modern war machine that is wreaking much more damage,"" says Wilcken from Amnesty International.

Brexit arms trade?

The British former defence secretary Michael Fallon announced that after leaving the EU, Britain will ""spread its wings across the world"" with increased arms and equipment exports.

In this speech he did not directly refer to the crisis in Yemen and the accusation against Saudi Arabia of targeting civilians in their bombing campaign, but rather other global threats such as North Korea and terrorism.

Under the 2008 common position on EU code of conduct on arms exports, member states must not export military equipment or technology that may contribute to regional instability.

Where serious human rights violations have been established by the UN or the EU, special caution in issuing arms licences must be taken.

Saudi Arabia has committed numerous violations of International Humanitarian Law, according to Human Rights Watch World Report 2018.

The UN have said that this year there are 3.4 million more Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance than last year, and a total of 22.2 million.

Since the conflict began in 2015 there have been tens of thousands of civilian casualties.

""I think it would make a huge difference if the UK and other European states were to cease their arms exports to Saudi Arabia,"" says Wilcken.

A Spanish aid group accused Italian authorities of putting humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean at risk on Monday, after its migrant rescue boat was impounded on suspicion it was aiding illegal immigration.

The Proactiva Open Arms group, which has saved more than 5,000 migrants since the start of 2017, had its boat impounded at the port of Pozzallo in Sicily, where it arrived on Saturday with more than 200 people rescued off the coast of Libya.



The group had refused to hand the migrants over to the Libyan coastguard, despite warnings from Rome and what the NGO claimed were death threats from the Libyans. The prosecutor's office of Catania in eastern Sicily has opened an investigation into Proactiva Open Arms and three of its leaders for criminal conspiracy to promote illegal immigration.

""Today it seems that solidarity has become a crime,"" said Open Arms co-founder Oscar Camps at a press conference in Barcelona. ""What is being done is the blocking of intervention of humanitarian organizations at sea. There are fewer and fewer NGOs doing this work and the objective is that there are none any left,"" he said.



""Finally an Italian prosecutor's office is blocking human trafficking!"" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, which leads the rightwing coalition that won the largest percentage of the vote in Italy's March 4th general election.

One in every 17 migrants dead

On Thursday, the Open Arms ship went to the aid of two boats that were in difficulty 73 nautical miles (135 nautical kilometres) off the Libyan coast, after being alerted by the Italian coastguard. But Italian authorities then informed the NGO's ship that the Libyan coastguard was in charge.



A Libyan coastguard speedboat arrived at the scene after an hour, but the NGO refused to transfer the migrants despite the threats it claims to have received. The ship was allowed to dock in Pozzallo on Saturday by the authorities because of the ""frail condition of the migrants on board"".

Following controversial agreements made by Rome with Libyan authorities and militias, migrant landings have dropped by more than 60 percent since the summer of 2017.



So far this year Italy has recorded 6,100 arrivals. In that time at least 358 migrants have died or are missing off the coast of Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).



That means one migrant dead for every 17 that arrive in Italy, significantly up from the rate of one for every 33 over the same period last year.

Fewer rescue ships

Last year around a dozen NGO ships patrolled the coast off Libya, and according to the Italian coastguard they carried out 46 percent of all migrant rescue operations. Now there are only two such ships, with others suspending their operations following the drop in departures from Libya last summer, as well as threats from Libya and the seizure of boats.



Catania's public prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro made a series of statements last year against NGOs operating in the Mediterranean, saying he had evidence some had been in contact with people traffickers.

This time Zuccaro's office was more circumspect, telling Italian media that Proactiva Open Arms was acting with the sole purpose of landing the migrants in Italy, refusing any alternative.



The condition of migrants in Libya has been heavily criticized by humanitarian organizations.



A 22-year-old Eritrean, rescued alongside other skeletal migrants by the Open Arms ship last week after spending 18 months in detention in Libya, died from severe malnutrition just hours after landing in Sicily.



Last summer Italian authorities seized the Iuventa ship run by the German group Jugend Rettet. Italian courts have so far backed that seizure, with a new hearing scheduled for April 23rd in Rome.



Proactiva Open Arms will find out about the fate of its ship by Tuesday, by which time judge from nearby Ragusa will confirm the seizure or allow it to leave Pozzallo.

When Carles Puigdemont was arrested near the German border last weekend, Spanish secret service agents who had tracked the country’s most wanted man across Europe issued a coded message: “The mop is in the bucket.”

The phrase was a reference to the Catalan leader’s floppy haircut. It had taken the full might of the Spanish state five months to catch the man who, in October, secured an illegal vote for Catalan independence. That vote triggered the biggest constitutional crisis in Spain since a failed coup in 1981.

CHG ANALYSIS

1. Brazil -- The five-time World Cup champs stay in first after crushing Russia and earning a feel-good 1-0 win over Germany.

2. France

--

The French stay where they are despite the loss to Colombia, which came after they had a 2-0 lead and made some changes. Paul Pogba shined against Russia and Kylian Mbappe is on fire. All good signs.

3. Spain +1 A good draw vs. Germany and an amazing 6-1 thrashing of Argentina has La Roja flying high as we near the summer. And Isco has made himself a sure starter.



4. Germany -1 They lose a little momentum after the Brazil defeat, but hard to take much from it with Mario Gomez up top. This team will go with Timo Werner, who didn't play on Tuesday.



5. Uruguay +1 They won the China Cup by beating Czech Republic and Wales, scoring three goals and allowing zero. Goals came from Edinson Cavani (2) and Luis Suarez, and that all sounds about right.



6. Belgium +2 Belgium crushed Saudi Arabia 4-0 and avoided any injuries. On paper, a contender to win the World Cup. Just need to build momentum.



7. Argentina -2 The 6-1 loss to Spain, without Lionel Messi, raises big-time concerns. It really doesn't feel like this team has enough to win.



8. Portugal -1 Losing 3-0 to a rough Netherlands isn't a good sign. But Cristiano Ronaldo did score two vs. Egypt. Maybe they should try playing young central defenders?



9. England -- Beat the Netherlands and drew Italy, both without Harry Kane. Hard to read into this team much without its most important player, so they stay where they started.



10. Colombia -- Were set to move up after that fine 3-2 win at France, but they were poor early and only won on a penalty kick. And then they drew 0-0 vs. Australia. Still a dark horse for a deep cup run.



11. Croatia +1 Couldn't take care of Peru but did get a nice 1-0 win over Mexico without its best players. Most importantly, no key injuries.



12. Mexico -1 Appear to have lost Nestor Araujo and Carlos Salcedo for a while due to injury, and that will hurt their chances in Russia if they can't make it. Not a good international window.

13. Switzerland +2 Defensive concerns were eased with two clean sheets, and a 6-0 win over fellow World Cup participant Panama builds momentum.



14. Peru +3 Ricardo Gareca has his team believing. Wins over Croatia and Iceland in the United States are good signs, and once they have Paulo Guerrero back, watch out.



15. Russia

-2 Lost to Brazil and France, as expected. Showed fight against France by coming back within a goal. There is some talent there, but this team is too inconsistent.



16. Poland -2 Didn't look sharp in the loss to Nigeria and then let South Korea back into a 2-0 match as the Asian nation drew level before Poland got a late winner. More stability in the middle of the pitch is needed.

17. Denmark -1 Just friendlies, I get that. But one goal in 180 minutes against Panama and Chile is a concern. Who else can create for this team besides Christian Eriksen?



18. Costa Rica -- Here come a bunch of team who surprisingly lost to inferior teams. Beat Scotland, lost to Tunisia. Didn't create enough in final third.



19. Sweden -- Lost to Chile, which is fine, but then fell 1-0 against Romania. Can we call Zlatan Ibrahimovic, please?



20. Nigeria -- The Super Eagles follow up a nice 1-0 win over Poland by losing 2-0 to Serbia. Odion Ighalo has to be the striker ahead of Ahmed Musa.



21. Japan -- Drew Mali and lost to Ukraine, but a lot of young, new guys were called into the team. The mix of young guys and players past their prime is a concern.

22. South Korea -- The loss to Northern Ireland wasn't pretty, but this team showed fight in coming back against Poland before losing. This team will go as Son Heung-min goes.



23. Serbia +1 Concerning to lose to Morocco, but getting two goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic in a win over Nigeria was big. I'm concerned that this team's old defenders will cost them.



24. Iceland -1 Lost to Mexico 3-0 and Peru 3-1. Not good results, but both great tests against more talented teams that will only make this team better.

25. Morocco +4 A nice window with wins over Serbia and Uzbekistan with just one goal allowed in 180 minutes.

26. Egypt -1 No shame in losing to Portugal, because they had it one before Cristiano Ronaldo went nuts in extra time. But losing 1-0 to a weak Greece team doesn't help this team with confidence.

27. Senegal -1 El Hadji Diouf ain't walking through that door. A 1-1 draw with Uzbekistan and a 0-0 draw against Bosnia raise concerns about the attack. Having Kalidou Koulibaly in defense is a blessing for this team, but it needs more than Sadio Mane in the final third.



28. Australia -1 Not much to like about this team's attack, but the fact that they held Colombia without a goal after allowing Norway to score four is an encouraging sign for the defense.



29. Panama -1 Starting to feel like Panama's first World Cup could be a nightmare. Losing 6-0 to a Switzerland team that is inconsistent in attack is alarming. How's that going to go against England and Belgium this summer?

30. Saudi Arabia -- Not shocked to see them get killed by Belgium, but playing toe-to-toe with Ukraine bodes well for this team when it goes up against a physical Russia in the World Cup opener.



31. Tunisia +1 Can't take too much from the 1-0 win over Iran, but beating a talented Costa Rica team is a really good sign.

5,spain,"A European arrest warrant issued for five former Catalan ministers is stirring nationalist feelings around the continent but looks unlikely to change the EU’s settled view of the separatists’ standoff with the Spanish government.

The arrest of the former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont in Germany on Sunday, and the decision by his former education minister, Clara Ponsatí, to turn herself in to Scottish police on Wednesday, may be diplomatically delicate.

But despite protests from German leftwingers and Scottish, Spanish and Belgian nationalists, Europe’s leaders show little sign of budging from their position that Catalonia’s independence drive must remain strictly a matter for Madrid.

The Spanish case against Puigdemont and other members of his former government who fled abroad – besides Ponsatí in Scotland, three are currently in Belgium and two in Switzerland – is therefore a judicial, not a political, question, they believe.

“Spain is a democracy, where the rule of law exists,” Angela Merkel’s spokesman said after Puigdemont was detained near the Danish border on his way from Finland to Brussels, where he had been in self-imposed exile since late October.

Others are not so sure. Germany’s far-left Die Linke party called Puigdemont’s arrest a disgrace, arguing – in the words of the its European affairs spokesman, Andrej Hunko, that the criminal case “is clearly politically motivated”.

In Scotland, the SNP MP Angus MacNeil said the Scottish police should not be “doing the political work of the fascists” in the Spanish government, while in Spain, the Basque nationalist MP Izaskun Bilbao demanded urgent EU action on Spain’s “territorial problems”.

Mark Demesmaeker, an MEP from the New Flemish Alliance, which seeks the secession of Flanders from Belgium, said Madrid was “escalating the repression. Democracy is in crisis, dialogue has been denied. The EU must open its eyes and facilitate political dialogue.”

The SNP’s parliamentary leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, wrote to the Spanish ambassador to London to say his country’s pursuit of the separatist politicians “goes against the principle of democracy and of respect for human rights, and risks people’s basic civil liberties”.



The former Catalan leaders – who argue Spain is authoritarian, the case against them is political and that as elected politicians they had a democratic mandate to push for regional independence – are wanted on charges ranging from rebellion to misuse of public funds for organising last October’s independence referendum, which Spain’s top court ruled was unconstitutional.

The charge of rebellion, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, is questioned by some Spanish legal experts since it requires evidence of a “violent uprising” and could be hard to prove in court. Few European countries have a direct equivalent for it, which may also prove an obstacle to extradition.

The EU, already dealing with Brexit, the fallout from Italy’s elections and growing tensions with its eastern members, has little appetite for any formal intervention. Under the Lisbon treaty it is in any case bound to respect the “essential state functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity” of member states.

While Brussels is tussling with rightwing, populist governments in Poland and Hungary over the rule of law and fundamental democratic values, Spain – despite Madrid’s forceful, sometimes violent, attempt to disrupt the referendum – is seen as a country that respects its judiciary and can resolve its own political conflicts.

The bloc, which views itself above all as a members’ club, is also concerned that recognising the outcome of an illegal referendum would set a precedent for other regions with aspirations to independence, such as Flanders, Lombardy and Corsica.



Many believe the EU could offer behind-the-scenes mediation, and that Madrid might benefit from being told, informally, that it is not really helping itself by tackling Catalonia’s unrealistic drive for independence as it would high treason.

But few member state governments see any benefit in either angering Madrid or encouraging secessionists. Their stance is unchanged since Donald Tusk, the European council president, said last year: “It is not on our agenda. All of us have our opinions, but formally speaking there is no space for an EU intervention.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/catalan-independence-european-leaders-unmoved-spain-standoff-with-separatists
6,spain,"After Argentina conceded six goals in their friendly against Spain, the ESPN FC guys discuss how much should be read into the result. (5:17)

The Spanish media hailed the country's national team and its hat trick hero, Isco, after the impressive 6-1 win over a Lionel Messi-less Argentina side in Tuesday's international friendly in Madrid.

In a glitzy World Cup warmup, Real Madrid midfielder Isco stole the limelight against the 2014 World Cup runners-up, who played without superstar Messi as the forward was unavailable with a muscular problem and watched on from the Wanda Metropolitano stands.

Spain, who had drawn 1-1 at World Cup holders Germany last Friday, are unbeaten in their last 18 games and Tuesday's performance again highlighted the ambitions of Julen Lopetegui's side in Russia this summer, much to the delight of the Spanish press.

Marca: Masterpiece

""Spain's first chapter was overwhelming, with Isco and Asensio in the academy of imagination. The second one was demolishing... Messi left his place 15 minutes before the end, Argentina had done that long before, unable to be keep up. Isco not only confirmed that he is a great player but that he is a very different player when he plays for Spain that when he does for Real Madrid. Three goals, maximum involvement and crucial from the first minute until when he was replaced.""

Buenos días, aquí tenéis la #PortadaAS del 28 de marzo de 2018 pic.twitter.com/RmQvxUNWxJ — AS (@diarioas) March 28, 2018

AS: Isco and Ole!

""Messi was missing, which was considered as taking away the sugar, caffeine and calories of the game. It was not like that. It was more of a World Cup game than a warmup. Argentina were close to their limit and have arrived at the conviction that, at this stage, Spain are unapproachable to them. Isco again delivered. It felt extreme the orphanhood of Argentina without Messi. Spain are right now more talented, better trained for a conventional fight. In a nuclear one, they will always have Messi.""

Diario Sport: Messi already knows who is favourite

""Spain enchanted with a finesse and touch play against a very poor rival without Leo. The Spanish national team gave new reasons to think that a second star can be added at the Russia World Cup. La Roja destroyed an Argentina without Messi, who didn't play as a precaution, with talent and a touch play that rivals none in current football.""

Argentina's press, meanwhile, summarised the concern of a nation.

Clarin: A thrashing that hurts and fills with doubts the future of the national team

""It's impossible to guess the consequences from this slap that our fragile Argentina national team received at the overwhelming hands of a merciless Spain. But there will be, that's undoubted. A 6-1 defeat leaves fingerprints and injured. It's not going to be the same, the relationship between the team and the coach and above all, the squad list that the coach had in mind to take to the World Cup will not be identical. Spain's coherent and sustained project provokes jealousy, but more so for certain individual reason than emphasize those distances (between Argentina and Spain). There, in the players, you can also understand that historic 6-1 (defeat). Argentina for some time now don't find first world class players in crucial positions. How many Argentinian players are close to (Andres) Iniesta's talent to move and organise play? How many born in this country get close to what Isco offers?""

Diario Ole: The only consolation for the 6-1 loss, there are three Messis missing

""The dream of building a team with less than 80 days is that. The slap that Spain gave us once again puts Argentina's luck exclusively on that animal of the ball that Messi is. More than the poor individual performances, the fact that we faced one of the best national teams, that we are building a group, Leo was the one that took us to the World Cup with that starring role (hat-trick) against Ecuador (Argentina's final qualifier). Let's hope the dream does come true and the team appears, but in view of this devastating scenario that this tremendous football beating leaves us, the national team's chances appear to be each time more restricted to what Messi can do first, then what Messi can do later and what Messi can do after that.""

La Nacion: Humiliated in Madrid, the 6-1 defeat to Spain raises alarm bells with 78 days to go to the World Cup

""Without Messi there is no paradise nor aspirations: the national team is just one among a bunch. Sampaoli will see a thousand times the video of the de-stabilizing 6-1. He will draw his conclusions, will make decisions. Little or nothing will be as it was before the night at the Wanda Metropolitano. It's a knockout punch but they have to get up.""",http://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/4/blog/post/3434370/masterpiece-spain-thrash-argentina-6-1-without-injured-lionel-messi
7,spain,"Manuel Blanco, Julio Latorre, and Enrique Rodriguez, three firefighters from Seville, Spain, who have helped out in multiple refugee rescue missions on the Greek island of Lesbos, could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Greek authorities accuse them of smuggling refugees into the European Union.

The authorities say the firefighters “attempted to smuggle people into Greece” because “the night (they refer to) they didn’t have anyone on board,” Manuel Blanco, one of the firefighters and vice-president of the Spanish NGOs Proemaid, told Euronews.

A fine line that changes everything

“If a person is drowning and you bring them ashore to try and save them, that can be seen as facilitating their entry,” said Blanco. This, in his opinion, blurs the fine line between human trafficking and humanitarian aid.

Blanco spoke to Euronews from Brussels, where he’s trying to gather support from Spanish MEPs ahead of the May 7 trial in Mitilene, Lesbos.

“The complaint came a few months ago, but we are starting to react now,” Blanco explains.

The firefighter and his co-workers are very worried about the situation.

“We are not smugglers. We are rescuers doing humanitarian work to help the local authorities who don’t have the capacity to help the huge number of Syrian refugees escaping the war.”

Lesbos became the face of the worst refugee crisis to hit Europe since World War II. Between January 2015 and February 2016, 937.000 people crossed into Greece from Turkey. About half of them arrived to the island of Lesbos according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).

An unprecedented humanitarian crisis

Blanco said that in his time as a firefighter he’s never seen a crisis like the one in Lesbos: “The humanitarian crisis has been brutal. I’ve been a firefighter for 20 years and I thought I had seen every sort of emergency response scenario but I hadn’t experienced a humanitarian crisis of this caliber.”

The first time Blanco joined the rescue missions in Greece was in December 2015, at the peak of the humanitarian crisis and the last one was in 2017, after his detention by local authorities.

Not leaving the island after being detained was the “the best way to prove that we weren’t doing anything wrong,” he said.

“How you can compare a person who smuggles people for money with rescuers who save people’s lives?” asks Blanco the European Parliament while his court date approaches.",http://www.euronews.com/2018/03/06/three-spanish-firefighters-accused-of-trafficking-people-in-lesbos
8,spain,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women in Spain are poised to stage their first nationwide strike on International Women’s Day on March 8 as they demand an end to unfair wages, domestic violence and the country’s prevailing “macho” culture.

The walkout aims to highlight discrimination, harassment and violence against Spanish women, which the organizers see as a product of macho attitudes.

The 8M Commission, the umbrella collective organizing the strike, has demanded authorities take a tougher stance on domestic violence in Spain, where 99 women were killed by their partners last year.

The organizers have also urged women to halt the “invisible” tasks that they often perform, such as taking children to school or cooking meals, and that they said go mostly unrecognized.

“We believe that the world does not work without us, without our domestic and care work, without our purchases and without our labor,” 8M Commission said in its manifesto.

The group called for measures to reduce precarious work conditions and improve wages for Spanish women. They earn about 15 percent less per hour relative to their male counterparts, a survey by the European Commission showed.

Women staged strikes in dozens of cities across Spain last year, but this will be the first nationwide walkout.

The strike is expected to draw teachers, journalists, healthworkers and politicians, including Madrid’s Mayor Manuela Carmena and her Barcelona counterpart Ada Colau.

Similar strikes are planned in other countries - including Britain, Poland and Ireland - as the movement for women’s rights continues to gain momentum around the world.

“I feel bad for the boys, I take the responsibility. In the second half we didn't have balance or solidity and we were all at sea.” Argentina may have swept Italy aside 2-0 on Friday without Messi, who is sidelined with a muscle injury. However, as the Italians failed to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1958 after a 1-0 playoff defeat by Sweden, the win may not be considered a testing encounter for Argentina. There was no Angel di Maria or Sergio Aguero against Spain on Tuesday either and when it came to the crunch, the players wilted. Too often they rely on superstar Messi to add some inspiration.

It was Messi who fired a hat-trick in their final qualifier against Ecuador – after they went 1-0 down inside the first minute – to secure their spot at the World Cup in Russia. Without him against top level opposition in Madrid, Argentina wilted and to describe their defending as haphazard is generous. Sampaoli may have a squad that allows him the luxury of leaving the likes of forwards Mauro Icardi and Paulo Dybala at home but on the other hand neither of their goalkeepers – Sergio Romero and Willy Caballero – are first-team regulars for their clubs. “Argentina is going to be living in torment from now until the World Cup,"" former international Jorge Valdano said on Spanish radio station Onda Cero. “Messi's the only reason that anyone is even giving Argentina a sliver of hope of winning the World Cup.”

11,spain,"Washington (CNN) Jared Kushner, tasked by his boss and father-in-law, President Donald Trump, with mediating Middle East peace early in the administration, has so far staked a bulk of those efforts on the ascendant Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

And according to a new report, the Saudi prince -- known casually by his initials, MBS -- took advantage of that power.

When Kushner, Trump's senior aide, made an unannounced trip to Riyadh last year, the Intercept -- citing three sources -- reported Wednesday , MBS told confidants after the meeting that Kushner had discussed Saudi leaders who are disloyal to the crown prince.

One person ""who talks frequently to confidants of the Saudi and Emirati rulers"" told the Intercept that MBS bragged to United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed that Kushner was ""in his pocket.""

The Intercept also reported that Kushner's information on Saudi royals not loyal to MBS was contained in the President's Daily Brief, a document presented to the President every morning. Kushner lost his access to the document earlier this year when new security clearance rules were instituted.

12,spain,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Spanish police have rescued 39 Nigerian girls and women from a notorious sex trafficking ring who kept them in squalid cave-like houses and forced them into prostitution after threatening them with black magic, Europol announced on Thursday.

The operation, carried out with British and Nigerian law enforcement agencies, led to the arrests of 89 people including a well-known Nigerian DJ, according to a Europol statement.

It said the Nigerian crime ring was linked to the Eiye Confraternity - a network that Spanish police have previously compared to the mafioso in Chicago in the 1930s.

The victims, many under the age of 18, were believed to have undergone voodoo “juju” rituals in Nigeria to force them to comply with orders, Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

After being trafficked to Spain via Libya and Italy, the women and girls were kept in cave houses in the southeastern city of Almeria, it said.

They were then forced into prostitution to pay off “debts” of 30,000 euros ($36,900) each that they were told they owed the organization for their journey to Europe.

Europol said the DJ had helped transfer the victims to Spain and “organize sexual exploitation” in several provinces.

It said bank accounts used by the network to launder more than 300,000 euros had been blocked.

“(This) was a highly organized crime gang, exploiting young woman for lengthy periods of time, keeping them in horrendous conditions where they knew there would be no escape,” the NCA’s deputy director Tom Dowdall said in a statement.

Europol said raids were carried out across 11 Spanish cities last November but the operation could not be announced until Thursday to avoid jeopardizing investigations.

The NCA said police had also arrested a Nigerian woman in Manchester this year who they believe was controlling some of the victims in Spain. She is in custody awaiting extradition to Spain, it said.

Europol said Eiye operated in clandestine groups all over the world, funding the brotherhood in Nigeria through both legal and illicit activities, particularly through human trafficking.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-nigeria-trafficking/spanish-police-rescue-nigerian-girls-sold-for-sex-after-voodoo-threats-idUSKBN1GY2TC
13,spain,"A decision to reissue arrest warrants for several Catalan politicians has reignited the debate among Scots on the future of the province in north-east Spain.

Five former ministers in the devolved Catalan government were named in the warrants on Friday. But it was the inclusion of Clara Ponsatí that raised most eyebrows in Scotland.

The former education minister was serving in the Catalan government when it declared independence from Spain in October last year following a hugely divisive referendum - an event which was subsequently ruled illegal by the central court in Madrid.

Ponsati has a close links to Scotland. A former head of St Andrews University’s school of economics, she had returned to the Fife town earlier this month to resume her work as a researcher. She is now expected to hand herself in at an Edinburgh police station later this week.

Nicola Sturgeon has said she supported the right of the Catalan people to determine their own future, but added the police were obliged to follow due process and ministers were not permitted to intervene.

Ponsati is likely to follow Carles Puigdemont - who was detained in Germany on Sunday - in being extradited to Spain. Other members of Mr Puigdemont’s former government have been in prison pending trial since the immediate aftermath of the referendum.

But the impending arrest of the five former ministers will not resolve what has become an increasingly bitter constitutional crisis in a country once considered a model for its embrace of democracy.

What next?

Daniel Cetrà, a research fellow for the Centre on Constitutional Change at the University of Edinburgh, has studied both the Scottish and Catalan independence campaigns in recent years. Originally from Barcelona, he moved to Scotland in 2010.

He described a “deep polarisation” taking hold in Catalonia between those supporting independence and those in favour of Spanish unity.

“(The arrests) are another significant episode in the greatest constitutional crisis in Spain since the restoration of democracy,” he said.

“There is a deep polarisation both within Catalonia, between supporters and opponents of independence, and between Catalonia and the rest of Spain. Two distinct worldviews have grown apart over the Catalan quest for self-determination and independence that started in 2012.”

Paying the price?

Writing on the centre’s website, Mr Cetrà said the majority view in Spain was the former Catalan ministers had broken the law and subsequently deserved to pay the legal price. In contrast, the majority of Catalans view the issue as a political one.

He added: “The last two elections returned a pro-independence majority in the parliament, and the claim is that Spanish institutions are not respecting the democratic mandate of the people and are abusing judicial powers for political purposes, including the jailing of political opponents.”

But the arrests of all the main Catalan leaders poses problems. It makes the possibility of negotiations between separatists and Spanish authorities unlikely. The former are unlikely to agree to talks without the release of their colleagues. Longer-term, the arrests may weaken the legitimacy of the Spanish judicial process in the eyes of Catalans.

“Spain now runs the risk of crossing the line between the rule of law, in which judges hold the ring of political dispute, to the rule by law, in which judicial powers are abused for political ends,” said Cetrà.

“Solving this crisis requires a nimble political intelligence that has so far been absent. It also requires both sides to recognise each other as a legitimate political interlocutor and a recognition of past mistakes.”

With a year to go until the UK leaves the European Union, BBC Scotland has been speaking to Scots pondering a future in Spain.

It's easy to understand why so many Scots settle on the Costa Blanca, with its sandy beaches, all-day breakfasts and the promise of sunshine 300 days a year.

Spanish officials estimate there are more than 65,000 Britons registered as residents in the Alicante region.

And they may well be asking themselves: ""Will Brexit change my plans for a life in the sun?""

Bicycle shop businessman Gary Routledge from Elgin has been living in Quesada for 10 years and is now in the process of applying for residency in Spain.

He voted to remain in the EU and he says that since the referendum his business has changed.

""Since Brexit kicked in we have started to buy less bikes from the UK due to the fact that bikes have gone up in value - they charge us more for the same bike,"" he explained.

""So we are now buying more Spanish bikes. We buy 80% of our bikes from Spain now and 20% from the UK, whereas it used to be 100% from the UK.

""So the UK is losing out both from us and the wholesalers who we speak to.""

Registering with the Spanish authorities is also on the mind of restaurant worker Caroline Sim, who has been on the Costa Blanca for six years.

The former social worker from near Glasgow acknowledges the benefits: ""It would make sense obviously to become resident because then it should safeguard you, your rights and everything like that within the country.""

English language teacher Agnes Miller grew up in Edinburgh but has lived in Spain for more than three decades.

She didn't get a vote in the referendum but campaigned with the Remain in Spain group before the UK went to the polls. She is concerned about what will happen to her language school post-Brexit.

Anges told the BBC: ""My real and immediate concerns on my business about Brexit are that British teachers are going to lose their freedom of movement, so they are not going to be able to come here to work as quickly, as easily and as inexpensively as they can do now and that is going to impact a lot on my flexibility as a business.""

One Briton who knows what UK citizens are having to consider as the clock ticks closer to Brexit is Jack Troughton, a journalist working for English newspaper Costa Blanca News.

He believes people from Britain who settle in Spain are failing to realise the importance of committing to residency.

Jack says: ""Brexit is something we have had to cover a lot, ever since the referendum.

""There are something like 300,000 officially registered [Britons], and there are probably something between that and 800,000 living here.""

'People have tried to wing it'

He added: ""One of the other problems is there are people called swallows who spend half their time in the UK and half the time here trying to chase the good weather.

""I think a lot of people have tried to wing it, they haven't done their research.

""They are ready for Brexit in terms of they can read about it in newspapers, they can see it on TV, but in some respects they stick their heads in the sand and they don't engage properly - and all of this bureaucracy, you have to get it right.""

The British Embassy is keen to get the message of residency across to ex-pats. It's held 60 separate events in the region on the matter.

A spokeswoman said: ""One of the main recommendations we give to British citizens in Spain is that they register with their local authorities, in the Padron.

""This is a requirement by the Spanish government, to keep a record of number of citizens living in towns.

""Also, municipalities get assigned services and resources depending on numbers of residents, so being a registered resident benefits both the resident and local authorities.""

The number of UK citizens registered as resident in Spain has fallen in the past five years - from 397,892 in 2012 to 240,785 in 2017.

Further down the coast in Malaga, the Spanish Citizens Advice Bureau, has been inundated with requests for information on Brexit, with 30,000 people posting on their website since the referendum.

Myra Azzopardi, from CAB Spain, says the advice is to get registered. ""People are very confused. Unfortunately they do not understand what's going on.""

16,spain,"Why Isco is starring for Spain but struggling at Real Madrid

08:00 Share Close

The midfielder hit a superb hat-trick for La Roja against Argentina on Tuesday, but is not a guaranteed starter for his club. So why the difference?

It was a night to remember for Isco Alarcon. The 25-year-old rounded off a near-perfect performance with a first hat-trick of his career, against Argentina no less, and left the pitch to a huge ovation from Spain's supporters at the Wanda Metropolitano.

Isco is a player who seems to transcend rivalries. Everyone loves him. A Real Madrid player who was wanted by Barcelona – and also their fans – not so long ago, he heard his name chanted on Tuesday at the home of his club's other big rivals, Atletico.

That is no mean feat, yet it is impossible not to appreciate his talents. There is, however, one big conundrum with Isco: how can he be starring for Spain but struggling somewhat at Real Madrid?

Because there is a definite difference. Yes, he has started three of Madrid's last four league games and appeared 38 times in total, scoring seven goals this term. But he has found himself excluded in some of the important games, including the Champions League last-16 second-leg clash against Paris Saint-Germain.

At Real, a feeling persists that he sometimes slows down the team, that he is to blame for failing to replicate the fantastic form of last season. In a Spain shirt, however, he is suddenly superb again. Under Julen Lopetegui, he has scored a goal every 75 minutes. At Madrid, it is one every 327. That is quite a discrepancy.

""When you don't have that continuity with your club, games with the national team give me life,"" Isco said after Spain's win on Tuesday. ""Here, the coach has confidence in me... maybe I haven't earned that at Madrid. Julen shows his confidence in me with minutes. At Madrid I don't have the confidence that a footballer needs.""

And he added, with complete sincerity: ""Maybe I'm the problem. I haven't been able to earn it. I have to keep working to earn Zidane's trust.""

Lopetegui worked with Isco in Spain's Under-21 side and placed his confidence in the Malaga-born midfielder as soon as he took over the senior side in 2016. ""I'm passionate about Isco,"" he said. He also claimed he and Andres Iniesta could co-exist ""marvellously"" in the same XI. And he was right.

Lopetegui made sure he was communicative and close to Isco in training ahead of Spain's two friendlies against Germany and Argentina. He knows how important the midfielder is in his team and that personal touch clearly makes a difference. Perhaps Zidane could learn something from the Basque's approach in that respect.

""I'm not unfair on him, and he's happy,"" Zidane said on Friday. ""He wants to play more like all players, and maybe he hasn't been enjoying as central a role here, but I've always made it clear to him that he's important. Isco is a Real Madrid player, and he's going to stay here. He's a player I like.""

Competition for places at Madrid is intense, of course, although the same could be said of the Spain side these days. And if Isco is talented enough to star for La Roja, surely he should be a fixture for Real too?

Already a three-time Champions League winner for Los Blancos, he has only started one of those finals – the 4-1 victory over Juventus in Cardiff last season. That, on the back of some scintillating showings in La Liga, looked like a watershed moment. A new contract was signed, his release clause set at a whopping €700 million.

So what changed? A collective winter slump for Real hardly helped, but it is more than that. For Spain, Isco is surrounded by players like Iniesta, David Silva, Sergio Busquets and more, who are just like he is. Masters of touch passing, juego de posesión. Tiki taka.

Madrid's style is a mixture. While there are plenty of technical players in their line-up, such as Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Marco Asensio, there is also a more direct approach with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Meanwhile, the switch to a more traditional 4-4-2 with wingers (Asensio and Lucas Vazquez) has seen Isco fall down the pecking order of late.

Article continues below

Zidane has continued to speak of Isco's importance. The sign of a top coach, however, is the ability to get all of a team's best players on the pitch at the same time, make it work and improve them in the process. And if Madrid cannot, there will be plenty of takers for Isco – Pep Guardiola and Manchester City among them.

""I don't see him to day to day for his club and I don't know what Zidane is thinking,"" Spain team-mate Koke said after Tuesday's win. ""I love Isco. If he doesn't have continuity there, maybe he would at Atletico...""

There is little chance of that, though it does show how highly he is rated. Koke loves Isco, just like everyone else loves Isco. But perhaps it is time for Real Madrid and Zidane to love him a little more. The potential rewards are there for all to see.",http://www.goal.com/en-ng/news/why-isco-is-starring-for-spain-but-struggling-at-real-madrid/14uts3885oyio1uti91nh0vws5

The Spanish Supreme Court in Madrid has detained five Catalan separatist leaders, including the latest candidate for regional president. They will be held without bail pending their trials.

The leaders are charged with rebellion, along with eight others, over their involvement in a push for independence.

A judge said the five were serious flight risks.

Following the ruling, protesters clashed with police in the centre of Barcelona late on Friday.

The latest detentions throw into doubt a planned second vote in the Catalan parliament on Saturday on whether to install Jordi Turull, now in prison, as regional president.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Catalan politician Jordi Turull (l), a regional presidential hopeful, is one of the five jailed on Friday

Two separatist leaders wanted by the Spanish authorities are in self-imposed exile in Belgium and Switzerland.

Altogether 25 separatists have been charged variously with sedition, rebellion, embezzlement and other crimes. They deny all the allegations.

The escalated legal action against the separatists follows Catalonia's independence referendum last October, which the Spanish courts declared illegal.

What next for Catalonia's independence movement?

Danny Aeberhard, Europe Regional Editor

This is the most serious challenge to date for the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership faces a major legal fight.

The legal rulings have provoked a furious response from Catalan separatists and thousands have turned out to demonstrate.

One of the accused - the sacked former head of the Catalan government, Carles Puigdemont - called Spain anti-democratic and an embarrassment to Europe.

A European arrest warrant has been reactivated against him, and issued for five others who are also in self-imposed exile.

Who are the latest to be detained?

The five senior Catalan politicians remanded in custody on Friday were:

Jordi Turull - former Catalan government spokesman and the latest candidate for regional president

Josep Rull - former Catalan development minister

Carme Forcadell - former Catalan parliament speaker

Raul Romeva - former Catalan foreign affairs chief

Dolors Bassa - former Catalan labour minister

All five spent some time in detention following the banned referendum but were released on bail late last year pending investigations into their individual roles in the independence drive.

The Supreme Court Judge, Pablo Llarena, ruled on Friday that they should be returned to jail as they represented a flight risk.

The five join four other Catalan leaders already detained in prison. They include Oriol Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, and Jordi Sánchez, who was nominated to lead the Catalan government but dropped the bid after the Spanish authorities refused to release him to attend an investiture ceremony.

What else did the judge say?

Judge Llarena also issued an arrest warrant for Marta Rovira, the head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, who failed to appear in court on Friday.

Spanish media reported that she had fled into exile in Switzerland.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Catalan separatists clashed with police in Barcelona late on Friday

The judge also reactivated European arrests warrants for six others who are also in self-imposed exile, including former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont who is in Belgium.

What reaction has there been?

The nationalist Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) condemned the court ruling and demanded the release of all those held in prison.

Later on Friday, thousands of protesters gathered in the centre of Barcelona, waving flags and condemning the actions of the Spanish government. Some parts of the crowd clashed with police and Spanish media report that more than 20 people were treated for minor injured.

A leadership vote for Mr Turull had been due to take place on Saturday.

20,spain,"Stevie Nicol and Ale Moreno dissect Isco's comments about his lack of confidence at Real Madrid under Zinedine Zidane. (1:37)

Isco said he felt ""alive'' after his first career hat trick helped Spain thrash Argentina 6-1 at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid.

But the Real Madrid playmaker, who has seen his club football limited in spells under Zinedine Zidane this season, admitted he might not know how to win his Los Blancos manager's confidence.

However, Isco produced a superb display for La Roja against Argentina, whose captain Lionel Messi again watched from the stands because of fitness concerns.

Spain had drawn 1-1 against Germany last week and have now extended their unbeaten run under coach Julen Lopetegui to 18 matches.

""In Madrid I don't have the confidence a player needs,'' Isco said in a postmatch interview with Marca. ""The matches with the national team give me life. Here I have the confidence of the coach.

""I want to show that I'm a good player. Lopetegui shows me confidence with the minutes he gives me.

""Maybe I'm the problem in Madrid. I don't know how to win Zidane's confidence.''

After Gonzalo Higuain shot wide early on, Diego Costa fired Spain ahead in the 13th minute, before Isco struck either side of a header from Argentina defender Nicolas Otamendi.

Thiago Alcantara added a fourth, with substitute Iago Aspas also on the scoresheet before Isco netted his third with 16 minutes left.

""Despite the result, this match wasn't easy,'' Isco added. ""They made things difficult for us, they were very aggressive.

""We mustn't forget that this is part of our preparation for the World Cup. The victory can give us a lot.''

Spain coach Lopetegui also looked to play down the final scoreline, but did hail his playmaker Isco in the process.

""I'm not discovering anything new about Isco, it gives me great pleasure to have him in the national team,"" Lopetegui said. ""Argentina were without many important players tonight and it would be stupid to deny that.

""It doesn't take away the work my players have done. We are happy, but the World Cup has not started yet.

21,spain,"The Spanish authorities have accused Mr. Puigdemont of rebellion and misuse of public funds, and a German regional court will decide within 60 days whether to send him back to face trial. But if the court chooses to extradite him only for the corruption charge, that would create a political and legal bind for the Spanish government, which would be barred from trying him for rebellion, the charge at the heart of the matter.

“Spain is creating a situation where Europe’s judges rather than its politicians are being asked to solve Catalonia,” said Sergi Pardos-Prado, a professor of politics at Oxford University. “At a time when the European Union needs more legitimacy and to reconnect with its citizens, how can this not make it seem like a distant and technocratic project?”

On Monday, Gonzalo Boye, a lawyer who represents two of the politicians wanted by Spain, told the Spanish news media that he was confident a foreign judge would not allow his clients to stand trial for rebellion. He even asked whether “Judge Llarena isn’t our best friend, because things are being handled in the worst possible manner.”

Mr. Puigdemont’s arrest has thrust Catalonia back onto the European agenda, potentially testing relations between Germany and Spain, after European governments had mostly managed to ignore the separatists’ political aspirations. The case also raises questions about whether Europe has a unified conception of the rule of law, and how it will respond to other secessionist movements.

Madrid is also seeking the arrest of other Catalan separatists who are in Scotland, Belgium and Switzerland, where officials have so far questioned whether their legal systems require the separatists’ extradition based on the rebellion charges brought by Spain. Mr. Puigdemont himself had been based in Belgium, where the European Union is headquartered, since late October. While Belgium never considered him a flight risk, a German judge has ordered that he should be provisionally kept in prison for that very reason.

The arrest comes at a particularly combustible time for the European Union, which is coping with Britain’s pending exit from the bloc, a right-wing populist upheaval in Italy, growing labor unrest in France, frictions between Brussels and the increasingly authoritarian governments of Hungary and Poland, and a growing clash with Russia.

It is also a difficult time for the Catalan separatists, who appear to be running out of options within the country’s political framework. After a botched declaration of independence in October, and new regional elections, the three separatist parties have been unable to resolve disputes among them and elect a new Catalan president.

Mr. Puigdemont and other separatists claim that Spain cannot give them a fair trial. That accusation is dismissed in Madrid as yet another affront by politicians who have repeatedly flouted court rulings in their drive toward independence.

“We can debate the specific approach of the prosecution and the judges, but there are strong legal grounds for this case,” said Enrique Gimbernat, professor of criminal law at Complutense University in Madrid.

Still, several Spanish legal experts acknowledge that state prosecutors are pushing the Supreme Court into uncharted waters. They also note that, however many Catalan politicians are tried and convicted, imprisonment is not a viable alternative to a political solution that Mr. Rajoy has failed to reach.

Mr. Rajoy dissolved the parliament of Catalonia, which represents one-fifth of the Spanish economy, and called new elections in December, which served only to confirm the profound split in Catalan society. Mr. Puigdemont and other separatists retained their narrow parliamentary majority, with almost exactly the same share of votes — 47.5 percent — as two years earlier.

“It seems absolutely counterproductive to use criminal law and this court to solve a politico-constitutional conflict,” said José Antonio Martín Pallín, a former judge of the Supreme Court.

Since Friday’s court decision in Madrid, protesters have been back on the streets of Barcelona and other cities. Roger Torrent, the pro-independence speaker of the Catalan Parliament, is pushing for lawmakers to elect Mr. Puigdemont in absentia, though the former president has recently said he is no longer a candidate; opposition lawmakers want Mr. Torrent to resign, instead.

Separatist lawmakers have two months to form an administration or force new elections.

“Puigdemont’s arrest does not bridge the divisions between secessionist parties over what to do next,” Antonio Barroso, a political analyst at consulting firm Teneo Intelligence in London, wrote in a note on Monday.

The politics of Spain have also shifted: Mr. Rajoy now leads a minority government, and his center-right People’s Party finished last in the Catalan election. He risks being outflanked by a center-right party, Ciudadanos, that was founded on an anti-secession platform and won the most votes in Catalonia in December.

“One can be critical of the leaders on both sides and how they have handled every part of this conflict, but I don’t think this should be seen through the lens of a conflict between the rule of law and democracy,” said Alan Solomont, a former United States ambassador to Spain who is now dean of the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. The better lens, Mr. Solomont argued, was that “Catalonia is a region, subject to the Spanish Constitution of 1978, and a national government always has the right to enforce national law.”

In 2014, Catalonia’s government defied Madrid by staging a nonbinding vote on independence. Catalonia’s leader at the time, Artur Mas, was later barred from office for organizing an unconstitutional vote.

In October, Spain’s attorney general decided to prosecute Catalan leaders for rebellion, though Spain’s legal code had been revised to emphasize violence as a component of rebellion. The crime carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.

The Spanish authorities are also widening the investigation, looking into Catalan media executives and officers in the region’s autonomous police force, and raiding offices in search of evidence linked to the referendum last October. So far, their findings fill 15,000 pages of police reports.

Javier Ortega, a leader of Vox, a small far-right party, described the drive for Catalonian independence as ”a failed coup d’état, led by people who had already set up all the structures of a parallel state.”

Vox is a fringe party. But in his ruling last week, Judge Llarena drew a thinly veiled comparison between last year’s events in Catalonia and an aborted military coup in Spain in 1981.

Mr. Puigdemont, who had traveled to Finland, left that country on Friday, driving across Scandinavia, with officers of Spain’s secret service following him. He was detained after crossing into Germany, whose criminal code, Spanish authorities believe, will allow for his extradition.

Christian Mölling, the research director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said he saw no reason Mr. Puigdemont would not be extradited to Spain.

“If we pass this onto politics, it would be a declaration of bankruptcy for the judiciary,” he said. “We have courts precisely to depoliticize things.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/world/europe/spain-catalonia-carles-puigdemont-extradition.html
22,spain,"These are tough times for NGOs performing search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. They face two major risks: hostility from the Libyan coast guard in open water, including threats with guns blazing; and seizures ordered by the judicial authorities on arrival in Italy, as in the case of the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms. So it is that a year after the number of humanitarian ships operating in the central Mediterranean reached a peak of 12, just one is left.





In the middle of all this is the controversial code of conduct introduced by the Italian Interior Ministry. And with the imminent start of the fair weather season and the consequent likely increase in migrant departures from north Africa, the prospects for NGOs dedicated to saving lives at sea do not look much better.





Investigations and rules





There was a time last spring when 35% of migrants rescued at sea were picked up by NGO ships. At that point the Italian government, parliament and judicial authorities intervened to stem the phenomenon. The 'offensive' was launched in February 2017 by Catania prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro (the same magistrate who ordered the recent seizure of the Open Arms vessel), who opened a probe into the sea rescues. There followed an investigation by the Senate defence committee that resulted in an invitation to block ""the humanitarian corridors managed independently by NGOs.""





Then at the end of July Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti introduced the code of conduct introducing new restrictions on NGO activities in the Mediterranean, which some organisations such as MSF refused to sign. At the same time the Libyan coast guard stepped up its patrols, thanks also to motorboats donated by Italy, defining its SAR area. At this point the withdrawal of humanitarian vessels began.





The NGOs that have abandoned the Mediterranean





In early August 2017 the Iuventa operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet was seized by prosecutors in Trapani. The same office ordered a search of the Vos Hestia operated by Save the children, which then withdrew from operations in the Mediterranean. MOAS took the same decision, while there were several reports of 'incidents' between humanitarian ships and the Libyan coast guard. Sea Eye has also suspended its activities, saying that it could resume operations next week.





The ship operated by Sea Watch is currently berthed in Spain, although the organisation says it intends to continue its rescue missions in the central Mediterranean. This leaves only the Aquarius operated by Sos Mediterranee-MSF. ""After a few days in port to refuel and change crew Aquarius is preparing to return to international waters as the weather conditions improve. The SosMedItalia teams are ready to save lives.""",http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/8199/ngos-are-facing-difficult-times-in-italy

With its distinctive culture and economic prowess, the region of Catalonia has long dreamed of independence from outside rulers who for centuries have kept its ambitions in check.

Most recently, Catalonia’s fight for independence, splashed across front pages around the world, has triggered a constitutional crisis with Spain’s central government and raised awkward questions about European unity just as Britain is preparing to quit the EU.

The triangular region bordering the Mediterranean Sea and France in northeast Spain is known for its cosmopolitan capital, Barcelona, its rich artistic heritage — think Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso and Antoni Gaudí — its beaches, boulevards and night life, and, for football lovers, FC Barcelona, aka Barça.

It is also one of Europe’s major ports and the economic powerhouse of Spain, accounting for one quarter of the country’s exports and about a fifth of its output.

Catalonia’s economic might has long made it an attractive prize for outside powers while making the dream of independence something more than a whim.

Rapid economic growth lessened the pain.

For centuries, Catalonia was coveted by rulers on both sides of the Pyrenees mountains that divide current-day Spain from France.

In the early 18th century, competing monarchies laid claim to the Spanish crown before the Bourbon King Philip V emerged victorious. Feeling betrayed by the Catalans, he wasted no time issuing the Nueva Planta Decrees, which terminated Catalonia’s separate institutions, laws and rights, and folded the region into Spain.

The loss of centuries of separate laws and customs did not sit well with Catalans, but over the next two centuries, rapid economic growth, spurred by trade with Spain’s American colonies, lessened the pain.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Spain had lost all of its remaining colonies to the United States while Barcelona was emerging as an artistic and industrial capital. Catalonia’s growth made independence seem a more realistic ambition.

Spain’s decision to remain neutral during World War One, when many Catalans felt an affinity for the Triple Entente of Britain, France and Russia, added to resentment of the monarchy, which in the event was sidelined after Francisco Franco emerged victorious from Spain’s Civil War and imposed 3-1/2 decades of fascism.

Ruling with an iron fist, Franco repressed Catalonia’s culture and self-government as part of his policy of centralizing control in Madrid. After Franco died in 1975 and Spain transitioned to a democracy and eventual membership in the EU, Catalonia recovered much of its cultural and political autonomy.

The next two decades of rapid economic growth bankrolled Barcelona, which hosted the Olympic Games successfully in 1992 and became one of Europe’s top tourist destinations.

At a breaking point

But Spain’s financial crisis starting in 2008 stirred secessionist thoughts anew among many Catalans who felt they were carrying too big a fiscal burden inside of Spain.

Kitchen-table talk of independence moved to party platforms.

It all came to a head last autumn when a coalition of pro-independence parties spearheaded a referendum, quickly declared illegal by Madrid, that saw an overwhelming majority of those who voted favoring secession from Spain.

During the referendum, images of a brutal crackdown by police, ordered into the streets by anti-independence forces, were transmitted around the world, only muddying the waters.

A subsequent declaration of independence by Catalonia’s legislature was struck down by Madrid, which dissolved the regional government and placed the region under central control.

So now we wait for the dénouement of this latest political spasm that is pitting Spain’s richest region against the central government — and the monarchy.

Those of us at School Year Abroad Spain are truly caught in the middle. The city where we are studying, Zaragoza, is halfway between Madrid and Barcelona. And it is hard for any of us to take a position on an issue that for centuries has remained unresolved but which now seems to be reaching a breaking point.

Do you think Catalonia will secede? Do you think they should?

25,spain,"A constitutional row has broken out after Spain’s ministry of defence ordered all military installations to fly the flag at half mast over Easter to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ.

It is the second year running that the defence ministry has issued an order to the effect that “from 14.00 on Holy Thursday until 00.01 on Resurrection Sunday the national flag must be flown at half mast at all military units, bases, centres and barracks, as well as the ministry of defence and its regional departments”.

A defence ministry spokesman said that flying the flag at half mast for religious reasons was “in keeping with tradition” and was “part of the secular tradition of the armed forces”.

Flags, passion and anger: reporting from a divided Spain Read more

But Francisco Fernández Marugán, the national ombudsman, criticised the move on the grounds that Spain is constitutionally a secular state. Article 16.3 of the 1978 Spanish constitution states: “No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic church and other confessions.”

In a study carried out in 2018 by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research, 68.5% of Spaniards identified themselves as Catholics and 26.4% as atheists. There are approximately 2 million Muslims and 50,000 Jews in Spain. Fewer than half of Spanish Catholics ever attend mass.

Fernández Marugán rejected the argument put forward by the ministry, led by María Dolores de Cospedal, based on a 2017 ruling that members of the armed forces are authorised “to take part in celebrations of a religious nature in which the military traditionally takes part”.

He argued that the ruling did not anticipate “military funeral honours for religious motives, such as the commemoration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ”.

The ombudsman said that “even if this tradition has acquired a ‘secular’ connotation over the years there is no doubt that it also has a religious one”, adding that “these practices could lead people to think that the state was more inclined to honour one religion than another” and that a non-confessional state had to demonstrate neutrality in regard to the various religions.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/spains-military-in-row-over-flags-at-half-mast-for-easter
