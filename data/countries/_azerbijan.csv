Siamak Ghaderi is an Iranian freelance journalist and a former editor and reporter for the Islamic Republic's official news agency IRNA.

Ghaderi made international headlines when he chose to rebut former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's claim in 2007 that there were no homosexuals in Iran by publishing online his own interviews with several gay Iranians. He later set up his own blog, called IRNA-ye maa (Our IRNA), in which he covered street protests and other developments following the contested 2009 presidential election.

In July 2010, he was arrested and, in January 2011, sentenced to four years in prison and 60 lashes on charges of ""propagating against the regime,"" ""creating public anxiety,"" and ""spreading falsehoods."" Pro-government news websites--including Rasekhoon and Haghighat News--called him a ""seditionist"" who was arrested for ""immoral"" acts. His blog was repeatedly blocked by authorities before he was detained, reports said.

Ghaderi was an editor and reporter for IRNA for 18 years until he was dismissed for writing about the 2009 election on his blog.

On July 14, 2014, Ghaderi was released from prison.

The text of Ghaderi's acceptance speech, as prepared for delivery, is below. For the Farsi-language version of the speech as prepared for delivery, click here.

Ladies and gentlemen, greetings.

I am grateful to be honored with this prestigious International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. I accept it on behalf of all brave, hardworking Iranian journalists.

This award is a show of support for journalists who are experiencing the hardest and darkest period for journalism in Iran.

During the past 15 years, and specifically during the years since the 2009 election, dozens of newspapers and journalists have been found guilty in courts affiliated with security organizations. Many of those journalists will remain behind bars for years to come.

The crackdown on the Iranian media and journalist organizations is not new. It has been almost a decade since the Association of Iranian Journalists was suspended and its elected officers either imprisoned or forced into exile.



Journalism in Iran becomes bloody as dictatorships lose legitimacy and become unstable.

The heaviest pressure on Iranian journalists came in the summer and fall of 2009 after state television broadcasted show trials. The Tehran bureaus of foreign media were prevented from reporting on the bloody crackdown on protests by a government which had come to power through a de facto coup d’état.

This was when thousands of ordinary people took to disseminating information. In the years following, our prisons were filled with these citizen journalists and human rights activists who, in the absence of independent media, presented the voices of protesters.

If it weren't for journalists, the sad death of blogger Sattar Beheshti in custody in 2012 and the beating of political prisoners at Evin Prison this year would have never been reported.

Ladies and gentlemen, need I remind you that the Iranian regime has violated the Iranian Constitution, which guarantees political and civil rights and freedom of expression?

Iranians continue to protest in the framework of the Green Movement. The regime is terrified to normalize the country's political situation, to release Green Movement leaders and political, human rights, minority, and student activists.

The regime is battling a legitimacy crisis and so considers a free press as an enemy that peddles negative news and anti-state propaganda.

This award is an indication of the will of the international community to support the free activities of Iranian journalists and the people's protests.



Thank you.

2,azerbijan,"The British publicist at the center of the Donald Trump Jr Russian meeting is a well-connected showbusiness figure who has built a relationship with the Trumps - but it is his link to a Russian oligarch which is at the heart of the growing scandal.

Rob Goldstone, 57, boasts of his connections to Michael Jackson, Richard Branson and Bob Geldof on his company's website.

Behind the scenes, his newly-published emails make clear that his connections to Donald Trump Sr and Jr were close too, being on first name terms with Donald Jr and Rhona Graff, Trump's executive assistant and Trump Tower 'gatekeeper'.

But it is Goldstone's work in Russia in recent years which is the key to his explosion into the limelight.

Goldstone is the manager of Emin - real name Emin Agalarov - a 37-year-old Russian pop star whose connections take him to the heart of Putin's autocracy.

Agalarov's father is Russian-Azerbijani Aras Agalarov, a billionaire retail mall and property development magnate whose Crocus Group is one of Russia's biggest companies.

He is known to be close to Putin.

Out of the shadows: Rob Goldstone (right) and his client Emin (left), a pop star whose father is a Putin-friendly Russian billionaire, were captured on camera with Trump during the now presidnet's 2013 visit to Moscow

Deal makers: Aras Agalarov (second left) and his son Emin, set out to woo Donald Trump to bring Miss Universe to Moscow, traveling to Las Vegas to build a relationship with the then tycoon. Goldstone is Emin's music manager

Success: This was the scene when Trump brought his Miss Universe to Moscow - with Emin (left) and Aras Agalarov (right) posing with him. Their branding was side by side. Now the FBI will look into what happened next.

Link: Goldstone was present as Trump and the Agalarovs spent time in Moscow for Miss Universe. Then three years later he used the continuing relationship to set up the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Natalai Veselnitskaya, saying it was to offer 'incriminating' official Russia information

Happy together: In Miami Beach in on December 31, 2014 Emin posed with his sister Sheila, a realtor, and his manager Goldstone.

And Emin was until last year married to Leyla Aliveya, whose father Ilham Aliyeva is the president of Azerbijan, and an ally of Putin.

That Putin relationship appears to be the one which is critical to the meeting between Trump Jr and Natalia Veselnitskaya, which was sensationally revealed over the weekend.

Goldstone is the man at the center of the web – and an unlikely figure for international intrigue.

He was born in Manchester, in the north of England, and brought up in its tight-knit Jewish community, leaving school at 16 to become a local newspaper reporter.

He worked for regional newspapers in the UK and freelanced for national titles including, on his own account, The Sun and the Sunday Mirror, and then moved into broadcast, working for LBC, the London commercial news radio station, which resulted in him spending time with Bob Geldof, the Irish pop singer turned humanitarian, in Ethiopia in the wake of Live Aid.

Goldstone told the Jewish Telegraph that he relocated to Australia, where he covered Michael Jackson's tour in 1987,

The former showbusiness journalist went into public relations, setting up first his own company then working for British recording label HMV, who moved him to New York, where in 1997 he set up Oui2, his current PR firm.

Over time it was involved in promoting events in the city such as Sting appearing in Central Park, a Tony Bennett Gala, and awards shows featuring Martin Scorsese and Tom Cruise. A string of selfies accompanied the contracts.

Goldstone offered an account of how he went from a jobbing New York music PR to an oligarch's intimate to the Jewish Telegraph.

He told the British newspaper that he was called by then Sony Music / ATV chairman martin Bandier, who is now retired, and asked to manage Emin. The connection came through Sony Israel, Goldstone said.

Reluctantly, he said, he accepted. What he did not say is that the offer would be certain to have been lucrative and politically intriguing.

FBI questions: Officers assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller will want to establish exactly how Goldstone came to known Natalia Veselnitskaya

Conflicting stories: Donald Trump Jr (left) and Veselnitskay (right) have told conflicting stories about their meeting

Emin is also a vice-president of his father's billionaire company. The parallels to Donald Trump Jr are easy to draw; Agalarov Snr is known as the Donald Trump of Russia and both sons were until recently vice-presidents of the family construction and property firms.

The first dealings between the Trumps and the Agalarovs appear to have been around 2012. Although in 2008 Donald Trump Jr made frequently trips to Moscow, and his father spoke approvingly about the market there, the Agalarovs do not appear to have been involved. But they started wooing the Trumps to bring Miss Universe to Moscow.

The relationship between the Trumps and the Agalarovs reached its height in 2013 when Trump held his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, his last and only second known visit to Russia. His only other known visit was in 1987.

The Agalarovs essentially paid for Miss Universe to come to Moscow – and their branding was all over the event.

On the red carpet, Trump posed with the billionaire father and his son Emin, along with the winner of the pageant.

Trump obligingly appeared in his Celebrity Apprentice persona for Emin, and there were moves to finalize a deal to build a Moscow Trump Tower. Agarlov Snr hosted a dinner for the now president. And also there was the British PR and music manager.

Largely in the background, he can be seen in one image captured by a Russian television station, standing on Trump's left, with Emin on Trump's right.

What the emails released on Tuesday by Donald Jr make clear is that Donald Jr, Goldstone and by extension Emin had maintained a relationship in the wake of Miss Universe.

In March 2014, before Trump's run for office, Emin hosted an event at one of the Trump golf courses. A picture posted to social media showed him, Trump and Ivanka smiling together.

Goldstone's social media shows that he has been a frequent visitor to Moscow and to Azerbaijan. The Agalarovs, father and son, are both dual Russian and Azeri nationals, and the social connection between Emin and the Putinm-friendly regime there, thanks to being the president's son-in-law until his divorce in 2016, appears not to have harmed his pop career.

The Agalarovs are of course more than businessman and a would-be worldwide pop singer: Agalarov Snr is an intimate of Putin.

Video star: Emin managed to get President Trump to star in his music video back in 2013 (above)

Relationship: In 2014, Emin hosted an event at one of Trump's golf clubs and posed alongside the then tycoon and his daughter Ivanka

Leverage: On the day Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr to suggest a meeting, he was at one of Moscow's most elite venues - with Emin

The bombshell email: This is the message which has created the political scadal which has erupted since Saturday

In 2013, just before the Miss Universe pageant, the oligarch was awarded one of the nation's highest awards, the 'Order of Honor'.

The reason was not spelled out but the connection was clear; little business is done in Russia without Putin's say-so.

What will now be at the heart of the Russian investigations taking place in Washington is how exactly Goldstone became acquainted with Veselnitskaya. She claims to have been acting independently of the Kremlin, and the Kremlin have claimed they do not even know who she is.

But that appears unlikely.

Veselnitskaya, 42, is seen in Moscow as having ties to Russia's vast security structures - known as the siloviki - via her ex-husband, who was a former senior state prosecutor, and other associates.

Veselnitskaya rose to prominence after marrying Alexander Mitusov, often operating in close tandem with his daughter from a previous marriage, lawyer Natalia Mitusova, only four years her junior.

He was once described as a 'shady cardinal who sorts various tricky questions with the siloviki for the elite' in Moscow region, while he was also an owner of his wife's legal business.

Called the sharpest lawyer in Moscow region, Veselnitskaya was nicknamed 'the prosecutor's bride' because of her link to Mitusov.

That led to her defending Denys Katsyv in New York on tax fraud charges.

Katsyv's father is the vice-president of the state-owned railways, and seen as part of the circle around Putin.

There is no known direct connection yet between her and the Agalarovs, but business in Moscow operates on the basis of who you know.

Social media shows that Goldstone was in Moscow with Emin when he sent the email to Trump Jr suggesting the meeting.

What the FBI will look into is how Veselnitskaya came to know Emin, and Goldstone, before her meeting with Trump Jr.

Of course both the lawyer and the billionaire construction magnate are close to Putin's inner circle.

That means the FBI will also look into whether the Agalarovs were told by the Kremlin to facilitate the meeting, which would mean they turned to Goldstone, their conduit to the Trumps.

In the wake of the election, the Agalarovs kept in with the Trumps, with Emin being the conduit for the relationship.

Last act: This was the picture Goldstone pictured as the international scandal of the meeting with Don Jr unfolded

By his own account, given to Forbes magazine, he spent time with Trump in Trump Tower before he announced he was running for president.

The presidential run killed off the deal the Agalarovs were hoping for: side by side Trump and Agalarov Towers in Moscow.

Still Emin sent congratulations to Trump on his victory in November and received a handwritten note in return.

'He will give you extra attention if he likes you,' he told the magazine. 'He does not forget his friends.'

Meanwhile Emin's career since then has certainly risen, for which Goldstone will take at least some credit.

Earlier this year the Russian singer performed at a concert in St Petersburg with David Foster, the veteran music producer then embarked on an American tour covering Miami, New York and Chicago.

Managing Emin has also afforded Goldstone a chance to pursue his interest in travel to destinations including Brazil, and his native England.

He lives in a condo in Hoboken, New Jersey, just across the Hudson from New York. It is jointly owned with David Wilson, a close friend, and he commutes to an office in Chelsea, Manhattan when he is in the city.

He appears to be a member of Soho House, the elite media members' club, and is a friend on social media of gossip columnists and entertainment journalists in New York and London.

When his involvement in the Russian affair emerged he and Wilson were on a cruise from Venice to Athens, apparently largely unaware of what was happening.

In between posting pictures of himself with some of the young male staff he had met on board and on his travels, he posted a selfie in a shop, wearing the laurel leaves of a Roman emperor.

Now he finds himself at the center of the sort of political intrigue which could have been drawn from the courts of the Caesars themselves.

NOT HIS FIRST SELFIE: HOW PORTLY GOLDMAN PLAYED FRIEND TO THE STARS

Risky business: Rob Goldstone, 57, has documented his celeb encounters on his Facebook page over the years (above with Tom Cruise in 2012)

Bad: He has posted photos of himself with the likes of Michael Jackson (above), Tom Cruise and Tina Turner

Life on the D-list: Kathy Griffin posted a photo of herself with Goldstone in 2010 (above) to her social media accounts on Monday

Goldstone, 57, is not shy at all about sharing the details of his life, which include lavish trips and much time in the company of attractive young men.

And it also includes time in the company of celebs like Cruise, who Goldstone posted a photo with back in 2013, writing: 'A year ago I was in a kitchen with Tom Cruise.'

Unfortunately, he did not offer any further details or an explanation as to why he was in a kitchen with Cruise.

Then there was the photo of Jackson, which was posted on the anniversary of his death in 2014, with Goldstone commenting: '5 years ago Michael Jackson died... I still treasure My time spent with him in 1989 on BAD album.'

Lather that same year he also commented: 'I was walking to my hotel room tonight and I think I saw Michael Jackson pushing his room service trolley out of another room... could be wrong as I am basically demented!'

He even posted a photo of himself and President Trump in November of 2016, just after he won the election.

'I see I made it onto Russian TV news today with Emin and Donald Trump,' wrote Goldstone.

His client Emin, the attractive pop-star son of a Russian billionaire, is often featured on his social media accounts.

Check this out: Goldstone checked into Trump Tower on the same day that Don Jr. met with

Emin also appears to have been the person who brought Goldstone into the Trump family's orbit, with the 37-year-old performing at the Miss Universe pageants in 2013 in Moscow after his father hosted the pageant.

That year, Trump even appeared in a music video made by Emin to mark the pageant.

And in 2010, Goldstone also posed for a pic with noted Trump enemy Kathy griffin, which the comedienne posted on social media Monday.

'‪OMFG! Don't recall taking this 2010 pic w Russian intermediary Rob Goldstone,but I am wearing my DYNASTY hat preparing 4my interview w Mr. Mueller;)‬,' wrote Griffin.

'Someday, somehow, I will be able to share my crazy ass story of everything that has happened 'post pic'. The story will not stop unfolding... which for a comedian, it's actually a fantastic thing.'

The meeting, first reported by the New York Times on Saturday, took place two weeks before Trump officially won the Republican nomination.

The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, sat in.

Reince Priebus and President Trump himself were also at Trump Tower that day, but were not said to be at the meeting.

NI 1 – 0 New Zealand

Liam Boyce's first international goal was enough to give Northern Ireland a 1-0 win over New Zealand in their first ever meeting in Friday’s friendly clash at Windsor Park. The former Cliftonville man carved out the opportunity five minutes in to only his second start for NI, showing the finishing skills that saw him score 23 goals for Ross County this season.

Although Michael O’Neill’s men went on to dominate the match, especially in the first half, they had the post to thank for denying New Zealand a late equaliser. However, the manager will be pleased with many aspects of the game - especially Boyce, who was taken off at the break, having done enough to suggest he could figure in the key World Cup qualifier in Azerbijan next Saturday. Boyce delighted the home fans within minutes of the start when he collected a pass from Josh Magennis, juggled the ball inside his marker, and drove a low shot wide of the keeper for the goal.

It was almost 2-0 two minutes later, with Boyce setting up Magennis whose snapshot was touched round the post by Kiwi keeper Marinovic. New Zealand found it tough to get out of their own half as Northern Ireland thrived on the good start as they pressed for more goals. The Magennis and Boyce partnership caused constant problems for the visiting back four in what proved to be a comfortable first half for O’Neill’s side.

A minute from the break, a mistake by defender Smith saw Magennis latch onto the ball and break into the box, but his shot was blocked at the near post by Marinovic. Northern Ireland made three changes at the start of the second half with Steve Davis, Kyle Lafferty and Shane Ferguson replacing Chris Brunt, Matthew Lund and Boyce. NZ had their first real strike at goal on 47 minutes as Doyle struck the ball sweetly from distance, but his effort flew wide of the target.

The visitors offered more in the second half without really troubling the Northern Ireland goal. With 25 minutes to go, Northern Ireland almost added a second - with Magennis heading a great delivery by Ferguson just over the bar. For the first time in the game, the home side went to sleep on 70 minutes when Kosta Barbarouses nipped in, but his effort came back off the post. Shay McCartan came off the bench on 88 minutes to earn his first international cap as Northern Ireland finished on top to secure a well-earned victory.",http://www.itv.com/news/utv/2017-06-02/early-boyce-goal-sees-ni-beat-new-zealand/
5,azerbijan,"When the Seventh Caspian Air Cargo Summit got underway October 7-11 inside the Boulevard Hotel in Baku Azerbijan, Silk Way Group President Zaur Akhundov was front and center.

Mr. Akhundov oversees the fortunes of 23 aviation-related companies, including Silk Way Airlines.

Silk Way is the Azerbaijani state-run cargo airline with head offices and flight operations at Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku.

Silk Way operates a couple dozen aircraft, including B747-8Fs, Antonov, and Illushin.

Next year Silk Way will commence induction of the first of ten B737-Max aircraft ordered from Boeing.

We spoke to Silk Way Airlines USA, Inc. Commercial Director, Americas, Lisa Wallace.

Lisa revealed some big plans. Driven by a boundless energy, she’s building a legacy of service and pioneering from a powerful and growing air carrier based in Baku. All Cargo All The Time “Silk Way Group currently operates two cargo-only airlines, with both operating as a cohesive unit dedicated to seamless operations for our customers.

“Silk Way West Airlines, established in 2012, uses only western type aircraft with a fleet consisting of seven Boeing 747 freighters (five B747-8s and two B747-400s). Silk Way Airlines, on the other hand, operates eastern type aircraft such as the IL-76. Silk Way West Airlines provides the extended intercontinental reach and capacity of its B747 fleet, while Silk Way Airlines provides more of a regional reach using smaller aircraft.

“The combination of the two helps to create a large network with multiple solutions for customers,” Lisa declared. Adding AZAL “When you add Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL), the state-owned passenger airline, into the mix, the network and capacity become even larger.

“With AZAL recently announcing their fleet expansion through the purchase of four new B-787-8 Dreamliners, and with Silk Way’s efficient utilization of AZAL’s lower deck/belly cargo capacities, we are anticipating an additional boost in the growth of postal mail and freight traffic in the region. Even More Aircraft “In order to meet market demands and provide better connectivity to our customers, we have recently expanded our network and added more capacity with our fifth B747-8F, which was delivered just this past April.

“Silk Way significantly increased its global footprint by expanding our network on the main airfreight routes between Asia, Europe, and the U.S. while at the same time expanding regional routes into Central Asia and the Middle East.

“Additionally, we continue to invest in technology and building/improving our infrastructure.” Baku Cargo Handling Ups The Ante “Over the last few years we have built a state-of-the-art sorting and handling facilities in BCT, or Baku Cargo Terminal, to handle shipments of pharma, perishables, and e-commerce that require special handlings. The facility includes the 12,000-m2 Baku Logistics Center, the 8,000-m2 International Logistics Center, and a 2,000-m2 Postal Terminal; each is equipped with the latest shipment tracking technologies. As such, Baku, more specifically Silk Way, has become a preferred choice for many customers.” The Business Climate “Business for Silk Way in 2017 has grown significantly in both of our scheduled and charter services.

“In terms of scheduled services, we experienced a double-digit tonnage increase in Q1, and closed Q2 with higher fleet/capacity utilization.

“We accomplished this by increasing both network and frequencies to and from destinations such as Chicago, Amsterdam, Zhengzhou, and Hong Kong.

“Additionally, by continuing to focus on improving performance and adding more capacity, we enhanced our position in the European and Asian air cargo markets.

“The portfolio of customers in the charter segment has also grown considerably.

“When compared to 2016, the number of charter flight hours flown has also increased by double digits for both the IL-76s and the B-747s.

“The airline business is just fascinating, with ever-changing market dynamics and innovative technologies to serve customers’ evolving needs.” An Airline Career So Far “It’s challenging and rewarding at the same time, and there is no room for boredom and complacency working in the airline industry.

“My take is that airlines can certainly benefit from gender diversity in senior management positions.

“I think the role of women in the airline industry has been constantly improving, especially on the passenger side. On the cargo side, it has been encouraging as well, as we see more women participating in leadership roles.

“I was an English major at college in China, and came to the U.S. and completed my masters in Computer Information Systems and Marketing.

“I’m not sure what I would be doing were I not in the airline business. I could be in the hospitality industry or running my own authentic Chinese restaurant serving dumplings!” Ahead For Silk Way “As an airline, we help facilitate trade growth and trade relations between countries and regions, and I can say that we as a company are doing all that we can to support trade developments.

“Currently we are offering near-daily connections into Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia out of Baku.

“The Russia market specifically has been served well by our partner airline, Sky Gates Cargo Airlines, and our close cooperation with them.” Consignments Abounding “The type of goods we are moving hasn’t shifted too much from our traditional main deck cargo, such as odd-sized cargo, Oil & Gas, etc.

“These industry sectors have contributed a large portion of our tonnage.

“Having said that, however, we’ve seen significant increases in other types of general and project cargos.

“We have also experienced phenomenal growth in e-commerce and specialized cargo such as pharmaceuticals and perishables.

“By being able to offer customers special handling and various cold chain management options, we have really started to see the investments we’ve made in our infrastructure to pay off.”

To read Hinostroza's acceptance speech, click here.

As a leading television reporter and host in her native Ecuador, Janet Hinostroza has investigated human and arms trafficking, the Ecuadoran police, and extrajudicial killings. She is also a prime target in the government's ongoing assault on free expression.

Following early work on Ecuadoran and Colombian television, Hinostroza has anchored the investigative news show ""30 Plus"" for the past decade and hosted the news program ""La Mañana de 24 Horas,"" both on the private Ecuadoran television channel Teleamazonas. Hinostroza also hosts a radio program on 98.1 FM Mundo and is the local correspondent for Univision, while managing a production company specializing in journalistic programming and audiovisual products.

In 2012, Hinostroza was forced to take a leave of absence from her morning news program following anonymous phone calls threatening her safety. Hinostroza had recently investigated a scandal involving a loan by a state-owned bank to a businessman who defaulted. Her reporting uncovered irregularities in the loan and connected the businessman to the then-head of Ecuador's central bank, who was President Rafael Correa's cousin.

The Ecuadoran government's hostility towards Teleamazonas dates to 2009, when the network was ordered off the air after it covered the effects of natural gas exploration on the local fishing industry. The persecution escalated in 2011, when Hinostroza reported that a woman had been charged with disrespecting Correa and the government ordered Teleamazonas to pre-empt 10 minutes of her program with a rebuttal from an official spokesman. Her show has been consistently pre-empted to transmit official rebuttals, and this year Correa requested that prosecutors investigate the network for its alleged links to a 2010 police rebellion.

Hinostroza's plight is a microcosm for the hundreds of occasions when the administration has taken on individual media outlets engaged in critical reporting with obligatory presidential addresses known as cadenas. Although traditionally used to deliver information in times of crisis, cadenas have instead become a forum for political confrontation--a misuse of Ecuador's broadcast law.

Ecuadoran journalists must contend with official censorship and harassment, including the use of defamation laws to silence critics, smear campaigns to discredit them, and legislation to regulate news content and media ownership, a CPJ investigation has found.

7,azerbijan,"Special to the Armenian Weekly

Ever since the 1994 ceasefire brought a semblance of peace to Artsakh, its people have made great strides in democratic self-governance and in rebuilding and improving the economic and social infrastructure wantonly destroyed by Azerbaijan during the Karabagh War. During these difficult years the people have maintained a collective esprit and energy that confounds the Azeri leadership.

The ultimate concern, whether we live in Artsakh or beyond, is the future viability of this historic Armenian land liberated through the heroic efforts of its people. There are several questions that must be affirmatively answered: Would Artsakh (and Armenia) be able to withstand renewed hostilities by Azerbaijan? Can Artsakh’s interests be protected through negotiations? Does Artsakh have the resources to develop a robust economy, not only for its present population, but as a future frontier beckoning Diasporan Armenians wishing to return home?

Confronting renewed hostilities



Any number of reasons would—or should—deter Azerbaijan from renewing hostilities; if they did not exist, President Ilham Aliyev would have already exercised his oft-threatened military option. Yet, there is always the possibility that internal pressures or his outsized ego could override prudent judgment. This analysis will only consider the military strategy that Azerbaijan is likely to adopt if it were to resume hostilities, and the difficulties that a tactical implementation of that strategy would involve. Given these apparent difficulties, one might question why the strategy would even be considered. It is based primarily on the reality that the international community, and especially the neighboring countries, would not tolerate a protracted war. This reality requires a strategy that would (1) seek to occupy strategic objectives within a window of opportunity of from 12-15 days; (2) seek to breach the heavily fortified frontier, preferably at both Agdam and Fizuli, within the first 48-72 hours; (3) engage the defenders along the entire front (the Northern, Central, and Southern Sectors); and (4) require the deployment of all 3 army corps, or significant elements thereof, currently positioned along the Armenian-Artsakh border from Georgia to Iran.

Presently Azerbaijan has five army corps in the field. The first Army Corps is concentrated in the vicinity of Ganja. It is responsible for the Northern Sector and the Armenian frontier. The third is stationed in the vicinity of Barda (Central Sector), and the second in the vicinity of Agdzhabedi/ Beylagan (Southern Sector). The second also has responsibility for the Iranian frontier. The fourth Army Corps is stationed in the capital district of Baku, and the fifth is deployed in Nakhitchevan.

Yusif Agayev, an Azeri military expert who fought in the Karabagh War, doesn’t believe “…the society of my country is ready for war. I think it would be a month or two. That is the amount of time the armed forces could fight for. If it drags on longer, then it will be a war that society will have to participate in, not just the army.” It is not likely that Azerbaijan will have the month or two that Agayev suggests. A window of opportunity of about 12-15 days would be more likely. That is why the first 48-72 hours is so critical. Within minutes of the first shot being fired there would be an international demand for a ceasefire led by Russia, Iran, Georgia, and possibly Turkey supported by Western Europe and the United States (covertly backed by international oil interests). Given the observable signs of an Azeri offensive build-up, these nations would not wait for the first shot to be fired before diplomatic pressure is applied. Although the conflict occupies a limited geographic area, its ramifications—the ‘unintended consequences’—could easily destabilize the entire region. Russia, Iran, Georgia, and Turkey each have ethnic minorities with long-standing socio-economic and political grievances who seek either independence or effective local autonomy. This conflict could be the spark that ignites this historic geographic tinderbox.

Since Azerbaijan realizes a protracted war is not viable, the strategy is to engage the Armenian defenders along the entire frontier. This can only be accomplished by simultaneously committing elements of the three army corps responsible for monitoring the Artsakh border. Given this strategy, the obvious objectives would be Agdam and Fizuli. To support these two major offensives, units of the second and third corps would engage the Armenian defenders in such tactical movements as holding actions to deny the redeployment of Armenian units to critical sectors of the front; diversionary maneuvers that seek to mislead or confuse the defenders; and diversionary attacks that would seek to relieve the pressure on the main forces attacking Agdam and Fizuli.

Diversionary attacks from Tartar toward Mardakert would relieve the pressure on the Agdam forces as well as protect their northern or right flank. At the same time a diversionary attack toward Martuni by elements of the second Army Corps would assist the main force attacking Fizuli and protect their eastern or right flank. The first Army Corps at Ganja would most likely engage in diversionary maneuvers and hold actions along the mountainous Northern Sector. Depending on the resistance encountered, the Azeris could commit elements of the first to a full-scale diversionary attack from Shahumian toward Mardakert.

The former United States ambassador to Azerbaijan, Matthew Bryza, has suggested that “the Azeris can’t retake Artsakh now. They are militarily incapable of doing it.” He further suggested that he “…didn’t think they could dislodge the Armenian forces from the high ground. Wayne Merry, a Senior Fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council, agrees, saying that “a key factor is the topography, the extent to which Nagorno-Karabagh has created defenses in depth. Progress would come at a high cost.”

In addition to controlling the high ground, the Armenian defenders have had nearly 20 years to develop fortifications in depth, as well as construct obstacles that would impede and channel men and mechanized equipment into prepared fields of fire. To achieve the quick breakthrough required, the Azeris would seek to overwhelm the defenders by deploying a numerically superior concentration of infantry and mechanized units. Against heavily fortified positions a disproportionate ratio of perhaps four to five Azeri casualties to one Armenian casualty could be expected. These excessive battlefield losses would have a demoralizing impact on the Azeri units, keeping in mind that possibly 7 out of 10 men are either 12- or 18-month conscripts in addition to reservists who might be called-up to augment the professional army. Loss of morale would have a debilitating impact on unit effectiveness, which would contribute to an increased casualty count. Every tactical plan is dependent on an integrated hierarchy of units from squad, platoon, on up, with each unit supporting the mission of the next higher command, which could be a reinforced company or a brigade. All units involved must operate as one cohesive force with one overriding objective to have any chance of success.

Engaging the Armenians along the entire front is sound strategy given the realities of the situation, but it is also a catch-22 situation. A phased deployment of units would favor the defenders, while committing significant elements of its three army corps simultaneously in a tactical bid to overwhelm them before an expected ceasefire can be enforced is no guarantee of success, and would most likely result in unacceptable losses in men and equipment. It is highly unlikely that the civilian population (if aware of the losses) or the field commanders (senior officers) who must follow orders would tolerate such losses.

The prize Azeri objective would be Agdam. To the east of Agdam is the Kura River floodplain, part of which is below sea level (the Kura River empties into the Caspian Sea, which is about 90 feet below sea level). From this floodplain the elevation rises westward in a step-like fashion to the high plains just west of Agdam (which is about 1,200 feet above sea level) that give way to the hillier terrain toward Stepanakert. If Agdam is occupied, it would allow the Azeri forces to spill out onto this plain, thereby facilitating the increased deployment of mechanized equipment such as tanks, armored troop carriers, self-propelled artillery, and rocket launchers for a final push toward Stepanakert and Shushi, with a smaller force moving south to join the attack on Martuni.

To the south, a second major offensive would be underway toward Fizuli. A diversionary attack on Martuni would seek to ease the pressure on the Fizuli force as well as protect its eastern or right flank. Holding actions at Hadrut would protect the western or left flank of the Fizuli force. If Fizuli were to be occupied, the main force would most likely split with the larger force wheeling eastward toward Martuni. Should this happen, the Martuni defenders would face a three-pronged enveloping maneuver that would either force them to fall back or be cut off from the main Armenian forces (assuming the Azeri offensive could succeed).

The second smaller force would augment the Azeri units engaged at Hadrut. If Martuni were occupied, the combined Azeri forces would then move toward Shushi/Stepanakert from the southeast to support the Agdam forces attacking from the northeast. The Azeri Hadrut units would be given the mission to protect the western or left flank of this final thrust toward Artsakh’s core area.

While this might be the essence of the Azeri strategy, its success is far from assured; the deterrents are many. First and foremost, this analysis does not consider the defensive and offensive capabilities of the Armenian forces, who have played out the various strategies the Azeris might adopt. An instant problem for the Azeris is the recognition by unbiased observers that the Armenian military force is much better prepared. Also it is unlikely that the Azeri soldier has the emotional and psychological stamina or determination of the Armenian soldier, who is prepared to fight for his family, his land, his children’s future, and for his right to live as an Armenian. What reasons would the Azeri soldier have to sacrifice his life in a war he might neither accept nor understand?

It is the expected immediate international call for a ceasefire that would require Azerbaijan’s massive deployment of men and equipment in a military gamble that seeks to overwhelm the defenders and breach their fortifications. It is this tactical decision that could result in extremely high battlefield losses against a determined, entrenched defensive force. It is not possible for Azerbaijan to gain any advantage from a surprise attack because the intelligence gathering technology available to the Armenian military allows for the real-time gathering of information. This intelligence effort is likely aided by Russian input and, during a conflict, possibly by covert Iranian input.

Every strategic target within Azerbaijan is within the effective retaliatory capability of the Armenian defenders. Pre-selected targets would be engaged immediately, some of which may have a devastating impact on Azerbaijan’s war effort. So much emphasis has been placed on the publicized expansion of its army that it is accepted as doctrine that numerical superiority in men, which is not the same as the principle of force concentration (achieving numerical superiority at a given time at a given place), is the key element on the battlefield. It is not! The Armenian defenders have the ability to achieve force concentration to gain a tactical advantage at any sector of the front based on their shorter interior lines of communication that facilitate the rapid deployment of troops and equipment. In addition, a defending force occupying heavily fortified positions may have a ratio of three- or four- to one advantage over the attacking forces: The Azeri staging areas where units are readied for movement to the front; their approaches to the line of contact; as well as their supply and resupply routes, are all vulnerable to effective Armenian counter-measures.

Adding to the deterrents is the sophisticated level of planning, coordination, and execution required and the real-time evaluation and response to evolving situations at the fronts that may require immediate tactical changes; the augmentation or redeployment of units; resupply; and the evacuation of battlefield casualties. It is highly problematic if the Azeri military command has this capability at the level required. Some of the officers and a smaller number of non-commissioned officers (NCO) may be veterans of the Karabagh War. Assuming the publicized expansion of the army is accurate, most of the junior officers (captain and below) who fill the majority of the combat slots in any unit, as well as the NCO’s, may well be the weak link in the Azeri command structure in terms of training, leadership, and indoctrination. A resumption of hostilities is not likely to provide President Aliyev the solution he seeks.

Can negotiations protect Artsakh’s interests?

The principles advanced by the Minsk Group (represented by Russia, France, and the United States) to guide the negotiations, no matter how nuanced they have been over time, continually stress (1) the inviolability of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity and (2) that when and how Artsakh’s final status is determined, it will be no better than limited autonomy under Azerbaijan’s jurisdiction. This raises an important question: If Artsakh had the legal right to declare its independence under the principles of remedial cessation or self-determination, or under the laws of the soviet constitution, the negotiators, including the Artsakh representatives, should be discussing the timing of Artsakh’s recognition; indemnification for displaced people/refugees (both Armenian and Azeri); its final boundaries; and the status of Shahumian, and the occupied border areas of Mardakert and Martuni. It may be difficult to accept, but some adjustments in the area to be included in Artsakh may have to be considered. An offer giving Azeris married to Armenians (possibly including their extended families) the right of return to Artsakh might also be considered.

Azerbaijan continues to claim that its territorial integrity is being violated by Armenia. This is a specious argument ostensibly supported by the Minsk Group. Azerbaijan is purposely misinterpreting Principle 4 under Chapter 2, Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, which prevents a state from threatening the territorial integrity of a neighboring state. It is the Artsakh Armenians who threatened the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan by having legally declared their independence. However, Principle 4 does not apply to Artsakh. Armenia’s intervention was limited to providing humanitarian and military assistance to protect a beleaguered population from the indiscriminate use of military force by the Azeris. The present Armenian presence in Artsakh represents a stabilizing influence that facilitates the recovery effort and a preventive measure against a renewal of hostilities.

Economic development

Artsakh’s natural resource base is more than adequate to support at least 10 times its present population of approximately 140,000. However, several interrelated factors—a reverse domino effect—represent serious obstacles that must be addressed before a robust economy can develop. The most obvious are (1) Artsakh’s tenuous political status, which (2) inhibits foreign investment, which (3) discourages in-migration.

Tenuous political status

Artsakh declared its independence in 1991 and has, since the 1994 ceasefire, met all of the “unofficial” requirements for de jure recognition. (Unfortunately, recognition is a highly subjective political decision.) Until recognition is granted, it is vital that Artsakh continue to invite foreign government leaders, as it did recently with Uruguayan parliamentarians. While recognition will not come solely or immediately from these visits, they will lay the groundwork as well as the perception that recognition is highly likely to occur. It is an important first step (which Stepanakert already recognizes) if investment is to be encouraged. Dependence on the level of aid presently received is not adequate to stimulate a robust economy that can independently sustain Artsakh. However, this aid has made significant improvements in basic infrastructure that has improved the quality of life for the people—the foundation upon which Artsakh’s future will be built.

To facilitate this process Artsakh must continue to expand its public relations effort through the various political, humanitarian, and philanthropic organizations that are already committed to its cause. Without getting into the political aspects of the Artsakh issue, its long-term viability should represent the most significant issue on the Armenian national agenda. The more the Armenian Diaspora know about Artsakh—its achievements and potential—the greater its response to aid in Artsakh’s development.

Measured population increase

Increasing the population should go hand-in-hand with economic development. However what is required and doable is a measured increase in population as a means to meet political and economic needs. Politically it is difficult to claim “empty” lands however justified that claim may be when the lands are not reasonably integrated with the core area. We should have learned from the Turkish inspired genocide that emptied historic western Armenia of our people to weaken if not eliminate potential territorial claims by Armenia. A program of selective immigration would seek to meet the political and economic objectives identified by a government master plan for strategic resettlement. (See “The Strategic Resettlement of Artsakh,” The Armenian Weekly, February 19, 2011) Stepanakert must be prepared to effectively assist these newcomers to Artsakh. It cannot be expected that these 21st century Armenians are pioneers able or willing to “tame” the wilderness. That type of settlement program is a prescription for disaster.

As Stepanakert increases its connections with various organizations and institutions beyond its borders; as it cultivates relations with foreign governments; and as the world community (including our Diaspora) are given reasons to support Artsakh, an aura of inevitability with respect to recognition will encourage greater interest from foreign investors, including Armenians. Although Artsakh has already benefited from visionary diasporan entrepreneurs, de jure recognition is essential to open the floodgate for foreign investment

Renewable energy sources

Present available data for Nagorno-Karabagh indicate a significant potential for the development of renewable energy. This is important given the absence of carboniferous energy resources. Several sites in the vicinity of Jermajur and Vaghuhas in the north and in the Stepanakert-Shushi region have been identified as “most appropriate” for constructing wind turbines to generate electric power. Other secondary sites exist, as well as sites in Kashatagh that have yet to be fully evaluated.

The region receives an average of about 23 inches of precipitation annually which is sufficient for agriculture supplemented by irrigation if or when necessary. Precipitation generally increases from the south/southeast toward the higher elevations to the north/northwest. In the Kashatagh Region precipitation increases north toward the Eastern Sevan/Mrav Mountains. Surface flow and the many deep narrow valleys provide sites that may be used to construct dams for water storage, hydroelectric generation and irrigation as well as preventing floods from the annual Spring snow melt from the higher elevations that dominate the north and northwestern portions of Artsakh. The average precipitation would suggest a greater proportion of days with less than one/quarter of the sky covered by clouds. This would result in more hours of daily sunlight which would facilitate the development of solar power. Renewable energy would be a boon for the remote villages which could draw upon locally produced energy. In addition Artsakh’s balance of payments situation would benefit by eliminating or reducing payments for energy imports.

Potential sectors of the economy

Artsakh’s farmers should be able to produce a wide variety of field and tree crops (including viti culture). Some specialized products would include processed and comb honey, a variety of berries, nuts, and fresh-cut flowers. Natural and upgraded pastures could support commercial dairy farming including poultry and egg production, cattle and sheep rearing and hog raising. In addition, the by-products associated with each animal are able to support a variety of economic activities. A recent trade report cited the shortage of pork production in China (a potential market). Given present technology, a hog carcass in Artsakh can be deboned and cut-up to reduce its weight and bulk, flash frozen, vacuumed sealed in ‘cryovac’ and boxed to be economically air lifted to a foreign market. Historically the region was home to the Karabagh horse. No reason why rearing horses could not be reintroduced on a much larger scale.

Given the emphasis on the agricultural sector the processing industry could be an important source for exports. In North America there are significant nodes of Armenian population–Boston, New York, Philadelphia, DC, Los Angeles, Montreal, and Toronto–that could be developed as markets for some of Artsakh’s products including wine, vodka, brandy, bottled water and beer. This would require appropriate advertising and maintaining trade representatives possibly in New York and Los Angeles. These markets could also serve as conduits to introduce Artsakh’s products to a wider geographic area and a larger population. If the Stepanakert International Airport could become operational, it would be a significant political and economic triumph that would give Artsakh the potential for direct links to the world. Is it no wonder that Azerbaijan is so vehement in its opposition.

Artsakh’s forests could support an important domestic construction materials industry which would include such products as dimension lumber and timbers, composition board, specialty wood products, and roofing materials as well as furniture manufacturing. This could be augmented by quarrying for building stone, sand and gravel, limestone for cement, and the manufacturing of ceramics and glass. Given its resource base and an educated workforce, Artsakh has many options to pursue in developing a viable economy including an expansion of its incipient information technology industry.

Finally, Artsakh’s history, its ancient structures, archeological sites, breath-taking scenery, and mineral springs are ideal for tourism. Not to be overlooked are the gracious, friendly people and the cuisine. Tourism is a means for visitors, diasporan Armenians included, to become acquainted with the people and their country. Tourism is a catalyst that generates the need for better roads, transport facilities, lodgings, publications, a multitude of support services, a wide range of goods to meet the needs of the tourists, and most importantly, occupational opportunities. Although tourism does not generate high paying jobs, it does provide valuable experiences for first time employees to learn various skills as a way to move up the employment ladder. It is also a means to improve the balance of payments situation.

Several years ago I wrote an article entitled, “Artsakh: The Key to Armenia’s Political and Economic Future” (The Armenian Weekly, January 2010 Special Magazine Issue). Three years later I am even more bullish on Artsakh’s prospects after having witnessed the tremendous progress its people have made. Artsakh is a land of unlimited opportunity that can and will become our nation’s future frontier beckoning Armenians to return home to participate in rebuilding an ancient land that has been reborn.",https://armenianweekly.com/2014/01/05/artsakhs-prospects-for-the-future/

9,azerbijan,"Amidst the firestorm of U.S.-Russia recriminations and closings of diplomatic facilities this past September, and on the heels of an intense, year-long American campaign to demonize all things Russian, a project calling itself the Simone Weil Center for Political Philosophy organized a conference in Moscow. Our gathering took place in the offices of the Institute for Socio-Economic and Political Research (ISEPR), a Moscow-based think tank. Attendees included the Russian philosopher, Boris Mezhuev of Moscow State University and ISEPR; Mikhail Remizov, president of the Institute for National Strategy, a think tank; Leonid Polyakov, ISEPR; Dmitri Drobnitsky, a leading political affairs commentator for the journal Vzglyad; Egor Kholmogorov, a well-known essayist and presenter on Tsargrad, a religious/nationalist Russian television station; and several other prominent Russian scholars.

The goal of the conference, reflecting the Simone Weil Center’s general mission, was to explore the political questions separating Russia and the West and thus to seek ways of getting beyond the present dead end. There were about 15 of us in attendance, both Russians and Westerners. The Russian academics, journalists, and think tankers were generally conservative in orientation. The Western delegation, which included university professors, journalists, and writers from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, was more mixed in ideological terms. Several would be comfortable being designated as conservative, while others would call themselves “post-liberals” or perhaps “liberal realists.”

We began our talk with a question: why has reason disappeared from the relationship between Russia and members of the Atlantic Alliance? Conversation is a form of human interaction where the force of reason, as opposed to force of arms, holds sway. But today the words of mainstream politicians and pundits rarely seem to serve the purposes of conversation. Hostility resides just below the surface.

Reason’s disappearance appears perplexing when one considers that both Washington and Moscow appeal to a rules-based world order. But Professor of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa Paul Robinson explained at the conference that the two nations have entirely different interpretations of what the rules are and what they’re meant to achieve. For Russia, said Robinson, rules are symmetrical. They apply in the same way to all sides in a conflict. For the United States, the application of rules is asymmetrical, determined by whether a given side is deemed just or unjust.

This dichotomy, Robinson argued, stems from recent innovations in what is known as “just war theory.” Traditionally, just war theory has accepted that, whoever is at fault (or more at fault) for starting a given conflict, the rules of actually waging it must be the same for every participant. The reasons are practical: unless the rules apply to all, they will be disregarded by all. The United States, said Robinson, now effectively rejects such symmetry. In this view, rules apply mostly to the just. As criminals being chased by the police must surrender and accept arrest, soldiers on the wrong side of a war must yield to those who hold the moral high ground.

But who gets to define what is just? And what does justice mean? For the United States and its closest allies, the liberal states get to decide, precisely because the concept of justice is wrapped up primarily in the idea of “respecting individual human rights,” as developed over the course of history in the West. Based on this theory, civilian casualties incurred during the U.S. liberation of Mosul or Raqqa were regrettable but justified, whereas civilian casualties incurred during the Russia-backed liberation of Aleppo were morally unacceptable. As Russia and Syria don’t share the United States’ understanding of human rights, neither, from the U.S. perspective, can be “minimally just.”

In short, the United States and Russia are both rational, but, in classic Alasdair MacIntyre fashion, are operating according to differing rationalities. Is there some way to bridge the difference? It seems unlikely that the United States will abandon its liberal logic and equally unlikely that Russia will yield its own more traditional realism, to say nothing of its non-individualistic civic outlook.

Thanks to Robinson’s remarks, the political problem took on a starkly clear philosophical form, which helped frame the rest of the conversation.

Perhaps reconciliation between Western liberalism and Russian realism cannot be achieved, and therefore shouldn’t even be attempted. That, to summarize it perhaps too simply, is the gist of the civilizational realism proposal put forth by Boris Mezhuev. He does not argue that conflict between civilizations is inevitable, though he acknowledges that differences on matters of principle go to the essence of their relations. But Mezhuev believes that only by recognizing the depth of such differences can we withdraw from competition and, at last, enjoy a stable live-and-let-live accommodation.

Mezhuev acknowledges that Russia certainly has cultural affinities with Europe and other states of the Atlantic bloc. But no one argues that those affinities are definitive. The key to achieving a modus vivendi, in Mezhuev’s view, is overcoming the misplaced moralism that insists on recognizing one way of life as universally and exclusively the most humane. Is it more human, more moral, to be European as opposed to being Russian? No, these are simply two different, existential choices. Ukraine has every right to be in the West if it so wishes. But it also has a right not to. Both sides in Ukraine’s Civil War have the “right” to be either with the West or not.

To drive home his point, Mezhuev cited a recent New Yorker article by Adam Gopnik, “We Could Have Been Canada.” In reference to the U.S. Revolutionary War, Gopnik argued that the choice for England was no more, and also no less, moral than the choice for independence. Who can seriously maintain, Mezhuev and Gopnik ask, that those Americans who, in 1775, preferred to stay with England were morally evil? In such a context, the concept of morality clarifies precisely nothing.

On the other hand, Mezhuev acknowledged, if avoiding moralism is crucial to creating a stable international order, doing so raises other problems. How, notably, can we avoid slipping into some sort of Nietzschean relativism or amoralism in international affairs? Isn’t something universal still needed, all the same? No side wants to sit by passively during another Rwandan genocide, after all. But what would that something be, if it is not human rights?

Perhaps it’s a sign that any political order has gone off the rails when Carl Schmitt starts sounding like a moderate. But in his Concept of the Political the famous German jurist and political philosopher writes “To confiscate the word humanity, to invoke and monopolize such a term probably has incalculable effects, such as denying the enemy the quality of being human … a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme inhumanity.” In this light what Robinson and Mezhuev together seem to be saying is that the absolute moralization of political differences, including by reference to the concept of “human rights,” can have the unintended consequence of making human conflict open-ended, limitless both in extent and intensity, and capable of being overcome only through the total surrender of one party. Are we sure that we really wish to hold relations with Moscow hostage to that logic? Are we even aware that that is what we’re doing?

A human rights-based logic may work well enough within a liberal civilization of the American or Western European sort. But the reflections of Schmitt reinforced a consensus that emerged around the conversation table in Moscow. Whether intentional or not, the practical effect of such a human rights-based order is to give the United States a free hand to use force without limit wherever it sees fit. What’s more, by assuming the role of arbiter of human rights, able to update at will the definition of what constitutes a right, the United States can keep competing powers off center and permanently in the international moral doghouse.

Of course, in reality such an American-led order may appear no worse than various alternatives, such as the global dominance of a particular order that could be even worse; or constant warfare, whether cold or hot, between and among competing civilizational “blocs,” which is the anti-utopian promise of aggressive modern realists. Is anything better on offer?

One Russian answer is civilizational realism: effectively letting the West be the West and Russia be Russia. It recognizes that Russia and the West have in the years since the end of the Cold War embarked on developing their societies on two separate orders and accepts that pragmatic cooperation between them is better than an attempt by either party to impose its social or political order on the other.

For example, Mikhail Remizov describes Western Europe as having left behind its roots in Christianity as well as modernity. Its post-modern, post-national project is oriented toward rights, individuals, and emancipation. The Russian state, he argues, should not have, and does not have, any pretensions to challenging that project. As he put it in an exchange with Robinson, “I see Russia not as a superpower, like in Soviet times, which opposes the Western world and gathers together its own world, but rather as a rebel province of the global empire.” The global empire here refers, of course, to the American-led liberal order. The question is: how far can this empire actually tolerate such renegade provinces?

The answer might have to do with the extent of these renegade provinces’ ambitions and the degree of threat they pose to the ideological unity of the empire’s core territories—that is, in our time, the Euro-Atlantic world and its unifying creed of progressive, liberal globalism (the “New Atlanticism,” in the terminology of the University of Kent’s Richard Sakwa). Given this question as applied to today’s world, it was perhaps significant that, in Moscow, Egor Kholmogorov emphasized that Russia’s conservative foreign policy intellectuals are essentially isolationist, or at any rate inward-looking. This relates, he said, specifically to such leading lights as the late Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Vadim Tsymburski. Even the much-demonized Alexander Dugin, the far-right and intensely nationalist Russian advocate, is “essentially” isolationist, said Kholmogorov, adding that, while Dugin’s concept of land powers vs. sea powers “may be absurd” in various respects, even here he emphasizes that hard borders between them should be respected.

This is what we heard in Moscow. The question now in Washington, it seems, is how far such statements can be taken at their word. After all, how is one to answer the complaint that such statements are necessarily untrustworthy? For the hard-nosed realist, the urge to expand one’s sphere of influence is predicated not on philosophical conviction (whether feigned or sincere), but on the reality of international anarchy.

But maybe this is to frame the problem the wrong way. As James Carden, foreign policy writer for The Nation, elegantly argued in a paper delivered at the conference in his absence, ours is not the first generation in the history of the world to have navigated an international disagreement about founding political principles. Others have done so and managed to maintain a relative peace and stability in the world. Isn’t this after all the essence of diplomacy?

Perhaps. But as Carden explained, America’s attitude toward Russia has long since ceased to be motivated by a desire for regulating differences diplomatically. Instead, he argues, Washington manifests toward Russia “a hostility borne of a frustrated project of liberal cultural imperialism.”

Carden is not personally opposed to American identity politics. Indeed, he is “not in the slightest bit perturbed by the decision the U.S. Supreme Court came to in Obergefell v. Hodges— the gay marriage decision.” On the domestic level, he believes identity politics has led to some estimable gains for underrepresented communities in the United States. What worries him, though, is that, by choosing to carry over the claims of identity politics into relations with the rest of the world, and particularly with Russia, the United States has allowed “social justice impulses” to undermine any responsible and rational foreign policy.

Demonizing Russia for violating the norms of American identity politics first emerged as a tactic during the Obama years, well before the events in Kiev’s Maidan Square. Regime change enthusiasts noticed that identity politics could become for them a useful tool. That’s when U.S. media and other elites began making cause célèbres out of every Russian failure to order its domestic affairs in ways pleasing to American media and foreign policy elites. The Pussy Riot case was only the most noticeable.

Since then the range of sins attributed to Russia and its leaders has expanded exponentially, transforming Vladimir Putin into the global leader of the extreme right. But of what relevance is this to the formulation of U.S. foreign policy? Carden invoked the scholar-diplomat George F. Kennan, who once observed that the “moral obligations of governments are not the same as those of the individual.” He decried “the histrionics of moralism,” by which he meant “the projection of attitudes, poses, and rhetoric that cause us to appear noble and altruistic in the mirror of our own vanity but lack substance when related to the realities of international life.”

This was a cue for Carden to find within the liberal tradition itself an alternative to this “culture war liberalism.” Notably, Princeton scholar Jan-Werner Muller has defined a healthy school of Cold War liberalism, exemplified by among others Isaiah Berlin and Raymond Aron, for whom the primary concern was avoiding the worst rather than achieving the best. Unlike today’s identity politics as applied to foreign relations, this kind of “Cold War” liberalism is fearful of ambitious programs and utopian projects, resting on a caution that contrasts favorably, Carden concluded, with “the smug certitudes of our new Culture War liberals.”

This resonates with a key concept for Simone Weil, one she linked closely with the Christian idea of limit. For Weil, Greek thought and Christian thought were alike in their understanding of the centrality of limit, its profound symbolic importance, summarized for the Greeks by the word “hubris” and by the Christians in the word “pride.” An older, less positivist, more classically trained school of realists were likewise deeply familiar with this concept of limit, as well as its opposite—hubris or pride.

Is the problem, then, for Western diplomacy (such as it is) to be found far upstream of its immediate disagreements with Russia—in the prior collapse (some might say deliberate destruction) of the authority of precisely those sources of classical and Christian wisdom that once warned the executors of U.S. foreign policy off the limitless ambitions that are so intimate a part of the permanent revolution of identity politics?

As Nicolai Petro, professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island, observed, even among so-called “conservatives,” U.S. foreign policy is conservative only in a nominal sense. To Petro, conservative foreign policy must be guided by a realism that would abandon the imposition of Western standards of secularism and ideological moralism everywhere. But what if, as Petro asks, “moralism” is simply who we are in the West now? The solution, Petro suggests, might be in expanding the West’s own self-identity. We have come to view globalization as a synonym of Westernization. We have to think our way out of this habit—to become broader, more capable of incorporating insights from the rest of the world.

This is almost certainly the right approach. But it doesn’t take much to imagine how difficult this will be. For the better part of the last four decades, liberalism has been assumed across the board as the essential solution to any given policy question in the West. What we see in the failure of our relations with Russia, however, is that when it comes to organizing peaceable relations between states, liberalism is actually part of the problem.

This was the point made by Richard Sakwa in his wide-ranging critique of what he memorably calls liberal “monism.” Despite its claims to “open-ness,” liberalism in its late modern Western form becomes self-contained to the point of closure. Allied with such power constructs as the “liberal world order,” globalization (a word that came into common usage only after the fall of the Soviet Union) tends towards the homogenization of political space and the radical constriction of pluralism.

An alternative to this homogenizing (and essentially imperial) political logic can be found, Sakwa believes, in the dialogical approach associated with the work of the Russian Dostoevsky critic and theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. Dostoevsky’s characters change over time, often unpredictably, precisely through conversations with one another. They model—and this is the relevant political lesson for the West today—a type of conversation where both sides speak and listen and learn.

Whereas the liberal globalization model is axiomatic and axiological (in the sense that it already knows the answers), the dialogical approach is transcendent in the sense of being oriented to a horizon that is never fully determined in advance nor fully definable. That horizon, in the case of Russia, is of a spiritual, sacred order.

Mezhuev returned to this theme in a second contribution. Russia, he says, shares with the United States and the West the idea of having a “special status,” a special future. With the Russian philosophers Nikolai Berdyaev and Vladimir Solovyov, Mezhuev believes there is such a thing as the Russian idea, which is first and foremost the Christian idea. The literature inspired by this offers us a potential way out of the current impasse. This leads, once again, to Dostoevsky, whose The Brothers Karamazov, says Mezhuev, was the last openly Orthodox Christian novel, in Russian classical literature, until the appearance of Boris Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago in 1957. But, like Simone Weil, Pasternak could not accept the Old Testament because it introduces the idea of the “chosen.” For Mezhuev, chosen-ness in the Biblical sense must be accepted as a mystery, but a civilization that declares itself “chosen” veers necessarily toward amoralism.

For that reason, Mezhuev says his own Civilizational Realism should not be mistaken as a fig leaf for civilizational chauvinism. On the contrary, inspired by the works of the Russian classicist and geopolitician Vadim Tsymburski, for whom hubris was a key concept, it places particular emphasis on the idea of limits. Because it is a Christian civilization, Russia must accept with humility that the world contains varied civilizations. Russian civilization might possess, providentially, a special relationship with what it at least takes as universal truths. But it is not for Moscow to impose this on an unwilling world. Reciprocally extending this principle to the West’s relationship to liberalism, says Mezhuev, is our only hope of escaping the looming “new Cold War.”

At this point Remizov broadened the argument to principles of political organization. For him also, Christianity is central to Russia’s self-understanding. It is not some sort of cultural decoration. But Russia’s disagreement with the West is driven just as much by divergent relationships to modernity, in particular the West’s increasing rejection of the national form that has been normative in Western politics since at least the French Revolution. Whereas the West, being postmodern and liberal, has moved away from the idea of the nation, Russia is now entering into modernity in the classical sense: its national self-understanding is achieved not by means of the social contract but through a grasp of having a common inheritance. This latter process is inherently conservative inasmuch as it places at the center not human rights, which pertains to individuals, but the common inheritance, which pertain to citizens of a shared republic. This common inheritance requires that we, as members of the nation/community, cooperate with one another, says Remizov. The idea of empire, for Remizov, counteracts the very possibility of such a nation, for which the feeling and the reality of community is its very essence. Russia acts in the world, as a result, as an opponent of the homogenizing force of globalization, which erodes the nation.

Adrian Pabst’s contribution concluded the conference’s final day. Liberalism, says Pabst, professor at the University of Kent in England and a committed “post-liberal,” is experiencing a profound “meta-crisis” that is entirely self-generated. Within the liberal states, and especially the United States and the UK, liberalism is eroding the economic and cultural foundations on which it depends to survive. Oblivious to this dynamic, Western elites have embraced the “end of history” thesis and the progressive-neoconservative utopia of a borderless world converging towards the West’s brand of liberal market democracy as the “final form of human government.”

But this is no longer sustainable. While the liberal model has many virtues and should not be condemned wholesale, its inadequacies are not only economic and political but also cultural. Its focus on individual rights and personal freedom of choice leaves little room for mutual obligation and shared identity. “Freedom to choose” applies most of all to the wealthy and powerful who are at home in a world of mobility and permanent change. People who care about their cultural traditions and sense of belonging end up on the “wrong side of history,” as those cherished things are swept away in the name of progress. Liberal globalization tends to promote a kind of low-grade U.S. culture accessible to all, but corrosive of both universal high culture and local folk cultures.

The alternative, suggests Pabst, is neither chauvinistic nationalism nor abstract cosmopolitanism. It is what he calls “post-liberalism.” This proposes a shift from unfettered liberal market capitalism to economic justice and a greater reciprocity of profit and social purpose. It signals a shift from rampant individualism and top-down, state-enforced egalitarianism to social solidarity and more fraternal, reciprocal relations. Politically, it signals a shift from the minority politics of vested interests and exclusive group identity to a majority politics based on a balance of interests and shared social identity. It also means re-envisioning the international order.

Despite Edmund Burke’s reputation as a conservative stick in the mud, his political insights prove surprisingly helpful here, Pabst argues. The established liberal order is today’s ancien régime. But unlike the radical right and the revolutionary left, who are determined to overthrow it, Burke provides a vision of politics that avoids a rehash of both revolution and the ultra-liberal center (from Clinton to Cameron). Precisely what in terms of particular policies this vision entails is for us to work out through genuine agonistic political dialogue within our own political communities. But it involves (re)learning a spirit of conversation in the service of the common good, the rejection of revolution, and the humble and realistic acceptance of limits that ought to carry over into our relations with the rest of the world, including Russia.

Finally, says Pabst, our conceptual framework needs to make room for a political concept of relationality that fosters a form of mutual exchange that is neither hierarchy nor simple equality. It is a form of political understanding that takes mutual obligation as more primary, and more sacred, than individual rights.

To us, the organizers of the Simone Weil Center, it’s clear that, whether one works in fashionable Moscow circles, in Washington, D.C., or, for that matter, at the Google headquarters, questioning the liberal, human-rights-based order is no way to win popularity contests. Anyone who raises such questions will be labeled a conservative, and it won’t be meant a compliment. We say: let’s accept the insult, but reject the usual definition.

Conservatism is not mean-spirited nationalism. Nor is it irritability, over-confidence, or a refusal to talk to the other side. Further, it is not neoconservatism, that combination of ideological liberalism and a perverse reading of Thucydides that leads to an overriding desire to conquer the world so as to make it liberal.

No, true conservatism is more thoughtful than that. Our Moscow conversation demonstrated elements of it, defined by being grounded in a long tradition of philosophy and practice (in Alasdair MacIntyre’s sense of the word “practice”). If we accept this conservative calling, with its roots in dialogue and the idea of limit, we will find the courage to engage Russia in conversation. And this same call to courage, the spirit of coming out of our shells and talking with one another, was on display by our “conservative” Russian counterparts.

This suggests there is room for hope. But the forces in the West arrayed against this kind of dialogue and this perspective of openness are both powerful and willful. And so there should be no illusions about the formidable task ahead.

10,azerbijan,"Three brown bears held captive in shocking conditions in Armenia were freed recently as part of The Great Bear Rescue, a project by International Animal Rescue (IAR) and a local group called Federation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets (FPWC). The bears were rescued from separate locations across Armenia, a landlocked Eurasian country bordering Turkey, Georgia, Azerbijan and Iran.

The first bear rescued was a three-year old male who was kept in a rusty cage in a dark warehouse in Aparan. Second to be freed was a ten-year-old female who had spent her entire life in captivity in a restaurant. Due to a life-long inadequate diet, she is very overweight and has barely any teeth left. Rescuers are now feeding her a nutritious diet of soft, chopped fruit and vegetables. The third bear rescued was a female held at a restaurant in Gyumri, who was exhibiting stereotypical stress pacing behaviour when the team came to set her free.

Now in quarantine at the Yerevan zoo, the bears are receiving expert veterinary care, and their physical and mental conditions are being monitored carefully while their rescuers arrange a better future for them.

The bears are all Syrian Brown Bears (Ursus arctos syriacus), who live wild in the more mountainous regions of the country. Poachers illegally catch about 150 of these bears annually. The majority of these bears wind up being used as public entertainment or tourist attractions, trapped in tiny, bare cages in restaurants, and spend their lives in misery behind bars.

IAR launched The Great Bear Rescue in October 2017, with the support of the Armenian government, to save these suffering bears by releasing those that can be rehabilitated and provide a lifelong home in sanctuaries for those that cannot.

Ruben Khachatryan of FPWC stated: “there are many other bears in urgent need of our attention. We are keeping focused on the job in hand and trying to reach as many caged bears as possible, as fast as we possibly can.”

The coordination of vital rescue work of bears kept behind bars – whether for entertainment like these three bears or for bile farming – is made possible by the growing global awareness of and refusal to accept these cruel practices. As the world learns the truth about the cruelty, they are no longer willing to tolerate the torture of these majestic animals for profit.",https://ladyfreethinker.org/bears-forced-entertain-diners-armenia-finally-rescued/
11,azerbijan,"Drowning in debt, Dubai has received a financial lifeline to refinance $20 billion of its government debt owed the United Arab Emirates and its capital, Abi Dhabi. The emergency loan that comes due this year was issued during the 2009 financial crisis, when Dubai’s real estate market collapsed.

Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE, received another five years to repay the loan at a 1% annual interest rate. Dubai owes a total of $142 billion in debt, equivalent to 102% of its gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some $35 billion of the total belongs to the government or is guaranteed by the government. About $60 billion comes due between 2013 and 2017, according to the IMF.

Dubai’s market crashed as oil, its lifeblood, peaked. At the same, development of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Dubai at 818 meters tall was nearly completed. The skyscraper broke ground in 2004, as oil prices were rising, and opened in 2010. Historically the development of the world’s tallest buildings coincide with market tops right before an economic storm hits, according to Dave Harder and Janice Dorn, M.D., Ph.D.

“The next thing to look for in regards to the history of tallest structures correlating with market tops may well be Azerbijan,” Harder and Dorn wrote in their book, Mind, Money & Markets. “(It has) plans to build the tallest building in the world after the Kingdom Tower, which is to be built in Saudi Arabia.”

As Dubai is drowning in debt, ripples from the 2009 debt crisis still limit lending in the emirate. The banking sector remains saddled with non-performing loans, according to an IMF report published Oct. 5, 2013.

The UAE’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio has declined from a peak of 23.4% in 2010 to 14.6% currently, according to Trading Economics. Investors prefer to see a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio as low as possible because the lower it is, the more likely it will be able to repay its loans. It reduces the country’s borrowing costs and government bond yields.

The UAE is very technically advanced relative to all industrialized countries. However, its stock market is considered a frontier market because it has a smaller market capitalization and less liquidity compared with more advanced emerging markets.

The MSCI All United Arab Emirates Index, measuring its stock market performance, has gained 12% year to date and a mind-boggling 72% in the past 12 months, as of March 14, according to MSCI. It has rallied 35% annualized the past three years and 25% annualized over the past five years.

The UAE has outpaced both developed and emerging foreign markets for the past five years. The MSCI EAFE Index, measuring foreign developed markets, fell 3% year to date while returning 10% in the past year. It has increased 4% and 14%, annualized over the past three and five years.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index plummeted 6% year to date and 11% in the past year. It lost an average of 6% annually the past three years. On a five-year basis, emerging markets has returned 12% annualized.

Dubai’s has to contend with higher borrowing costs as it will need $7 billion to develop infrastructure to host the World Expo in 2020. This will surely deepen the extent to which Dubai is already drowning in debt.

13,azerbijan,"Almedin Imsirovic Wins $10,000 Single-Day High Roller for $160,050

January 14, 2018 Frank Op de Woerd

The action was fast and furious in the $10,000 Single-Day High Roller at the last day of the 2018 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure. In the hyper format, blinds were just 15 minutes long. A total of 55 entries, 13 of which being reentries, came to the Imperial Ballroom of the Atlantis Resort for one last chance at a spade trophy and hefty cheque.

After just six and a half hours, American grinder Almedin Imsirovic took down the tournament. The $160,050 he collected, marks the biggest score of his career. Cheered on by his friends on the rail, he beat a star-studded final table including Ryan Riess who had to settle for 2nd place.

Position Player Country Prize 1 Almedin Imsirovic United States $160,050 2 Ryan Riess United States $115,770 3 Matthias Eibinger Austria $74,690 4 Mustapha Kanit Italy $56,550 5 Sam Greenwood Canada $43,750 6 Benjamin Pollak France $34,140 7 Stefan Schillhabel Germany $27,210 8 Ramin Hajiyev Azerbijan $21,340

A lot of the high rollers strolled into the tournament room at 1 to gamble it up one last time this PCA. A lot of them left empty-handed, with some closer to the money than others.

Closest to the money without cashing, came Sylvain Loosli. The former November Niner finished in ninth place, running ace-five into the ace-eight of Mustapha Kanit.

Time was of the essence in this event, and Ramin Hajiyev's ran out soon enough after the bubble had burst. Severely short stacked, he got it in with king-six and didn't outrun Greenwood's ace-three.

""Koray needs you more on his rail than we need you here""



Stefan Schillhabel was next to go, getting crippled with queen-jack suited to Almedin Imsirovic's ace-king. Kanit, again, was the one finishing the job eliminating the German high roller with ace-three versus six-seven. ""Koray needs you more on his rail than we need you here,"" Kanit said with a big smile.

Schillhabel cracked a smile too and gathered his things before he moved over to the rail of the final table of the Main Event to support his friend Koray Aldemir.

Benjamin Pollak (six-deuce into king-ten) and Sam Greenwood (king-queen to ace-seven) departed in respectively sixth and fifth before Mustapha Kanit himself exited. The one-time chip leader doubled Ryan Riess first and lost ace-five to eights to bust in fourth place.

Riess and Imsirovic were both big stacks, while Matthias Eibinger was the absolute shorty. The latter didn't recover and had to settle for third place getting it in with queen-four against Riess' jack-ten. A ten on the flop and jack on the river was all there was to it for Riess, Eibinger had to leave the tournament area just before the heads up began.

Riess and Imsirovic started out about even, but with just a few big blinds in play, the tournament finished under 10 minutes later. After Riess folded two-pair to a river check-raise on a dangerous board, he was the shorter one. He made a move shoving all in with king-deuce and ran into the ace-jack of Imsirovic. Five community cards later, it was all over as Almedin Imsirovic was crowned victorious.

Jorge Ramos 2014 Burton Benjamin Memorial Award acceptance speech from Committee to Protect Journalists on Vimeo.

The text of Ramos' acceptance speech, as prepared for delivery, is below.

I love being a journalist. It is the only profession in the world in which your job description is to be rebellious and irreverent. In other words, journalism keeps you forever young. As Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez used to say: This is the best profession in the world. But we can, and we should, use journalism as a weapon for a higher purpose: justice.



The best of journalism happens when we take a stand: when we question those who are in power, when we confront the politicians who abuse their authority, when we denounce an injustice. The best of journalism happens when we side with the victims, with the most vulnerable, with those who have no rights. The best of journalism happens when we, purposely, stop pretending that we are neutral and recognize that we have a moral obligation to tell truth to power.

I believe in the basics of journalism. I have nothing against objectivity. Our profession is based on finding the facts, on reporting exactly what happened, on being obsessed with details. We should not get it wrong. If five people died, we have to say five, not six or seven. We should get the name right, the quote right, the numbers right. Our credibility depends on this.

I have nothing against being balanced. Every story has at least two points of view and we have to report both. This has to be like a reflex. If a Republican said something, I bet you a Democrat has a response, and vice versa. If a president proposes a new law, the opposition should also have a say. This has to be second nature.

But to get all the facts and to present both points of view doesn't mean that we got the story right.

When we deal with the powerful, we have to take a stand. Yes, we have to take an ethical decision and side with those who have no power. If we have to decide between being a friend or an enemy of the president, of the governor, of the dictator, it should be an easy choice: I'm a reporter and I don't want to be your friend.

When I'm doing an interview with someone important, I always assume two things: First, that if I don't ask the tough questions, nobody else will. That's my job. And second, that most probably I will never talk to that person again. Some of the worst interviews that I've seen happen when the reporter refuses to ask difficult questions just to maintain access to his sources. That's self-censorship.

Yes, I'm arguing here for ""point of view journalism."" It means being transparent, it means recognizing to our audience, to our readers, that we have opinions and a code of ethics. We don't live in a vacuum. All the time, we are taking moral choices right before the interview, right before the investigation or the coverage. It is perfectly O.K. not to be neutral and to openly take a stand.

We have many great examples of courageous journalists who decided to take a stand:

Edward R. Murrow confronted biased Senator Joe McCarthy.

Walter Cronkite openly criticized the Vietnam War.

The Washington Post reporters got rid of a corrupt president, President Nixon.

Christiane Amanpour denounced President Clinton's flip-flop policies and made him accountable for what happened in Bosnia.

And Anderson Cooper showed the incompetence of the Bush administration after Hurricane Katrina.

If they did it, I can do it. Therefore, I think I can call Fidel Castro a dictator, even though I can't get a visa to go to Cuba.

We were right to report early this year that the Venezuelan government was behind the killings of dozens of students. Obviously, President Maduro hasn't given us an interview.

And we are right to report now that there is a huge conflict of interest in Mexico because a government contractor is financing the $7 million home of the president's wife. That's not saving Mexico. That's corruption.

Can you imagine what would happen here if a government contractor would secretly finance the private home of Michelle Obama? Well, that is happening in Mexico and, believe it or not, there is not even an independent investigation on this matter. Because of the so-called ""White House"" in Mexico and the disappearance of 43 students, thousands of Mexicans want President Peña Nieto to resign. We have to report that. No, Peña Nieto doesn't want to talk to me either.

Now let me tell you what it means for me to be a journalist and to be an immigrant. This defines me. I came to the U.S. after they tried to censor me in Mexico. So this country gave me the opportunities that my country of origin couldn't give me. And, of course, when it comes to immigration, I take a stand.

As an immigrant myself, many times I speak up for other immigrants who don't have a voice. That's why I told President Obama that he didn't keep his promise on immigration and that's why I told Speaker John Boehner, to his face, that he blocked immigration reform in the House. I think I was just doing my job. As a journalist, part of my job is to make visible the millions of immigrants who are invisible to the rest of America.

I don't believe in being partisan. But I believe in taking a stand. As Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel once said: ""We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim."" In front of genocide, dictators, and politicians abusing their power, we can't be neutral.

The worst in our profession is when we stay silent. Sadly, we stayed silent before the war in Iraq and thousands of American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians died unnecessarily. We have to learn from that. Silence is the worst sin in journalism. But the best is when journalism becomes a way of doing justice and speaking truth to power.

That's why tonight I want to dedicate this award to all the journalists who have been recently killed in Syria and in Mexico. You were our eyes. Now you are part of our soul.

15,azerbijan,"Azerbaijan may not leap to the forefront of your mind when you read the phrase “futuristic eco-island” but that might change when the country’s plans for Zira island in the Caspian Sea come to fruition. It’s going to be transformed into a 1 million square-meter tourist resort and residential area that’ll have a zero carbon footprint.

The project’s been designed by Dutch architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), and it involves nothing less than an almost complete transformation of the little island into something so futuristic that even the Thunderbirds Tracy Island pales in comparison.

The plan’s eco-credentials are clearly set-out by BIG: By utilizing “the wind, the sun and the waste the Island will produce the same amount of energy as it consumes.” Heat pumps connected to the sea will heat or cool the buildings, along with solar water heating units. Photovoltaic panels will generate electricity, as will an off-shore wind-farm. Run-off water and waste water will be recycled in a processing plant, and solid sewage waste will be treated to convert it into topsoil fertilizer.

And all of this eco-friendly high-tech is designed to not conflict with the natural aspects of the island. The buildings and structures are designed to replicate the “Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan” and as a result resemble high-tech and sculpted Egyptian pyramids. Solar panels are concealed in architecture itself. The shapes of the structures have been designed with mind modeling to optimize air-flow around the island, creating microclimates in concert with tree-planting–in high wind zones the trees are denser, stalling the air at ground level so it’s more comfortable for people.",https://www.fastcompany.com/1149848/azerbijans-futuristic-eco-island-plans
16,azerbijan,"Sky Sports F1 viewers on Christmas Day are being treated to a one-hour special interview with four-time world champion Lewis Hamilton.

'Lewis Hamilton: My 4th World Title' is the title of the show, and it will see the four-time world champion sit down with Sky F1's Damon Hill, himself a former world champion, to discuss his record-breaking 2017 season.

The 32-year-old from Stevenage became Britain's most successful F1 driver and only the fifth in the sport's history to land a fourth world championship.

Viewers were given a sneak-peak of the Christmas Day episode on Sky Sports F1's Twitter account in which Hamilton touched on conflicts he had over the years with fellow drivers.

Ferrari's Sebastien Vettel collided with Hamilton twice in the Azerbijan Grand Prix, and that was a major talking point during the interview.

First running into the back of Hamilton, and second when he swerved into the side of Hamilton's car after thinking the Mercedes man had been brake-testing him.

Vettel entered that race with a 12-point lead over Hamilton in the F1 standings.

""Looking back at Baku, one of the things I worked on this year was re-starts. Lights go out, you become the second car, you control the pace, I was letting him go like a race before.

""He's realised he'd been napping all those other times and got on the gas and drove into the back of me.

""I'm not a violent person, but every now and then it can be handled that way (laughs).

""When I was younger in karting, you'd get boshed off by some idiot, but my dad always said just do your talking on the track and that's what I did.""

It was quite a turnaround by Hamilton this season who managed to clinch the title in Mexico with two races remaining.

Already available to watch on Sky Sports is 'Hamilton Makes History, a look back at 2017', as the channel fills its schedule with F1 programmes to watch over the festive season.

17,azerbijan,"Palatial is a word that comes easily to mind when approaching the Armstrong Auditorium east of Bryant Avenue and north of Waterloo Road in Edmond.

Crossing a ""sea of glass"" plaza of travertine from Turkey, one comes upon the $20 million, eight- story building that will house a performing arts series that this year includes such acts as the Russian National Ballet Theatre and the Vienna Boys Choir, to name just a few.

The auditorium has been almost three years in the building stage and six years in the planning. It is scheduled to open Sept. 5 with a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's ""Elijah"" performed by Herbert W. Armstrong College's choral union.

""This is all about our mission of serving God and humanity, and being able to showcase all that He's created us to be,"" said Shane Granger, marketing director for the Armstrong International Cultural Foundation. ""When you enjoy the performing arts in this setting, you cannot help but be uplifted and inspired, and that glorifies God.""

The building is a study in opulence. Twelve columns soaring 48 feet bracket the glass-fronted lobby. In front is a 40,000-gallon reflecting pool with the bronze sculpture, ""Swans in Flight,"" by British sculptor David Wynne.

Swarovski-Strass crystal chandeliers, weighing up to 2 tons each and holding between 15,000 and 21,000 pieces of crystal, are suspended over royal purple carpet in the lobby. Baccarat crystal candelabra commissioned and used by the Shah of Iran for the 2,500-year anniversary of the Persian Empire stand in front of caramel onyx panels mined in Azerbijan and polished in Viareggio, Italy.

American cherry wood panels have matching grain from floor to ceiling. The effect is achieved by peeling logs as one might unroll paper towels.

Even the rest rooms are richly appointed. Brazilian sandstone countertops in the men's rooms show fossilized leaves and tree roots. Spanish marble adorns the ladies' rooms.

That's all before one reaches the 823-seat auditorium, where Granger said a tremendous amount of thought was put into seating and acoustics. Paneled walls have mov able shelves and curtains to deflect or enhance sound. Seats are 23 inches wide versus the traditional 19-inch theater seat.

Each seat is anchored in cast iron to minimize reverberation as people sit or stand. Each aisle also has extra leg room, Granger said.

""This is the difference between flying coach or first class,"" he said.

On a recent weekday, workers installed the truss that will hold the main stage curtain — three shades of gold chenille that will drape in thirds, Granger said.

The front of the stage drops 9 feet into an orchestra pit. A state-of-the-art audio-visual package will allow production of each performance to share with an even larger broadcast audience, Granger said.

Equal thought was given to performers. Two dressing rooms for stars have chandeliers, granite countertops and private rest rooms. Dressing and waiting rooms for cast members are similarly appointed. Performers will be treated to chiropractic adjustments and massage therapists if they wish, as well as buffets served from a full catering kitchen, Granger said.

""Our philosophy is our patrons are going to enter this palatial environment but so are our performers,"" Granger said.

Funding for the building came from members of the Philadelphia Church of God, through its nonprofit, humanitarian arm, the Armstrong International Cultural Foundation, Granger said. The church and its foundation are based on the 171-acre Herbert W. Armstrong College campus in Edmond, which has 60 full-time students.

The church traces its roots to the Worldwide Church of God that severed after founder Herbert W. Armstrong's death in 1986.

Before his death, Armstrong had built Ambassador College and Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, Calif. The design of Armstrong Auditorium and many of its pieces of art come directly from Armstrong's original campus, Granger said.

Good or bad legacy?

Operations Director Ryan Malone said the new auditorium is a tribute to Armstrong's legacy.

The building in Edmond is not without detractors. At least one former church member has taken issue with how donations were raised.

Sarah Luther, of Bartlesville, said she was an early member of the Philadelphia Church of God, before dropping out in 2002 after what she called ""abuse"" by church leaders. In an e-mail, Luther wrote, ""this auditorium is being paid for on the backs of church members, who have been warned to give extra special and generous offerings if they want to please God.""

Granger said any church that has a worldwide membership of 150,000 that has gone through a major split will have its enemies.

""We feel the fruits of our labors speak for themselves,"" he said.

18,azerbijan,"A SINGLE anonymously owned Glasgow shell firm was used to funnel nearly £145 million out of an oil-rich former Soviet republic to feed one of Europe’s biggest ever slush funds.

The business was one of 20 Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) named in a major investigation into the elaborate and far reaching £2.2 billion Azerbaijan Laundromat money-laundering scheme.

Faberlex, which was registered at a Glasgow branch of Mailboxes Etc, was the second biggest feeder in to a scheme believed to have been used, among other things, to pay off European politicians sympathetic to Azerbaijan's regime.

The firm, which has now been dissolved, only existed for three years and, like most SLPs, never revealed its true owners or filed any accounts.

There is no suggestion Mailbox Etc had any knowledge its branch was being used for such activities.

Only a mysterious venture called Baktelekom, which shares its name as an entirely unrelated Azerbaijan telecoms firm, paid more in to the laundromat than Faberlex.

Azerbaijan has invested in an entire new look for its capital, Baku

Its role has been exposed just as international bodies become increasing nervous about the use of British firms, and a Danish bank, to help Azerbaijan’s elite both peddle interest and feather their nests at home.

The Council of Europe expressed “great concern” over the revelations which were exposed thanks to a data leak from Danske Bank in Denmark to Copenhagen’s Berlingske newspaper.

Its assembly passed a motion calling on Azerbaijan’s hardline president Ilham Aliyev to start “an independent and impartial inquiry into these allegations without delay and, furthermore, cooperate fully with competent international authorities and bodies on this issue.”

The country's officials have dismissed any claims of money-laundering. Media friendly to the regime suggested the stories were the product of a conspiracy theory featuring a billionaire frequently the subject of smears in the former Soviet Union state.

The Laundromat was “fake news inspired by billionaire George Soros”, said one outlet.

The entire dump of data to Berlingske has now been published online by the Organised Crime and Reporting Project (OCCRP), a body which previously exposed the bigger and even more elaborate Russian Laundromat.

Within this tranche of data, The Herald has found more than 20 SLPs, including Faberlex and two we named earlier this week as core firms in the Laundromat: Hilux Services and Polux Management.

These firms, which were also registered at a Glasgow Mailboxes Etc, played a crucial role in distributing cash paid in to the scheme.

Hilux and Polux were joined by two English limited liability partnerships Metastar Invest and LCM Alliance, as the central or “core” corporate entities in the scheme.

OCCRP urges caution on assuming all entities named in its data dump were involved in wrongdoing. Danske Bank has said that the some 16,000 transactions concerned, made through its branch in Estonia, were suspicious.

All but one of named SLPs identitifed discovered by The Herald are registered at addresses which have previously hosted firms involved in other scandals we have covered.

For example, the flat of an innocent Inverness nurse was used as the registration base of firms in the Azerbaijani Laundromat, the $1 billion looting of three banks in Moldova and the ownership of a ghost ship used to bust sanctions in to Russian-occupied Crimea, revealed by The Herald last month.

Westburn Enterprises, a Scottish limited company, which is not an SLP, is named in both the Russian and the Azerbaijan Laundromats. The now dissolved firm, which was based at an Edinburgh flat, was one of the core entities in the £20bn Russian scandal. In the Azerbaijan scheme it played a more modest role, funnelling just under $1.5 million to now defunct LCM Alliance.

There is no way to contact any of the SLPs’ owners, who are anonymous shell firms in tax havens.

There is no suggestion that any of the firms or householders hosting the SLPs in the Azerbaijani Laundromat were involved in criminality. Mailboxes Etc has previously stressed that its staff report anything irregular about their clients to the authorities.

SLPs named in the Azerbaijan Laundromat:

Luxborg

Faberlex

Cityport Contracts

Amberlot Invest

Rasmus

Richfield Trading

Globecom Trade

Wildpark Sales

General Trade

Interline Europe

Stamptone Service

19,azerbijan,"Christiane Amanpour was honored with the Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for her extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom on November 22, 2016. The text of Amanpour's acceptance speech, as prepared for delivery, is below.

I never in a million years thought I would be up here on stage appealing for the freedom and safety of American journalists at home.

Ladies and gentlemen, I added the bits from candidate Trump as a reminder of the peril we face.

I actually hoped that once president-elect, all that that would change, and I still do.

But I was chilled when the first tweet after the election was about ""professional protesters incited by the media.""

He walked back the part about the protesters but not the part about the media.

We are not there but postcard from the world: this is how it goes with authoritarians like Sisi, Erdoğan, Putin, the Ayatollahs, Duterte, et al.

As all the international journalists we honor in this room tonight and every year know only too well:

First the media is accused of inciting, then sympathizing, then associating--until they suddenly find themselves accused of being full-fledged terrorists and subversives.

Then they end up in handcuffs, in cages, in kangaroo courts, in prison--and then who knows?

Just to say, Erdoğan has just told my Israeli colleague Ilana Dayan that he cannot understand why anyone's protesting in America, it must mean they don't accept--or understand--democracy! And he thinks America, like all great countries, needs a strongman to get things done!

A great America requires a great and free and safe press.

So this above all is an appeal to protect journalism itself.

Recommit to robust fact-based reporting without fear or favor--on the issues.

Don't stand for being labelled crooked or lying or failing

Do stand up together--for divided we will all fall.

The historian Simon Schama, in the house tonight, told me early on that this was not just another election, and we cannot treat it as one.

And he says if ever there's a time to celebrate, honor, protect, and mobilize for press freedom and basic good journalism, it's now.

At the start of this campaign, a network news president said this phenomenon may not be good for America but damn good for us.

During an interview on my program this summer, the film-maker and historian Ken Burns asked me what would Edward R. Murrow do?

First, like many people watching where I was overseas, I admit I was shocked by the exceptionally high bar put before one candidate and the exceptionally low bar put before the other candidate.

It appeared much of the media got itself into knots trying to differentiate between balance, objectivity, neutrality, and crucially, truth.

We cannot continue the old paradigm--let's say like over global warming, where 99.9 percent of the empirical scientific evidence is given equal play with the tiny minority of deniers.

I learned long ago, covering the ethnic cleansing and genocide in Bosnia, never to equate victim with aggressor, never to create a false moral or factual equivalence, because then you are an accomplice to the most unspeakable crimes and consequences.

I believe in being truthful, not neutral. And I believe we must stop banalizing the truth.

And we have to be prepared to fight especially hard for the truth in a world where the Oxford English Dictionary just announced its word of 2016: post-truth.

We have to accept that we've had our lunch handed to us by the very same social media that we've so slavishly been devoted to.

The winning candidate did a savvy end run around us and used it to go straight to the people. Combined with the most incredible development ever--the tsunami of fake news sites--aka lies--that somehow people could not, would not, recognize, fact check, or disregard.

One of the main writers of these false articles--these lies--says people are getting dumber, just passing fake reports around without fact checking. We need to ask whether technology has finally outpaced our human ability to keep up.

Facebook needs to step up.

Advertisers need to boycott the lying sites.

Wael Ghonim, one of the fathers of the Arab Spring, dubbed the social media revolution, now says:

""The same medium that so effectively transmits a howling message of change also appears to undermine the ability to make it. Social media amplifies the human tendency to bind with one's own kind. It tends to reduce complex social challenges to mobilizing slogans that reverberate in echo chambers of the like-minded rather than engage in persuasion, dialogue, and the reach for consensus. Hate speech and untruths appear alongside good intentions and truths.""

I feel that we face an existential crisis, a threat to the very relevance and usefulness of our profession.

Now, more than ever, we need to commit to real reporting across a real nation, a real world in which journalism and democracy are in mortal peril, including by foreign powers like Russia paying to churn out and place false news, and hacking into democratic systems here and allegedly in upcoming crucial German and French elections too.

A quick anecdote from out there: in the 1997 Iranian elections, the reform candidate won and the establishment ayatollahs were caught totally off guard. One of them asked me later how I was so sure and when did I know that Khatami was going to win. I told him, as soon as I got on the ground and started talking to people! Just saying.

We must also fight against a post-values world.

And let me hit back at this elitist backlash we're all bending over backwards to accommodate.

Since when were American values elitist values? They are not left or right values. They are not rich or poor values, not the forgotten-man values.

Like many foreigners I have learned they are universal. They are the values of every American from the humblest to the most exalted. They form the very fundamental foundation of the United States and are the basis of America's global leadership. They are brand America. They are America's greatest export and gift to the world.

So yes, like so many around the world, I was shocked--very few ever imagined that so many Americans conducting their sacred duty in the sanctity of the voting booth, with their secret ballot, would be angry enough to ignore the wholesale vulgarity of language, the sexual predatory behavior, the deep misogyny, the bigoted and insulting views.

Gov. Mario Cuomo said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Perhaps the opposite will be true this time around.

If not, I will fight as a journalist--as we all must--to defend and protect the unique value system that makes these United States--and with which it seeks to influence the world.

The conservative radio host who may be the next White House press secretary says mainstream media is hostile to traditional values.

I would say it's just the opposite. And have you read about the ""Heil, victory"" meeting in Washington, DC this past weekend?

Why aren't there more stories about the dangerous rise of the far right here and in Europe?

Since when did anti-Semitism stop being a litmus test in this country?

We must fights against normalization of the unacceptable.

A week before the heated Brexit referendum in the U.K., the gorgeous, young, optimistic, idealistic, compassionate MP Jo Cox, a remainer, was shot and stabbed to death by a maniac yelling ""Britain first."" She was particularly sensitive to the plight of Syrian war refugees.

At his trial, the court was told the accused had researched information on the SS and the KKK.

Just a few weeks ago, her husband, Brendan, now raising their two tiny toddlers, expanded for me on an op-ed he'd written:

""Political leaders and people generally must embrace the responsibility to speak out against bigotry. Unless the center holds against the insidious creep of extremism, history shows how quickly hatred is normalized. What begins with biting your tongue for political expediency, or out of social awkwardness, soon becomes complicity with something far worse. Before you know it, it's already too late.""

So now the solutions!

Somehow, the war of attrition in this country has to end. You've all seen the results of this election. It's very close. The nation is very divided, and angry.

Are we in the media going to keep whipping up that war--or are we going to take a deep breath and maybe have a reset?!

It matters to us out there abroad too.

For better or for worse, this is the world's only superpower. Culturally too.

The political example, the media example set here, are quickly emulated and rolled out across the world.

We, the media, can either contribute to a more functional system or to deepening the political dysfunction.

Which world do we want to leave our children?

In the same way, politics has been driven into poisonous partisan and paralyzing corners, where political differences are criminalized, where the zero sum game means in order for me to win, you have to be destroyed. What happened to compromise and common ground?

That same dynamic has infected powerful segments of the American media.

Like it has in Egypt and Turkey and Russia, where journalists have been pushed into political partisan corners as we see here tonight--delegitimized, accused of being enemies of the state.

Journalism itself has become weaponized. We have to stop it.

We all have a huge amount of work to do, investigating wrongdoing, holding power accountable, enabling decent government, defending basic rights, actually covering the world--Russia, Syria, North Korean nukes.

Can't we have differences without killing each other off?

As a profession, let's fight for what is right.

Let's fight for our values.

Bad things do happen when good people do nothing.

In the words of the great civil rights leader, Congressman John Lewis:

""Young people and people not so young have a moral obligation and a mission and a mandate to get in good trouble.""

So let's go out and make some.

And especially--let's fight to remain relevant and useful.

Perhaps contemplating the long weekend ahead,

Let's resolve not to be turkeys voting for Thanksgiving!

Happy holidays, everyone.

20,azerbijan,"MOSCOW - It would be unforgivable if a deal over Iran's nuclear program was lost, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported.



The ministry also said it was disappointed by plans by the United States to extend its Iran Sanctions Act by 10 years.

Meanwhile on Thursday, the White House said the bill extending US sanctions against Iran for 10 years will become law without President Barack Obama's signature, but will not affect implementation of the international accord limiting Iran's nuclear program.""This Administration has made clear that an extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, while unnecessary, is entirely consistent with our commitments in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Consistent with this longstanding position, the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act is becoming law without the President's signature,"" a White House statement said.Iran Foreign Minister Zarif hopes nuclear deal is kept once the dust settlesThursday's remarks came after Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday ordered scientists to start developing systems for nuclear-powered boats, in reaction to what he called the United States' violation of a global atomic deal.The announcement marked Iran's first concrete response to a US Congress decision last month to extend legislation making it easier for Washington to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.Rouhani described the technology as a ""nuclear propeller to be used in marine transportation,"" but did not say whether that meant just ships or possibly also submarines. Iran said in 2012 that it was working on its first nuclear-powered sub.His words will stoke tensions with Washington, already heightened by comments from US president elect Donald Trump who has vowed to scrap the deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for lifted sanctions.There was no immediate reaction from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's nuclear work.""The United States has not fully delivered its commitments in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the nuclear deal),"" Rouhani wrote in a letter published by state news agency IRNA.""With regards to recent (US congress) legislation to extend the Iran Sanctions Act, I order the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to ... plan the design and construction of a nuclear propeller to be used in marine transportation to be used in marine transportation.""US Congress members have said the extension of the bill does not violate the nuclear deal agreed last year to assuage Western fears that Iran is working to develop a nuclear bomb.

21,azerbijan,"British human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has sparked outrage in Azerbaijan by taking on the case of jailed investigative journalist Khadija Ismayilova.

Ismayilova, an outspoken critic of the government, has been in prison for more than a year on charges she claims are politically motivated.

Clooney and the Media Legal Defence Initiative will challenge Ismayilova’s detention in the European court of human rights, saying her extended pre-trial imprisonment violates the European convention.



The Azerbaijani media, which often acts as a mouth piece for the government, responded to the news by accusing Clooney of harbouring a vendetta against the Turkic countries of central Asia.

“Clooney targets Turkic states in her path to fame,” claimed AzerNews on Wednesday – an outlet known to defend the government against criticisms of human rights abuses.

“We would like to note that Amal Clooney is an ethnic Armenian and she represented Armenian interests in the European court for human rights,” echoed the Haqqin.az news service.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at loggerheads over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh since the 1990s. Clooney is of Lebanese heritage.

Ismayilova, 39, was detained in December 2014 after allegedly prompting a co-worker to attempt suicide but remained in custody even after the the charges were dropped, said Media Legal Defence Initiative attorney Nani Jansen.

The initiative is also representing Ismayilova in a case which accuses the government of failing to prosecute those involved in a sex-video blackmail attempt against her, which they say violated her right to privacy.

The journalist has also been sentenced to seven-and-a-half-years in prison on “economic charges” in a verdict delivered in September. Supporters say the conviction is in retribution for her exposés of corruption at the hands of the president, Ilham Aliyev.

Under the European court rules, Ismayilova’s case must go through the national appeal process before being considered. After being rejected at theBaku court of appeals, Ismayilova’s lawyers filed a case with Azerbaijan’s supreme court and expect to hear back “in two to three months, ” Interfax-Azerbaijan reported.

The attacks on Clooney focus on a 2015 Armenian genocide-denial case she led and lost against a Turkish politician, also at the European court. This has fed accusations that the 37-year-old attorney is on an anti-Turkic tirade.

As close allies, Turkey and Azerbaijan both oppose Armenia on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.

“Anti-Turkic activities indeed helped Amal, a Lebanese by origin with close roots to large Armenian community in her motherland, to get distinguished in her lawyer career,” wrote AzerNews. Adding that Clooney’s “anti-Turkic” spree was a “bid to catch up [with] with her husband’s [George Clooney] fame.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/amal-clooney-azerbaijan-khadija-ismayilova
22,azerbijan,"Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven that he will get into bed with anyone in order to make a buck. From constructing a hotel in Azerbijan built with a partner from the government ministry whom U.S. diplomats suspect launders money for Iran’s military, to one under criminal investigation in Brazil, to investments under serious scrutiny in Turkey, Toronto (more on that later), Scotland and Ireland, among many others—it is clear that Trump is not as discerning about his business partners as his bluster indicates.

His extensive dealings in Atlantic City could not have been done without help from the mob, and he has intimated as such, when he told Chris Matthews last February:

“I’ve known some tough cookies over the years. I’ve known the people that make the politicians you and I deal with every day look like little babies.”

Upon his initial foray into Atlantic City, he partnered with Kenneth Shapiro and Daniel Sullivan. The former was a bag man for Philadelphia’s Scarfo crime family, while the latter was a mafia associate-turned FBI informant. However, when he was looking to acquire a gambling license in 1982, Trump told regulators that he didn’t “think there was anything wrong with [Shapiro and Sullivan]” and that they “have been in Atlantic City for many, many years and I think they are well thought of.”

Yet, a year before that, Trump spoke with FBI agents, and per the memorandum produced from that meeting, “Trump advised Agents that he had read in the press media and had heard from various acquaintances that Organized Crime elements were known to operate in Atlantic City…Trump advised that he wanted to build a casino in Atlantic City but he did not wish to tarnish his family’s name.”

As his infamous bankruptcies demonstrate, Trump did build casinos in Atlantic City, and this was simply the start of his relationship with organized crime figures. His mentor—Roy Cohn—who is most well-known for being Senator Joseph McCarthy’s chief witch hunter, also advised a litany of mafia figures after leaving public life for a private practice on East 68th Street in New York City. Some of his clients included Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno and Paul “Big Paul” Castellano among many other mobsters. According to Wayne Barrett’s 1992 book Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, Cohn told a reporter that Trump called him “fifteen to twenty times a day, asking what’s the status of this, what’s the status of that.”

With Cohn’s help, Trump’s Grand Hyatt New York on East 42nd street was practically built by the mafia. According to the FBI, the demolition company was secretly owned by a top Philadelphia mobster with extensive ties to Atlantic City; Biff Halloran—who was later convicted in a price gouging racket run by the mob—poured the concrete for the hotel; and the carpentry contract was given to a Genovese family-controlled enterprise, as later discovered through a federal probe.

Donald Trump partnered with John Staluppi, and slapped his name on a line of stretch limousines for his casinos. According to the FBI, Staluppi was a made member of the Colombo crime family, yet Trump claimed to know nothing about Staluppi’s mob ties. Trump’s ties to another mafia figure he claimed to not know—Joseph Weichselbaum—are much more extensive. While living out of Trump Tower in 1986 (part of his rent was paid by allowing Trump access to his fleet of private helicopters), Weichselbaum plead guilty to federal charges of cocaine smuggling. Trump and Weichselbaum were so close that Trump provided a letter to the court on behalf of his friend as someone who was “conscientious, forthright and diligent.” After his three-year sentence ended, Weichselbaum came home to an even nicer apartment at Trump Tower, and when Trump was asked about his letter to the judge by casino officials in 1990, he said he did not remember writing it.

Robert LiButti was such a heavy hitter at Trump’s casinos that they complied with his wish to not have any African Americans or women deal while he lost over $20 million at his tables between 1984 and 1990. Trump’s casinos were subsequently fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for these violations, and in 1991, LiButti was banned from Atlantic City entirely as regulators concluded that he was an associate of John Gotti—the boss of the Gambino crime family. When a reporter later asked Trump about LiButti, Trump responded: “I wouldn’t know him if he was standing in front of me.”

Now to be fair, no federal probe has ever labeled Trump a “mob associate,” which is what the FBI calls someone under the sway of organized crime, but Trump clearly has a pattern of getting into bed with bad dudes and conveniently forgetting about them when it eventually blows up in his face. So if you are of the opinion that any Trump-Russia business connections are farfetched, ask yourself, if he’ll tie himself to almost any member of the Italian mob, what’s stopping him from working with people connected to the Russian mafia? (who are inherently tied to Russian oligarchs, who are inherently tied to the Kremlin)

“I don’t settle lawsuits—very rare—because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you.” — Donald Trump in March 2016

In part one, I chronicled Trump’s statements related to Russia over the years, and in the late 2000’s, he clearly became much more interested in doing business with Moscow. This is exemplified by perhaps his most high-profile failure, which is filled with shady Russian connections and a settlement that was made on the condition that those settling could not cooperate with a parallel criminal investigation into the project. Per the New York Times’ report on Trump SoHo, a 46-story luxury condominium/hotel in Lower Manhattan:

He and his co-defendants settled the case in November 2011, agreeing to refund 90 percent of $3.16 million in deposits, while admitting no wrongdoing. The backdrop to that unusual denouement was a gathering legal storm that threatened to cast a harsh light on how he did business. Besides the fraud accusations, a separate lawsuit claimed that Trump SoHo was developed with the undisclosed involvement of convicted felons and financing from questionable sources in Russia and Kazakhstan. And hovering over it all was a criminal investigation, previously unreported, by the Manhattan district attorney into whether the fraud alleged by the condo buyers broke any laws, according to documents and interviews with five people familiar with it. The buyers initially helped in the investigation, but as part of their lawsuit settlement, they had to notify prosecutors that they no longer wished to do so. The criminal case was eventually closed.

The Times provided additional details about the portion of the settlement requiring those cooperating with the criminal investigation:

That part required the plaintiffs to notify any investigative agency with which they “may have previously cooperated” that they did not want to “participate in any investigation or criminal prosecution” related to matters in the lawsuit, according to a confidentiality agreement signed by more than 20 people. The plaintiffs could respond to a subpoena or court order, but would also have to notify the defendants that they had received it, the agreement said. The criminal investigation was closed sometime afterward.

Bayrock is a development company with offices based out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, and it is largely inactive these days, save for fighting any remaining lawsuits against it. They were one of two partners on Trump SoHo. As far as Bayrock’s involvement in the project, Trump said in a deposition that he and Arif worked on “numerous deals all over the world” and:

“Bayrock knew the people, knew the investors, and in some cases I believe they were friends of Mr. Arif. And this was going to be Trump International Hotel and Tower Moscow, Kiev, Istanbul, etc., Poland, Warsaw.”

Arif grew up in Kazakhstan, which was part of the Soviet Union until 1992. He worked in the Soviet Ministry of Commerce and Trade as Deputy Director of Hotel Management for 17 years. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he worked for a short while in Turkey, before moving the states, buying property in Brooklyn, then subsequently founding Bayrock in Trump Tower.

Bayrock is connected to a litany of shady figures in the former Soviet Union—one being Viktor Khrapunov, the ex-mayor of Almaty, Kazakhstan. According to the Financial Times, lawyers for the city told a U.S. court in March 2016 that Khrapunov and his family “conspired to systematically loot hundreds of millions of dollars of public assets…and to launder their ill-gotten gains through a complex web of bank accounts and shell companies…particularly in the United States.” Three of the networks in Almaty’s case were Soho 3310, Soho 3311, and Soho 3202—all LLC’s, which enabled them to hide their ownership.

After they were created in April 2013, property records show that they paid $3.1 million to purchase apartments in Trump SoHo, and bank statements tied those purchases to Khrapunov’s daughter in California, Elvira Kudryashova—a purported central link in this laundering scheme. The same amount of money was shown to leave Kudryashova’s Wells Fargo account to New York lawyer Martin Jajan, who signed the purchase documents for the apartments in Trump SoHo, with the central benefits going to Bayrock/Sapir Organization LLC.

A 2007 Bayrock investor presentation cites Alexander Mashevich’s “Eurasia Group” as a partner. Along with two other Kazakh billionaires—Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov—the three who would come to be known as “the Trio” who ran the Eurasian Natural Resources Cooperation.

The Trio has been involved in the standard bribery, money laundering and racketeering that defines the post-Soviet republics, and they subsequently controlled a huge portion of Kazakhstan’s mineral and gas reserves. State Department cables leaked by Wikileaks in 2010 demonstrate a very close relationship between the Trio and Nursultan Nazarbayev—who has been Kazakhstan’s president since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, with his last “reelection” coming with a Saddam Hussein-like 98% of the vote. This is the world that Trump was referring to when he said “Bayrock knew the people, knew the investors.”

However, the former Soviet Republic is not where Arif’s most damning Kremlin connections come into play, but through an Icelandic fund called FL Group which tends to find its way into many of Trump’s investments. According to James S. Henry’s must-read deep dive into Trump’s business ties to Russia in The American Interest:

For purposes of our story, the most interesting thing about Iceland is that, long before this crisis hit and utterly bankrupted FL Group, our two key Russian/FSU/Brooklyn mobster-mavens, Arif and Sater, had somehow stumbled on this obscure Iceland fund. Indeed, in early 2007 they persuaded FL Group to invest $50 million in a project to build the Trump SoHo in mid-town Manhattan.

The 2007 Bayrock investor presentation linked to above named FL Group as the Trio’s other “strategic partner” in this venture. The Trump Organization denied any connection with FL Group despite the fact that with an 18% stake in Trump SoHo, Donald Trump personally had to sign off on the deal.

In the 1990s, Iceland turned their banking industry into a neoliberal paradise, and this produced massive returns for their investors obscured by the cloak of privatization up until the financial crisis of 2008, where Iceland was hit incredibly hard. Iceland’s largest private investment fund prior to the 2008 crash? FL Group, who had a dizzying series of connections to all of Iceland’s major financial institutions. Per Henry’s investigation in The American Interest:

Fourth, Iceland’s largest banks also made a series of extraordinary loans to Russian interests during the run-up to the 2008 crisis. For example, one of Russia’s wealthiest oligarchs, a close friend of President Putin, nearly managed to secure at least €400 million (or, some say, up to four times that much) from Kaupthing, Iceland’s largest bank, in late September 2008, just as the financial crisis was breaking wide open. This bank also had important direct and indirect investments in FL Group. Indeed, until December 2006, it is reported to have employed the FL Group private equity manager who allegedly negotiated Felix Sater’s $50 million deal in early 2007.

Fifth, there are unconfirmed accounts of a secret U.S. Federal Reserve report that unnamed Iceland banks were being used for Russian money laundering. Furthermore, Kaupthing Bank’s repeated requests to open a New York branch in 2007-08 were rejected by the Fed. Similar unconfirmed rumors repeatedly appeared in Danish and German publications, as did allegations about the supposed Kazakh origins of FLG’s cash to be “laundered” in the Kriss lawsuit.

Toronto’s Trump Tower and Hotel

Alex Shnaider is a Russian-Canadian billionaire who partnered with Donald Trump to co-finance Toronto’s Trump Tower and Hotel, which was the tallest building in Canada before going out of business this past year. Shnaider is connected to FL Group in a litany of ways—one simple example being a €45.8 million loan to him from Kaupthing Bank to buy a yacht. Kaupthing Bank is one of the poster children of how the financial crisis wrecked the Icelandic economy—as more than 70 percent of the liabilities of the three biggest banks in Iceland (Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir) were denominated in foreign currency, with the banking system comprising eight times Icelandic GDP. In what I’m sure is a completely unrelated fact—in 2013, the CEO, chairman of the board and two other executives at Kaupthing Bank were sentenced to five years in jail for fraud.

An Icelandic Bank swimming in Kremlin cash is just the tip of the iceberg of Shnaider’s Russian connections, as his ex-father-in-law is Boris J. Birshtein. According to the FBI, Birshtein was a close business associate of Sergei Mikhaylov, who allegedly runs the largest branch of the Russian mob—Solntsevskaya Bratva. According to Fortune, this is the highest grossing organized crime group in the world. In a 1996 intelligence report compiled by the FBI, Birshtein put together a meeting in his Tel Aviv office to discuss “sharing interests in Ukraine” that included Mikhaylov, along with several other leaders of the Russian mafia. In the early 1990s, investigators tracked transfers for millions of dollars between bank accounts of Ukrainian government officials, Mikhaylov and Birshtein.

In 1993, Boris Yeltsin—the first president of Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union—accused Birshtein of illegally exporting seven million tons of Russian oil and then laundering the gains from it. According to the New York Times, Dmytro Iakoubovski—a former associate of Birshtein’s—was cooperating with this investigation, and a gunman fired three shots into his home, then left a note telling him to stop collaborating with the detectives. Birshtein laundered this money as part of a larger project at Seabeco, a company that former KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov said “was created in order to apply the KGB money.” According to the Belgian newspaper Le Soir, two of the three members of the Trio—Chodiev and Mashkevich—were also involved in this KGB front known as Seabeco.

So how does this connect to Alex Shnaider—Trump’s Toronto financier? Well, aside from Birshtein being family for a portion of Shnadier’s life, according to the Toronto Globe and Mail, Shnaider started working for Birshtein at Seabeco’s headquarters in Zurich in 1991. The Toronto Globe and Mail reported that Shnaider left Seabeco in January 1994 to start his own company with an unknown Belgian partner. Kudos to James Henry of The American Interest for finding this Le Soir article showing that Mikhaylov and Birshtein co-founded MAB International in Antwerp, Belgium at that exact same time. If this were a tweet, this is where the thinking face emoji would go.

So to recap, Trump’s Toronto financier came up through the ranks a company which was quite literally created by the KGB in order to swim in untraceable cash; was able to obtain a massive loan to buy a freaking yacht from a Kremlin-connected bank holding a significant stake in an investment fund which helped finance Trump’s New York SoHo debacle—one which Trump settled a civil lawsuit filed against him where one of the central provisions was that those helping with the criminal investigation had to stop talking to the feds. Nothing to see here.

Now this brings us to the last part of this whole triumvirate—one that is ongoing to this very day.",https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/the-kremlins-man-how-donald-trumps-businesses-are.html
