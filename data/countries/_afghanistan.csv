Bird flu continued to be the main challenge for the west region in February 2018. Initially in January, bird flu was found in 4 farms, but the disease has now spread to several hundred poultry farms. As a result 460,000 chicken were disposed from affected farms.

The deteriorated security situation has resulted in the closure of several health facilities: two in Kandahar (Maruf Comprehensive Health Centre (CHC) and Nish CHC) and one in Urozgan province (Oshey CHC).

At the same time, Speen Jomat Basic Health Center (BHC) is the only open facility in Chaparhar district. Mobile health services have been used by partners to cover the vulnerable population.

Active fighting resulted in internal displacement of people in the Southern region, where in February alone 139 IDP families were identified in Kandahar, 489 in Urozgan and 205 in Helmand.",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/who-afghanistan-monthly-programme-update-february-2018-emergency-humanitarian

“I lost my son in one of these explosions, and his family are without any support. I am asking the Taliban to accept our demand for peace,” said Khial Bibi, a women participant among peace activists that have set up tents in the Afghan province of Helmand and will march to a Taliban controlled district to demand an end to the war.

Afghanistan has been unstable for decades with terrorists and rival armed groups fighting for control of the country; hurting and disturbing common people’s life.

There are many people like Khial Bibi and her family in the crisis led parts of Afghanistan where bomb blasts are not so uncommon. The most recent among these blasts is a car bomb blast near Lashkar Gah, which killed at least 14 people and wounded another 47.

The car bomb blast highlighted the threat of violence and terror across Afghanistan and with the spring season coming up, it is expected to pick up even more as it has been in the past years.

The Taliban is seeking to restore strict Islamic rule which ended with US-led troops defeating them in 2001.

A new Army formation deployed to Afghanistan is dedicated to focusing the power of the Afghan military and government on taking the fight to the Taliban to convince the group to reconcile.

The 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade will help the Afghan national security apparatus to increase its effectiveness. Members of the unit will advise down to the brigade and kandak level. A kandak is roughly the size of a battalion. There is a mix of advisers and self-protection forces in the unit.

Army Col. Scott Jackson, the commander of the brigade, spoke to reporters traveling with Marine Corps Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, last week. Jackson spoke via phone from his headquarters at Advising Platform Lightning near Gardez, Afghanistan.

Purpose-Built Brigade

The brigade is a purpose-built organization designed, selected, trained and equipped specifically for this mission. Every individual is a volunteer.

Jackson deployed numerous times to Iraq and advised Iraqi troops. He said the changes in Afghan forces over the last eight years have been incredible. In 2010, U.S. forces were in the lead, partnering with Afghan forces in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida. Afghan soldiers accompanied Americans on combat patrols.

It is an Afghan battle now, Jackson said. They are in the lead, they decide the goals and they assign the resources. Afghans are the ones who gather the information and launch the strikes.

The 1st SFAB is falling in on established advisers at the train, advise and assist commands in Afghanistan. Those commands work at the corps-level and higher. Jackson’s command will advise six brigades and up to 36 maneuver battalions.

Each Afghan brigade has roughly 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers and is led by a brigadier general. “Then I have various types of battalion-level advising teams largely focused on advising the maneuver forces -- the infantry battalions in the Afghan army,” Jackson said.

The brigade also has specialty advising teams that can cover down on everything from military intelligence to signal to engineers to field artillery and logistics.

“We cover all the functions that a regular U.S. Army brigade does,” Jackson said. The brigade, he said, will be advising units all over the country from the German-led Train Advise Assist Command – North in Mazar-e-Sharif to the [train, advise and assist commands] in Helmand and Kandahar in the south.

Training Afghan Forces

While the teams are going to partner with Afghan battalions, a good bit of the brigade force structure will engage with Afghan forces on the institutional training side. Each of the Afghan corps have a regional military training center and Afghan units use these to maintain their proficiency.

“We’re going to apply some of our advising skills to those training academies, too,” Jackson said.

This arrangement allows the Afghans to employ forces and build readiness at the same time.

Army Lt. Col. Jason Sabat, a battalion commander in the brigade based at Train, Advise, Assist Command South, has 14 teams advising units in the Afghan 205th Corps. “We fill the gap from brigade and below,” he said. “So of the four brigades that make up the 205th Corps, we are trying to align -- at a minimum -- a team that can persistently advise that brigade commander and staff.”

But the brigades are separated and that may not always be the case, he said. If so Sabat’s unit has a periodic advisory capacity to go out to those brigade headquarters to advise them.

About half of Sabat’s unit has been deployed to Afghanistan in the past. This familiarity with the region and the culture is allowing his personnel to move quickly into place.

With the introduction of the SFAB, U.S. advisors have the capability to accompany kandaks on operations, but that will only happen after a rigorous examination of the risk/reward ratio, Sabat said. “There is a [concept of operations] process that we will work through before we embed,” he said. “That takes under consideration the risks involved in the mission, the duration we’ve been with the unit, how well we know them, how long we’ve been in theater .”

The examination is a very deliberate process for all the right reasons. “We haven’t been [advising] at these levels for quite some time,” Sabat said. “Approval authority for accompanying a unit runs the gamut from the train, advise [and] assist commander to the commander of the Resolute Support Mission.”

Sabat and his advisors will be co-located with many of the units they advise in Kandahar. “This will allow the advisors to do their jobs, and since they will walk into the compound, advisors can assess what the maintenance picture is like in the unit, how many forces are assigned and how many are present for duty,” he said.

‘You See an Increased Bravado’

The Afghans are pleased to see American forces advising them once again. “In some of the initial engagements you see an increased bravado -- sense of intestinal fortitude in the Afghans seeing a physical commitment standing there in front of them,” Sabat said.

But the reappearance of American advisers does not mean a shift to Americans doing the fighting. “The first tool you reach for should be an Afghan tool,” said Army Capt. Kristopher Farrar, an SFAB team leader who will be advising the 3rd Kandak, 4th Brigade on Tactical Base Gamberi in Train, Advise, Assist Command East. “We make sure that we use their soldiers, their weapons, their procedures and we are just helping refine that. In the past, where we may have tried to have the Afghans mirror the U.S. way of doing things, we’re trying to help them make their processes work smoother.”

Afghan forces have made great strides and have been conducting operations on their own. “We don’t want to re-impose that dependence,” Farrar said. “They’ve been fighting, they’ve been winning. We just want to help with those small adjustments that maybe they don’t see. An outside set of eyes is always good for any formation, and that’s what we are providing to these kandaks .”

Afghan forces are working to perfect intelligence sharing among the various entities that make up the security forces and the operations that result. Advisers help with that and the various corps in the country are working to gather and disperse intelligence, working with army, police, special operations forces and other entities to handle complex operations.

A recent operation in the eastern part of the country points to the progress made. Afghan commanders used intelligence from the National Directorate of Security to develop an operation plan to move into population centers. Special operations forces -- the famed Afghan commandoes -- led the way with shaping operations. Conventional forces interspersed with police followed. The corps used ScanEagle drones for intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, and then used MD-530 helicopters and A-29 Super Turcano fixed-wing attack aircraft to hit enemy positions.

Successful Operation

All aspects of the military participated, all pillars of the Afghan government melded for the operation. The operation was a success.

“You can fight battles nose-to-nose -- anybody can do that,” Jackson said. “But if we do our jobs right, the Afghans are not getting into a nose-to-nose street fight.”

Afghan forces need to use their all aspects of the nation’s power against the Taliban to convince the group that it is not worth continuing the fight. “That means effectively using intelligence, air power, ground forces, artillery -- the whole bit,” the colonel said.

The advisers have just hit the ground, and Jackson insists they will be deliberate in their actions.

“We are not going to run out beyond our headlights,” he said. The teams will understand the environment, understand the risks and understand the missions.

3,afghanistan,"Every week, IRIN’s team of specialist editors curates a reading list of humanitarian trends and developments from around the globe.

Counting wars and arms deals

To the lawyers, there's more than one kind of ""war”. Important why, you ask? Because different categories carry particular obligations and legal implications. The Geneva Academy’s 2017 War Report lays out these distinctions for the 55 situations of armed violence it says amounted to armed conflicts last year. A country-against-country war is an IAC – an international armed conflict. In 2017, there were six IACs. Some (the one between Israel and Syria, for example) flare up and finish quickly. Others, the report says, can run for decades (think India and Pakistan). It also describes 11 ""belligerent occupations"" and 38 non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). In a novel development, the conflict in Mexico between the state and two criminal cartels is described as a NIAC – the same category as the Iraqi government's fight against so-called Islamic State. Nine of the 55 conflicts involved Syria.

All these wars don't arm themselves. The latest trade figures from think tank SIPRI show that arms imports to the Middle East have doubled in the last 10 years. Africa and the Americas are buying less however, on a five-year trend line. SIPRI's data doesn't provide dollar figures, instead using its own methods to show volume and trends. But in 2015, it estimated the value of the trade at $91.3 billion. And it's gone up since then. Total military expenditure, on the other hand, was $1.6 trillion in 2016, according to SIPRI. Global humanitarian funding last year was just 1.3 percent of that, according to the UN's Financial Tracking Service.

Swipe right for blackmail in Nairobi

UN staff have been lured into armed robberies and blackmailed by criminals stalking dating apps in Kenya, according to UN security officials. After meetings in public places and some preliminary rapport-building, victims are lured to ""an unknown apartment"" where they are ""locked in, held at gunpoint and robbed of their money, phone, credit cards and other valuables by an organised criminal group"", a UN warning to senior management stated.

That internal advisory message, obtained by IRIN, said staff or their family members seeking same-sex meet-ups are particularly being targeted. In some cases, threats of ""exposure"" accompany demands for payments (made with mobile money) even after the initial robbery.

The message, sent to members of the UN's in-country security management team, stated: ""online dating opens the doors to certain vulnerabilities."" Nairobi hosts the UN's largest presence in the developing world and is a key hub for humanitarian efforts in the East Africa region. Sodomy in Kenya is punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and human rights groups say harassment and homophobia are rife. These laws are being challenged on constitutional grounds by activists, including the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. Contacted by phone, an officer with the Nairobi diplomatic police told IRIN he was not aware of the UN warning.

Turkey’s mixed message to Syrians

This week, we brought you a story from Istanbul on the shifting attitudes and political rhetoric towards the millions of Syrians who have sought safe haven in Turkey over the past seven years. But even as Turkey has welcomed many refugees and advocated an open-door policy for its neighbours fleeing war, it has also – according to this new Human Rights Watch report – shot asylum seekers attempting to cross its borders and intercepted and deported thousands back to Syria. Turkey says it continues to accept refugees and does not use violence, but IRIN reported on the shootings and closures back in March 2016, and HRW has been meticulously documenting these incidents for years. Next week, we’ll bring you up to speed on efforts to integrate Syrian students into Turkish schools, a move complicated by the fact that a good number of Turks are increasingly frustrated with the idea that many refugees may end up sticking around for good.

After Afghanistan’s mild winter, fears of food shortages and migration surges

An unusually mild winter in Afghanistan is stoking fears of water shortages for the upcoming growing season. Snowpack levels recorded in February were the lowest Afghanistan has seen for any month since 2001, according to NASA. Water from snowmelt is crucial for irrigating downstream crops, and this year’s near-record low levels point to a heightened risk of food insecurity, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. This volatility could have far-reaching impacts in a country struggling with multiple insurgencies, mass displacement, and the reintegration of hundreds of thousands of Afghans returning from abroad. A weak harvest would mean fewer jobs in the local agriculture sector, and fewer opportunities will likely push unemployed youth to look for work in neighbouring countries – just one of the many factors driving migration from Afghanistan. Yet Afghans are at the same time returning in droves from Pakistan, Iran, and European countries. This continuing influx means more people competing for fewer opportunities and shrinking wages, pushing more young Afghans to look elsewhere for work… again. Not to mention that conflict is spreading and last year killed or injured more than 10,000 civilians.

Beyond “ethnic violence” in Congo’s Ituri

The Democratic Republic of Congo’s long-troubled Ituri Province, where recent attacks have caused hundreds of civilian deaths (including many infants) and led around 100,000 people to flee their homes, made it to the UK’s flagship news programme this week. Kudos to BBC Africa Editor Fergal Keane for seeing beyond the reductive cliché of “ethnic conflict” – even though members of one community are meting out unspeakable brutality against those of another. Keane’s report pointed to hidden hands behind the killings, possibly with a view to keeping President Joseph Kabila in power far longer than many people want. Keane had only five minutes to put Ituri on the map, so it’s understandable he only scratched the surface of what’s really behind the horror. IRIN reporters in Congo and Uganda – now hosting more than 40,000 refugees from Ituri – have delved deeper. Politics does appear to be part of the story, but so does oil, as well as aborted reconciliation efforts after previous clashes. We’ll publish their reporting and analysis next week.

“A policy that knowingly and unrelentingly harms children for political ends”

More strong words against Australia’s offshore detention programme for asylum seekers, this time from a senior UNHCR official who had just visited Nauru, the Pacific Island nation where some 300 refugees and asylum seekers are still detained. In an op-ed published in The Guardian this week, Indrika Ratwatte, the UN refugee agency’s director for Asia and the Pacific, called Australia’s policy an “abomination”. Since 2013, Australia has forced asylum seekers arriving by boat to have their refugee claims processed on Nauru or on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. The Australian government says it won’t ever allow people known as ‘boat arrivals’ to settle in Australia even if refugee status is granted – which has been the case for the large majority. Last year, authorities shut down the detention centre on Manus Island. Several hundred remaining refugees and asylum seekers await a slow resettlement process to the United States; some asylum seekers face looming deportations, while others whose refugee applications were rejected are stuck in legal limbo, forbidden to be deported but equally forbidden to settle permanently in PNG.

TINICUM >> U.S. Army SPC James Long Jr. had a simple reaction Friday as he received a hero’s welcome at the Philadelphia airport following his nine-month deployment to Afghanistan: “It’s good to be home ... This is awesome.”

Long was greeted with a hug from his mother as he crossed through security at C terminal in Philadelphia International Airport.

In addition to his family, Warriors’ Watch Riders, A Hero’s Welcome and Stars, Stripes, Bars and Pipes biker support groups were on hand to greet Long with a flag salute and escort to his families home in Aston.

Philadelphia police escorted the motorcyclists and family south through a torrential downpour along the Industrial Highway, avoiding gridlocked I-95. At Aston, township police and firefighters joined the group escorting them past the Aston Fire Co., where Long is a volunteer firefighter.

Long, a graduate of Marple Newtown High School, enlisted in the Army following high school and served in the 82nd airborne, said his father, James Long Sr. During his time in Afghanistan he performed numerous patrol operations, receiving a combat medal. He spent much of his time in the Kandahar area as well as performing his speciality of mortar operations.

“I’m glad he’s home safe, that’s for sure, “ said his mother, Kelley Long. “I am so proud of him but it is very difficult.”

Kelley Long said on base, the family was able to communicate with their son through Face Time but when he was on patrol he was out of touch for weeks at a time.

Long Sr. said the family was not able to talk to him about the two causalities his unit suffered during his time in Afghanistan.

In August the Army reported Spc. Christopher Harris, 25, of Jackson Springs, N.C., and Sgt. Jonathon Hunter, 23, of Columbus, Ind., both of the 82nd Airborne division, died near Kandahar City.

“He’s coming to the end of his four years and is still trying to decide wether to re-enlist,” said Long Sr. “He loved it and didn’t want to leave. It was a life-long dream to serve in the military.”

Long is home for two weeks and then will return to Fort Bragg.

Maria Hyland, representative for A Hero’s Welcome, said the groups have been active for the past ten years welcoming returning soldiers home. She said they have hundreds of members and anyone is welcome to join.

Attacks and insecurity continue in troubled Afghanistan (Keystone)

Switzerland and Afghanistan have signed an agreement in Kabul to boost development cooperation and humanitarian aid to the troubled country.

“This enhances the legal basis for cooperation between the two countries,” a Swiss government press releaseexternal link stated on Tuesday.

The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has had a permanent presence in the Afghan capital since 2002, after the fall of the Taliban. Its programmes include support to vulnerable populations, education and agriculture.

They also focus on helping to build trust in Afghan state institutions, such as the police and judicial system. Swiss aid has, for example, been used to recruit and train 3,500 female police officers.

Security for aid workers in the country is a major issue. The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) temporarily suspended its operations in Afghanistan last year after six of its staff were killed.

The SDC’s cooperation strategy for Afghanistan is “guided by a long-term commitment, even in periods of instability and insecurity”, according to the government.

It told a conference in late 2016 that Switzerland will continue funding humanitarian projects in Afghanistan to the tune of CHF26 million ($27.7 million) per year until 2020.

6,afghanistan,"The continuing political crisis following a serious of failed negotiations between Ashraf Ghani and Atta Muhammad Noor does not bode well for stability and national unity of Afghanistan. It could also endanger the hard-gained achievements of the last decade and a half. The protracted political tension between Kabul and Balkh that has undermined Ashraf Ghani’s administration is not a new development. In fact, since the establishment of the National Unity Government (NUG) in 2014, the Afghan political atmosphere has been uneasy between its leaders. The situation has continued to impede governance and led to the rise of insecurity across the country. It is due to the fact that NUG agreement between Ghani and Abdullah did not materialize since early days of the unity government due to disputes on sharing power and delegating of authorities. After becoming president, Ashraf Ghani reneged on those promises by sidelining his political rival and centralizing power at the presidential palace. As a result, the Chief Executive Office, led by Abdullah as shareholder of the National Unity Government, lost his authority.

If NUG agreement which promised an equal sharing of power between Abdullah and Ghani had been implemented, perhaps Afghanistan would have been in a better security and political condition now. It is because the NUG agreement had outlined some key and important issues that could have led the state toward political stability. For instance, it was agreed to hold a constitutional Loya Jirga after two years by turning the CEO into a prime minister position. The agreement had also emphasized on electoral reforms and devolution of power among provinces. This would have equally distributed the political power at the national and provincial levels, which has remained a contentious issue among Afghan political elites since the collapse of Taliban in 2001. Additionally, NUG agreement would have allowed provincial governments to exert more power; since centralization has proved a failure during the last fifteen years, especially in a multi-ethnic society such as Afghanistan.

When the unity government was being negotiated by the United States, the Afghan people were hopeful that the new government would uplift the economy and improve security. But after three and a half years, the country is appallingly insecure, politically fragmented and economically stagnant.

With the deteriorating security situation across the country, NUG and its leadership have lost legitimacy and become unpopular in the eyes of the Afghan people. The spike of violence in Kabul and Jalalabad, which has cost countless innocent lives during the last couple weeks, is a testament to the decline of security in major cities. Afghans do not feel safe in rural or urban areas anymore. One of the reasons is the incompetence and poor leadership of the security sectors in maintaining security that have become heavily politicized in recent years.

Besides worsening security situation, the Afghan political front also remains fractious and unstable. Since the center and periphery political dispute that has emerged, it appears that Ashraf Ghani’s dismissal of Atta Mohammad Noor in December 2017 was a miscalculation despite the assurances he had from his CEO. Abdullah had already lost legitimacy particularly in the last two years and therefore he could not speak on behalf of Jamiat and other party members. This is due to the fact that Abdullah was unable to stand against Ghani in claiming his authorities based on NUG agreement.

Consequently, Abdullah was incapable to represent the wider Tajik political base and more importantly-Jamiat-i-islami which had supported his candidacy during the 2014 election. As Abdullah has become unpopular among supporters and irrelevant within NUG, Atta has gained popularity among his party members and is now seen as a decisive leader who negotiates with Ashraf Ghani. Given Atta’s rise at the center of Afghan politics, the assessment to oust him has proved failure and undermined Ashraf Ghan’s authority as the head of NUG.

Since the appointment of a successor to Balkh governorship, Mohammad Dawood, Atta has not allowed the new governor to occupy his position by directly challenging Ashraf Ghani’s political and constitutional authority. Moreover, Atta has already consolidated his power within Jamiat and some other political parties with expanding his support not only within his Tajik base, but also among Uzbek and Hazara ethnic groups. Since the inception of political showdown between Kabul and Balkh, Atta has also been regularly meeting people from all segments of Afghan society and political spectrum. He has mostly been condemning and slamming NUG and its policies in these events and gatherings.

Initially, there were reports that the central government could use military force to remove Atta as Balkh governor. This would certainly be a dangerous move as a military conflict will undermine the nearly two decades U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Furthermore, it could lead to fragmentation of the state along ethnic lines since Atta has enormous support among different ethnic groups.

8,afghanistan,"KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban appear to have rejected the bold proposal by President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to invite them for direct peace talks with the government. In an unsigned commentary published last week on their official website, the Taliban said, “The permission of peace and war are with the Americans ….” and claimed that their policy of wanting to “talk to American invaders about peace and stability rather than talking to their slave regime is now widely accepted by the independent Western analysts and other intellectuals.”

Instead of dealing with the Kabul government, the Taliban want to talk to the United States, which they see as the decisive actor on the battlefield. Even with the United States’ diminished direct combat role since 2015, American airstrikes and operations by American special forces pose the gravest danger to the Taliban.

Over years of interviews with Taliban fighters and leadership I have found that the narrative of the United States being the primary enemy unites them. In recent weeks, the Taliban too have called for peace talks but only with the United States.

Mr. Ghani’s proposal and his speech did not mention the potential withdrawal of American and other foreign forces from Afghanistan, which is a core demand of the Taliban. A declaration signed by the participants at the Kabul Process meeting on Feb. 28, at which Mr. Ghani made his offer, hinted at the possibility of discussing such a withdrawal.

The elections are considered a dry run for the presidential vote to be held in 2019 and a test of whether Afghanistan’s Western-backed government can overcome past election problems of poor security and fraud.

President Ashraf Ghani and international donor countries have all said elections need to happen this year. Some Western diplomats doubt, however, that there is enough time to organize the vote in 2018.

The Independent Elections Commission (IEC) would hold the election on Oct. 20, IEC chairman Gula Jan Abdul Badi Sayad said on Friday. He said voter registration would start in mid-April.

The current parliament’s five-year term was to expire in June 2015, but Ghani extended it by decree amid security fears and disagreements on how to prevent fraud.

The main challenges ahead of the vote are registering Afghans, many of whom do not have identification documents, and setting up ballot stations in remote areas. Plans for voter security and preventing fraud are also critical.

Afghanistan has held two parliamentary elections since the end of Taliban rule, in 2005 and 2010. District council elections have never been held.

WASHINGTON - A senior US envoy has said the Taliban could not expect direct talks with the US as had happened in the case of North Korea.

The Taliban are the stumbling block to the peace process, the Trump administration alleged on Friday, ruling out direct talks with it unless the militant leaders engaged with the elected Afghan government.

In an apparent response to a recent letter from the Taliban to the US, the Trump team also ruled out withdrawing troops from Afghanistan - a precondition set by the rebels for talks.

America’s senior diplomat for South and Central Asia said the US was in Afghanistan at the request of its government and people would be stay there to make sure the country did not become a safe haven for terrorists again.

“The recent Taliban letter to the people of the United States, I believe, misses the point. For eight years, the US has been prepared to support a peace process, but we cannot be a substitute for the Afghan people in the Afghan government negotiations with the Taliban,” Alice Wells remarked.

Speaking at the US Institute of Peace, a Congress-supported think-tank, she said: “The Taliban were at war with the Afghan people long before US military operations began in 2001. Now obviously the US has a direct interest in the resolution of this conflict and the Taliban have frequently stated the need for all foreign troops to depart Afghanistan is a precondition for negotiations.

“We are in Afghanistan as a guest of a sovereign Afghan government that’s recognised by the UN and international community, with our presence enshrined in the strategic partnership agreement and a bilateral security agreement.”

She added the US would continue its mission so long as the independent Afghan government agreed to host and work with the Americans.

To a question, she said the Taliban could not expect direct talks with the US as had happened in the case of North Korea. There was no comparison between North and South Korea and Afghanistan, the diplomat argued.

Wells noted North and South Korea had spoken to each other in advance of the president’s offer to engage in the conversation.

“So, what we’re looking for in Afghanistan is a fundamental recognition that in an insurgency, the insurgents and the government that is ruling need to engage in a conversation with one another as well as with other interested parties to that settlement. We have been very consistent in this approach,” Wells said.

President Ashraf Ghani recently concluded the second Kabul Process conference, laying out some important principles in his remarks about implementation of the peace process. That would require the support of the international community.

There was no way to walk away from Afghanistan even in a time of peace. “But I can certainly assure you we understand how difficult it is and how essential it is to the success of the overall effort.

“Certainly it’s only going to be when we see the success of the stabilisation of Afghanistan that we in the international community can draw the confidence that the level of our presence is not required,” Wells said.

The Afghan government’s ability to manage its own security and territory in a responsible fashion would all feed into the international assessment of how to structure future relations with Afghanistan, Wells said.

Accusing the Taliban of being indifferent to the Afghan people, she believed it was time for the conflict to end. “There’s a way to end this conflict. There’s a will to end this conflict. There’s international support to this. It’s the Taliban who are the stumbling block to peace.”

The diplomat said it was up to the Taliban leaders to respond to this serious offer of talks from Ghani. The US supported Ghani’s move and was prepared to facilitate it, the official explained.

Wells said when it came to the United States, its conditions-based South Asia strategy ensured the Taliban could not win on the battlefield, but it recognised that a resolution to the conflict would be through a negotiated settlement.",https://nation.com.pk/11-Mar-2018/us-rules-out-direct-talks-with-taliban

The U.S. military is racing to demonstrate it is making progress in Afghanistan during a critical period that will test President Trump’s strategy and, potentially, political support for the war.

Military leaders say the arrival of new troops and aircraft, along with a renewed mission to advise local operations more closely, will help reverse a Taliban resurgence that has exposed the fragility of the long American project in Afghanistan.

“This is not another year of the same thing we’ve been doing for 17 years,” Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a tour of military facilities across Afghanistan last week. “This is a fundamentally different approach.”

With an increased U.S. force of about 15,000, focused largely on efforts to ensure Afghan troops can launch offensives against the Taliban, Dunford said that “the right people at the right level with the right training” are in place ahead of the 2018 fighting season, a sentiment repeated by other commanders.

Yet looming over the battlefield push are questions about how long support can be sustained, given skepticism in Europe about an open-ended military effort and ambivalence from Trump about involvement in foreign wars.

Some experts remain skeptical the new approach can succeed where President Barack Obama’s 2010-2011 surge, with far more troops, could not.

The Afghan forces would have to become “so capable and lethal” they could defeat the Taliban in battles with little help, said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. “I am not optimistic we are going to see that happen anytime soon.”

The stepped-up campaign comes as the architect of Trump’s Afghanistan strategy, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, prepares to exit the White House. His successor, John Bolton, may be a less ardent proponent of a muscular U.S. campaign.

Ronald E. Neumann, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under President George W. Bush, said the questions swirling in Western capitals were impossible for U.S. commanders to ignore. “That’s what’s driving the sense of speed” in large part, he said. “They don’t know how much firmness we have in our own project.”

In a sign of the renewed Pentagon focus on Afghanistan, Dunford’s tour was one of several high-level visits in recent weeks, including stops by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command.

Over four days, generals and advisers traveling with Dunford fanned out across the country to gather information on the readiness of Afghan forces and their foreign advisers.

Officials said Afghan forces are demonstrating an improved ability to employ their own air power — with newly trained pilots, combat-ready helicopters and small-scale drones — and are coordinating maneuvers with the army, police and elite commandos.

If sustained, it would be a major change from the period following the end of U.S. combat operations in 2014, when once-secure districts fell to the Taliban and Afghan forces made desperate appeals for American air power, then limited by a smaller U.S. force and a narrower mission. The message from Washington during those years was, in some officials’ rueful characterization, “Don’t lose.”

Now, with a re-energized air campaign and new advisory units with Afghan army battalions, U.S. officials are trying to build confidence among local units.

As an example of the kind of momentum Pentagon leaders hope will break the cycle of dependence on foreign forces, U.S. advisers described a recent operation to clear Taliban forces from a district of Laghman province, to the east of Kabul.

Aided by intelligence gathered by Afghanistan’s spy agency, local commandos conducted raids in narrow valleys abutting the Alingar River that officials said the Taliban used to launch attacks on Afghan checkpoints and lob rockets or artillery at nearby bases. Then Afghan police and army troops from the 201st Corps pushed into the area, backed by U.S. and Afghan aircraft.

When the operation was over, the provincial governor arrived in the area in an attempt to cement government control.

But the Taliban has a stronger grip in southern strongholds, vast parts of which remain no-go zones for security forces.

In an echo of previous years, U.S. Marines in Helmand province are advising the Afghan army’s 215th Corps as it seeks to clear roads around towns and cities that are hotbeds for insurgent activity. While U.S. advisers report growing autonomy among Afghan units, they acknowledge that many areas will remain outside government’s grip for the foreseeable future.

Operations in the south are “now based on what the Afghan army wants to do, where do they really think they need to have security,” said Lt. Col. Ryan Benson, a Marine adviser at Camp Shorab. “They know what they can hold, and they know what’s less important.”

A key aspect of the strategy centers on the newly formed Security Force Assistance Brigade, which will advise battalion-level units and, sometimes, accompany them into the field. Pentagon leaders say the Obama administration’s decision to end the practice of embedding advisers with lower-level Afghan army units, part of its plan to extricate the United States from the war, set the stage for the Taliban comeback after 2014.

Dunford said the Afghan government is gradually gaining ground, expanding its control of populated areas from 64 percent late last year to close to 70 percent today. The government hopes to add 10 percent more this year, he said.

Whether Afghanistan can hold parliamentary elections without major violence will help Pentagon officials gauge the strategy’s success in coming months, as will the number of Afghan military casualties. While the Afghan government does not disclose exact figures, U.S. officials say combat losses remain in the thousands each year.

Officials also hope to see a payoff from changes initiated by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, including a plan to retire thousands of politically connected senior officers. Until recently, U.S. officials like to say, the average age of corps commanders exceeded Afghanistan’s life expectancy by a decade.

[A Dubai shopping trip and a missed chance to capture the head of the Taliban]

Gen. John Nicholson Jr., commander of international forces in Afghanistan, said the strategy includes pressing Pakistan to shut down Taliban safe havens and squeezing the Taliban diplomatically after a recent peace initiative put forward by Ghani.

In more emphatic terms than ever before, military leaders are calling for a negotiated end to the war. The new urgency reflects an awareness of the Taliban’s ability to regenerate and an acknowledgment that the United States and NATO are unlikely to provide high levels of resources indefinitely.

“The number-one metric is how are we doing toward reconciliation,” Nicholson told reporters during Dunford’s visit.

While there have been episodic efforts to foster peace talks since 2001, the prospect of negotiations with a group responsible for killing thousands of Americans has been met with resistance at the Pentagon in the past.

Now, in a twist, the new push for peace lacks equal high-level support outside the military. In January, Trump rejected talking to the Taliban after a bloody suicide attack. The State Department, which has led reconciliation efforts in the past, has not appointed a senior official to work on that subject and recently laid off the few staff members involved.

Military leaders are also seeking to get more lower-level fighters to lay down their arms. Such efforts have taken place previously without recruiting a critical mass of fighters.

David Sedney, a top Pentagon official for Afghanistan during the Obama administration and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said important Taliban figures in Pakistan continue to believe that military victory is possible.

“However, among Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, the growing disillusionment with those Pakistan-based leaders is fueling a rising interest in peace,” he said. “It is too soon to say whether this will result in peace talks this year, but the possibility exists where it did not a year ago.”

Adding urgency to the complicated U.S. mission is the unpredictability of a commander in chief who acknowledged as he unveiled his plan to redouble the Afghanistan effort that his original instinct had been withdrawal.

“I share the American people’s frustration . . . over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money and, most importantly, lives,” Trump said last year.

It’s not yet clear how Trump’s ambivalence will be affected by the arrival of Bolton, who has voiced distrust in nation-building overseas and appears more focused on North Korea and Iran than Afghanistan.

Andrew Wilder, an Afghanistan scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said that signaling continuity in U.S. plans would be crucial. “With the new leadership, it’s important to be messaging that the strategy remains in place and the U.S. is committed to it, or its biggest advantage, which is that it’s not time-based, is lost,” he said.

Reassuring European nations is equally important. While several NATO nations recently announced increased troop levels, there are signs of growing resistance. Ian Lesser, vice president of the German Marshall Fund, a think tank, said NATO leaders were increasingly focused on threats from a resurgent Russia and terrorism groups on Europe’s eastern and southern borders. Adding to that, low public support for Afghanistan means that “the political pressure is definitely on,” he said.

“The fact that allies were able to make modest new investments reflects the fact that they didn’t want to get off on the wrong foot with the United States,” Lesser said. But he added, “For different reasons all around the alliance, people are going to have an increasingly hard time justifying this as an open-ended commitment.”

Key Messages

The weakening of the casual labor market since 2014 has made it more difficult for poor households to earn sufficient income to support dietary needs during the lean season. Furthermore, 2017 rainfed production was poor in some provinces, including in Ghor, Balkh, Jawzjan, Takhar, Badakhshan, Samangan, Herat, Baghlan, and Sar-i-Pul Provinces­­­­­. Poor households affected by poor own production or who were not able to find sufficient employment to support food purchases are likely experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes until local spring labor opportunities facilitate access to income and market purchases of food.

The ongoing conflict between various insurgent groups, primarily the Taliban and IS, and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has increased in geographic extent and severity in recent years, with more than 1.1 million people displaced since the beginning of 2016. Beyond displacement, insecurity has continued to disrupt normal livelihoods by limiting access to farms, rangelands, markets, and labor opportunities, and by reducing local economic activity. Although seasonal improvements in access to food and income will occur during the spring and summer months, displacement and reduced non-agricultural labor opportunities are expected to drive Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes throughout much of the country during the scenario period, with many households in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).

Snow accumulation and cumulative precipitation were well below average for the season through February 2018, with some basins at or near record low snowpack, with data since 2002. Forecast models indicate a likelihood for below-average precipitation through the end of the season in May 2018, with elevated risk for prolonged periods of dryness.

Just last Friday, the world was shocked once again by a treacherous terrorist attack in Trebes, a small town in southern France, which took the life of three civilians and one police officer. More than 200 people have fallen victim to terrorist attacks in France since 2015.

Turkey has been fighting against terrorism for nearly 40 years. On Jan 20, 2018, it launched the counterterrorism Operation Olive Branch to clean the Afrin region in northern Syria bordering Turkey of the People's Protection Units (YPG), which are affiliated with the PKK. The PKK, a group recognized as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the EU and U.S., has had a significant presence in Europe for decades. Ignoring warnings from Ankara on PKK terrorism, Europe has allowed its undisrupted growth and now faces a continuous threat from the PKK and its affiliated groups.

Peace for Afghanistan

Fighting terrorism is a matter of the highest concern for world leaders at large. On March 26-27, the government of Uzbekistan is holding a high-level international conference on Afghanistan in Tashkent. The Peace Process, Cooperation in the Sphere of Security and Regional Interaction conference is bringing together U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and special representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) Tadamichi Yamamoto, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini as well as the foreign ministers of China, Russia, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, India, Iran, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The summit was jointly opened by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who both delivered their keynote speeches at the opening ceremony. The conference is a follow-up to the Second Meeting of the Kabul Process on Feb. 28, 2018, which took place in the Afghan capital as a logical extension of the efforts undertaken by the international community to secure peace and stability in the country. The Tashkent meeting aims to get the conference participants to express a consolidated position on the necessity of starting direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

The March 26-27 summit also comes as the immediate aftermath of a detailed peace offer Ghani laid out to the Taliban whereby the Afghan government announced unconditional peace in a bid to bring the Taliban to the table for peace talks. Exhausted by the decades-long devastating war, Afghanistan's political parties, influential figures and people of wisdom fervently support the government's initiative to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis, put aside previous bad and bloody experiences and prevent them from repeating.

The Kabul Process

The Kabul Process meeting this February was a recognized success both due to its high-profile attendees from 26 countries, the EU and two international organizations, and a clearly worded four-page declaration on peace and reconciliation, and security cooperation and counterterrorism.

By adopting the Kabul Declaration, the participants reaffirmed their belief in the U.N. as a key authority for cooperation to counter terrorist threats as well as the necessity to fully implement relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.

It reaffirmed as well ""that the Kabul Process must lead to the renunciation of violence and breaking of all ties to international terrorism, as well as respect for the equal rights of all Afghans, including women, under the Afghan Constitution. Hence, we appreciate the Kabul Process as a main forum and vehicle under the leadership of the Afghan Government to lead peace efforts to end violence in Afghanistan.""

The meeting also reiterated the call made by the first Kabul Process meeting on June 6, 2017 on all armed groups to cease violence and start peace talks with the government by saying: ""We strongly support the Afghan Government's commitment to forging a practical plan for reconciliation, which includes negotiation of various issues and any contested aspect of the international community's future role in Afghanistan.""

Contribution to reconciliation

As an extension to the Kabul Process meetings, the Tashkent Peace Summit on Afghanistan reiterates in its final declaration the main points that buttresses the Kabul Process. It emphasizes the key role of the U.N. and necessity of an indisputable compliance with the provisions of the U.N. General Assembly and UNSC resolutions and calls for a ""guaranteed integration of the armed opposition into the political life of Afghanistan and its recognition as a legitimate political force"" of life of the Afghan society.

Participants at the Tashkent meeting express in the declaration their utmost opposition to ""all forms and manifestations of terrorism […] and recognize that the threats of transnational terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime are common challenges to stability and sustainable development both for Afghanistan, the region as a whole and the world at large.""

The Tashkent Summit is a follow-up as well to the first meeting of the newly established cooperation format Central Asia and Afghanistan, or C5+1, envisaged to focus on specific areas of interaction between the Central Asian countries and Afghanistan. It was created to contribute to Afghanistan's successful integration into regional trade and economy as well as for infrastructure development in Central Asia.

An immediate neighbor of Afghanistan, Uzbekistan is an active participant in almost all the international forums addressing the Afghan crisis such as the Kabul Process, Moscow Format, Heart of Asia – Istanbul Process, International Contact Group on Afghanistan, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Afghanistan Contact Group and the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA).

Added value of peace

Since its independence, Uzbekistan has always been an ardent supporter of a political settlement to the Afghan crisis, believing that building lasting peace in Afghanistan will bring stability and prosperity to Central Asia as a whole. Afghanistan's peaceful development is of indisputable benefit for the economic prosperity of the countries in the region. A peaceful Afghanistan would ensure the shortest possible access to the harbors on the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf for Central Asian countries to connect India, Iran and Pakistan to the markets of Europe and the Middle East. The region is rich in natural resources and enjoys unique cultural and civilizational potential for major influence on the development of many countries and entire regions.

As a landlocked country bordering almost all the countries of Central Asia, Uzbekistan is dependent on fiduciary relations with them and wants the region to be a zone of stability, sustainable development and good neighborly relations. According to Mirziyoyev, a peaceful and prosperous Central Asia is a key task for Uzbekistan to achieve.

To make peace in the region feasible, the conflict in Afghanistan must be resolved by peaceful means, since historically and geopolitically the country is an integral part of Central Asian, which is ""the heart of Eurasia […] connecting Europe and the Middle East, South and East Asia,"" according to Mirziyoyev. In the meantime, Central Asia is a crossing point of interests of world powers, and the region has become more than once a hotspot of instability and conflict and was directly impacted by the ongoing destabilizing processes in the near and far abroad.

Prospective development

All this raises the legitimate question of what is next in terms of regional developments. Will the region proceed in line with the projected scenario of conflicts and confrontation or follow a path of cooperation and progress?

Most probably this will depend on the readiness of Central Asian governments to assume responsibility for the common future of the region. As such, Uzbekistan is increasingly building its position of a proactive contributor and stakeholder in the process for a peace settlement and reconciliation in Afghanistan. It strongly believes that the future of Afghanistan is to be determined and built by the people of Afghanistan.

Is there hope for an end to the long war in Afghanistan? A month ago, President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban a “comprehensive peace deal.” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the United States is open to a peace settlement in Afghanistan. And some Taliban leaders have expressed an interest in talks, as well.

For now, however, the prospects for peace in Afghanistan remain grim. There are multiple steps to a potential deal — and many barriers to success. Here are five pitfalls on the road to peace.

1) Will the Taliban negotiate?

The Taliban chief, Haibatullah Akhundzada, has not responded to the peace offer. Some analysts are reading his silence as a sign of interest. But it is more likely that he does not want to negotiate. A powerful faction within the Taliban, the Quetta Shura, is not interested in talks.

The silence may reflect the Taliban’s military confidence, which would support fighting instead of negotiations. Scholars highlight two conditions under which rebels remain optimistic about their military prospects: when rebels have state backers who give them sanctuary and material support, and when rebels have access to funding streams from illicit economies.

The Taliban meets both criteria. Its leadership has sanctuary in Pakistan and Iran. It receives material support from Russia. The drug trade and kidnappings continue to provide high earnings. Many in the Taliban’s shura think that they stand a chance to win — and that the United States is out of steam.

[ The new U.S. plan in Afghanistan may add a local militia. That might be a bad idea. ]

The United States has tried to curtail the Taliban’s incentive to fight on, in part by increasing airstrikes against the Taliban’s leadership and drug complex. But there is little evidence that this has significantly harmed the Taliban. Instead, it has increasingly bombed cities, including Kabul.

The United States also suspended military aid to Pakistan to pressure the Islamabad government to stop supporting the Taliban. That has yet to shift Pakistan’s Afghanistan policy. My research (with Paul Staniland and Sameer Lalwani) suggests that Pakistan is unlikely to crack down on the Taliban because of U.S. pressure. The Taliban provides Pakistan with influence in Afghanistan — and does not challenge the Pakistani military’s vision of nationalism.

Bottom line: As long as state backing and illicit funds make the Taliban confident of a victory, there is reason to doubt that it would want to negotiate.

2) What would peace terms look like?

But suppose that the Taliban agrees to talk. The next challenge would be to reach a consensus on peace terms — a key obstacle for most conflict agreements. In Afghanistan, building consensus is tricky, as the terms will be shaped by conflicting interests of the U.S. and Afghan governments, along with the Taliban.

[ Will U.S. threats to Pakistan help crack down on terrorism? Not really. ]

The Taliban’s recent demands include a U.S. exit from Afghanistan and share in the Kabul-based government. The United States seeks guarantees that the Taliban will not support transnational Islamist extremists. The Afghan government wants the Taliban to respect the rule of law.

The Taliban’s demand for a U.S. withdrawal is likely to cause a deadlock. Key Taliban leaders worry that if they back down, their credibility with their base of support will suffer. But it is hard to see President Trump’s hard-line foreign policy team agreeing to a withdrawal as a concession to the Taliban. And the Afghan government has reason to worry about its own survival in case of a rushed U.S. departure.

Any power-sharing demands from the Taliban would be contentious. The Taliban worry that if they demobilize without a large share, the Afghan government will renege on agreed terms. Ghani’s recent offer has nothing on power sharing, and it will be difficult for him to include the Taliban in his complex multiethnic coalition.

To reach a workable consensus, the United States has the most power to shape the terms that satisfy the Taliban. For now, the U.S. stance is that the terms are for the Afghan government and the Taliban to decide.

3) What are the likely spoilers?

In the unlikely event that the three parties can surmount these problems, the Afghan context is ripe for another major obstacle to peace — what scholars call the spoiler problem. An unhappy faction might try to derail the process with violence — by launching a major attack in Kabul or assassinating a senior leader of the Taliban during the talks.

The Afghan context brims with potential spoilers. These include factions within the Taliban, Afghan politicians, Pakistan, India, Russia, Iran, al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. These parties have different ideas about how the war should terminate and thus could jeopardize the peace process, causing the talks to break down.

4) How hard will it be to implement peace?

Even if there is some arrangement that is acceptable to all, committing to the terms of peace is a critical barrier to settlement. Warring parties worry that the other side may not keep the terms. Rebels worry that government forces might harm them once they disarm. Amid such concerns, a third-party guarantor is essential to implementing the terms of peace.

[ Trump says Pakistan ‘harbors terrorists.’ The real story isn’t so simple. ]

In the Afghan context, an acceptable third party will be difficult to find. The Taliban wants guarantees from an international coalition including China, Iran and Russia. But the United States worries about China’s ambitions in South Asia, Russia’s growing sphere of influence and Iran’s subversion. The United States is not likely to concede a role to its foes to satisfy the Taliban.

5) Could civil war return to Afghanistan?

Even if the parties overcome all of these challenges and strike a deal, a major risk of a return to war emanates from Ghani’s domestic politics.

Ghani draws multiethnic support, but many in the governing coalition do not want to share power with the Taliban. A peace deal means they stand to lose their privileged status — and that raises the risk of a coup by estranged ethnic factions after the deal.

How will Ghani respond to such a threat? He will face what political scientist Philip Roessler calls the “coup-civil war trap.” Ghani will have to pick between a possible coup by select factions in his coalition — or more civil war with the Taliban. More likely, he will choose a civil war with the Taliban over the coup.

Reaching a sustainable peace deal in Afghanistan is not a single problem but a series of formidable hurdles. And this means the war in Afghanistan is unlikely to abate anytime soon.

17,afghanistan,"An offer of talks by the Ghani government was met with silence from the Taliban. That, in itself, could be a good sign.

Is it time for optimism in Afghanistan? On February 28, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban peace talks without preconditions as a way to end the nearly two-decade-long conflict in his country. A month later, as delegates from more than 20 countries gathered in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to discuss ways to restore stability to Afghanistan, there still hasn’t been a formal response from the Taliban. Officials, meanwhile, have held out hope that the absence of a reply is cause for optimism. “[W]e have not seen them reject the proposal, which … is in itself a positive sign,” Alice Wells, the U.S. State Department official who oversees South and Central Asia, said earlier this month at the U.S. Institute for Peace. “And I would underscore our hope and expectation that the Taliban leadership will analyze the proposal seriously and carefully.” Ghani’s unprecedented overture to the Taliban includes the offer of talks without preconditions. It would also allow its members to run for government, release Taliban fighters from prison, and require foreign forces to leave Afghanistan. The Taliban, who ruled the country until the U.S.-led invasion in retaliation for the attacks of September 11, 2001 (which was conceived and executed by al-Qaeda, a group granted refuge in Afghanistan by the Taliban regime), is reportedly considering the offer. That has not prevented it from carrying out attacks across the country—nor does it mean its leaders will accept the proposal. Related Stories Peace Through Bombings: The U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan

The Devastating Paradox of Pakistan Barnett Rubin, an expert on the region at NYU, told me that Ghani’s offer is significant in that it addresses many of the Taliban’s major concerns. But, he said, it doesn’t address its main concern: its belief that Ghani lacks the authority or legitimacy to make such an offer. “The Afghan Taliban were not overthrown by the Afghan government. They were overthrown by the United States,” Rubin said. “And they want to talk to the United States. If they talk to the Afghan government, to them, it’s like surrendering—because, to them, it means that it was legitimate to overthrow them.” And yet, as The New York Times reported Tuesday, the mood at the Tashkent conference, the latest international effort to bring peace to Afghanistan, was “unusually optimistic.” Ghani’s offer to the Taliban came at a similar conference in Kabul bringing together 20 countries. There are also several other mechanisms in place working towards peace in Afghanistan; many involve a combination of its neighbors and either the United States or Russia. Most, but not all, include the Afghan government. None include the Taliban.

After years of criticizing America’s war in Afghanistan, President Trump followed his two predecessors by sending U.S. soldiers to the country. His South Asia strategy involved pressuring Pakistan, which he accused of giving “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt,” by suspending security assistance to Islamabad. He also wants India to do more. As part of this effort, the U.S. is helping Afghan forces fight the Taliban “in order to drive them to the negotiating table.” The Taliban remains the most powerful insurgent group in Afghanistan. Its membership is Afghan (unlike the other groups, whose ranks include many foreign fighters), it enjoys some support among the population, and controls about one-third of the country—more territory than at any point since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. (The Afghan government controls all the major population centers.) What all these international efforts underscore is that while the international community wants a reconciliation process between the Afghan government and the Taliban, many global powers who have meddled in the country for decades—if not centuries—still influence what happens within its borders. U.S. Army General John Nicholson, the senior-most U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told the BBC last week that weapons seized from Taliban fighters were allegedly supplied by Russia. (Russia, whose painful history in Afghanistan dates back to the 19th century, has denied this.) Russia is reportedly arming the Taliban in order to fight the Islamic State, which has gained a foothold in the country. (It also supports the Afghan government.) Hanif Atmar, Afghanistan’s national-security adviser, said last week in Washington that Kabul disagreed with Moscow’s distinction “between good and bad terrorists.”

“Of course, we’ve been provided assurance that [the] Taliban will not be provided with weapons and resources,” he said. “We will welcome that assurance and we would like to see that in practice.” Afghanistan’s other neighbors have their own interests—interests that are often at odds with one another, as well as with the Afghan government. Pakistan, the Taliban’s ally and major benefactor, is afraid of being hemmed in between two unfriendly neighbors, India and Afghanistan. India, in turn, is nervous about the prospect of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan because they provide a semblance of stability to the region. Iran, which borders Afghanistan in the west, is also reportedly arming the Taliban in order to fight ISIS. (It supports the Afghan government, as well.) China sees stability in the country as a major necessity if the belt-and-road initiative, its massive infrastructure project, is to succeed. China is also nervous about the presence of Uighur separatists inside Afghanistan; ditto for Uzbekistan, which is battling its own Islamist militancy. Atmar said the number of foreign fighters had increased in the country, as the number of international forces fell over the past four years.

ISLAMABAD: The attack on an army unit in Swat was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists based on Afghan soil, said a dossier handed over to Afghanistan on Thursday.

The dossier containing proof of TTP involvement in the suicide attack on an army unit in Swat and presence of sanctuaries of the TTP and the Jamaatul Ahrar in Afghanistan was handed over by the Foreign Office to the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, FO spokesman Dr Muhamamd Faisal said.

Eleven soldiers were martyred when a suicide bomber blew himself up near a military camp in Swat’s Kabal area in February. The TTP had claimed responsibility for the attack in emails sent to journalists.

“The Afghan side was asked to take effective action against terrorist hideouts from where they have been financing, planning and undertaking cross-border terrorist attacks on Pakistani military posts, cities and towns,” an FO statement said.

Dossier containing proof of TTP involvement in suicide assault on army unit handed over to Afghan embassy; US Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells holds talks with NSA

The dossier was given to the Afghan embassy as US Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells arrived in Islamabad for talks on Pakistani efforts for bringing peace and security to Afghanistan. Although ties between Pakistan and the United States have been getting colder, the latter out of its compulsions in Afghanistan has been trying to improve security cooperation between Islamabad and Kabul.

Earlier this month a US drone targeted a TTP-run camp in Kunar in eastern Afghanistan killing 21 suspected militants, including the master trainer of would-be suicide bombers. Military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor had at a press briefing a day earlier acknowledged that US-led Resolute Support Mission had started addressing Pakistani concerns and taken action against several sanctuaries along the Paki-Afghan border.

Speaking at the weekly media briefing, the FO spokesman, however, said the concerns about TTP, JuA, and Lashkar-i-Islam sanctuaries had not been fully addressed. He noted that things had improved in areas where Afghanistan had established border posts and deployed troops.

These terrorist groups have established sanctuaries on Afghan side of the Pak-Afghan border and were involved in cross-border raids on Pakistani military posts, Dr Faisal said.

Pakistan has on a number of occasions shared the locations of the safe havens of these groups with Afghan and the US authorities.

Talks with US

Pakistan and the US, during a meeting between visiting US official Amb Wells and Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua, reaffirmed their resolve to act against all groups that were operating against Pakistan and Afghanistan.

This was Amb Wells’ second visit to Pakistan. Recently Foreign Secretary Janjua has also visited Washington and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has met US Vice President Mike Pence during a private visit to the US.

These engagements, the FO said, were meant to continue the conversation for strengthening bilateral relations and promoting peace and security in the region.

The two sides during the meeting between Foreign Secretary Janjua and Amb Wells took stock of the bilateral relationship, Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, FATF grey listing and efforts for reviving Afghan peace talks.

“Both sides agreed that the momentum of the peace initiative unveiled in Kabul by President Ashraf Ghani and followed up in Tashkent needs to be carried forward,” the FO said.

A separate statement by the national security adviser’s office on Amb Wells’ meeting with NSA retired Lt Gen Nasser Janjua said the US encouraged good relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan to enable the two countries to work in a cooperative framework.

Gen Janjua, meanwhile, laid emphasis on mutually trusting each other and “continuing intelligence sharing and cooperation”.

Prisoners issue

Dr Faisal said India had not moved further on the humanitarian initiative involving the exchange of elderly, mentally challenged and female prisoners.

“Pakistan concurred to the Indian humanitarian proposal. Response on these is awaited from the Indian side,” he said.

With this, the total number of Keralites, killed after joining IS in Afghanistan, has gone up to eight after the NIA last year confirmed the death of four.

Four people including three in a family who are believed to have joined terror outfit Islamic State in Afghanistan, are reported to have been killed in a bomb attack.

A police intelligence officer in Kasargode, the district from where several people have joined IS, told IANS that they have heard the news but there is no official confirmation from the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

""What we have come to know is that the dead include Shihaz, his wife and their child besides another man. We are awaiting more details,"" said the official who did not wish to be identified.

Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police KG Simon told TNM that they had got information about the deaths a couple of days ago. “We have not received any official confirmation regarding this,” he said. State Police Chief Loknath Behera’s office also said that there is no official confirmation in connection with it.

With this, the total number of Keralites, killed after joining IS in Afghanistan, has gone up to eight after the NIA last year confirmed the death of four.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly in 2016 said that 21 people, including children, were missing from the state -- 17 persons from Kasargode and four from Palakkad.

Recently, Yasmin Mohammed Shaheed accused of recruiting 15 people from Kasargode for IS was convicted for seven years by the NIA special court in Kochi.

This was the first Islamic State related case in the state in which the trial was completed, an accused is convicted.

Yasmin is the second wife of Abul Rashid Abdullah who is allegedly the mastermind behind recruiting people from Kerala for IS. The NIA suspects that Adbullah is still in Afghanistan.

Yasmin and her son were arrested at the Delhi airport in August 2016 while they were trying to go to Afghanistan.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert Burns/AP Robert Burns/AP

Russia has fired back at accusations by U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson that the Kremlin is providing material support to the Taliban.

In an interview with the BBC last week, Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said in an interview taped there: ""We've had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and [they] said this was given by the Russians to the Taliban.""

""Clearly, they are acting to undermine our interests,"" he said.

As NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman reported last year, it is not the first time that the four-star general has made the accusation. Last year, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis also discussed the concern.

A statement by the Russian embassy in Kabul dismissed Nicholson's comments as ""idle gossip.""

""Once again, we insist that such statements are absolutely baseless and appeal to officials not to talk nonsense,"" the embassy said.

Officials in Russia have said they only have limited contacts with the Taliban and that they are aimed at encouraging peace talks and protecting Russian citizens.

Afghan officials last year also called on Moscow to halt its support for the Taliban.

In October, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Naser Hedayat, the commander of the Afghan army's 207th Corps, said Russia was ""actively meddling in Farah [province].""

""We have seized Russian-made weapons, including night-vision sniper scopes,"" he said.

As The Guardian wrote at the time: ""Russia's recent push for influence in Afghanistan follows a pattern across the region, where Moscow has challenged American influence in Libya, Turkey, Syria and the Gulf. But it also offers an echo of history for Afghans who since the 19th century have seen their country treated as a battleground for rival foreign powers.""

In an appearance before a Senate Armed Services Committee in Feb. 2017, Nicholson had this exchange with Florida Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson:

""If Russia is cozying up to the Taliban — and that's a kind word — if they are giving equipment that we have some evidence that the Taliban is getting ... and other things that we can't mention in this unclassified setting? And the Taliban is also associated with al-Qaida? Therefore Russia indirectly is helping al-Qaida in Afghanistan,"" said Nelson.

""Your logic is absolutely sound, sir,"" Nicholson replied.

At the time, Nicholson said the Russian operations in Afghanistan had resumed the previous year [2016].

Russia has a long and tortured history in Afghanistan. In 1979, Soviet forces invaded the country following a coup that overthrew the Kremlin-backed government there.

Local fighters, who called themselves mujahedeen, formed a fierce resistance to the Soviet occupation. During the Reagan administration, the U.S., with the help of Pakistan, funneled hundreds of million of dollars' worth of weapons to the Afghan resistance.

The 10-year conflict in Afghanistan, which devolved into a quagmire that cost 15,000 Russian soldiers, is widely viewed as a major contributing factor to the collapse of the Soviet Union.",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/26/596933077/top-u-s-commander-in-afghanistan-accuses-russia-of-aiding-taliban

Doha: Qatar has participated in the Tashkent high-level ministerial conference on peace in Afghanistan, which was held in the Uzbek capital yesterday, with the participation of 20 countries active in the Afghan affairs.

Qatar’s delegation to the conference was headed by Ambassador H E Dr. Mutlaq bin Majid Al Qahtani, Special Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Combating Terrorism and Mediation in Dispute Resolution.

Addressing the conference, the Special Envoy of the Foreign Minister said that there is no military solution to the crisis in Afghanistan, adding that “the parties must be engaged in direct dialogue without preconditions.”

He stressed the importance of the integration, cooperation and coherence of all international efforts in this regard, warning that the regional crises cast a shadow over the international and regional efforts to achieve peace and stability in Afghanistan and called for the need to resolve these crises and avoid their impact and repercussions on other international and regional institutions and countries of the world, including Afghanistan.

He reiterated Qatar’s continued efforts to find a solution to the crisis and achieve sustainable peace in Afghanistan, and said that the State of Qatar would do its best to facilitate the process of direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Kabul government, with the support of its strategic partners.

22,afghanistan,"The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is calling on the international community to increase its efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan and to rethink repatriation policies for refugees in the country. The organisation has created a list of seven reasons why these efforts are needed, highlighting that the situation in the country is going from ""bad to worse.""





1) The war and terrorism continue mean that millions of people are still be displaced inside the country. The NRC said that 1,200 people per day are forced to leave their homes due to violence. That figure is equivalent to an average of 50 people per hour. In the past two years, one million people have left their homes and been displaced, the organisation said.





2) Afghanistan is currently one of the most dangerous countries in the world. The organisation that said 10 civilians are killed in acts of war or terrorism in the country each day. In a recent attack, on February 25, a motorcycle bomb exploded in a crowded market in the province of Paktika, killing three people, two civilians and a police officer.





3) The situation has worsened due to the large number of refugees who have been forced to return. The NRC said that in the past five years, the country has received 300,000 returning refugees per year.





4) Many refugees who have returned have become internally displaced due to the lack of security and humanitarian aid. According to the NRC, seven out of 10 refugees who return to Afghanistan become internally displaced in their own country due to conflicts and violence. Many of them say they have been forced to flee again, up to three times, since their return.





5) Seventy-five percent of displaced families do not receive any aid. The NRC said that half of the displaced suffer from food insecurity that forces them to ration food and skip meals. In all, ""7.4 million people need humanitarian aid,"" it said. Of those, 3.3 million live in acute suffering, 1.9 million need urgent food aid, 1.6 million need healthcare services, and 1.1. million need water and sewage services.





6) Humanitarian aid workers in Afghanistan are under attack.Last year, 'a total of 17 humanitarian workers were killed and 32 were wounded due to violent attacks,"" the NRC said. Aid organisations ""need added resources for security, local agents and networks that can make their work safer.""





7) Efforts in the country until now are at risk of being lost. ""If Western countries don't contribute more to security efforts and don't rethink refugee repatriation policies, hundreds of billions spent in the conflict in Afghanistan are at risk of being squandered,"" the NRC said.",http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/7880/afghanistan-crisis-what-you-need-to-know

Afghan citizens returning to their home country can become internally displaced within days.

A total of 10,453 civilian casualties were recorded by UNAMA in the past year: 3,438 people killed and 7,015 people injured.

On International Women’s Day, the United Nations drew attention to women left behind in many areas of development.

In February, two aid workers were killed and one was abducted.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) sat down with OCHA to discuss donor perspectives and priorities on Afghanistan.

The Humanitarian Coordinator approved a CHF-allocation of some $18.5 million for 23 projects.

A Cycle of Return, Displacement and Migration

When Mohammad Afshar poured a can of fuel over himself and fumbled with the box of matches he was determined to end his life. This was on 15 November 2017. The father of 12 children and husband to two wives had exhausted all means to provide for his family and hardship seemed just too much to bear. He had sold one of his sons for Afs5,000 Afghani (US$80) to buy food, another son had died when the walls of the house collapsed under heavy snow and two daughters had frozen to death because he couldn’t afford enough blankets to keep them warm in winter.

A few weeks before the incident, he planned to sell their youngest daughter but was stopped only by his wife: “I would rather all of us die, than lose another one of my children”, she said. That was the moment he had decided to end his life in protest in front of the District Governor who visited the village. Only the quick reaction of bystanders who took the matches from his fingers foiled his plan.

Within days of their arrival in Afghanistan, they became internally displaced before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, Mohammad Afshar worked as a farmer on his land in his village in Takhar Province. In 1998, he and his family moved to Quetta in Pakistan to escape Taliban rule. “I found a job in a brick factory as a daily worker,” he remembers. “My income was decent and we were happy.”

But in 2016, after 18 years in Pakistan where he never tried to obtain or was asked for any kind of documentation, the harassment and extortion by Pakistani police reached their peak. He decided to return to Afghanistan.

When he arrived back in his old village in Takhar, the family’s house had been destroyed and the fields had been taken over by armed men. Having spent many years in exile he did not have the necessary support in the community to reclaim his property.

He and his family left the village and moved to another district into an abandoned building without doors or windows. Within days of their arrival in their home country, Mohammad Afshar and his family had joined the ranks of internally displaced people (IDPs).

One quarter of all returnees know they cannot return to their home villages Mohammad Afshar is not an isolated case: more than 100,000 Afghan IDPs and returnees currently live in improvised shelters, tents or under open sky, with more than 51,000 in Nangarhar province alone. This according to the latest results of IOM Afghanistan’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Baseline Mobility Assessments, conducted in December 2017 in 15 provinces of highest return and displacement.

Last year, one quarter of all returnees from Pakistan arrived in Afghanistan with no intention of returning to their province of origin. This is up from just over one fifth in the previous year. Of significant note, 67 per cent of Afghan returnees in 2017 with roots in Kunar Province had no intention to return to Kunar, where conflict has intensified in the past months and members of the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) are trying to gain influence. Among these, 86 per cent decided to settle in Nangarhar Province instead, notably in and around Jalalabad City.

“Insecurity is not the only reason for post-return displacement,” explains Michael Speir, IOM Afghanistan’s DTM Coordinator. “As in the case of Mohammad Afshar, many Afghan families who have lived abroad for decades only discover upon their return that their houses have been destroyed and their land taken away. Stripped of their homes and any opportunities to secure their living, these people have no other option but to seek alternative places to live.”

Lack of opportunities and services in rural areas furthers urbanization

Reasons why Afghans can’t return to their places of origin, especially in rural areas, include a lack of job opportunities and social services, such as schools, health facilities or markets.

More than 700,000 returnees and IDPs in the 15 assessed provinces reported to have no access to education, almost two million don’t have access to a doctor, and more than 1.5 million don’t have access to a market to buy and sell goods, including food items, according to IOM’s latest DTM results (see graph).

Mohammad Afshar’s case also explains the trend of urbanization in Afghanistan. “Before he left Afghanistan two decades ago, Mohammad Afshar was a farmer,” notes Speir. “When he moved to Quetta in Pakistan, the urban labour market required a different skill set. Then, upon return to his rural village in Takhar, there was no need for his urban ‘daily labor’ skills acquired in Pakistan. Ultimately, with no access to his former land and faded farming skills, he really struggled to ensure the survival of his family in rural Takhar.

Sadly, the extreme coping mechanism of selling his children was his last resort.” Lack of shelter, job opportunities and no school for returnees to Afghanistan Another case is that of Zabihullah and his family who also lived in Pakistan for many years. “One day, a representative from the Government of Afghanistan came to our camp and told us that if we return, we will be given shelter and jobs. Because the harassment in Pakistan was getting worse, I decided to bring my wife and five children back to our home district in Baghlan,” he explains. ”But there were no shelters and no job opportunities.” His children were not even able to go to school, because he could not provide the required certification.

When the tent that the family was forced to live in was washed away in a flash flood, Zabihullah was lucky to save all his family members, but lost most of his belongings. Zabihullah has decided to return to Pakistan, despite renewed uncertainty over the fate of Afghan citizens living in Pakistan.

Returnees at risk of cyclical, unsafe migration movements

“This is exactly what we don’t want to happen – cyclical, unsafe migration movements, because people get pushed from province to province, or from country to country,” says IOM Afghanistan’s Chief of Mission, Laurence Hart.

“Migration movements in Afghanistan have become coping mechanisms. The more often Afghans are forced to migrate, the more vulnerable they become, and the less likely it gets that they will be able to reintegrate,” the head of IOM Afghanistan explains.",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-73-1-28-february-2018
