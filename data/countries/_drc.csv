As pressure from the international community grows on Democratic Republic of Congo's Joseph Kabila to hold elections, a deepening humanitarian crisis and unrest grips the country.

Warning: Some readers may find photos below distressing.

A baby with nothing, not even a name lies in a hospital cot in DRC's central hospital in Bunia, fighting to live. His tiny skeletal chest heaves up and down as he battles for every breath with under-developed lungs.

His translucent hands are about the same size as the thumb of the doctor examining him. He has no clothes, no home, not even the cot to himself. He's sharing it with the hospital's latest arrival - another baby born earlier in the day, who looks equally fragile.

The two of them hover between life and death. It's too early to say which will be their fate. But should it be life, their futures look decidedly bleak in this, one of the world's richest countries in terms of natural resources.

The babies are two of the Democratic Republic of Congo's ""internally displaced"", basically a fancy name for refugees in their own country.

There are 4.5 million others according to the United Nations, making them the largest number of internally displaced people in the whole of Africa. They're people who've fled violence, left their homes and run trying to find safety anywhere.

Many are severely under-nourished. Some 7.7 million people are classified as severely hungry. They're all desperately poor, prone to sickness and now living in the direst of conditions in huge squalid camps with little sanitation and where disease festers.

Image: The two newborn babies fighting for their lives

The statistics are shocking. Some 13.1 million Congolese need humanitarian aid. That's the same number as in Syria.

Looking at the little baby with no name battling for every gulp of air, struggling to hang on to this thread of a chance he's been given, I thought of what lay ahead for him, should he win this, the first of a lifetime of challenges.

The dismal numbers scream out his life will be fraught with problems. Firstly, his 26-year-old mother, Lutove has to survive herself. She is also in the central hospital - but laying in a male ward because of lack of beds, weak through hunger and now ill with tuberculosis.

When we saw her, she couldn't haul herself upright and couldn't walk, she was that weak. The doctor measured her upper arms using a tape meant for babies from three months to three years.

She gave birth three weeks ago after running away from machete-wielding men who attacked her village for the second time. She was 28 weeks pregnant at the time.

The stress and panic triggered the birth of her baby some 14 weeks early. With little food throughout her pregnancy, she was under-weight and under-nourished and her baby son was born weighing less than half a bag of sugar.

Three weeks of hospital care had helped but when we saw him, he was still only 750 grammes with ribs which stuck out so you could count each and every one of them.

The central hospital paediatric wing is filled and overflowing into tents outside with mothers and babies lining the pavement and corridors.

Inside, there are frequently two babies to a bed. All of them are the children of the ""internally displaced"" - hungry, vulnerable to disease which is easily spread in the poor living conditions they now find themselves.

It is a miserable lot - and many believe this is man-made tragedy - caused by decades of ethnic conflict, multiple militias controlling and fighting for territory, rampant corruption and a president whose term expired last year but who's still clinging to power whilst most of his country cling to life.

DRC should be one of Africa's rich countries. It's Africa's largest copper producer and has more than half of the world's supply of cobalt laying beneath its soil. But it ranks very low on the UN Human Development Index.

President Joseph Kabila is now under pressure from the international community to hold elections as soon as possible as parts of his country descend deeper into chaos.

2,drc,"Armed rebels killed at least one soldier during an attack on a house owned by Congo President Joseph Kabila in the restive east where a number of conflicts have flared in recent months, rebel and Congo military sources said on Thursday.

Kabila was not present when Mai-Mai militiamen attacked the house near the town of Beni and clashed with state soldiers, who were able to fend off the attack.

The second assault on a presidential residence in three months points to a deteriorating security situation in Congo stoked in part by Kabila’s refusal to step down in 2016 when his mandate expired.

A home belonging to Kabila was attacked and set on fire in North Kivu province in December. A policeman died in the incident.

The security situation in the east, already a tinderbox of ethnic tensions, has worsened this year as state authority slips, forcing tens of thousands to flee and threatening to destabilise the whole country.

A spokesman for the Mai-Mai rebel group said it killed three soldiers during the attack. An army spokesman said one of its soldiers and one assailant were killed.

A spokesman for the president was not available for comment.

The Mai-Mai comprise a number of armed bands that originally formed to resist Rwandan invasions in the 1990s. They have since morphed into a wide variety of ethnic-based militia, smuggling networks and protection rackets.

UNITED NATIONS

A humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo is worsening and has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country, with millions facing severe hunger, the UN Security Council warned.

At least 13.1 million Congolese are in need of humanitarian aid including 7.7 million who are severely food insecure, said a unanimous statement from the top UN body.

VIOLENCE

The humanitarian crisis has been compounded by a doubling over the past year of the number of Congolese fleeing violence in the country who now total close to 4.4 million.

Council members ""expressed great concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, which has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country"", said the statement.

The council ""emphasized the need to address the presence of armed groups in the country"" and renewed its call for ""transparent, credible and inclusive elections"".

Kinshasa authorities have set a date of December 23 to hold historic elections but it remains unclear whether President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, will step aside to allow a transition.

UN officials fear the country could slide into all-out violence as the countdown to the elections begin.

APPEAL

An international conference will be held in Geneva on April 13 to mobilise funding for a $1.7 billion humanitarian appeal for the DR Congo — four times the amount secured last year.

The United Nations has declared the humanitarian crisis in the DR Congo to be a Level 3, the UN's highest-level emergency.

The council statement followed a meeting on Monday on the crisis.

At that meeting, the US head of the international development agency, Mark Green, said the Kabila government had done ""so little to alleviate suffering, even as many of its leaders have apparently been lining their pockets.""",https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/UN-warns-of-catastrophic-aid-crisis-in-DRC/1066-4353696-5ij8wjz/index.html

Her tiny limbs shake as her mother hands her to nurses at a roadside clinic in the town of Kananga. She is severely malnourished, nurses say, and weighs under seven kilograms (15 pounds), far less than an average child of 14 months.

WATCH: Children, Adults Face Dire Crisis in Central Congo After Conflict, Insecurity

Her frail chest crackles with what nurses say is bronchitis. Seeking comfort, she sucks insistently on her mother’s breast, which is dry of milk, as 32-year-old Suzanne Lukaji says she too has had little to eat since she and her family fled their home last year, abandoning their crops, after local militia clashed with government forces. The family was forced to survive for six months on what it could forage in the wild.



This week, the top U.N. humanitarian official warned 13 million people need aid in Congo, including 2 million children already experiencing severe, acute malnutrition.



Conflict in Congo’s Kasai province has displaced more than a million people. The situation is just one facet of a growing humanitarian crisis in the country, with U.N. officials urging donors to heed their $1.7 billion aid request.

More than 150,000 children affected

In the past year, the U.N. children’s fund and other aid groups have treated more than 50,000 children in this lush, but impoverished, region of south-central Congo.



U.N. agencies have asked for an unprecedented $1.7 billion dollars for Congo, most of it for this region; but, they have received a tiny fraction of that amount from donors.



“We estimate 150,000 children were affected,” said Oscar Butragueno, UNICEF’s emergency coordinator in Kasai. “So it’s been very serious; a lot of people are still displaced, they cannot go back to their homes, they cannot go and do the planting season, they’re hungry, they’re in need and they’re desperate.”

Local health workers say they’ve never seen it this bad. And this region has never been well off. Even before the crisis, aid officials estimated more than half of the children in this region were chronically malnourished.

The conflict that started in 2016 between an armed militia and the Congolese army, both of which are accused of committing heinous crimes, has pushed an already vulnerable population over the edge, locals say.



“If the international community brings us some support, it would make us happy and be a good help,” said local nurse Marie Louise Misenga, as dozens of mothers thronged the UNICEF-run clinic where she works.

Rations are just the start

At a World Food Program distribution site in the remote village of Tshikula, residents scrambled for meager rations. Women squabbled over handfuls of salt, liters of oil, and bags of beans and maize meal as hundreds of locals waited in the hot sun for their turn.

The rations may save lives, but local schoolteacher Jean-Pierre Ngalamulume says everyone is suffering.



“With students in a state of weakness, we are teaching them, but it’s hard for them to follow,” he said. “Even the teachers aren’t in the mood to teach because they have empty stomachs.”

UNICEF warns that as many as 400,000 children under the age of 5 could die this year from acute malnutrition unless the agency gets the funds and the access to help.

It’s a difficult number to imagine. But for many of the mothers who lined up patiently to have their babies seen and treated at a UNICEF-run clinic, those numbers mean little. What matters, they say, are nine-month-old Kabongo, 19-month-old Francois and 14-month-old Georgette.

Their stick-thin limbs and distended bellies can be treated, nurses and aid workers say, but their future is uncertain if the violence flares up again.",https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-kasai-region-humanitarian-crisis/4306968.html
5,drc,"A humanitarian is crisis rapidly worsening on several fronts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a top European Union aid official warned Sunday.

The growing humanitarian crisis is underscored by a political one — the refusal of President Joseph Kabila to step down 15 months after his electoral mandate expired.

The crisis situation is particularly acute in the central Kasai region and the eastern provinces of Kivu and Ituri.

A UN report earlier this month found some 13 million Congolese in need of humanitarian aid — twice as many as last year — and 7.7 million are facing severe food insecurity, which is an increase of 30 percent over 2017.

The crisis is further exacerbated by what appears to be the government's state of denial about the deepening crisis. Kinshasa is refusing to attend an international donor conference scheduled for April in Geneva that seeks to put together a $1.7 billion (1.4 billion euros) aid package.

'Enormous suffering'

""The EU is extremely concerned about the worsening crisis in the DRC,"" the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, said at a press conference in the eastern city of Goma.

""The humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day, and unfortunately I saw enormous suffering, enormous humanitarian needs and the situation in the country is not business as usual.""

The UN has categorized the situation there as a Level 3 crisis — the organization's highest-level emergency.

Government in denial

But Prime Minister Jose Makila dismissed such concerns, saying the UN had overreacted and that aid organizations in the country were propagating a ""bad image of the Democratic Republic of Congo throughout the world.""

He said the international community's negativity would discourage investment at a time when the government was attempting to stabilize a volatile economy.

""Activating the highest level of humanitarian emergency based on facts that are not real constitutes a hindrance to development,"" the government said in a statement.

The government said it wouldn't cooperate with international aid organizations unless they adjusted their figures to coincide with its own.

Children at risk

Stylianides, the EU commissioner, was touring Congo's hard-hit North Kivu province on Sunday, and was due to travel to the capital, Kinshasa, in an attempt to convince the foreign and humanitarian affairs ministers to reverse the decision.

""We will try to persuade them,"" he said, ""that this is not good for DRC but above all for the vulnerable people in DRC.""

A UN report says 400,000 children are at risk in the DRC

The UN children's agency first sounded an alarm at the end of last year saying 400,000 children were at risk of dying in the central diamond-rich Kasai region, which has been devastated by fighting.

So far at least 3,000 people have died and about 1.4 million have been displaced in the country, which has a long history of conflict and crisis.

7,drc,"In December, violence flared between communities in the Ituri province of northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The conflict intensified in February when fighting broke out in the Djugu area.

Houses were burned, people were killed, and tens of thousands fled their homes in search of safety. Some of these displaced people made their way south to Bunia, while others traveled north to Mahagi or crossed Lake Albert into neighboring Uganda. Many, however, remain stranded in areas that are currently inaccessible to aid organizations. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working on both sides of Lake Albert, offering medical humanitarian assistance to those in need.

In the past two weeks, MSF has treated thousands of displaced people in DRC and is responding to a cholera outbreak in Hoima district in Uganda, where new arrivals are hosted.

Uganda: Tackling Cholera and More in Hoima District

In the past several weeks more than 40,000 Congolese people displaced by the violence have paid to cross Lake Albert to neighboring Uganda, where the facilities in place to welcome the displaced are already overwhelmed and the dire conditions have had disastrous health consequences. On February 23, Ugandan authorities confirmed a cholera outbreak affecting both displaced and host communities in Hoima district.

The outbreak has resulted in least 1,000 severe cases requiring hospitalization and led to more than 30 deaths since mid-February.

""The situation in Uganda is extremely alarming, with the trend in cholera cases still increasing and a very high mortality rate,” says MSF emergency coordinator in Uganda Ahmad Mahat. ""In addition to dedicated cholera treatment centers, we are scaling up our response as quickly as possible, setting up a water treatment plant at Sebagoro landing site to increase access to clean water for the refugees as well as communities living along the shores, putting in place oral rehydration points, surveillance, [and] water trucking, and building additional latrines.""

However, access to clean water alone will not be enough to curb the spread of the disease; MSF is also urging the launch of a mass vaccination campaign to prevent more cases.

""To control this deadly outbreak and protect those most at risk, it is really urgent to undertake a cholera vaccination campaign in the coming days,” says Mahat. ""This must be a part of the routine response for such epidemics. After discussing with global partners, a stock of vaccines has been made available for this emergency campaign and MSF stands ready to assist the Ministry of Health as soon as the green light is given.""

In Sebarogo, a small fishing village in Hoima, MSF teams have set up a 50-bed cholera treatment center (CTC) in the town’s health center, which MSF also supports with supplies and resources, in addition to a mobile health post at the landing site to refer the most urgent cases to the health center. MSF also opened a 50-bed CTC in Kasonga health center near the reception center in Sebarogo.

Crossing the Lake

MSF Congolese refugees disembark in Sebarogo, a small fishing village in Hoima district, Uganda.

Refugees who leave DRC for Uganda make the journey in rickety, overcrowded fishing boats and canoes. The trip can take between six and 10 hours, and there have been reports of refugees drowning after their boat capsized.

Many people see no choice but to flee, however.

""New arrivals tell us of attacks at night, and a small number have deep cuts and wounds,"" Mahat said. ""Many arrive traumatized and exhausted, with sick children. Those using small canoes sometimes had to paddle for almost three days to reach safety here.""

Congolese refugees who cross the lake disembark in Sebarogo. The village’s landing site was quickly overwhelmed in mid-February when up to 3,000 people started landing each day during the height of the current refugee influx. Numbers have now decreased, partly because of weather conditions and prohibitive prices for passage across the lake, but hundreds of refugees still arrive daily.

New arrivals quickly leave Sebarogo for Kagoma reception center, which is managed by Ugandan authorities and UN partners. There they await registration and humanitarian assistance before moving to a refugee camp, usually Kyangwali settlement or other camps in midwestern Uganda. However, bus transportation and the registration system were at times so overwhelmed in February that the refugees stayed at the landing site for several days and up to a week with barely any assistance: there were no latrines, and the only available water source was the lake. Some moved on to Sebarogo town to join relatives and host families.

Kagoma reception center and Marutatu settlement (part of Kyangwali) are currently unable to cope with the influx of refugees. New arrivals already made vulnerable by their flight and the violence in Ituri end up sleeping in the open air, exposed to the rains and with inadequate access to water and food. Hygiene and sanitation conditions are appalling.

In Kagoma reception center, MSF teams vaccinated 5,263 children against polio and measles and 2,160 women of childbearing age against tetanus. MSF also opened a 24/7 outpatient clinic where over 2,000 patients have been treated since mid-February, for conditions including diarrhea and cholera, malaria, and respiratory infections. This clinic also provides antenatal care and assistance to survivors of sexual violence.

DRC: Addressing the Needs in Ituri

MSF Some 20,000 people displaced by violence are now sheltering in Bunia town, DRC.

In mid-February, OCHA estimated that around 20,000 people were sheltering in Bunia town in DRC. Most are living with friends and family, and 2,000 more have gathered at a temporary site at the regional hospital. MSF supports basic health care in three health centers in Bunia, Bigo, Kindia, and Lembabo, and helps refer severe cases to two nearby hospitals.

In the last two weeks, MSF teams saw 2,117 outpatients—783 were children under five years old and 349 were pregnant women—mainly suffering from malaria, respiratory infections, and diarrhea. MSF teams also offer mental health consultations, as many arriving in Bunia are traumatized by the violence they witnessed or experienced. There are unaccompanied children among them, and people who lost everything in their flight.

Additionally, MSF has undertaken water and sanitation work at the hospital site, installing a water supply and erecting 20 latrines and 10 showers. Teams distributed 1,200 kits of non-food items such as blankets and soap and continue to support the distribution of food such as flour, salt, and rice to the displaced.

""Most of the displaced people in Ituri are living with host families, but some are sheltering in schools, churches, or small informal camps,"" says MSF emergency coordinator in DRC Florent Uzzeni. ""Many in Bunia are women and children who are totally reliant on aid for their most basic needs, such as food and water. We know that there are many displaced people in the areas we can’t yet reach due to insecurity, and every effort needs to be made to bring them the assistance they so desperately need.""

An MSF team is also present in Mahagi, further north, where exploratory missions are ongoing. Additionally, MSF has been providing remote support to harder-to-reach areas like Drodro, including through donations of drugs and equipment and kits for treating the wounded. As very little help is available to these people, many are gradually making their way north in search of food, medical care, and shelter.

The situation in Ituri province remains unpredictable, and new waves of violence could cause further influxes of people to Uganda. At present, insecurity is preventing many people displaced within DRC from accessing lifesaving assistance. MSF is working to reach them. But the deadly cholera outbreak and inadequate provision of humanitarian aid in Uganda mean that a new, acute emergency is now developing on the shores of Lake Albert.",https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/conflict-and-displacement-drc-fuel-acute-humanitarian-emergency-uganda

“Humanitarian needs, caused by internal conflict, have doubled over the last year,” U.N. Humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told Security Council members on Monday.

The United Nations is hoping to receive commitments for $1.7 billion for this year, nearly four times the amount requested in 2017, at the April 13 pledging conference.

“Under funding is the single largest impediment to the humanitarian response in DRC,” Lowcock said.

4.6 million children at risk

The aid chief, who visited DRC last week, said more than 4.6 million children are acutely malnourished and the country is facing its worst cholera outbreak in 15 years.

The DRC has also become the continent’s largest displacement crisis, with 4.5 million internally displaced people and another 746,000 who have fled to neighboring countries.

Eastern Congo is experiencing a surge in violence in several provinces caused by armed groups and inter-communal fighting. Repeated delays in holding the presidential election is also adding to the insecurity.

“There is despair, but there is also hope,” he said. “The people of DRC are resilient and resourceful,” Lowcock said.

Political will needed

U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green said the United States and the international community should be ready to respond to the crisis.

“But none of us should believe that merely expanding humanitarian assistance is actually addressing the country’s greatest needs or principle causes of suffering,” Green told council members. “Boosting assistance without insisting on concrete, measurable action from the (President Joseph) Kabila government is the opposite of compassion.”

He said the international community must demand that credible elections take place this year, Kabila has repeatedly delayed them, and if elections do not take place as scheduled in December, then “we must rethink our support and our approach.”

Green said the Kabila government must also take steps to allow citizens to freely express their will and choose their own future.

The UN children's agency had sounded the alarm at the end of last year saying 400 000 children risked dying in the central diamond-rich Kasai region, which has been ravaged by conflict.

At least 3 000 people have died and about 1.4 million have been displaced.

""We are not now saying that children risk dying, but we are saying that children are already dying,"" the Unicef spokesperson Christophe Boulierac told AFP.

The Unicef has only been able to care for 65 000 children diagnosed with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), the most acute form which can lead to death, Boulierac said. ""That's far too few.

""This is not the time to discuss strategies,"" he said. ""If we act now, we can save lives.""

An AFP team visited Kananga, one of the main cities in Kasai this week and found an overwhelming number of children with SAM at the Saints Martyrs health centre where in a matter of minutes, eight out of 10 children were diagnosed with the condition.

'Catastrophic situation'

The other two had chronic malnutrition which stunts mental and physical development.

""Children with SAM are nine times more prone to dying than a properly nourished child,"" said Marie-Louise Misenga, a nurse at the centre.

Bibomba, aged about seven, sat patiently in front of the centre next to a 17-year-old boy. Both had skeletal figures.

""My granddaughter is facing death. She's very sick and she's not eating or going to school,"" wailed Angele, the grandmother of nine-year-old Aimee.

At Tshikapa, another town in Kasai, eight children died of malnutrition in a few days at the Eben Ezer church where 200 displaced families are being housed and receive support from British charity Oxfam.

""I was shocked to see the reality. The situation is catastrophic,"" said Ghislain Mumbere, an engineer who had come from Kinshasa to clean up local sources of drinking water.

Greater Kasai, grouping provinces created in 2015 in a change of internal borders, exploded into violence in September 2016, after soldiers killed a local traditional leader known as the Kamwina Nsapu.

Fighting between security forces and Kamwina Nsapu loyalists has since killed more than 3 000 people and displaced 1.4 million, according to the Roman Catholic church.

Over 5.1 million people are displaced: 4.49 million are internally displaced and approximately 630 000 have fled to neighbouring countries.

To address the worsening humanitarian crisis unfolding in DRC, today the European Commission announced €49.5 million in emergency assistance. A further €10.9 million will go to neighbouring countries, namely Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Republic of Congo mainly to support Congolese refugees. This brings the total amount of aid committed today to €60 million.

The announcement came as Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides visited EU aid projects in North and South Kivu, and met with government officials in Kinshasa to discuss, among others, the obstacles to humanitarian access in the country and the worrying number of attacks against humanitarian workers.

""The humanitarian needs in the Democratic Republic of Congo are mounting. It has become the largest displacement crisis in Africa. The EU is stepping up its support with new funding to provide emergency food and water supplies, shelter and education for children, as well as health assistance against epidemics. There is no time to lose to help those most in need. It is now critical that all donors step up too their support to the people of DRC. At the same time, I ask the DRC authorities to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers and facilitate humanitarian access throughout the country, so that assistance can reach all people in need,'' said Commissioner Stylianides.

During his visit, the Commissioner visited the EU funded Panzi hospital run by the 2014 Sakharov Prize laureate Dr Denis Mukwege in Bukavu and the Ndosho hospital in Goma.

Of today's announcement of €49.5 million in aid for DRC, €42.3 million will address the basic needs of the population affected by the crisis in the country. The remaining €7.2 million will support the EU's humanitarian flight (''ECHO flight'') service throughout 2018 which delivers essential aid supplies to difficult to access areas.

On 13 April 2018, Commissioner Stylianides will co-chair, on behalf of the European Union, a humanitarian donors' conference on DRC in Geneva. The other co-chairs are the United Nations and its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates.

KINSHASA – Around 230,000 people have been driven from their homes in Democratic Republic of Congo, the government estimated Friday, a vastly different figure from the reports of humanitarian groups in the conflict-torn country.

Kinshasa put the figure at ""231,241 internally displaced people"" compared with the more than four million estimate of NGOs, Bernard Biango, humanitarian affairs minister said at a governmental meeting broadcast on public television.

At the same, Biango confirmed DRC's ""non participation in the Geneva conference"" on April 13, called by the United Nations and the European Union to raise $1.7 billion for humanitarian needs in the vast central African nation.

For several months, the UN and its agencies as well as NGOs have pointed to an alarming situation in DR Congo. They claim 4.5 million people have fled their homes in provinces across the country plagued with violence, from Kivu and Tanganyika in the east, to central Kasai and most recently in northeast Ituri.

On March 23, Kinshasa said it would refuse to take part in the Geneva conference claiming tha the level of the country's humanitarian crisis was not so ""excessive"".

That is far from the view of the United Nations which considers DRC one of its humanitarian priorities along with Yemen and Syria.

""We are led by people who don't like us,"" commented the internationally-known Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege, who cares for women rape victims in the troubled east.

He called the attitude of the Kinshasa authorities ""scandalous"".

This article is part of a series of stories and op-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of this year’s International Women’s Day on March 8.

KIKWIT, DR Congo, Mar 4 2018 (IPS) - The numbers are hard to fathom. Nearly two million people driven from their homes in 2017 alone. The worst cholera epidemic of the past 15 years, with over 55,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. Countless others killed, maimed or sexually assaulted.

The human costs of the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo are borne disproportionately by women and children, whose homes have been pillaged and burned, who are not in school and thus vulnerable to soldier recruitment, and who have now been left with almost nothing.

Charlotte Ukuba, 60, fled to Site Etat at Kikwit, Kwilu Province in the southwest of DR Congo.

‘’I’m living now outside with my eight children,” Ukuba told IPS. “My husband was killed last year by the Kamwina Nsapu’s violence in Kasai province. When I came here, I was living first in a church with other displaced persons. But last week, a pastor chased us away. I have no money and need clothes for my children.”

Her eldest daughter is suffering from malaria. ‘’There are no drugs for this girl. I’m calling for help,” she added.

Violence broke out in Kasai in August 2016 following the uprising of local militia in Kasai Central. The crisis has been characterized by repeated clashes between militias and local security forces, which have subsequently generated inter-community conflicts.

Another displaced woman named Rose Thimbangula died at the age of 47 on Feb. 14 in Nzinda commune in Kikwit. The cause of death was tuberculosis complicated by fistula due to sexual violence. She had no money for medicine.

Dressed in a long black dress, Marie Ntumbala, 37, sleeps on the floor of a small room in Mweka, Kasai province. She is originally from a village called Tutando, 150 kilometers from Tshikapa, but was forced out by conflict. Ntumbala was fortunate enough to be taken in by a local family. But she says she is still living on the edge.

“When I’m ill, I can’t go to the hospital because I’m penniless. The Congolese government must help all the displaced persons in our country,” she said.

DR Congo has some 4.5 million internally displaced people, the largest number in Africa. Elections scheduled for 2017 were postponed to the end of this year, as political instability and clashes between soldiers and militias continues to escalate. An estimated 120 armed groups are operating in eastern DR Congo alone.

Humanitarian actors launched the largest ever funding appeal for the country this year, asking for 1.68 billion dollars to assist 10.5 million people. Only half of the 812.5 million dollars appealed for in 2017 was funded.

Brigitte Kishimana is 28 years old and six months pregnant. She lives at the Moni Site in Kalemi, Tanganyika province in the southeast. ‘’I need prenatal care,” she said. “Several other pregnant women at the sites need it too. If not, their lives will be in danger. Last year, four displaced women died during pregnancy or childbirth,” she told IPS.

Georgette Bahire, a 45-year-old farmer in Sud-Kivu province, fled Lulumba village on June 29, 2017. Fighting between government soldiers and the Mai-Mai, an armed group, drove her from her land. She was taken in by a family in the city of Kibanga.

“Humanitarian workers helped us in 2017 with food and some drugs. But the needs are still great,” she said.

Since the beginning of this year, armed conflicts have continued to plague the country, particularly in the areas of Rutshuru, Masisi, Walikale, South-Lubero and Beni. The gradual withdrawal of humanitarian aid workers from these areas has amplified the vulnerability of people affected by the humanitarian crisis, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a September 2017 report.

“The crisis in DR Congo has deteriorated exponentially over the last two years,” Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told IPS in an interview. “These are not the same conflicts we have been seeing for the last twenty years. Regions that were normally peaceful and stable areas of the country such as the Grand Kasai region and Tanganyika have now become hotbeds of unrest, with intercommunal violence displacing hundreds of thousands.”

“The fighting in the Kivus and Ituri is pushing the conflict in DR Congo closer and closer to a regional humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes into neighbouring countries like Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. A fresh appeal is necessary because while humanitarian needs are exploding and assistance is not able to meet the pace of needs.”

Egeland called on the international community to prioritize the humanitarian crisis in DR Congo and step up their efforts to help the 13.1 million people in need of assistance.

“If not,” he warned, “there will be fatal consequences for the country and possibly for the region.”

IOM is working to provide durable solutions for 5,973 IDP households in the North-Kivu province.

‘’Currently, IOM is helping 77 displaced women suffering from fistulas caused by sexual violence,” IOM Programme Officer Jean-Claude Bashirahishize told IPS. “In 2017, IOM received 205 cases of sexual violence in 12 sites,” he said, adding that cultural taboos made it difficult for women to talk about what had happened to them.

IOM helps victims of sexual violence get economic assistance, but also to train in livelihood activities so they can become self-sufficient.

‘’Insecurity is the greatest barrier to IOM accessing areas where armed groups are fighting government military forces,” Bashirahishize added.

Patrice Mushidinima, a civil society leader at Bukavu, the county seat of Sud-Kivu province, confirmed this, telling IPS, “Sud-Kivu province has 33 distinct armed groups operating in the area.”

In October 2017, the Congolese government and FAO helped more than 20,000 internally displaced persons, of whom about whom 70 percent were women and children at Kikwit, Kwilu province. But the situation is growing increasingly dire.

‘’Farmers who fled due to conflict have missed three consecutive planting seasons. This has left people with almost nothing to eat. Food assistance is failing to fill the gap. Only 400,000 out of the 3.2 million severely food insecure people in Kasai received assistance in December. More than 750,000 are still displaced,” FAO, UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) warned in a statement.

‘’IDPs have rights that need to be respected by the government and other authorities in the country. The Congolese Constitution claims that human life is sacred,” Valentin Mbalanda, a human rights activist in DR Congo, told IPS.

The European Commission, United Nations, and Dutch government will co-host a pledging conference in April. Jan Egeland said that international donors must give the same attention and priority to DR Congo that they do comparable crises around the globe.

“That means they must put their muscle and weight behind a successful donor conference and fulfill any pledges made. Donors must also look at needs on the ground and not just the bottom line. The DR Congo crisis of 2018 is not what is was in 2000 or 2005,” he said.

“Lastly, the international community must acknowledge the consequence of doing nothing. The stakes in DR Congo are high if inaction is the route we choose. There could be mass loss of life and humanitarian neglect could destabilize the entire region. This is a crisis of conscience that the world cannot afford to ignore.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-crisis-world-can-no-longer-afford-ignore

Thermo King, a provider of transport temperature control solutions, has announced that Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP) has selected its SLXi-DRC units to fulfill its largest, single domestic reefer container (DRC) order in Canadian history. CP is the first Thermo King customer to purchase the SLXi-DRC unit in North America.

The SLXi-DRC units have a slim profile, which increases cargo capacity by providing room for an extra pallet row of cargo space in the container. The SLXi-DRC also uses next-generation, lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant, R-452A, helping companies like CP and Thermo King meet sustainability goals.

“At CP it is important that we use equipment that is both efficient and reliable to best serve our customers,” said Jonathan Wahba, CP vice president, sales and marketing, Intermodal and Automotive. “By introducing the new Thermo King SLXi-DRC units to our fleet and to our CP TempPro service offering, we can offer highly reliable, innovative and sustainable refrigeration options to our customers.”

“We presented the SLXi-DRC refrigeration unit last year as a concept to our North America DRC rail customers and we received a great response,” said Dane Taival, vice president and general manager, Thermo King North America. “The ability to add an additional pallet row of cargo per container translates to increased profit for our customers. Domestic rail transport is a very competitive market, and every additional pallet of product adds to a customer’s bottom line.”

CP and Thermo King collaborated on an extensive, four-month field test of the new SLXi-DRC unit to verify performance of the technology in the rugged environment and climate of Canadian’s railways.

“We installed the unit on a six-year-old CP container and tested performance on a variety of loads – from fresh, to frozen, to pharmaceuticals, and on temperature extremes of -15 to 65 degrees F,” said Don Bradd, vice president and general manager, Thermo King Eastern Canada. “Performance downloads were taken regularly and our partners at CP recorded fuel levels before and after every trip. Internal box temperatures were always well below targets, and fuel economy, quality and reliability were all proven with the SLXi-DRC unit.”

Thermo King was the first transport refrigeration business to offer next generation refrigerants in its North America products. Understanding that customers operate in highly regulated spaces, it is the business’s mission to understand and address current and future regulatory requirements.",http://www.globaltrademag.com/global-logistics/canadian-pacific-chooses-thermo-kings-new-slxi-drc
15,drc,"DR Congo (MNN/MAF) — Violence in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has caused thousands of displaced people to flood the city of Bunia, where two makeshift refugee camps have sprung up.

According to Jon Cadd, program manager with Christian organization Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) in eastern DRC, the camps lack enough food and shelter for all the refugees. A small group of local Christians is attempting to feed the hungry, and MAF has provided rice, beans, maize meal, and cooking oil, but it’s just a drop in the bucket.

“There are over 100,000 IDPs (internally displaced people) in Bunia now,” said Cadd. “The big humanitarian organizations are still assessing the situation and organizing things to come, so there is still no food coming into the camp other than what the Bunia Christians are giving out. Today there were two bags of rice at the storage tent when we got there. We were able to purchase a 300-liter cooking pot at the market along with 30 more bags of rice to keep them going.”

Shelter for the displaced Congolese people is also in short supply. MAF reports refugees are constructing tent frames by tying together stalks of thick grass, but the camps have run out of tarps for the makeshift shelters, leaving thousands of people exposed to the rainy-season weather.

The crisis is expected to grow as people in eastern DRC are forced to flee their homes and villages. The MAF team heard of 41 civilians killed along the Lake Albert shoreline north of Tchomia. Many people are trying to flee by boat to Uganda, but this week one of the overloaded boats capsized and 10 people drowned.

Cadd said some of the refugees who reach Bunia are injured but medical care is not available. “There is a tent where the wounded are being placed but no medical work is going on and it’s hot beyond reason and feels very unhealthy. We saw people with machete wounds to the head, including a one-year-old who was cut across the face … and a little eight- or nine-year-old girl cut across the back of her neck.”

These injured families had not eaten in four days, so the MAF team decided to do a little extra for them.

“We got 10 tarps, five local cooking stoves called babulas, some pots, plates and cups, as well as food, and were able to give it to them personally so they didn’t have to wait in the long lines. When you can’t help everyone it feels like the little we are doing is useless in the scheme of things. But as it rained in the evening, we knew that at least 10 more families were not out in the rain and had food to eat,” said Cadd.

MAF’s Ashley Petersen said one of the biggest needs in the IDP camps right now is for more tarps.

“One lady, Juliet, she had three children and had walked for four days to get to the camp. Her husband remained with their home to try to protect it and keep it. She didn’t know if he was alive or not or if their home was still standing. But she and her children were sleeping underneath this frame in the rain. We were able to go back in and hand-deliver a tarp to her.

“She is never going to forget that moment and what it did for her family. It’s going to cause ripples for her in her life and possibly for eternity thinking about how in that moment some people came in Jesus’ name and gave her and her children a tarp to sleep under.”

“It’s that small piece. We cannot be everything to everyone. But if one person decides, ‘You know what? I want to put one tarp over a family’s head,’ that’s $15 and they don’t have to sleep in the rain.”

Petersen said your prayers are also needed. “Prayer is always important. If people can continually pray for peace here, it makes a world of difference. There is more going on than just the actual acts of violence. There is such a stronghold here with the Enemy, it’s just unbelievable at times the things that you experience living here and see. So prayer is very important.”

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world, and is frequently troubled by violence. According to The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in January 2018 more than 4.5 million people were displaced inside the country. Lack of roads and infrastructure, as well as political uncertainty, contribute to the insecurity.

Mission Aviation Fellowship (www.maf.org) is a global agency that has been operating in the DRC since 1961. Serving with seven aircraft from bases in Nyankunde, Bunia, Lubumbashi, and Kinshasa, MAF supports the work of medical teams, mission groups, development agencies and others seeking to share the gospel and improve conditions in isolated parts of the DRC.

16,drc,"This article is part of the follow-up brief of the pre-election period in the DRC. The first article from the brief can be found here.

While the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) drags on, the Kabila regime is attempting to gain support in the region as best it can. Meanwhile, the opposition is still mobilising the public to push for the organisation of elections.

Since the end of Kabila's term in 2016, there have been calls to bring an end his hold on power and to the denial of civil liberties, a situation that many say has gone on for too long. Since last December, those who oppose the regime have stepped up demonstrations which have been met with force by the police.

On 19 March, a lengthy letter landed on the desk of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres, the successor to Ban Ki-moon. In it, the Catholic Lay Committee of the DRC (CLC) asked that the MONUSCO mandate be renewed to prevent any pre-electoral tension and that the United Nations, therefore, come to the aid of the DRC in organising elections.

Violent crackdown

Contradicting the government release figures, the Joint Commission of Inquiry 31 21 estimates that the demonstrations held on 31 December and 21 January reportedly led to the death of 14 protestors, 12 of whom were shot dead and 2 from tear gas inhalation. Around 40 people were reportedly arbitrarily arrested then subjected to degrading treatment during brutal interrogations. On 25 February 2018, a 35-year-old man named Rossy Mukendi Tshimanga and a second individual were both killed during the protests. On 1 February, the Joint Commission of Inquiry 31 21 was organized under the patronage of the Minister of Human Rights and included delegates representing the Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Justice, the National Human Rights Commission, members of civil society, the United Nations Joint Office for Human Rights and the African Union Liaison Office.

On 11 March, this very commission urged the government to:

lever l’interdiction générale des réunions et des manifestations publiques et pacifiques et de mettre à la disposition de la Justice tous les moyens nécessaires pour mener des enquêtes judiciaires et poursuivre les auteurs de violations et atteintes aux Droits de l’Homme en lien avec les manifestations publiques du 31 décembre 2017 et du 21 janvier 2018.

Lift the total ban on public and peaceful demonstrations and assemblies and also make any necessary means available to the Judiciary in order to carry out judicial inquiries and prosecute those responsible for violating and attacking human rights in connection with the public demonstrations held on 31 December 2017 and 21 January 2018.

A few days later, on 15 March the IRDH (Research Institute in Human Rights) requested that these recommendations be extended to the telecommunication companies (PDF) in the country. The cuts in internet access the day prior to these demonstrations are a particular focus of this request.

The opposition demands elections

At the same time, the opposition movement is still calling for the departure of Kabila and the rapid organisation of the elections. On 12 March, several opposition leaders and activists made a three-day trip to South Africa to rally behind leading opposition politician Moïse Katumbi. The message of this candidate is clear:

…together I suggest we build an alternative Congo.

Since being voted in as presidential candidate by the G7 coalition in March 2016 (the G7 is a coalition of opposition political parties), the former Governor of the Katanga Province has been the target of repeated attacks from the regime. Sentenced to three years in prison after a real estate fraud accusation that many felt was likely controlled by the regime, Katumbi has been living in exile since May 2016. Katumbi is expected to return in June to submit his candidacy to the presidency.

This three-day assembly in South Africa was, therefore, an opportunity for the opposition to show their support for the 53-year-old opponent who has been calling for “credible and transparent” elections. For several weeks, the Kabila government has been saying it would like to set up an electronic voting system, something that the opposition criticises as being an attempt to rig the elections.

Support for the regime is dwindling

For his part, Kabila is attempting to gain support. After being put under pressure by the United Nations Security Council who condemned the demonstration crackdowns; after being abandoned by Belgium, a historic ally of the country who broke off its bilateral relations with the DRC at the end of January; and after being criticised by the European Union who requested that an International Criminal Court Inquiry be opened, the regime is attempting to win over its neighbouring countries.

The president was expected to attend the extraordinary session of the African Union on 20 March in Kigali. Despite first sending Minister of Justice Alexis Thambwe Mwamba and a delegation intended to prepare the groundwork — this will be no easy feat.

While President of Rwanda Paul Kagamé appears to be a historic ally of Kabila, supporting him today seems to be increasingly difficult for the other African leaders. Several countries that are traditionally friends of the DRC, like Zimbabwe, Angola, South Africa and even Botswana, are breaking their solidarity with the regime. Although increasingly isolated, Kabila shows no sign of standing down. This is a worrying situation for many analysts who fear that the country will sink further into a political stalemate.",https://globalvoices.org/2018/03/28/drcs-joseph-kabila-isolated-as-delays-to-organise-the-2018-elections-continue/
17,drc,"It was in the middle of the last Sunday mass of 2017 that the crackdown began. Armed security forces entered churches, hurled tear gas canisters and arrested priests and altar boys for supporting demonstrations against the government of President Joseph Kabila.

Over the year before that December 31 assault, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Catholic Church in the country had maintained an increasingly tense but largely civil relationship. When Kabila had refused to step down on December 31, 2016, despite a constitutional requirement that he do so, it was the Church that had brokered a peace agreement between the government and the opposition, under which the president committed to quitting by the end of 2017.

As that day approached, though, Kabila made clear he had no intention of fulfilling his promise, and protesters filled the streets of Africa’s vastest country. On the final day of the year, Church bishops joined in the protests marking the anniversary of the deal under which the president was to quit. At least eight protesters were killed by police and 120 arrested in the anti-Kabila demonstrations on December 31, 2017.

Clashes between police and Catholics … are likely to continue until Kabila steps down from the presidency. Father John Baptist Nkuhe, organizer of a protest against President Kabila

But if Kabila had expected the use of force to quell the Church’s criticism, he was mistaken. The Church has since taken on a far more public role against Kabila, emerging as the principal pillar of opposition to the controversial president in the country where half the population is Catholic. It is organizing and leading protests, as clashes between police forces and Catholics too have mounted through early 2018. The Church is working with local communities to influence key economic policies — its interventions were critical in shaping a new mining law that imposes higher taxes on foreign firms. And it is carving out a diplomatic role for itself, getting both the Vatican and the UN to weigh in against Kabila and to demand elections in the country.

It’s a tussle that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen before, when former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko successfully stared down opposition from the Church in the 1980s after it had criticized his policies and asked citizens to vote according to their conscience. But for the two decades after Mobutu’s regime ended in 1997, the Church has played the role of referee, staying out of overt politics and public policy. And indeed, through history, leaders of predominantly Catholic nations have tried to get the Church to legitimize their rule. But this time, the battle lines are drawn far sharper than in the 1980s. Kabila isn’t backing down, but neither is the Church, setting the stage for a drawn-out crisis with religious leaders at the heart of a nation’s search for political salvation.

“Since [December 31, 2017], several clashes between police and Catholics have continued to take place and are likely to continue until Kabila steps down from the presidency,” says Father John Baptist Nkuhe, one of the organizers of demonstrations in the country’s east.

The divide is sharp. The leader of the Catholic Church in the country, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, has said in a statement that he condemns the “barbaric manner in which policemen killed innocent protesters” this past New Year’s Eve. But the government’s spokesperson, Lambert Mende Omalanga, has said protesters had violated a ban on demonstrations that was imposed because of intelligence inputs “indicating that criminals were going to infiltrate the protests and cause chaos.”

The genesis of these current tensions lies in the same crisis that has torn at the nation’s unity since Kabila’s refusal to leave power after his term expired at the end of 2016. The president argued then that the country wasn’t ready for fresh elections since most voters hadn’t yet registered. Violent protests at that time left more than 50 people dead, before the Church mediated an agreement giving Kabila breathing space for a year — but no more.

A few days after the signing of the December 2016 agreement, however, several Catholic churches in different parts of the country were attacked by armed men who vandalized property and kidnapped some priests. The worst-hit region was Kasai, one of the country’s poorest parts, where anti-Kabila protesters attacked the police. The office of the papal nuncio in Kinshasa said in a statement at the time that 60 parishes, 34 religious houses and 141 schools were closed or damaged because of clashes between the police and rebels. Though the police insisted that the churches were being attacked by bandits, eyewitnesses said that some of those who vandalized churches were in uniforms similar to that of the national army.

“It is likely the attacks on churches were a warning to the bishops and Catholic Church at large that it should not interfere in the country’s politics,” says Congolese political analyst Thomas Kasongo. The Church complained to the government, but the response was tepid. Even today, some priests who were kidnapped then have not been traced.

If that was a proxy war, the battle is now out in the open, with the government’s harsh actions against the Church following recent protests, and declarations by bishops that they will lead similar opposition action all over the country.

The Church has demonstrated its capacity to challenge Kabila, an ability the government can’t ignore, says Kasongo. The Church manages most schools and hospitals in the country and works across the nation’s villages. It has also lent its voice to key economic debates. The Church lobbied — successfully — for provisions in the country’s new mining law that address environmental and developmental concerns of local communities that have long argued that the benefits of the industry haven’t reached them.

It is also pulling its diplomatic clout. In January, Pope Francis called on the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to avoid violence. And on March 19, a Congolese clergyman addressed the UN Security Council, seeking their intervention to ensure that the country holds democratic elections soon. The Security Council issued a statement censuring Kabila.

But Kabila has shown that he isn’t too perturbed by either the international community or by the Church. “The way the state reacted by even sending soldiers in churches shows it can do without the Church,” says Kasongo.

The crisis is deepening. But there’s little pointing to a resolution, in a country with a long history of violent conflicts over political ideology and ethnic affiliations. A new one is shaping up — only this time, with religion too in the mix.",https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/can-the-church-lead-drc-to-political-salvation/83453
18,drc,"Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. [IVN-TSX; IVPAF-OTC] on Thursday March 29 said a formal proposal outlining recommended changes to the 2018 national mining code has been submitted to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Minister of Mines by a group of international mining companies that includes Ivanhoe.

The announcement follows recent revisions to a DRC mining code that are expected to impact every mining project in the African country.

On March 9, 2018, DRC President Joseph Kabila signed into law a new mining code that raises royalties and taxes on mining operations, while removing a stability clause in the current law that has been protecting miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years.

The group of international mining companies with operations in the DRC are now collectively negotiating with the DRC government in a bid to resolve corporate concerns about anticipated impacts on their DRC operations.

The group includes Randgold Resources Ltd. [GOLD-NASDAQ, LSE], AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. [AU-NYSE; AGG-ASX; ANG-JSE], Glencore PLC [GLEN-LSE; GLN-Jo’burg; GLNCY-OTC], Ivanhoe Mines, Gold Mountain International/Zijin Mining Group, MMG (PTY) Ltd. and China Molybdenum Co. Ltd.

A joint statement issued today by the group of international mining companies on Thursday said their proposed changes would address the DRC government’s expectations of increased public revenues from the mining of mineral resources and address concerns within the industry about the impacts of some provisions in the new mining code.

This week’s submission to the Mines Ministry by the companies, in part proposes linking a sliding scale of royalty rates to the prices of key DRC mineral commodities, which the companies believe would be a more effective mechanism than the windfall tax introduced in the new code and, at current prices, would provide the government immediately with a larger share of revenues than it would receive under the new code.

The submission by the companies also addresses stability arrangements, state guarantees and mining conventions.

The international companies have stated that they accept 76% of the articles in the 2018 code and are proposing changes to the remainder only to ensure the effectiveness and legality of the code.

“Ivanhoe encourages caution in reviewing reports and statements made before these discussions are concluded and mining regulations are brought into effect,” said Ivanhoe Executive Chairman Robert Friedland.

Ivanhoe Mines is advancing its three principal projects in Southern Africa, including:

Mine development at the Platreef platinum-palladium-gold-nickel copper discovery on the Northern Limb of South Africa’s Bushveld Complex.

Mine development and exploration at the Tier One Kamoa-Kakula copper discovery on the Central African Copperbelt in the DRC.

Advancement towards a new era of production at the high-grade Kipushi zinc-copper-silver-germanium mine, which is also located on the DRC’s Copperbelt.

A prefeasibility study for Kipushi and announced in December 2017, is forecasting life-of-mine average annual planned zinc concentrate production of 381,000 tonnes per annum, with a concentrate grade of 59% zinc. Total zinc production is expected to be 8.6 million tonnes of ore at 32.14% zinc over a period of 11 years to produce 2.5 million tonnes of zinc metal in concentrate.

The Kipushi prefeasibility study anticipates annual production of an average of 381,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrate over an 11-year initial mine life at a total cost of approximately $0.48 per pound of zinc.

Back in October, 2017, Ivanhoe said it had agreed to rebuild 34 km of track to connect the Kipushi Mine with the DRC national railway at Munama, south of the mining capital of Lubumbashi. The Kipushi-Munama spur line, which has been inactive since 2011, will be rebuilt under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by Ivanhoe Mines and the DRC’s state-owned railway company.

A February 2018 mineral resource estimated has boosted the combined Kamoa-Kakula indicated mineral resource to 1.03 billion tonnes at 3.17% copper, containing 72 billion pounds of copper, plus an additional 182 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources at 2.31% copper at a 1.5% cut-off.

The new mineral resource estimate establishes the Kamoa-Kakula Project as the world’s fourth largest copper discovery.

As a fresh wave of civil unrest engulfs the Democratic Republic of Congo, the nation’s government unveiled late last month a new electronic voting machine which it claims will be instrumental in carrying out this year’s presidential elections, booked in for December 23.

However, critics fear that incumbent president Joseph Kabila – whose term was officially over in November 2016 and who had promised to hold elections late last year – is simply using the machines as a ruse to further delay votes, with the ultimate goal of maintaining power indefinitely.

Against the backdrop of increasingly violent and vocal civil unrest, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) introduced domestic and international journalists to a new electronic voting machine, which it maintains is indispensable to meeting its target of the December 23 elections.

Yet critics are concerned that these machines are just another bait-and-switch to allow Kabila to postpone elections further – or worse, to manipulate the voting. Indeed, shortly after they were unveiled, the machines, which had been imported from South Korea, broke down when they were being presented to a parliamentary commission in Kinshasa.

French only

Furthermore, it is estimated that 60,000 of the devices will be needed to service a country two-thirds the size of western Europe. Ahead of election day, more than half a million electoral agents will need to assist with their deployment, along with efforts to update the electoral roll. What’s more, the machines operate only in French – not in any of the nation’s four other official languages. These obstacles alone could end up as convenient excuses for Kabila to renege on his promises once again.

The integrity of an electronic ballot has also been called into question by the international community. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has claimed that America ""has no appetite"" for such a system, highlighting the fact that it has never been tested in the country. Notwithstanding that display of unequivocal opposition, government-controlled media have tried to paint the international stakeholders as supportive of their venture.

It is key to note that Kabila has a long history of employing questionable excuses to postpone his secession of the presidency. Previously, he has cited issues ranging from incomplete electoral registration to underfunding of CENI to militia violence in the central region of Kasai – a consequence, ironically, of his own refusal to step down.

It’s easy to imagine that as election day approaches, the voting machines will end up as yet another subterfuge – especially since, as CENI head Corneille Nangaa swore, ""Without voting machines, there won't be elections on December 23 2018.""

DRC tinderbox

How far has the DRC fallen. After the horror of Africa's World War in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the world hoped with bated breath that Kabila could bring some much-needed stability to this turbulent region. The son of the previous (assassinated) president, Kabila ruled for a transitional period from 2001 until 2006, before winning two more elections (in questionable circumstances) and serving a 15-year tenure.

Yet his rule has been characterised by an increasingly tenuous but iron-willed grip on power, with conditions for everyday citizens slowly but steadily deteriorating. Despite being one of the most resource-rich countries in Africa, it’s estimated that annual inflation has reached 50% and almost 10% of the population (7.7 million people) struggle with extreme hunger.

And in the wake of Kabila’s refusal to cede power in 2016, the situation has only deteriorated, with surging conflict forcing more than 1.3 million people to flee their homes, 800,000 of them children.

The Catholic church

In response to the rising chaos in the country, step forward the Catholic church. With 32 million followers in a nation of 80 million, the church is one of the few institutions capable of wielding power against Kabila and was behind a deal reached with Kabila in late 2016 to organise elections by December 2017.

Yet when the time came, Kabila once again sidestepped his obligations, incurring the wrath of church leaders, who have been coordinating a new wave of peaceful protests against him. Since then, three church-led anti-Kabila marches have taken place; on December 31, January 21, and February 25.

The authorities have used tear gas and live ammunition to disperse protesters on all three occasions, resulting in at least 17 deaths and countless more injuries. The government callously maintain that there have been minimal casualties and deems all victims “known terrorists”. Yet that does precious little to explain why an infant is currently struggling between life and death after having inhaled teargas in the February 25 protest.

Beyond colour and creed

The government have also tried to further divide their opponents by instigating a Muslim counter-protest – a claim which has been categorically quashed by COMICO, the Islamic Community in Congo. Meanwhile, exiled businessman and politician Moïse Katumbi, who is seen by many as the greatest political threat to Kabila’s rule and the country’s best chance of a democratic leader, has called for opponents of the president to unite, regardless of colour or creed. Earlier this month, Katumbi succeeded in rallying together opposition parties into a coalition backing his candidacy, itself an impressive feat in a country as fragmented as the DRC. And though he has promised to return to the country by June, he still remains in Belgium, where he fled after a botched assassination attempt and in order to avoiding incarceration for trumped-up money laundering charges.

Endgame

Surely keeping lawful elections at arm’s length can’t succeed indefinitely – so what is Kabila’s endgame? Judging by similar events in other increasingly authoritarian states like the Republic of Congo and Rwanda, it’s entirely feasible that the president is postponing his abdication just long enough to find a loophole which will allow him to engineer himself a third or even fourth term in power.

After all, Kabila has already suggested ""reframing"" the legality of peaceful protests, so he may well take an oft-used page from the dictator’s playbook and seek to alter the constitution for his own personal gain. Yet if the international community wants to avoid another “World War” in Africa, they must step in to negotiate with Kabila for his own peaceful resignation – before he goes beyond the point of no return.",https://www.opendemocracy.net/amanda-clarkson/drc-s-joseph-kabila-unveils-his-latest-ruse

Multiple crises are spiraling out of control in Congo - in the central Kasai region and in the eastern Kivu and Ituri provinces - aggravated by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his elected mandate in 2016.

Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30 percent from a year ago, the United Nations said in a report earlier this month.

It has declared the crisis to be at Level 3, the world body’s highest-level emergency.

“We all believe that the humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day. It’s not business as usual,” said Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.

He spoke to Reuters during a trip to eastern Congo.

Concern over the deterioration of the situation in Congo, a country with a long history of war and humanitarian crises, has pushed the United Nations, the European Union and donor nations to organize a conference in Geneva next month.

They are seeking to raise $1.7 billion, nearly four times the amount secured last year, to support humanitarian activities in Congo.

But Congo this week disputed the U.N. assessment of the gravity of the crisis, which it said would discourage investment at a time when the government was attempting to stabilize the volatile economy.

“Activating the highest level of humanitarian emergency based on facts that are not real constitutes a hindrance to development,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

It added that, unless the humanitarian statistics were brought in line with the government’s own figures, it would not send representatives to the conference in Geneva.

Stylianides, who was touring Congo’s hard-hit North Kivu province on Sunday, was due to travel to the capital Kinshasa later in the day to attempt to convince the foreign and humanitarian affairs ministers to reverse the decision.

“We will try to persuade them that this is not good for DRC but above all for the vulnerable people in DRC,” he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-eu/congo-crisis-worsening-eu-says-as-government-shuns-aid-conference-idUSKBN1H10PK

22,drc,"Luanda - The Government of Japan has provided about USD 250,000 for the Kasai, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) refugee support operations in Dundo, Lunda Norte, Republic of Angola.

The funds provided enable UNICEF to continue humanitarian assistance in the areas of nutrition, water, hygiene and sanitation, as well as the promotion of good health practices, UNICEF said in a statement.

The support of the Government of Japan joins efforts by the Government of Angola, UNICEF and other partners to support refugee families who have found peace, security and stability in Angola after being forced to leave their areas of origin in Kasai, due to the violent conflicts that swept across the region.

The donation serves to finance UNICEF interventions in community management of malnutrition cases, maintenance and expansion of equipment facilities such as latrines and basic showers.

The funding also serves to protect children, particularly the use of latrines, adoption of hygiene care and prevention, which are fundamentally related to violence against children and women.

Since the beginning of 2017, UNICEF has been supporting response actions in the nutrition, water, hygiene and sanitation sector, child protection and social mobilization work with refugee communities in Lunda Norte.",https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/japan-and-unicef-support-drc-refugees-lunda-norte
