0,philippines,"It’s been over six months since powerful back-to-back storms left “catastrophic” damage in Puerto Rico.

The federal recovery effort in this American territory has been under fire nearly every day since then. Critics note that hurricane relief in Texas and Florida last year was quicker, more robust and more effective.

At the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, we study the the role of the armed forces in disaster relief and humanitarian emergencies worldwide. So we decided to examine the U.S. military’s deployment to Puerto Rico after hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Limited by posse comitatus

Hurricane Maria hit the island on Sept. 20, 2017. The first soldiers arrived in Puerto Rico eight days later and would stay until mid-November. Eventually, 17,000 troops – including active duty, reserves and National Guard – were deployed to both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Their mission: to conduct search and rescue missions, provide medical care and restore power. Soldiers also delivered food and water to both residents and emergency responders there.

Our first question was why it took the military over a week to get to Puerto Rico. By comparison, U.S. troops were in Haiti two days after its 2010 earthquake.

The answer has to do with an 1878 law called the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits American armed forces from performing domestic law enforcement duties. In other words, the U.S. military does not respond to disasters on home soil unless ordered to do so by an act of Congress or for a “humanitarian assistance mission.”

When, in late September, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., suggested that the military should take over aid distribution in Puerto Rico from the Federal Emergency Management Agency – which was clearly stretched thin by its simultaneous responses to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria – Lt. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, commander of the U.S. Army North, rejected the idea. His response invoked the limits imposed by the Posse Comitatus Act.

“This is not a dictatorship,” he said. “The military does not take charge of these kinds of operations in the homeland.”

The Department of Defense had sent several FEMA liaisons to the Caribbean before Maria. But, by law, it could not mobilize troops until it was determined that civilian agencies were unable to manage the disaster response. For this reason, the U.S. military can actually respond more quickly to international emergencies than it can at home.

By Sept. 27, FEMA had requested help and the military was preparing to dispatch its first brigade of soldiers to Puerto Rico. Buchanan was named chief of the mission.

Deployments abroad and at home

Though it rarely does disaster relief at home, the U.S. military frequently responds to emergencies abroad. Between 1970 and 2000, American troops provided international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief 366 times, mostly in the Pacific. In the same period, they engaged in combat just 22 times.

We used these foreign deployments as a basis of comparison for evaluating the U.S. military’s Puerto Rico mission. And though some experts have recommended more training for these missions, our prior research has generally found that U.S. troops are quite good at international disaster response.

The U.S. Armed Forces score well on what we’ve identified as critical indicators of military success in a relief mission. They typically deploy quickly, bring a specialized skill set, coordinate well with aid agencies on the ground and plan their arrival and exit appropriately.

We modified these indicators slightly to assess the military’s humanitarian response in Puerto Rico, a domestic emergency. And, beyond the relatively slow mobilization, we found the military performed about as well in the Caribbean as it has abroad.

The deployment of 17,000 troops, 82 aircraft and three combat support hospitals was comparable in size to the U.S. military’s mission in the Philippines after 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan. There, 13,400 troops were deployed to some 450 disaster zones across the country.

As critics have observed, that is far smaller than the Haiti earthquake response, when 22,000 troops and 33 U.S. military ships were sent to the island.

This makes sense when given the death tolls of these various disasters, though. Some 230,000 people died in Haiti’s earthquake. Roughly 12,000 died in the Philippines. When the U.S. went to Puerto Rico, the government there maintained that just 16 people had died in the storm – though that would turn out to be a very low count.

Critically, however, fewer other organizations were working in post-hurricane Puerto Rico than were present in Haiti or Philippines.

After Typhoon Haiyan, 23 militaries jointly responded, including 23,000 Filipino troops, 13,400 U.S. troops and at least another 10,000 soldiers from other countries.

Dozens of international organizations also typically rush in to help after a disaster in the developing world. Groups like the International Committee of the Red Cross, CARE and Save the Children provide emergency assistance alongside soldiers.

International armies and charities do not undertake humanitarian relief in the United States. As a result, just a handful of national aid groups – among them the American Red Cross, Caritas de Puerto Rico and Habitat for Humanity – deployed to the islands after Hurricane Maria. They were soon joined by the military.

But, in the end, there simply was not enough manpower to get the job done.

Coordination is key

Our research suggests that the most critical factor in any humanitarian response — whether in a post-disaster scenario or in a conflict setting — is coordination. To succeed, military responders must work together with the civilian groups and government agencies on the ground.

One big reason why the 2005 Hurricane Katrina response in New Orleans failed, for example, was lack of coordination between the Department of Defense – which oversees the U.S. military – and FEMA. That disaster spurred the DOD to create a liaison position integrated with FEMA.

The Puerto Rico response shows that this new system has in fact improved coordination. Our study determined that when military personnel arrived, they complemented – rather than duplicated – the efforts of the federal officials, local authorities and humanitarian organizations already on the ground.

The military brought manpower to the island, including engineers, medical staff and airlift capabilities. This aided in the search and rescue, health care and power restoration work underway. The military also provided translators, mortuary affairs teams and tower climbers.

Coordination was not flawless. A recent report from the Center for Army Lessons Learned finds that FEMA and the military were not always “aligned and synchronized.” Sometimes, for example, they competed to conduct airlifts.

But, in our assessment, the DOD-FEMA liaisons effectively ensured the coordination necessary for the Puerto Rico mission.

Scale of damage was an obstacle

Even so, Puerto Rico’s recovery has clearly lagged. Power has yet to be entirely restored and over a thousand people died from storm-related causes in the weeks after Maria.

What went wrong?

Our interviews with Department of Defense responders suggest that the biggest challenge was the sheer scale of the damage left by Hurricane Maria.

Puerto Rico’s government was completely overwhelmed, making it very difficult for FEMA and the U.S. military to get a clear picture of what was most urgently required – and where – in the first days after the storm.

The island’s total power outage, in particular, hobbled emergency aid. Troops and FEMA staff deployed across the island could not communicate with affected communities.

The rundown condition of the power grid, already fragile before Maria, also made it massively harder to get the lights turned back on. No brigade of soldiers, no matter how well trained, can overhaul the energy infrastructure of a place as big as Puerto Rico in days.

Finally, because Puerto Rico is an island territory with no neighboring states, first responders like the National Guard struggled to arrive quickly. When parts of Texas were badly hit by Hurricane Harvey in September 2017, the National Guard was simply dispatched from elsewhere in Texas and from nearby states.

Lessons learned

Overall, we believe that the U.S. military itself performed as well in Puerto Rico as it does in its international relief missions.

But our assessment reveals real shortcomings in planning for disasters – especially considering that hurricanes occur regularly in the Caribbean.

Puerto Rico is not the first time the U.S. military has been called in to provide humanitarian assistance on domestic soil. It won’t be the last.",http://theconversation.com/military-mission-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-was-better-than-critics-say-but-suffered-flaws-91558
1,philippines,"Manila (ICRC) – Five months after the end of the clashes in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur province, humanitarian organizations working on the ground estimate that 81,000 evacuees and returnees are still struggling to meet their basic needs: water, food, sanitation and education. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working together with the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) and the local authorities to aid the affected communities, particularly with clean water.

“At the Saguiaran evacuation centre, 400 families have been reliant on the water we have been delivering by truck for nearly a year now,” Alessandro Giusti, head of the ICRC water and sanitation team in the Philippines, speaking on the occasion of World Water Day.

Last week, the ICRC finished building a system that will regularly supply clean water for these evacuees who face prolonged displacement. ""Water is closely linked to public health. Waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera, as well as sanitation issues, can be prevented if there is regular supply of potable water,"" said Mr Giusti.

Two new generator sets were recently donated to the Marawi City Water District (MCWD) to guarantee a regular supply during unexpected power outages. The generators kept two pumping stations functional during the initial phase of residents’ return, before the power supply was restored.

The ICRC will support the authorities’ broader rehabilitation efforts, including a three-month study to assess the current condition of the water system in Marawi City. “The result of this assessment will give us baseline data to define and plan the rehabilitation of Marawi’s water network,” said MCWD acting general manager Dr Ali Descallar. The study will commence in April and be conducted in coordination with the MCWD, the Local Water Utilities Administration and Task Force Bangon Marawi.

A neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organization, the ICRC has assisted more than 100,000 people displaced by the armed conflict in Marawi, in partnership with the PRC. It also works to promote respect for humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles through bilateral dialogue with weapon bearers and visits to people detained in relation to the conflict.

President Trump on Thursday came closer than ever to publicly endorsing the death penalty for drug dealers, a policy he has reportedly advocated for in private.

“Some countries have a very, very tough penalty — the ultimate penalty,” Trump said at a White House summit on the opioid crisis. “And, by the way, they have much less of a problem.”

Speaking at the White House opioid summit, Trump said countries with the “ultimate penalty” have less of a drug problem than the US pic.twitter.com/npkFcjk4ah — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) March 1, 2018

“If you shoot one person, you get life in prison,” he added. “These people kill 1,000, 2,000 people and nothing happens to them.”

Among the countries that execute drug traffickers are Singapore and the Philippines, whose authoritarian president, Rodrigo Duterte, has earned Trump’s admiration. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump said to Duterte on a phone call last year. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”

Under Duterte’s rule, 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers have been killed in the Philippines, some by police and some by vigilantes, according to Human Rights Watch.

Trump’s interest in executing drug dealers fits a pattern that’s seen him advocate for law enforcement solutions to the opioid crisis, without giving equal attention to treatment and prevention efforts. As he said in his first State of the Union address, “We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.”",http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/trump-solve-the-opioid-crisis-by-executing-drug-dealers.html
3,philippines,"ALAMOSA -- The Rev. Carl Andrews, retired Canon to the Ordinary for the Diocese of Colorado, will celebrate Eucharist at a special Easter Sunday service at the Bridge, 3407 Carroll St., Alamosa, 11 a.m. April 1.

Andrews, a United States Air Force Chaplain, Colonel, and now retired Canon to the Ordinary for the Diocese of Colorado, served in Vietnam, where he was called to be a priest, then a military chaplain. His career includes time in Australia; Alaska; the Philippines, where he lead humanitarian efforts following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo; at the Pentagon during the attacks of 9-11 and ultimately serving as Command Chaplain for all USAF personal in Europe. Today, as retired, he is pleased to live out his personal motto of “serving others in ministry where the rubber meets the road.” His personal interests and passions are mentoring chaplains, working with Post-Traumatic Stress and brain-injured patients, teaching young people, sharing the Gospel and fly fishing.

Born March 5, 1948, to the late Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Joseph and Kathleen Agnes Andrews, his early life was strongly influenced by the multiple countries and locations he lived as a military child, including a period attending an English boarding school. He graduated from Central High School, London, England, and from Colorado State University, Colorado, with a bachelor’s degree. Upon graduation in 1970, and following in the footsteps of his American father who flew Spitfires for the British during World War II, Andrews was commissioned a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and trained as a Weapons Officer. His first duty station was Phan Rang, Vietnam, with follow-ons to Da Nang, Vietnam and Takhli, Thailand. During his time in Vietnam, Carl wrestled with the vocation to priesthood; upon ordination in 1977, he returned to Colorado as a curate to St Timothy’s, Littleton, and then to the Western Slope of Colorado as a mission priest.

During his five years in Craig, Andrews responded to a call to become an active duty US Air Force chaplain. His assignments have included Colorado, Thailand, Montana, Australia, the Republic of the Philippines, California, Illinois, the Pentagon, Germany, and Texas. Like most service members, he spent short tours in Turkey, France, Spain, Iceland, the Azores, Bosnia, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, Italy, Norway, Holland, and Belgium.

The zenith of Andrews’ military ministry was his assignment to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, where he served as Command Chaplain to all USAF personnel serving in Europe. While assigned at Ramstein he also served as an intensive care chaplain at Landstuhl Hospital, ministering to wounded returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A personal high point of Andrews’ Air Force career occurred during his last assignment as senior chaplain, Basic Military Training, Lackland AFB, Texas. In this capacity, Carl authored the Air Force’s Spiritual Fitness program for over 5,000 Basic Military Training recruits attending chapel each weekend, providing them a spiritual foundation and ensuring the program’s fourth “tie-down of spirituality.”

Lynne, Andrews’ wife of 45 years, will accompany him to Sunday’s service. All are welcome at the service. There will be no Easter service at St. Thomas Church this year.",https://alamosanews.com/article/the-rev-carl-andrews-to-celebrate-easter-at-the-bridge-in-alamosa

Sazon said she has joined the tradition for seven years in the hope of being cured of severe headache and nervous breakdown. Thousands of Filipino Roman Catholic devotees and tourists descended Friday on a farming village north of Manila to witness the crucifixion of several men in a reenactment of Jesus Christ’s sufferings, a gory annual tradition church leaders frown upon. (Aaron Favila/Associated Press)

SAN PEDRO CUTUD, Philippines — Seven Filipino Roman Catholic devotees, including a woman, were nailed to wooden crosses in a Good Friday reenactment of Jesus Christ’s suffering that was watched by thousands of spectators but frowned upon by church leaders.

Three devotees wearing crowns of twigs were nailed to crosses by villagers dressed as Roman centurions on a dusty hill in San Pedro Cutud village, and four others were nailed to crosses in nearby farming villages in San Fernando city north of Manila, tourism officer Ching Pangilinan said.

The spectacle reflects a unique brand of Catholicism that merges church traditions with folk superstitions. Many of the mostly impoverished penitents undergo the ritual to atone for sins, pray for the sick or for a better life, or give thanks for what they believe were God-given miracles.

The Lenten rituals are frowned upon by church leaders in the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, especially if the events are used to boost tourism and business. The reenactments of the crucifixion, however, have persisted and become a tourist attraction in the largely unknown villages in Pampanga province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the capital.

While the crucifixions have become a tradition for villagers, they still leave many foreign tourists bewildered.

“It’s terrible,” said Luke Henkel from Florida. “You wanna stop it.”

Mayor Edwin Santiago of San Fernando, where San Pedro Cutud lies, said more than 400 police officers were deployed and first-aid stations set up to look after the huge crowds.

“We provide assistance because we can’t stop the influx of tourists,” Pangilinan said. “We don’t promote it as a festival but it’s rather a show of respect to a local tradition.”

Villagers used the crowd-drawing events to peddle food, water, fans, umbrellas and souvenirs and rent out parking slots and toilets. A leading cellphone company provided tents for shade with its name embossed on them.

Archbishop Socrates Villegas said it’s best for Catholics to mark Lent with prayers and acts of love and charity.

“Instead of spilling your blood on the streets, why not walk into a Red Cross office and donate blood? Choose to share life. Share your blood,” Villegas said in remarks posted on a Catholic church website.

Friday’s reenactment of Christ’s crucifixion was the 32nd for Ruben Enaje, a 57-year-old sign painter who began his yearly rite after surviving a fall from a building. He plans to stop when he turns 60.

Maryjane Sazon, a 39-year-old beauty salon worker, said she joined the reenactments seven years ago in the hope of being cured of severe headaches and a nervous breakdown. Her act Friday was dedicated to her sick sister.

Prior to the cross nailings, dozens of male penitents walked several kilometers (miles) along village streets while beating their bare backs with sharp bamboo sticks and pieces of wood. Some had their backs cut to keep them bloody.

Foreigners have been banned from taking part since an Australian comic was nailed to a cross under a false name a few years ago near Pampanga. Authorities also believe that a Japanese man was nailed to cross as part of a porn film in 1996.

5,philippines,"STAND where the warm sea laps the gleaming white sand of the 4km-long beach on the resort island of Boracay and whip out your selfie stick. You can capture an image of yourself against the impossibly beautiful backdrop of an orange sun dropping from a pink sky into a deep blue sea. Or you could, if the parasailors and banana-boat riders would only get out of the way. And then there is the local feature that your camera cannot capture: the peculiar whiff wafting up from the water at your feet.

“Boracay is a cesspool,” President Rodrigo Duterte declared, with customary frankness, in a speech last month. “You go into the water, it’s smelly. Smells of what? Shit.” Look down, and your toes curl up in the green algae washed ashore from the shallows where it grows, fed by sewage that seeps untreated into the sea from the resorts and ancillary businesses that cram the island. Look up, and you see the start of the evening parade of tourists up and down the beach-front. They are Chinese or Koreans, mostly, a horde in search of the perfect place to drink, eat and be merry after a day of fun in the water. They appear unperturbed.

Resort-owners, in contrast, are alarmed. “I will close Boracay,” the president has threatened. He claims to have told his environment secretary, Roy Cimatu, “I’ll give you six months. Clean the goddamn thing.”

Boracay’s beach has earned the island world renown. Over 2m tourists visited in 2017, spending 56bn pesos ($1.1bn). Yet businesses here seem reluctant to invest in disposing of their sewage in the way required by law. Mr Cimatu’s inspectors found that only 383 of the 578 places they had checked by late February were connected to the sewage system and that, anyway, the system needed repairs.

The legend among backpackers is that two Swiss discovered Boracay in the age of the Hippie Trail. The ensuing trickle of escapees from suburbia were delighted to have to wade straight onto the beach from an outrigger boat, dine on the barbecued catch of local fishermen and sleep in thatched huts. These days planeloads of visitors step ashore on a concrete jetty, from which motor-tricycles whisk them to concrete hotels complete with air conditioning, cable and Wi-Fi.

By threatening to close this flawed paradise, the president is perhaps just trying to scare resort-owners into spending some money to preserve their main asset, the beach. But as his bloody campaign against drug-dealers proves, not all Mr Duterte’s threats are hollow.",https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21739703-or-least-treat-its-sewage-president-philippines-wants-close-paradise
6,philippines,"If you care about the planet, don’t recycle.

Because there’s a very good utilitarian argument our 50-year practice of reducing, recycling and reusing does more harm to the environment than good.

In other words, it makes ideological not necessarily environmental sense.

China has been the dumping ground for much of the world’s unwanted recyclables. That changed in January when China imposed strict new restrictions effectively banning imports of recyclable foreign paper and plastic.

Much of what was coming to China was contaminated and difficult to process. And while recycling may no longer make sense as an industry in a country with 1.3 billion people and a significant trash issue of its own, China never should have been the world’s recycling dumping ground.

How does it make environmental sense for the city of Halifax, for example, to ship 80% of the plastic water bottles and grocery bags it collects, as the CBC reported this week, halfway around the world by truck, rail and ship then truck again to China?

What is the carbon footprint of that journey?

What is the carbon footprint here, in Ontario, of having two sets of garbage trucks make rounds, spewing greenhouse-gas creating emissions, to pick up trash destined to be shipped thousands of miles away?

Different studies offer conflicting views of whether recycling causes net harm or benefit to the environment. Recycling aluminum for example is far more efficient than mining aluminum to produce new products.

It would seem to defy common sense that there’s much net carbon footprint and benefit to collecting then shipping paper and plastics vast distances for processing. However, recycling ideologues can twist a good tale to support doing that.

Whether doing so is ethical, the right thing to do, is an entirely different question.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself on the uncomfortably pointed end of questions during a Philippines trip last fall over why Canada dumped some 2,500 tons of soiled diapers and rancid household trash in 103 shipping containers there five years ago, claimed it was recyclables and then refused to take responsibility when the Filipinos objected.

Why was Canada doing shipping recyclables to the Philippines in the first place?

Because we’re not dealing with the waste we create.

Cities have struggled since the early 1970s when municipal recycling began to take off over how to process the stuff they saved from landfill. Now that China has shut its borders, dump sites across North America face a recycling crisis and are being forced to stockpile mountainous bales of paper and plastic.

But in crisis there is also opportunity, in this case to take responsibility for waste at its source.

Provincial governments, if they actually want to be environmentally responsible, should ban the shipment of recyclables outside their borders.

Among the possible outcomes — investment in local recycling technology and business and jobs. Or provinces could consider using trash as fuel for power generation.

That’s being done elsewhere in the world using clean incineration technology, that while not completely without environmental impact it’s clearly preferable over shipping containers full of waste on tanker ships burning high-sulphur and CO2 heavy oil. And it places responsibility for dealing with waste with those who create it.

Other parts of the puzzle potentially include packaging laws, and packaging is becoming more of a problem in world where Amazon ships everything in a box or paper envelope.

Our oceans are awash in plastic trash – and dumping from ships is part of the problem.

China has forced the world to confront the dirty secret hidden by recycling’s clean, environmentally friendly public image.

It’s time to stop viewing the world through an ideological lens and indiscriminately associating virtue with popular causes.

Doing the right thing is more than a matter of good intentions. It matters to ensure what we’re doing is right.

7,philippines,"Overseas Filipino workers say their goodbyes to their loved ones before leaving for another country to work. ABS-CBN News file photo

PAMANTINGAN - When the rains failed in 2015 and drought gripped southern Mindanao in the Philippines, Corazon Vegafria knew what she had to do: move to the city of Koronadal, about an hour away by bus, and find work as a domestic helper to support her family.

Her husband looked after the children while Vegafria sent home most of the P2,000 ($38) she earned every month cooking and cleaning at her employer's home.

""We had no choice – we needed the money, and I could easily find a job in the city,"" she said. Six months later, she returned home ""when the situation improved"".

In the past two decades, the Philippines has emerged as one of the world's leading source countries for migrant workers, particularly as more powerful typhoons and other harsh weather make life at home harder.

More than 10 million Filipinos currently work abroad, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. But in the last few years, the gender balance has shifted, with about 55 percent of overseas workers now women, its data shows.

That makes the Philippines an outlier in a world where most migrant workers are men.

Globally, migration is growing, especially among families hit by disasters, conflict or weather shifts - and that growth does not always adhere to traditional patterns.

In some places, seasonal migration is slowly leading to permanent relocation. In others, migrants are heading to new destinations. In the Philippines, one of the biggest changes is that migration is gradually taking on a female face.

Each day, hundreds of rural women pack their bags for jobs as maids and care-givers, largely in the Middle East and the United States. Others go to Singapore and Hong Kong.

Thousands of women also flock to Philippine cities including Manila, Davao and Koronadal, where they work as domestic helpers or in malls and restaurants, sending money home to pay for their children's schooling or to invest in farms their husbands tend.

""Migration is linked to low agricultural productivity, natural disasters such as droughts and typhoons, failed deals to secure land rights, and conflicts,"" said Alvin Chandra, a research fellow at the University of Queensland in Australia.

""Increasingly, it is a coping strategy for young women to diversify family income and overcome poverty,"" said Chandra, who has studied migration in Mindanao, where an armed conflict has raged for decades.

HIGHER SALARIES

Across Southeast Asia, people are migrating in rising numbers, with the wealthier countries of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand the top destinations, according to the World Bank.

Singapore's average monthly wage is more than 30 times that of Cambodia, while Malaysia's is triple that of Indonesia and the Philippines, it said.

Migration plays an outsize role in the Philippines' economy, where remittances from overseas workers make up about a 10th of gross domestic product - the highest share in the region.

Women are leaving home in greater numbers, as they can get long-term jobs more easily. Men, by comparison, usually land short-term, seasonal work.

Some migrants, like Vegafria, move for a few months at a time to get their families through a lean period. But many end up staying on, as a cycle of frequent storms and drought makes it harder to live off the land.

Elisabeth Pacaldo, for instance, moved to Manila in 2002 to work as a nanny after income from fishing and farming fell in the Visayas region where she came from. Her husband stayed behind to care for their five children.

After four years, Pacaldo, now 55, was able to send for three of her kids. Her husband moved to Manila in 2008 to work as a driver.

""It's easier for women to find work in the city, and the salaries are higher. I can't go back,"" said Pacaldo, who now works as an administrative assistant in a non-profit.

'EXTREME CHOICES'

Worsening extreme weather is an important driver of migration in rural parts of the Philippines, a country seen by experts as highly vulnerable to climate change.

""There are some climate impacts where adaptation and risk reduction efforts are no longer a feasible option. People have to make extreme choices, and migration is one of them,"" Chandra said.

The Philippines and other developing nations must acknowledge migration as one way of coping, and develop ""a comprehensive strategy that ensures the safety and dignity of their most vulnerable people"", he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Philippines has a well-established system for workers looking to move overseas: the government lists job opportunities and offers orientation courses.

Recruitment agents operating in the country must attend a seminar before getting a licence, and a refresher course when renewing.

But there is little support for - or data on - the millions of women who move inside the country, a group at risk of abuse and low wages, according to Gabriela, a rights group based in Manila that records cases of abuse.

There have also been complaints about the treatment of Filipino maids overseas. President Rodrigo Duterte earlier this year banned workers from going to Kuwait following the discovery of the body of a Filipino worker in a freezer.

Earlier this month, the two countries reached an agreement regulating conditions for domestic workers.

Last year, Indonesia agreed to continue sending domestic helpers overseas, after temporarily banning them from going to 21 Middle Eastern countries following cases of abuse.

GENDER RELATIONS

The benefits of migration are undeniable for most Filipino families - and for the country's economy.

""Even members of the household who do not migrate benefit from remittances that boost budgets and reduce poverty,"" the World Bank said in an October report.

""In the Philippines, households that are able to send a member abroad have two-fold or three-fold greater odds of escaping poverty,"" it added.

Filipinos overseas sent home a record $28 billion in cash remittances last year, money that helped fuel spending and sustain expansion in one of the world's fast-growing economies.

But the movement of women is also having an unhappier impact on households in a country where men have long been the main earners, and often had a bigger say in the family.

""With the migration of women, there is a shift in community values, lifestyles and gender relations that has led to greater domestic conflicts and violence,"" Chandra said.

""With women being away, their right to participate in community life and decision-making is challenged. They are also vulnerable to abuse and trafficking,"" he said.

President Duterte has said his long-term aim is to slow the exodus of workers by boosting the domestic economy and creating jobs that provide sufficient income.

In Sultan Kudarat district in Mindanao, some migrants are finding ways to return home - and stay.

When Geneline Castillo, 47, got back after working seven years as a domestic helper in the Middle East, she joined a cooperative that trains farmers in organic growing methods.

She now cultivates rice and vegetables on the 2-hectare plot she and her husband lease, and has bought a motorbike for trips to the market.

""It's better here with the family, and I now have a livelihood option, even if the money is less,"" she said.

""But my daughter has gone to Dubai to work. I could not stop her - there is nothing for her here,"" she said.",http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/30/18/philippine-migration-takes-on-a-female-face

On 13 January 2018 at 4:21 PM, Mayon Volcano generated a phreatic eruption (steam-driven) that propelled a grayish steam and ash plume approximately 2,500 meters high that was drifted to the southwest. Based on seismic records the activity lasted approximately 1 hour and 47 minutes.

Due to Mayon’s decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption, the Alert Level status of the volcano has been downgraded to Level 2 as of 8AM today, March 29, 2018.

Tesla has deployed its Powerpack batteries to the Philippines, helping a local solar company construct a 2MW/2MWh micro-grid for the town of Paluan, which has been suffering from notorious power outages for years. The project went online back in December, giving the town round-the-clock electric power for the first time.

To complete the project, Tesla partnered with local renewable energy company Solar Philippines. According to a report from Energy Storage News, Solar Philippines believes that the 2MW/2MWh will be enough to provide reliable power to the town’s residents 24 hours a day, at 50% less than the usual electricity costs. A 2MW diesel generator is on standby as well, ready to provide extra power when the need arises.

Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste believes that the Powerpack installation in Paluan would be the first of many renewable solutions in the country. The Solar Phils. executive further noted that “there is no reason” why other towns in the country would not follow suit, considering the cost benefits offered by solar-battery installations.

The benefits of the solar-battery system are notable. Thanks to the 2MW/2MWh micro-grid, the town’s residents were able to experience a Christmas absent of power outages for the first time. Schools in the area have also begun using computers. An ice plant, which would support the local fishermen, is also being planned. The town’s residents aired their gratitude to Solar Phils. and Tesla in a recent photograph, proudly declaring that there are no more power outages in the area since the batteries and solar arrays were installed.

The tiny town of Paluan, located just below the largest island in the Philippines, is home to around 16,000 people, according to a census conducted in 2015. The town is infamous for its struggles with electricity, with power outages becoming a part of its residents’ daily routines. The town first got electricity back in 1978, though the region’s grid was only able to provide power for 4 hours a day. This was improved in 2014, when the Philippines’ National Power Corporation was able to provide the town with electricity for 16 hours on a daily basis. Despite this improvement, however, power outages were still common, with some lasting for several days.

Tesla’s Powerpack systems have become game changers for areas with unstable electricity. Over the past few months, Tesla’s 100 MW/129 MWh big battery near Jamestown in South Australia had helped the region’s beleaguered energy grid hundreds of times, at one point even providing backup energy after a coal-powered plant unexpectedly experienced a power loss in December. Tesla had also announced other, more ambitious projects for the country, such as a 250 MW/650 MWh virtual power plant involving 50,000 residential units and Tesla Powerwall 2 batteries.

As we noted in a recent report, however, Tesla’s initiatives in South Australia are currently hitting roadblocks from the government, with newly-elected premier Steven Marshall stating that he would not support the company’s virtual power plant initiative. LNP senator and Minister for Resources Matt Canavan also dismissed Tesla’s efforts, calling the Powerpack farm near Jamestown the “Kim Kardashian” of energy.

11,philippines,"Quezon City, The Philippines – Fossil fuel companies are today under the spotlight as hearings begin in the Philippines into their contribution to human rights harms resulting from climate change.

Youth, scientists, and legal experts are among those to testify in what is the world’s first national human rights investigation of its kind into the ‘Carbon Majors’ – 47 investor-owned carbon and cement producers, among them Shell, BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ENI, ExxonMobil, Glencore, OMV, Repsol, Sasol, Suncor, Total and RWE. [1]

“We can no longer ignore the impact of significant changes in global temperatures and the rising sea levels on people’s lives. We have been witness ourselves in this country to a spate of natural disasters and supertyphoons such as Ondoy, Sendong, Pablo and of course Yolanda, with grave consequences. Some of the survivors and victims of these disasters who have directly suffered from them are here with us today,” said Chair of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, Jose Luis Martin “Chito” C. Gascon, at the opening of the first hearing session.

The investigation was triggered by a petition filed at the Commission in 2015 by representatives of communities across the country. These include survivors of super-typhoons such as Haiyan (Yolanda), fisherfolk from Alabat originally known for its rich fishing grounds, communities living near Bataan coal power plant situated in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines, and civil society groups, including Greenpeace Southeast Asia-Philippines. [2]

The investigation has the potential to shift global understanding of corporate responsibility for climate change, bringing attention to the role of fossil fuel companies in creating the climate crisis. The petitioners aim to set the record straight by demonstrating that the coal, oil, and gas companies are the most responsible for the climate crisis and must take action to prevent further harm resulting from impacts.

“Justice must be delivered to the communities living on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Their basic rights to food, water, shelter, health, and even life are under threat from climate change,” said Amalie Obusan, Philippines Country Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “It is the fossil fuel companies who hold the lion’s share of responsibility for climate change and the harms it creates, and they can and must be held accountable.”

Participating in the hearings are people from different sectors of the community, who have been impacted by climate change; as well as the Climate Change Commission of the Philippines and other local and international experts. They will testify about climate science and impacts, the link between climate change and human rights, and the responsibility of fossil fuel companies to respect human rights. [3]

“This petition is both a moral and legal plea to address climate change as one of the greatest threats to human rights of our time and an opportunity to uphold the rule of law where corporate actors that have contributed to climate change and knew about the foreseeable harms caused by climate change have a responsibility to respect human rights,” said Lisa Hamilton, Director of the Energy and Climate Program of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and one of the expert witnesses.

The petitioners are demanding that representatives of the companies attend the public hearings and present their plans for phasing out fossil fuels in order to prevent future human rights harms resulting from the impacts of climate change.

Ms. Rica Diamzon Cahilig, an Indigenous Peoples youth leader, is among those who are opening the first day of the public hearings to share how climate change has impacted her family, education, and even the cultural tradition of pagdadanso, which is on the verge of extinction. “We used to be able to go to the mountains when food is unavailable in the city. But we cannot do that now,” Cahilig shared in Filipino. [4]

More hearings are scheduled in the Philippines, the US and Europe in the coming months. The Petitioners hope that the Commission will conclude its investigation by the end of this year and issue its resolution in early 2019.

12,philippines,"(CNN) — Is an anti-fake news law proposed in Malaysia really designed to protect the country's citizens, or is it just a way for the government to clamp down on the media and stifle free speech?

With elections around the corner and a years-long financial scandal plaguing Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, many within the country's media, legal fraternity and civil society are worried about the government's intent in introducing the bill.

The proposed Anti-Fake News Bill 2018 will give the government sweeping powers to hit those it deems guilty of creating or spreading fake news with jail terms of up to six years and fines that could as high as $130,000.

It is expected to be easily passed next week as Najib's ruling coalition has a majority in the country's 222-seat parliament and is but the latest example of how the phrase championed by U.S. President Donald Trump has been adopted and used by leaders across Asia.

At the heart of the problem is a broad definition of what constitutes fake news and who an offender could be.

The bill defines fake news as ""news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false,"" and an offender as somebody who by any means ""knowingly creates, offers, publishes, prints, distributes, circulates or disseminates any fake news or publication containing fake news.""

Particularly concerning to international media is that the proposed law will also give the Malaysian government extra-territorial reach – an offender need not be either Malaysian or in Malaysia for the law to apply, as long as the fake news ""concerns Malaysia or ... a Malaysian citizen.""

In February, de facto law minister Azalina Othman Said said the government is prioritizing the bill because fake news threatens national security.

Azalina rejected claims the law would be another tool used by the authorities to crack down on dissent, saying it would protect all parties, government and opposition alike.

'Legislative overkill'

However, Zaid Ibrahim, a former minister in charge of legal affairs, was blunt in his assessment of the bill.

""This law is necessary for Najib, but not the country. He needs this to put fear in people, that they can go to jail if they criticize him,"" he told CNN.

Calling it ""useful for the elections,"" Zaid said political campaigners are already becoming wary of what they say, even though the bill hasn't even been passed yet.

He added that the 1MDB scandal – which has seen Najib accused of misappropriating massive amounts of money – has ""everything to do"" with the anti-fake news bill.

The scandal has made numerous headlines in the international media, and Zaid said Najib will apply the new law to protect himself and try ""everything possible to put a stop to the 1MDB investigation.""

""We are the most oppressive country in the world,"" he said.

The former minister is not the only person who has come out against the bill. Najib's own brother, Nazir Razak, chairman of the CIMB banking group, has taken to social media to call for it be deferred.

The Malaysian Bar Council has also urged that the bill be withdrawn, with its president George Varughese saying the organization is ""deeply troubled"" by the proposed legislation, and calling it ""legislative overkill.""

Crackdown on satire

Varughese said since the proposed law criminalizes fake news but does not clearly define it, it could be used to suppress freedom of expression.

""The wording of the provisions is sufficiently wide for an action to be brought challenging 'correct' or 'incorrect' views on, for example, economy, history, politics, science and religion,"" he said in a statement.

He added the proposed legislation does not deal with a situation if the government publishes ""fake news.""

Speaking to CNN, Varughese highlighted the international ramifications of the law, saying if an alleged offender is in a country with whom Malaysia has an extradition treaty, it's possible for that person to be sent there for punishment.

""Also they run the risk of being arrested and charged the moment they set foot in Malaysia,"" he added.

The lawyer also expressed ""serious concern"" caricature, parody and satire ""which by their very nature may involve some embellishment"" would now be criminalized.

Najib and his government have been the butt of a great many jokes and have often responded with criminal and civil suits.

Artist Fahmi Reza was jailed and fined earlier this year for portraying Najib as an evil clown, while political cartoonist Zulkiflee SM Anwarul Haque, known popularly as Zunar, has been slapped with sedition charges, travel restrictions and a ban on nine of his comic books.

Malaysia already has a plethora of laws that can been used to control media and individual freedoms, Varughese said.

""There is no need for this law. All that this act is intended to cover is already in other legislation,"" he said.

These include the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, the Internal Security Act 1960, the Sedition Act 1948 and the Official Secrets Act 1972.

These laws grant the government broad powers to, among other things, arrest and detain individuals without trial, classify government documents, shut down publishers – and punish false news with criminal charges.

Echoes of Donald Trump

The phrase ""fake news"" has gained traction in Southeast Asia since it was popularized by US President Donald Trump in 2016.

Officials in Myanmar have used it to disparage international coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has hurled the term at Rappler, an online news publisher and one of his staunchest critics. Cambodia's leader Hun Sen has also used it to slam media in his country.

Singapore is planning legislation to tackle online falsehoods, and has set up a parliamentary select committee to probe the issue. The committee called on representatives of major tech companies including Google, Twitter and Facebook to provide statements.

Malaysia's bill has been labeled especially draconian by Steven Gan, the editor-in-chief of prominent online news site, Malaysiakini. The site has been taken to court, threatened with closure and raided by police several times in its 18-year history.

Gan says he's ""pretty sure"" the law is for the government to defend itself in the elections.

""It cannot argue to defend its record, so this will stop the opposition from attacking them,"" he said.

Of particular concern to Gan is that the government could make an ex-parte application to the courts over alleged offenses -- which means offenders would not be present or able to defend themselves.

""The court will only hear one side – the government's side. A court order will be issued and if you don't take it down, it's an additional offense,"" he said. ""You can challenge it, but if the government uses public order or national security as a reason, then you have no chance.""

Gan added the jail term and huge fines could deter whistle blowers and journalists from coming forward: ""If there was a similar law in the US in the 70s, there would probably have been no Watergate.""

13,philippines,"MANILA, Philippines (Corrected, 3:26 p.m.) – The Philippines was among five nations that rejected a resolution by the United Nations' human rights body on the human rights situation in Myanmar.

The Philippines joined Burundi, China, Cuba and Venezuela in opposing a UN Human Rights Council resolution to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar for another year and to call for the safe return of displaced residents.

The resolution also calls on the government of Myanmar to lift the curfew in Rakhine State and ""ensure freedom of movement and the safety and security of all persons

without discrimination, to grant and facilitate immediate, safe and unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to United Nations agencies and their partners, and other domestic and international non-governmental organizations.""

The resolution was adopted during the UNHRC session in Geneva, Switzerland last Friday with 32 countries voting in favor, ten abstentions and five nations against.

In its explanation of its vote, the Philippines said it had been following the developments of the ""complex"" inter-communal issue in northern Rakhine State, which includes the positive developments.

The UNHRC resolution also recognizes efforts by the Myanmar government to prepare for the voluntary return of Rohingya refugees and ""the admission by the Myanmar military for the first time of the extrajudicial killing of 10 Rohingya villagers in Inn Din village, northern Rakhine State.""

The Philippines cited that although it condemns the acts of violence, it is ""not supporting the international fact-finding mission as it rested on the wrong assumption that domestic investigative processes were not independent and credible.""

It however, said that it supports the provision of humanitarian assistance and urge the international community to further assist Myanmar and its neighbor Bangladesh.

The resolution strongly condemns the ""reported widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations and abuses committed in Rakhine State since 25 August 2017.""

It also ""expresses its deepest concern about the disproportionate response of the military and the security forces and deplores the serious deterioration of the security, human rights and humanitarian situation, [and] the exodus of almost 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh.""

The UNHRC and nations in favor of the resolution are calling for a full and independent probe of reports of systematic human rights violations and abuses as reported

by several UN bodies including the HRC independent international fact-finding mission.

The resolution also requested the special rapporteur to present a progress report in its future sessions.

How the Philippines voted in the past

In November 2017, the Philippines also voted against the draft resolution of a UN General Assembly committee draft resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar.

The draft resolution urged Myanmar to end its military campaign against Rohingya Muslims living in its Rakhine state.

The draft resolution also called on Myanmar to grant full citizenship rights to Rohingya Muslims as they are treated as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

The Philippines was then among the ten nations that voted against the draft resolution, which earned 135 votes in favor and 26 abstentions.

Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano justified the country's vote saying he thinks the issue is being “politicized.”

Cayetano said the options of the Philippines were ""no"" and ""abstain"" because, as chairman of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations, the country wanted member nations to resolve issues among themselves.

""I can assure all of you, our heart goes out to those affected, we are doing what we can to help them,"" Cayetano said in November.

""We don't just look at the title. If we think the issue is being politicized, we don't support it,"" he said.

The Foreign Affairs chief said then that the Philippines wants Myanmar to quickly exert efforts to return the situation to normal and undertake earnest talks with Bangladesh, where displaced Rohingyas have been staying, to stop violence on all sides.

He noted there were many acts of violence ""left and right.""

In September 2017, Malaysia disassociated itself from a statement on the situation in Myanmar that Cayetano made as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

The statement, issued on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, condemned attacks against Myanmar security forces and acts of violence ""which resulted in loss of civilian lives, destruction of homes and displacement of thousands."" It also expressed support for Myanmar's government ""in its effort to bring peace, stability, rule of law"" in the area. ""The Foreign Ministers acknowledged that the situation in Rakhine State is a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots. They strongly urged all the parties involved to avoid actions that will further worsen the situation on the ground,"" Cayetano also said then.

Malaysia's Foreign Affairs Minister Anifah Aman, in a strongly worded disavowal, said Cayetano's statement ""was not based on consensus.""

""The statement (of Cayetano) also omits the Rohingyas as one of the affected communities,"" Aman said in a statement.

Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila will wash the feet of migrants and refugees during this week’s Holy Thursday evening liturgy that commemorates Christ’s washing of the feet of His disciples.

Cardinal Tagle, who is also President of Caritas Internationalis, the Church’s worldwide humanitarian confederation, recently released an Easter message urging men and women of goodwill worldwide to join the Caritas “Share the Journey” campaign that aims to reach out to migrants, tackle prejudice by changing perceptions and help people open their hearts and their minds.

The Caritas “Share the Journey” campaign was launched in September 2017 with the backing of Pope Francis.

Migrants, refugees, priest



Among those whose feet the cardinal will be washing at Manila Cathedral are the parents of Joanna Demafelis, the overseas Filipino worker found dead in a freezer in Kuwait.

There is a foreign Catholic couple who sought refuge in the Philippines because of religious persecution in their homeland.

There are also two indigenous environmental refugees, who fled their homelands because of massive militarization and destruction by logging and mining companies.

There will also be Father Teresito “Chito” Soganob, the priest held captive by the Maute terrorist group for almost four months in Marawi City in the south. The priest’s inclusion in the Holy Thursday rite is also significant as the Filipino Church is marking the Year of the Clergy and Consecrated Persons.

Holy Week



The Holy Week that begins with Palm Sunday commemorates the last days of Christ’s life, and is the most solemn period in the Christian calendar. With Holy Thursday begins what is called the Easter Triduum, the three days that climaxes into Christianity’s greatest feast, Easter, or the Resurrection of Jesus from death.

There are two main liturgical events on Holy Thursday: the Chrism Mass, which is celebrated by the bishop together with the priests of his diocese, commemorating the institution of the Holy Eucharist and the priesthood by Jesus at the Last Supper. During the Mass, the Chrism or the holy oils used in the administration of various sacraments in the coming year are blessed.

The Mass of the Lord’s Supper, celebrated on Thursday afternoon or evening, commemorates Jesus washing the feet of his disciples in a gesture of loving service.

Philippine Church open to suffering brethren



“This is a new mission for the Philippine Church - opening our arms to our Christian brethren who suffer persecution in their country,” the cardinal said.

The migrants’ ministry of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines in September 2017 reported that there are about 30 refugees, mostly from Pakistan, who are being cared for by the local Church.

There are also about 600 refugees and asylum seekers in the country and majority of them are from Iran, Syria, Pakistan and Somalia.

In the footsteps of Pope Francis



Meanwhile, Pope Francis will celebrate Holy Thursday’s evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper in Rome’s “Regina Coeli” prison, where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates.

Last year, Cardinal Tagle washed the feet of drug addicts, drug surrenderers, policemen, government officials, volunteers and relatives of victims of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.

So we’re going to have to be very strong on penalties.” Channel News Asia Reports

Trump has praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war on drugs has led to the extra-judicial killings of alleged traffickers.

Philippines police say they have killed 4,100 drug suspects as part of the campaign, while rights groups claim the real toll is around three times the number. The International Criminal Court is investigating.

At an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump unveiled an anti-opioid abuse plan, including his death penalty recommendation and one for tougher sentencing laws for drug dealers.

For Trump, the visit to New Hampshire returns him to a state that gave him a key Republican primary election win when he was a political newcomer in 2016.

16,philippines,"Executive Summary

The Philippines has a high vulnerability to natural hazards which are attributed to the nation’s geographic position in Southeast Asia. Natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and fires affect the country. Volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are related to the continental plate activity around “the Ring of Fire”. Because it is one of the most geologically active areas, it is nicknamed “The Ring of Fire”. This is a circular arm of active volcanoes that surrounds the Pacific Ocean basin. This area in the Pacific Ocean covers nearly 25,000 miles from the southern tip of South America, to the west coast of North America, across the Bering Strait, through Japan, and into New Zealand. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (also known as Typhoon Yolanda), one of the deadliest disasters to strike the Philippines, affected 26 million people and claimed at least 8,000 lives. Rising sea levels are also a direct threat to approximately 70 percent of the Philippine population, which has forced many to relocate as a result. In addition, climate change has also increased the severity and frequency of natural disasters in the country.

The agricultural tradition and rapid development in some areas of the country leave large portions of the population and the economy vulnerable to natural hazards. Apart from the metropolitan regions, the agricultural workers and fishermen are the most affected population by natural disasters. Approximately one-third of the Philippines total population are employed in the agriculture sector and natural disasters pose significant threats to this population’s food security and sources of income.

The Philippine Government, International Non-government Organizations (INGOs) and local NGOs are all making attempts to address the impact of disasters and climate change at various levels. The Philippine Government has made significant strides in the implementation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning and activities through the development of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) which acts as the lead agency for DRR in the Philippines. The disaster focal points are the NDRRMC and the Office of Civil Defence (OCD). The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is responsible for leading immediate disaster relief efforts.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is a primary responder in disasters and have been deployed frequently to several disaster relief operations in the country in recent years. The Philippines has endured disasters that involve national and international assistance.

There is increased awareness on disaster risk reduction in the Philippines, but proper integration with climate change adaptation and sustainable development policies can be improved. Disaster risk reduction management and climate change adaptation have been integrated in various plans and framework; however, multiple plans can be overwhelming for local government units. The Philippine Government has learned from Typhoon Haiyan that risk communication is essential and through the NDRRMC has issued very specific warnings regarding potential storm impacts as a result.",https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-disaster-management-reference-handbook-march-2018
17,philippines,"(CNN) — Facebook is facing a crescendo of questions about how its user data came to be harvested for political purposes as investors continue to take fright at the risk the scandal poses to its business.

Claims by the New York Times and UK media that Cambridge Analytica tried to influence how Americans voted using information improperly gleaned from 50 million Facebook users have already seriously hurt its brand.

The London-based data analysis firm worked on President Donald Trump's campaign. It has denied the claims and says it did not use Facebook data in the 2016 campaign.

Facebook will hold a staff meeting Tuesday to address questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the company's policies on data protection, two sources with knowledge of the matter told to CNN. The meeting was first reported by The Verge.

An undercover TV report Monday suggesting that Cambridge Analytica was prepared to consider using bribes and entrapment to create videos for clients it could then post to the internet to sway voters is piling on the pressure.

Cambridge Analytica says it does not engage in bribery or entrapment and says the Channel 4 News report was a misrepresentation of how the company conducts its business.

Facebook says the user data in question was initially properly gathered by a psychology professor, who then passed it to Cambridge Analytica. That breached Facebook's rules.

Cambridge Analytica says it deleted all the data in 2015 when it learned that Facebook rules had been broken. It has agreed to an inspection by Facebook-hired auditors, Facebook said Monday.

Facebook shares suffered their biggest one-day fall in four years on Monday wiping $37 billion off the company's value. They fell again in early trade on Tuesday, dropping 3%.

""What matters for this stock, at this time, are the headlines,"" wrote analysts at Macquarie Capital.

Related: What you need to know about Facebook's data debacle

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasn't commented publicly since the scandal broke late on Friday.

But the questions of data privacy thrown up by the scandal strike at the heart of Facebook's business, which relies on more than 1.4 billion users engaging with the platform each day.

Every time they do, they share a bit of information about themselves: what they like, who their friends are, what they want to watch. That data is the product Facebook sells to advertisers who want to target specific customers.

If the Cambridge Analytica scandal leads to tougher data protection regulations – as some policymakers are demanding – or puts people off sharing as much about themselves online, that could hurt Facebook's revenue, and that of all social media platforms. (Other tech stocks suffered in Monday's sell-off too.)

Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives will be bracing themselves for another rough ride Tuesday. Channel 4 News will broadcast a new report at 3:00 p.m. ET on Cambridge Analytica's work in the United States.

Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is facing calls to testify before lawmakers in the United States and United Kingdom.

""The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election,"" tweeted Senator Mark Warner.

Damian Collins, chair of the UK parliament's media committee, requested on Tuesday that the CEO give evidence about Facebook's connection to Cambridge Analytica.

UK data protection officials are seeking a warrant to enter Cambridge Analytica's offices in London to inspect its servers and systems. They are also examining Facebook's response to the unauthorized use of its data.

""We're looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether people were informed,"" Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told BBC radio on Tuesday.

In a statement on Tuesday, Cambridge Analytica says it has been cooperating with the Information Commissioner's office on a number of matters, including the Facebook data, since early 2017 and offered to share ""all the information it has asked for.""

18,philippines,"March 16 marked the 20th year of the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) by the peace panels of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). It culminated a series of formal talks held over 11 months (excluding suspensions and indefinite recesses) in The Netherlands.

CARHRIHL became binding and effective on the two Parties when it was signed by Mariano Orosa, NDFP chairperson, on April 10, 1998, and President Joseph Estrada on Aug. 7, 1998.

It is living proof that with the mutually agreed upon goal of attaining a just and lasting peace, together with enough goodwill and earnest effort on both sides, and despite seemingly irreconcilable positions, a bilateral agreement of far-reaching import as well as immediate benefit can be achieved.

This landmark Agreement seals the first of the four substantive agenda laid out by the two Parties; that is, human rights and international humanitarian law, socioeconomic reforms, political and constitutional reforms, and end of hostilities and disposition of forces. It has led to accelerated negotiations on the remaining items, in consecutive order, albeit haltingly and with great difficulty.

It may well be asked by well-meaning, if by now cynical, observers of the on-and-off peace talks between the GRP (now termed GPH) and the NDFP, what is the point of celebrating an Agreement that has been for the most part either ignored or observed in the breach?

In light of the thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings, displacement of civilians and illegal arrests in the course of the Duterte administration’s “war on drugs,” “all-out war” against communist rebels, and no-holds-barred military operations against supposed ISIS-inspired terrorists, of what use is CARHRIHL in rendering justice to victims of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law?

No matter how edifying, comprehensive and with actual mechanisms for implementation to boot, CARHRIHL appears now to be just a meaningless scrap of paper with little or no benefit to the people so long as it is not upheld by both sides.

Especially with the peace negotiations currently at an impasse, with the GPH saying that these are in fact terminated, what hope is there that the beneficial provisions of CARHRIHL can still be availed of by those adversely affected by the armed conflict and by those whose socioeconomic and civil and political rights are being trampled upon?

Peace advocates from a broad array of organizations — the Philippine Ecumenical Peace Platform (PEPP), Pilgrims for Peace, Sulong CARHRIHL, Philippine Peace Center, Justice Peace and Integrity of Creation (OSB) and ACT for Peace — together with enthusiastic students of St. Scholastica College took the time last Friday to find answers to these questions as they commemorated this historic event.

In his keynote speech, staunch peace advocate Bishop Emeritus Deogracias Iñiguez, gave voice to his fellow advocates’ unequivocal stand that CARHRIHL remains relevant to the situation of armed conflict and rampant violations of HR and IHL in the country today. He underscored the view that the people stand to gain much from CARHRIHL’s implementation by both Parties. He also emphasized that CARHRIHL has an important role to play in breaking the current impasse in the peace negotiations.

Bishop Iñiguez reminded everyone how, in the past 20 years since CARHRIHL was inked, it has served as an instrument to strengthen trust and confidence between the two Parties, generate goodwill and a conducive climate for the peace talks, and thus pave the way to fruitful negotiations on basic social and economic reforms.

Concretely, under the auspices of CARHRIHL, the GPH has released political prisoners (including NDFP consultants) while the NDFP has released captive police and military personnel in order for the peace talks to get back on track and overcome obstacles or deadlocks, even suspensions.

An example of an actual benefit derived from CARHRIHL is the indemnification of tens of thousands of human rights victims under the fascist Marcos dictatorship that the NDFP had consistently and persistently championed. The GPH delivered on its commitment to pass a law providing for such.

Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that there remains a huge gap between the good provisions of CARHRIHL and what is happening in actuality. And while its implementation has served as a confidence-building and goodwill measure for the peace talks and is beneficial to the people, the opposite is also true. Non-adherence to CARHRIHL and continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have served to poison the atmosphere for peace talks. Neither has such helped to resolve the roots of armed conflict; instead, it has only exacerbated the sufferings and calamitous situation of affected communities.

The head of the NDFP peace panel, Fidel Agcaoili, sent a message to the commemoration while the GPH was a no-show. Mr. Agcaoili highlighted, among many violations of CARHRIHL by the GPH, its petition to proscribe the CPP (Communist Party of the Philippines) and NPA (New People’s Army) — component revolutionary organizations under the umbrella of the NDFP — as “terrorist organizations,” the inclusion of more than 600 individuals in the Department of Justice “terrorist list” together with the arrest and continuing detention of NDFP consultants on trumped-up charges of common crimes. Agcaoili welcomed the call for the full implementation of CARHRIHL and the resumption of peace negotiations.

A 14-year-old girl named Carhrihl (after the Agreement) capped the program with a strong appeal for a return to peace talks to arrive at a just and lasting peace. When she was much younger, she confessed, she didn’t understand why her parents gave her the name and what it meant. She lamented that her friends mispronounced and misspelled her name all the time. Only when she herself became a youth activist did she begin to appreciate CARHRIHL and to learn the importance of fighting for human rights.

19,philippines,"Philippine drug-enforcement officials said on Tuesday that nearly 4,100 people have been killed in shootouts with police since the start of President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody antinarcotics campaign, a growing number that has attracted international condemnation.

The drugs war launched by the increasingly authoritarian president after he took office in June 2016 has alienated Mr. Duterte from Manila’s traditional allies including the U.S., creating an opening for China to increase its military and economic influence in Southeast Asia. Still, Mr. Duterte has persisted with it and cursed his critics, calling those from Europe “white idiots.”

Last week was one of the bloodiest in the campaign, with 13 killed by police in one night and more than 100 arrested as officers raided homes and staged sting operations near the capital, Manila. Human-rights groups say thousands more people have died than police admit, most of them poor and many executed by police.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary James A. Walsh, who monitors the international narcotics trade, said in January that Washington had reduced its support for the Philippine police force, which once included training in areas such as counterterror operations, because of human-rights concerns.

Police deny allegations that they have summarily executed drugs suspects. In February, the Netherlands-based International Criminal Court launched a preliminary examination into claims of crimes against humanity in the Philippines, the first phase of a process that in other countries has led to the prosecution of heads of state.

Mr. Duterte promptly ordered the withdrawal of the Philippines from the court, a process that takes a year, and said he wouldn’t cooperate with its probe. He slammed Western democracies for lecturing him and praised China for its growing support, which includes billions in investment commitments and donations toward drug rehabilitation facilities.

Police and drug enforcement agency officials said Tuesday that nearly 124,000 drug dealers and users had been arrested since the beginning of July 2016 and that 2,620 tons of methamphetamine had been seized in the drug war. More than 2,400 have perished in drug-related homicides, and more than 46,000 cases are backlogged in the creaking legal system, which lawyers say is at the point of collapse.

Mr. Duterte has said the bloody crackdown is necessary to save a generation of Filipinos who have become hooked on drugs, especially methamphetamine, which ravages poor communities. “We have been swallowed with drugs,” he said in a speech last week. “Our children are in jeopardy.”

Mr. Duterte’s spokesman said Monday that the government believes human-rights groups “have become unwitting tools of drug lords.” Rights groups denied the claims. Human Rights Watch called the allegations “shockingly dangerous and shameful.”

The drug war—and the president—remain overwhelmingly popular among Filipinos; more than 70% were satisfied with his performance at the end of last year, according to local pollster Social Weather Stations. His allies dominate Congress, where his opponents have faced a string of impeachment charges. Lawmakers are discussing changes to the constitution in a way that critics have said would undermine democratic checks and balances.

20,philippines,"Philippine-Japan defense ties have been in the headlines quite a bit this week, in part due to a few key developments in the maritime security realm. Though these are just a couple of manifestations of a longstanding and wide-ranging defense partnership, they nonetheless are worth emphasizing because they constitute a boost for Manila’s limited military capabilities as well as a gain for the bilateral defense relationship between the two countries that has broader regional implications as well.

As I have noted before in these pages, Japan-Philippines defense ties have continued strengthening despite the uncertainties and subsequent refocusing that we have seen under President Rodrigo Duterte (See: “Japan-Philippines Defense Relations Under Duterte: Full Steam Ahead?”). The strategic rationale for both sides remains clear in terms of bilateral ties and their wider interests, with Japan looking to boost ties with Southeast Asian states, including in the defense realm, and the Philippines eyeing ways to strengthen its limited military capabilities to address a series of threats ranging from terrorism to the South China Sea (See: “Where is the Philippines Coast Guard in its Military Modernization?”)

There are various manifestations of this defense relationship. Some of them are continuations of older lines of effort, like the Maritime Safety Capability Improvement Project (MSCIP), which has seen Japan offer deliveries of equipment, training, and other forms of cooperation. Others are newer developments, such as Japan’s delivery of used Beechcraft King Air TC-90 planes, which was the first instance of Japan transferring excess defense equipment to another county free of charge following ongoing changes in its domestic laws (See: “Why Japan’s New Military Aircraft Gift to the Philippines Matters”).

This week was a rather active one for defense ties between the two sides that featured both the old and the new and reinforced the strategic importance of defense cooperation more generally. First, on March 26, the Manila received three more Beechcraft King Air TC-90 planes from Tokyo, completing the initial landmark deal that had been forged (See: “New Military Aircraft Puts Japan-Philippines Defense Ties in the Spotlight”).

Beyond its strategic importance, the TC-90s deal is important for practical purposes too because of Manila’s limited ability to even conduct regular and extensive patrols of the South China Sea with its existing capabilities. So it was little surprise that we saw Philippine defense officials highlight that more of such aircraft would facilitate such efforts in terms of added capability, even though there are lingering questions about the Duterte administration’s overall approach to the South China Sea and China’s growing assertiveness more generally (See: “Beware the New China-Philippines South China Sea Deal”).

Then, on March 28, the Philippine Coast Guard commissioned two new multirole response vessels (MRRVs) from Japan. The MRRVs were part of an initial pledge to provide 10 of the vessels under Phase I of MSCIP, with three of them delivered in 2016, three of them arriving in 2017, and the remaining four expected this year. The two ships, named BRP San Agustin and BRP Cabra and given pennant numbers 4408 and 4409 respectively, were commissioned at the PCG headquarters in South Harbor, Manila.

The stated use of the vessels involves a range of tasks including search and rescue, law enforcement, and counterterrorism, and the PCG has indicated that the vast majority of the missions carried out thus far by the vessels have been related to regular patrols and surveillance efforts to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. But Philippine defense officials have also indicated previously that these vessels would be directly useful in addressing the country’s key security challenges, be it deployments in the southern Philippines to fight sea piracy or providing greater capacity for Manila to patrol its waters given Beijing’s concerning behavior.

To be sure, these are just two of several lines of effort that are underway within the context of the Japan-Philippines defense relationship, and the focus on these positive developments needs to be paired with an understanding of the lingering challenges for ties, especially during the Duterte era. Nonetheless, this week was one which maritime security updates clearly reinforced the strategic significance of defense ties between the two sides.",https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/a-big-week-for-japan-philippines-defense-ties/
21,philippines,"While there is more work ahead for the coffee industry, there is palpable confidence among coffee stakeholders in the country.

Published 9:00 AM, March 31, 2018

BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Kirstin Reyes worked for 7 years in Singapore where she began an affair with coffee. When she returned to her home in Tuguegarao City in 2013, she roasted coffee and created her own coffee brand. In 2014, she opened Barako Boy, Tuguegarao’s first coffee shop that sold specialty coffee at a low price. Four years later, Barako Boy is thriving and well, frequented by regulars and walk-ins from a nearby hotel.

Reyes is among the 700 participants of the 3rd Philippine Coffee Conference held in March in Baguio City, organized by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Agriculture (DA). All of the participants – whether engaged in coffee production, processing, trade, roasting or marketing – came from all over the country. The huge turnout of participants, representing almost all of the regions in the country, illustrates the country’s engagement with the bean.

The Philippines, which lies on the so-called “coffee belt,” has favorable climatic conditions to grow all 4 varieties of coffee, namely Robusta, Arabica, Excelsa, and Liberica throughout the country. The largest coffee producing regions in the country are based in Mindanao – Soccsksargen, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and Davao.

A long history of coffee in the Philippines

The industry’s rich albeit dramatic coffee history has witnessed the rise and fall of fortunes. In the 19th century, the country was the world’s leading exporter of Arabica coffee, until the 1890s, when the proliferation of coffee rust and other diseases totally decimated the crop. The country rebounded by shifting to Robusta up to the latter half of the 20th century but failed to recover its world leadership in the commodity. In the 1990s, global coffee 2001 coffee crisis, the domestic industry, which has relied on smallholder producers, collapsed.

And yet optimism prevailed as demand for coffee increased with rising incomes. By 2010, retailers were making the most of the Filipino’s need for the brew. According to a study conducted by Washington-based Duke Center for Global Value Chains, the decade saw the proliferation of a younger generation of Filipinos preferring to consume convenient instant coffee to get their daily dose of caffeine. Meanwhile, wealthier Filipinos, particularly in the urban areas, supported the emergence of a specialty coffee sector hence the proliferation of brands such as Starbucks, UCC, and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, as well as small local coffee shops.

Local demand bodes well for the coffee industry

The increase in local demand for coffee has prompted coffee stakeholders to get their act together. To focus efforts in revitalizing the industry, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez and Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol approved the Philippine Coffee Industry Roadmap (2017-2022), a product of more than 3 years of organizing the sector.

At the 3rd Philippine Coffee Conference, Senator Cynthia Villar discussed convergence of various government agencies including the Philippine Coconut Authority, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agrarian Reform in supporting coffee production. Agriculture Undersecretary Evelyn Lavina presented various programs being implemented with the support of various universities and private sector partners. Secretary Lopez talked about coffee as a priority of his deparrment's industry clustering program, to ensure markets and market readiness for Philippine products.

Efforts are slowly paying off. In terms of quality, Philippine coffee is reaping international awards for taste. One sterling example is Bana’s coffee, a single-origin brand from Sagada, which was awarded the Medaille Gourmet at the International Contest for Coffees Roasted in their Countries of Origin organized by the Agency for the Valorization of Agricultural Products in Paris, France.

While there is more work ahead for the coffee industry, there is palpable confidence among coffee stakeholders in the country. Conference participants share animated conversations over cups of the country’s best coffees. Big traders raffle off prizes – expensive coffee equipment – and everyone roots for the farmer who wins a depulper or a barista who wins a complete set of tools. At the 3rd Philippine Coffee Conference, coffee as an industry is hot and brewing. – Rappler.com",https://www.rappler.com/business/199226-philippines-coffee-industry-hot-brewing
22,philippines,"MANILA, Philippines — Following Manila's withdrawal from the Rome Statute, Beijing maintained its position that the International Criminal Court should respect the sovereignty of nations.

Earlier this month, the Philippines submitted its letter of withdrawal from the international treaty that established the ICC.

The Philippine government said that the decision to pull out from the international court was a ""principled stand against those who politicize and weaponize human rights.""

The Chinese Foreign Ministry maintained that the ICC should ""act cautiously and avoid being used as a political tool.""

""China believes that a sovereign country has the right to say no to political manipulation under the cloak of law,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in a news briefing Wednesday.

Beijing defended President Rodrigo Duterte's crackdown against illegal drugs and stressed that the campaign has improved public security in the Philippines.

Duterte's so-called war on drugs has created a ""sound environment"" for the Philippines' economic development, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.

""The international community should give more understanding and support to those efforts instead of pointing fingers and casting blames,"" Lu said.

Despite withdrawing from the ICC, Manila assured the international community that it will remain resolute in upholding human rights.

""The Government remains resolute in effecting its principal responsibility to ensure the long-term safety of the nation in order to promote inclusive national development and secure a decent and dignified life for all,"" the Philippines said in its letter of withdrawal.

Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano maintained that there is no crime or liability linked to the Duterte administration's campaign against illegal drugs.

""Contrary to what some parties are trying to make it appear, there is no failure on the part of the Philippine Government in dealing with issues, problems, and concerns arising from this campaign. These are dealt with by independent and well-functioning organs and agencies of our State,"" Cayetano said.

The Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC will be effective one year after the date of receipt of the notification.",https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/03/30/1801491/china-backs-philippines-withdrawal-icc
