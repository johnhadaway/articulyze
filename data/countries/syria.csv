1,syria,"President Trump delivered a disturbing tweet this morning regarding a U.S. military strike in Syria, which is reportedly impending:

Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018

This amounts to an embrace of Russia’s challenge and it risks a significant escalation of the U.S. role in Syria. It is a profoundly dangerous example of brinkmanship. Americans are now supposed to ready themselves for a military clash with a nuclear power over a U.S. military strike against the Assad regime that has no legitimate justification.

First, any U.S. strike against Syria will be illegal unless it first receives explicit authorization from Congress. As was the case with Trump’s previous missile strike against the Assad regime last April, he will be acting unlawfully if he takes this action.

Second, what does the administration expect to accomplish here? No U.S. military action short of all-out regime change is going to deter the Assad government from committing future atrocities. The strike in April 2017 had zero strategic or tactical utility. It did nothing to resolve the Syrian civil war. It did not serve U.S. national interests in any tangible way. Nor did it serve any humanitarian objective. The Assad regime has continued to use violence against its own people.

Third, it strains common sense that we would take an illegal military action with virtually no chance of success and with high risks of escalation because roughly 40 people were killed by chlorine in a civil war that has killed 500,000 people by bullets and bombs. Chemical weapons occupy a special place in our minds as a particularly cruel form of violence, but there is nothing special about them, except perhaps that they are less lethal than the conventional military means by which most Syrians have been killed or maimed in this war.

Reports indicate that the Trump administration is trying to find a Goldilocks military option that would be more damaging than the pin-prick punitive strike last April, but not big enough to entangle the United States in another Middle East quagmire by toppling the Assad government or clashing directly with Russian or Iranian forces in a way that triggers escalatory measures. This is a farcical exercise that ignores the utter lack of strategic, tactical, legal, or humanitarian rationale for military action.

Just days prior to news of this recent chemical weapons attack in Syria, President Trump articulated his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the country. His instincts were correct.","No Strategic, Tactical, Legal, or Humanitarian Justification for US Strikes in Syria",https://www.cato.org/blog/no-strategic-tactical-legal-or-humanitarian-justification-us-strikes-syria
2,syria,"Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan has been ousted only six days into his term, and protests have been voluntarily suspended while the National Assembly decides on his successor.

But political uncertainty in Armenia jeopardises a fragile ceasefire with Azerbaijan over an unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and this in turn has broad strategic implications.

Russia is treaty-bound to aid Armenia in the event of a conflict, while Turkey enjoys close cultural and economic ties with Azerbaijan. Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh could therefore threaten relations between Russia and Turkey as they gradually learn to coexist in the Middle East, especially in Syria.



Russia and Turkey: Syria

Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war is focused on preserving the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia sees the conflict as an opportunity to support Assad and his backers in Iran to challenge the hegemony of US allies in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.

Turkey, however, is focused on containing the Kurdish militia groups who support Assad, specifically the People’s Protection Units (YPG). Turkey views the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish nationalist organisation that has previously taken up arms against the Turkish state, and it has supported the Syrian Free Army to seek regime change in Syria.

Russia and Turkey, therefore, appear to have competing interests in Syria, and the two countries have already experienced direct confrontation: Turkish fighter jets downed a Russian warplane in 2015, accusing it of violating Turkish airspace during a sortie near its border with Syria.

But as the Syrian civil war is winding down, both Russia and Turkey are responding pragmatically to changes on the ground. Islamic State has been eradicated from much of the country, and the Syrian Government has retaken control of key cities from rebel groups. Turkey has sought – and received – Russian approval for airstrikes against the YPG in northern Syria, and the two countries met with Iran in April to cooperate on a post-war plan for stability.

This cooperation, however, could well be threatened by their opposing positions in the Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict: Russia and Turkey have previously traded stern words over Nagorno-Karabakh.



Russia and Turkey: Nagorno-Karabakh

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous, forested region surrounded by Azerbaijan yet populated mostly by ethnic Armenians. Several years of interethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis at the end of the 1980s led a full-scale war between the two countries after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group brokered a ceasefire in 1994, but only a handful of monitors continue to police what is known as the “line of contact”.

The conflict has flared-up several times in the last decade, most recently in April 2016 with an Azerbaijani offensive in the northern part of Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan stated that Turkey would back Azerbaijan “to the end” against Armenia, to which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded by accusing Turkey of one-sidedness in the conflict.

With the stability of the Armenian Government now in question, nervous Armenian commanders in Nagorno-Karabakh or emboldened Azerbaijani troops could trigger a new wave of violence and force Russia and Turkey to again take opposing sides, jeopardising their cooperation in Syria.



Armenia: 8 May

Sargsyan resigned on 23 April. He had reneged on a promise to step down from politics by taking the office of Prime Minister, an office he had created as part of Armenia’s constitutional reforms in 2015. His tenure had been marked by economic stagnation, a failure to address the tension in Nagorno-Karabakh, and accusations of corruption.

The National Assembly is widely expected to nominate protest leader and vocal opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as Sargsyan’s replacement on 8 May. But if Pashinyan cannot gain enough support in the National Assembly, Armenia will go to the polls in a snap election and Nagorno-Karabakh will likely be a campaign issue.

Sargsyan was born there, and his supporters in the area may be extra-sensitive to perceived provocation from Azerbaijan. Pashinyan, for his part, has taken a hard-line attitude toward Azerbaijan as a way to burnish his security credentials, and an election campaign may force him to further clarify his plans for the region.

The best way for Russia and Turkey to avoid being placed into direct confrontation over Nagorno-Karabakh is to collaborate with Armenia and Azerbaijan on the issue through the OSCE Minsk Group. A commitment from all parties to attend further talks once the political crisis in Armenia is resolved may be sufficient; inviting OSCE election monitors to oversee snap elections may be an important next step if a unifying leader cannot be chosen on 8 May.

Even if there is no room for inclusive democratic reform in post-war Syria, it is important that the next development in Armenian politics and Armenia–Azerbaijan relations is not a step backwards for Syria.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Civilians in Syria continue to face an ongoing protection crisis. Amid active hostilities in many parts of the country, humanitarian actors remain concerned by the high levels of civilian casualties that continue to be reported and point to violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL),

An estimated 1.7 million people were displaced in the first nine months of 2017 alone, many multiple times. An estimated 721,000 spontaneous/self-organized IDP and refugee returns also took place in 2017, including approximately 66,000 refugees. While the number of people in besieged areas decreased compared to last year, the humanitarian situation for those trapped in the remaining areas is dire. Amid the disruption caused by prolonged hostilities, extensive displacement, family separation and disruption of community networks, access to basic services as well as livelihood opportunities remain scarce. Prices and availability of basic commodities, also affected by unilateral coercive measures, remain a factor of need. As a result, people’s ability to cope is strained and many are unable to meet their basic needs.

In 2017, 6.1 million people were internally displaced with 750,000 people living in last resort sites, and a daily average of 6,550 people displaced each day. 5.3 million people were registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Throughout most of 2017, 2.98 million people lived in besieged and hardto-reach areas, including 419,920 people in 10 UN-declared besieged areas. Lack of civil status documentation remained a serious concern across Syria. 8.2 million people were exposed to explosive hazards in contaminated areas with 33 per cent of hazards located on agricultural land. Some 6.5 million people were food insecure and face large food consumption gaps or are at risk of extreme loss or depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps. A further 4 million people were at risk of becoming food insecure because of exhaustion of productive assets to maintain food consumption.

Less than half of Syria’s health facilities are fully operational. The protracted nature of the crisis has negatively affected immunization coverage rates, reducing immunity and increasing the risk of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as polio (74 cases of cVDPV2 mainly in Deir Ez-Zor and ArRaqqa).

Economic losses are estimated at more than $254 billion. The conflict has damaged or destroyed Syria ‘s infrastructure, impeded access to sources of income, disrupted markets, and triggered currency depreciation. Economic losses from the disruption to the education system are estimated at around $11 billion, equivalent to about 18 per cent of Syria’s 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) further damaging long term economic prospects.

Food production has been drastically reduced, with the total area of land under cultivation having shrunk by 40 per cent. Compounded by difficulties in distributing food staples, a third of the population is now food insecure. Government revenues have plummeted largely due to the decrease in oil exports and disruption of trade. As a result, the country’s GDP has contracted by 55 per cent with further contraction expected.

Hostilities have characterized 2017 and are expected to continue in 2018 concentrated in certain areas. As a result, displacement is anticipated to continue. Based on displacement trends in 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people may be displaced over the course of 2018, some multiple times, in addition to the 6.1 million IDPs in protracted displacement. Approximately one million IDPs may spontaneously return to their areas of origin. Humanitarian access challenges continue to limit humanitarian organizations from regularly reaching the most vulnerable people. Humanitarian needs in Syria remain – according to recent humanitarian analyses – similar in scale and severity to those of last year Humanitarian assistance should be available to millions of people striving to meet their basic needs",Syria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi's office confirmed the attack in a statement released on Sunday morning.

One of the strikes targeted a position south of the town of Deshaisha, the statement said.

ISIL commanders, according to Abadi, used the base, situated near the city of Deir Az Zor in the country's east.

Iraq launched air raids on Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) positions several times over the past year with the support of the Syrian government and the US-led coalition fighting ISIL.

ISIL, also known by its Arabic acronym ""Daesh,"" controlled significant portions of Iraq and Syria. At its peak, the group ruled over roughly 110,000sq km between the two countries.

By October 2017, the group's territory had been reduced to about 10,000sq km, mostly in Syria's east.

ISIL's administrative capital was once in Mosul, a large city in western Iraq. Mosul was freed by the Iraqi military and militias collaborating with the US-led coalition in July 2017 after nearly a year of battles.

Abadi stated at an April meeting of his ruling Darwa party that Iraq's ""land war with Daesh has ended. We have saved all the land of our country and taken control of the Syrian border.

It will reaffirm the international community’s support for a political solution to the Syrian conflict and will aim to strengthen the international response to the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and support for the refugees and host countries.

The humanitarian situation in Syria remains tragic. 13.1 million Syrians, including 6 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance. More than half the Syrian population has been forced to leave their homes: 6.1 million have been internally displaced and 5.6 million are refugees in neighboring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt). The delivery of humanitarian assistance continues to be subject to unacceptable blockades, notably on the part of the regime.

The humanitarian situation in Syria is a priority for France. Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne will reaffirm France’s support for the Syrian people and Syria’s neighboring countries. He will reaffirm our commitment to providing €200 million in grants to Syria and its neighboring countries for the period 2016-2018. The aim is to support the host countries, help the Syrian population and establish conditions in Syria conducive to the voluntary, safe and sustainable return of the refugees.

BEIRUT — Voting Sunday for the first time in her life, the young Shiite Muslim woman said she was casting her ballot for the Shiite militant Hezbollah group. One of her relatives was killed while fighting Sunni militants near the border with Syria and she wanted to honor that sacrifice with her vote.

“Had it not been for the resistance we wouldn’t be here,” said Zahraa Harb, 24, as she and her husband entered a polling station in the southern Beirut suburb of Burj al-Barajneh. “The arms of the resistance protected Lebanon. Had it not been for the resistance all of Lebanon would have fallen into the hands of the terrorists.”

Sunday’s parliamentary election was the first in nine years — and the first since the catastrophic civil war in Syria broke out seven years ago. The conflict has nearly torn apart this tiny Arab nation with bouts of spillover violence and sent more than a million Syrian refugees — a quarter of Lebanon’s population — pouring across the border.

The war next door has divided Lebanese, with some supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and others sympathizing with the rebels trying to bring him down. In May 2013, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah began openly sending its fighters to back Assad and since then has taken part in almost every major battle in the country. Hundreds of its fighters have been killed and wounded while fighting in Syria, an intervention that Hezbollah says was necessary to protect Lebanon from the Sunni militants that proliferated across the border in the chaos of Syria’s civil war.

The divisions and open hostility were on display Sunday among Hezbollah supporters and opponents of the Shiite militants. As polls closed, fist fights broke out in the Beirut district of Tareeq Jdideh, a bastion of support for Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s Western-backed Sunni prime minister, with both sides throwing stones at each other as security forces rushed to contain the violence.

Hariri, who heads a national unity government that includes members of Hezbollah, is widely expected to return as prime minister and recreate that coalition following Sunday’s election. But that political alliance, seen as necessary to keep the peace, is not often translated into harmony on the street.

For Harb and her husband, Ashraf Harake, casting their ballots for Hezbollah came down to a matter of survival.

She recalled how her parents’ home shook when twin suicide bombings claimed by the Islamic State group targeted their hometown of Burj al-Barajneh on Nov. 12, 2015, killing 43 people in the deadliest attack by extremists in Lebanon since the war in Syria broke out. Harake, who was her fiance back then, rushed from the house to help dozens of people wounded in the streets.

“The Burj al-Barajneh blasts made us more determined,” said Harb, her face framed by a black traditional Islamic head scarf. Her husband’s cousin, Ali Harake, had been killed a year earlier when IS militants sent explosives-rigged vehicles into Hezbollah strongholds in the Qalamoun mountains on Lebanon’s border with Syria.

“I will raise my children on the ideology of the resistance,” said Harb, who is six months pregnant with her first child, and sees Hezbollah as a group that once fought to liberate Lebanon from Israeli occupation and now protects the country from Syria-based militant groups.

For 60-year-old Sami Kara, who is a strong supporter of Hariri, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah’s involvement in the war in Syria is to blame for the militant attacks in Lebanon.

“Hezbollah attracted explosions to this country. Had we kept our distance from (regional) conflicts we wouldn’t have reached this point,” said the clothes merchant, standing near a tent decorated with the blue flags of Hariri’s Future Movement in Beirut’s Sunni stronghold of Tareeq Jdideh.

He said Hariri will always stand against Hezbollah and prevent the Shiite militants from dominating Beirut, adding that his city will not become the fourth Arab capital dominated by Iran — a reference to Iran’s influence in Syria’s Damascus, Yemen’s Sanaa and Baghdad.

Wissam Shqifi, 44, another Hezbollah critic, said the group’s intervention in Syria “is an aggression on another country. Hezbollah is ruining our relations with regional countries” — a reference to Hezbollah’s military intervention in Yemen, Iraq and Syria that has led several oil-rich Gulf states to join the United States in naming it as a terrorist organization.

Casting his ballot in the capital on Sunday, Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheik Naim Kassem, countered the charges that Hezbollah was trying to turn Lebanon into a state controlled by Iran. Beirut, he said, “is an Arab city and is not Persian.”

With violence in several areas of Syria UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency today expresses its alarm at the civilian deaths this is causing as well as spiralling new displacement. This is on top of a humanitarian situation that is already desperate; Syrian civilians have more than suffered enough.

Of particular concern is the situation in Douma in Eastern Ghouta where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped. We estimate that more than 133,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta over the past four weeks. This is almost three times the number we reported on 20 March and includes some 45,000 people who are currently being accommodated in eight collective shelters in Rural Damascus. An estimated 44,000, mainly women, children and elderly have so far been allowed to leave the collective shelters after completion of their security screening. UNHCR teams are working with UN and NGO partners to help improve the conditions at these collective shelters, which remain congested. We continue to appeal to all parties to the conflict for proper protection of civilians, including freedom of movement and free choice over where to stay. Family unity must also be respected.

Since the outset of this emergency, as part of the wider UN response, UNHCR has been working to address the needs of the displaced. Our staff are paying daily visits to all the collective shelters where displaced people from Eastern Ghouta are accommodated, to assess needs and help address them. Overcrowded shelters and insufficient sanitation facilities are posing serious health risks. Common concerns we are hearing are a lack of civil documentation, restrictions on freedom of movement, family separation and SGBV risks.

UNHCR’s response to the Eastern Ghouta emergency encompasses the delivery of core relief items, shelter support and protection services. Nearly a quarter or a million urgently need aid, and more than 60,000 people have been reached so far. UNHCR is purchasing clothes locally as many people fled with nothing more than what they were wearing. In addition to a massive shelter effort, UNHCR protection partners have provided legal counseling to 22,000 people.

Meanwhile, we are facing similar challenges and concerns in responding to the humanitarian needs of more than 137,000 Syrians displaced from the Afrin region. Most are scattered across Tal Rifaat, Nubol, Zahraa and surrounding villages in northwest Aleppo, living in makeshift shelters, damaged or unfinished buildings, mosques, warehouses and open-spaces. Some 3,500 people are being accommodated in a tented camp in Fafin to the north of Aleppo. In addition we have distributed more than 1,400 kits for shelter rehabilitation and redeployed 1,000 UNHCR family-sized tents, for use as needed.

Displacement from Afrin has subsided and some returns to the city are taking place. The challenging journey back home for the displaced may take up to four days in some cases. Movements of displaced people towards Aleppo and other government-controlled areas continues to be constrained.

9,syria,"The U.S. has a number of actions in responding to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, but it's a more difficult challenge than ""just kind of firing ready, aim here,"" said CBS News Radio military analyst Mike Lyons. But most importantly, Mr. Trump's ""got to be careful not to get goaded into doing something that's not in the best interest of the United States,"" Lyons told CBSN's Meg Oliver Tuesday.

""I think as more time is going on, that window is closing for some kind of response that's going to make any difference on the ground,"" Lyons said, noting that it still needs to be proven if it was a chemical attack.

Reports out of Syria suggest dozens of people were killed in rebel stronghold Douma, near Damascus, on Saturday in attack using chemical weapons. Initial reports from the humanitarian group known as the White Helmets and Syrian American Medical Society indicated that chlorine gas might have been the agent used.

Last year, the U.S. launched 59 tomahawk missiles on a Syrian base that was believed to have launched a chemical attack. Lyons called that response ""small"" and recommended Mr. Trump think ""through whether he wants a tactical response, something quick on the ground, or he's got to think through the strategy hopefully involving our allies.""

The U.S. is still trying to determine what happened in Syria. Mr. Trump, though, tweeted on Sunday ""many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!""

International chemical watchdog groups are on their way into Syria, but Lyons warned that it could be difficult to find remnants of the alleged attack. ""It's hard to make a chemical weapons strike – in most cases, they've come out of helicopters, or planes – you don't want a rocket delivery because it endangers the crew,"" Lyons said.

Lyons said the U.S. is searching for that ""Cuban Missile Crisis moment, where they show the world that Russia is involved."" But, he cautioned, Russia will most likely deny any involvement, and the longer the wait for a response, the less likely remnants will be around.

Crude futures soared to highs not seen since December 2014 on Wednesday, underpinned by greater geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East and heightened concerns over the prospect of imminent military action from Western powers. Ample crude supplies had pared some of the gains on Thursday, though crude futures remained in touching distance of levels not seen in more than three years.

""I think certainly some of what we are seeing is a little bit of geopolitical premium (but) I don't think it is just about Syria,"" Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" Thursday.

Instead, Mallinson argued crude futures had soared to multi-year highs on the back of two main price drivers — concern over the ""wider ramifications"" of heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East and the looming prospect of the U.S. withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal.

13,syria,"Western countries are reportedly planning to bypass Russia’s veto at the UN security council over Syria by referring concerns about the suspected use of chemical weapons to the UN general assembly.

Russia has used its veto 12 times to block UN action targeting the regime of its ally, Bashar al-Assad.

In November, it used its veto to block the extension of a UN mechanism to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons attacks.

Western nations blamed the Syrian government for a poison gas attack on the town of Douma earlier this month, which killed dozens of people and led the US, Britain and France to launch 105 missiles targeting chemical weapons facilities in retaliation.

The Syrian regime and Russia deny involvement or the use of chemical weapons.

Western officials are reportedly supporting the idea of turning to a rarely used diplomatic route in order to clear the impasse, known as “uniting for peace”, which would allow nine members of the security council to refer their concerns to a vote at the general assembly, bypassing Russia’s veto.

A two-thirds majority in the general assembly would then be required to agree upon an attribution mechanism.

“The Russian veto need not be the end of efforts for collective action by the UN,” Ian Martin, a human rights activist and former UN official, told The Guardian.

“The responsibility of asserting accountability for the use of chemical weapons, and for bringing an end to the horrors of the Syrian conflict, rests with the world community as a whole.”

“We’re seeing in last few weeks, days ... that military gains, territorial gains and military escalation does not bring a political solution, has not brought any change. On the contrary,” he said.

On Monday, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialised nations united to condemn Russia for what they said was ”a pattern of irresponsible and destabilising” behaviour.

They urged Moscow to help resolve the conflict in Syria and agreed to create a working group to study the Kremlin’s “malign behaviour”.

John Sullivan, the acting US secretary of state, called on Moscow to stop creating impediments to peace in Syria, and to play a role in ending the seven-year-long conflict.

“Russia must be a constructive partner in Syria or will be held accountable,” he said.

Speaking to reporters on the margins of the meeting, foreign secretary Boris Johnson said G7 ministers had agreed on the need to be vigilant about Russia.

“What we decided ... was that we were going to set up a G7 group that would look at Russian malign behaviour in all its manifestations – whether it’s cyber warfare, whether it’s disinformation, assassination attempts, whatever it happens to be, and collectively try to call it out.”

German’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the meeting established “again that there will be no political solution in Syria without Russia ... and that Russia has to contribute its share to such a solution.”

While supporting the air strikes in Syria, the G7 statement said they were “limited, proportionate and necessary – and taken only after exhausting every possible diplomatic option to uphold the international norm against the use of chemical weapons.”",Syria crisis: Western countries plan to bypass Russia's UN veto over Douma chemical attack,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-russia-un-veto-chemical-weapons-civil-war-general-assembly-a8319821.html

Thirty-six donors at the conference, co-hosted by the European Union and the United Nations, made pledges towards the UN-coordinated Syria Humanitarian Response Plan, the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan, the ICRC Syria Crisis appeals and other activities. Pledges also included support to Palestinian refugees in Syria.

""The pledges announced today are a good start,"" UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said in Brussels. ""In an ideal world, we would have liked to raise even more money and we do expect to receive additional funding this year. The money that donors generously provide makes a real difference to the lives of Syrians caught up in this horrible crisis.""

The international community also confirmed $3.4 billion in funding for humanitarian, resilience and development activities in 2019 to 2020 for the Syria crisis response.

The Syria crisis is the world's largest protection and displacement crisis and 13.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection inside the country. Over 5.6 million Syrians have fled the country mainly to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt.

The UN coordinates two international appeals in response to the Syria crisis. The plan for response inside Syria require US$3.6 billion to provide life-saving assistance and protection for 13.1 million people. The regional refugee and resilience response plan requires $5.6 billion to assist over nine million people with protection, humanitarian and resilience support in the neighbouring countries.

17,syria,"As Syria’s war grinds along in its seventh year of fighting, the conflict is entering an ominous new phase as President Bashar Assad’s forces step up their offensive operations and the broader proxy war intensifies between several nation states, including Iran and Israel. Assad’s forces have secured the upper hand on the battlefield and are concentrating their efforts in clearing out remaining areas of opposition influence around Damascus. In the coming weeks, look for Assad to focus on eliminating remaining pockets of opposition control around Rastan in the north and in southwestern Syria near the Jordanian border.

At that point, Assad will face an important choice. Does he try to regain control of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, where thousands of civilians and militants fleeing other conflict zones have moved, and where radical groups such as Fatah Sham, which is Al Qaeda in Syria, control large parts of the province? Or does he instead turn east to contest U.S. backed-Kurdish forces and try to regain large portions of the country’s critical oil infrastructure? The latest estimate is that Kurdish forces control territory, including oil and gas fields in eastern Syria, that accounts for about 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. These resources will be critical to the regime’s long-term reconstruction project.

Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Iran in Syria have reached a dangerous new level in recent weeks. In early April, Israel reportedly fired missiles at a Syrian airbase and killed seven Iranians. There are also reports that late Sunday night Israel may have struck military bases used by Iran and its proxy militias near Hama and Aleppo, killing additional Iranians. This comes on the heels of claims by Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisOvernight Defense: Inside the House's 7B defense policy bill | Bill would authorize Trump's military parade, halt weapons sales to Turkey, allow sanctions waivers for allies with Russian weapons | SEALs discharged over drug use Defense bill would allow sanctions waivers for some allies buying Russian weapons Defense bill would authorize Trump's military parade MORE that Iran is strengthening its military footprint in Syria and using the country as a platform to transfer increasingly advanced weapons to Hezbollah.

Senior Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that Israel will not accept a large Iranian military presence on its border, and are reportedly now bracing for an Iranian response to the recent missile strikes. So, the potential for a clash between Israel and Iran in Syria has increased sharply of late. It’s worth considering that such a confrontation could escalate quickly and trigger direct attacks inside both Israel and Iran. It could also spill beyond Syria’s borders to Lebanon and Iraq, potentially drawing in Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq.

If all this is not sufficiently worrisome, Turkey’s recent military operations in northwestern Syria around Afrin, as well as Ankara’s on again, off again cooperation with Washington on the final disposition of the strategically important area around the city of Manbij, located just west of the Euphrates River, adds yet another level of complexity to the situation. If Turkey’s overarching objective is to expand its buffer zone to its entire southern border with Syria, we should anticipate additional clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces in the coming months.

Even as the increasingly fraught military situation in Syria absorbs most of the world’s attention, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The latest reliable estimates are that nearly 500,000 Syrians have died thus far in the conflict, and nearly half of Syria’s population before the war is now displaced or seeking asylum outside the country. In fact, according to the United Nations, more than 13 million of Syria’s current population of 18 million people are now dependent on humanitarian assistance. So, in my view, it’s crystal clear that the war that Assad unleashed on his own population more than seven years ago and that external actors, especially Iran and Russia, have fueled, seems poised to enter an ominous next stage. Is there anything that U.S. policymakers might do now to prepare for the next chapter in this conflict?

First, U.S. policymakers might want to delay the timeline for drawing down U.S. forces in Syria. The fight against ISIS in eastern Syria is not yet over, and the removal of U.S. forces could allow ISIS to reconstitute in the no man’s land along the border between Iraq and Syria, potentially jeopardizing the security of Iraq and eventually Jordan. The presence of a limited number of U.S. troops also increases America’s ability to target Al Qaeda elements in western Syria, and does provide, in my view, diplomatic leverage over both the Assad regime and Moscow, which will be critical during future negotiations to end the conflict. In addition, a sudden removal of U.S. forces could put at risk the Syrian Democratic Forces backed by the United States, who were instrumental in the recapture of Raqqa, and who in the absence of U.S. military support will likely become a target for the Assad regime and its allies.

Second, given the recent spike in tensions between Israel and Iran, U.S. policymakers may want to think carefully about ways, including direct messaging to both countries, to limit the potential for that confrontation to spread beyond Syria’s borders, and about U.S. options if that should unfortunately occur. Finally, U.S. policymakers might want to reconsider all of America’s options for tackling the deepening humanitarian nightmare in Syria, from providing increased relief assistance to rethinking the handling of Syria’s displaced population. The situation on the ground will not improve for the foreseeable future, and it is not an exaggeration to say that an entire generation of Syria’s children are at risk.

Despite periodic claims to the contrary, there has never been, nor likely will ever be, an easy policy solution to the Syria crisis. But make no mistake, the conflict is getting worse on many levels and could spark an even broader regional crisis soon. It is incumbent on leaders across the globe to avoid the temptation to look away, and to instead redouble their efforts to identify creative diplomatic options to reduce tensions, minimize civilian casualties, prevent the further use of chemical weapons, and mitigate as much as possible the humanitarian fallout from an international crisis with no end in sight.

18,syria,"Was it necessary to retaliate against the suspected chemical attack in Syria? Yes. It was.

Two reasons. One, there was a red line on the use of chemical weapons. It had to be enforced. Two, you have to enforce the international ban on the use of chemical weapons.

Is it mission accomplished? A leader should never say it is mission accomplished, and certainly not a US president. Is it possible that Bashar Al-Assad and his regime will use chemical weapons again? It is.

We've been here before. This is the second time that the US and its allies have had to act. So it certainly was not mission accomplished.

Where does it leave Syria? Well, sadly, it leaves Syria where Syria was a week ago, before these attacks. The strikes do not change the balance of power on the ground. And the balance of power is still in favour of the Syrian regime and its allies, Iran and Russia.

What should the West do now? The big problem has been for years that there is no consistent Western policy towards Syria. The west has not been willing to use its military might in a significant way.

QAMISHLI, Syria (AP)  After defeating the Islamic State group in battle, Syria's Kurds want to show they can also bring justice.

With control of nearly 25 percent of Syria, the U.S-backed Kurdish authorities in northern and eastern Syria built their justice system from scratch and put hundreds of Syrians  members of IS  on trial.

However, the system lacks any international recognition, complicating their efforts to bring hundreds of foreign fighters to trial. The system also is flawed, with a suspect lacking the right to a defense lawyers and a chance to appeal.

Here is a look at the Kurdish system and the number of those tried in one of the so-called ""The People's Defense Courts"" since 2015 in northern Syria:

THE SYSTEM:

There is no death sentence; maximum punishment is a life sentence, counted as 20-years, for those with blood on their hands.

Courts offer lenient sentences for those who hand themselves in and show good behavior in prison. The process is based on tribal mediation as Kurdish authorities seek to improve relations with powerful Arab tribes, many of whom were important during IS rule.

A panel of three judges, two men and one woman, try the suspected IS members. There are no defense lawyers and no right to appeal.

The Syrian Kurdish Parliament is discussing an amendment to the law to start an appeals court.

THE DEFENDANTS:

The largest court, in Qamishli, has tried some 1,533 suspected Syrian IS members, and a few Iraqis, between early 2015 until the first week of April, 2018.

Of those, 146 were sentenced to life in prison in 2016 and 2017. Life sentences in Kurdish areas are a 20-year period. Only 133 detained since 2015 have been set free.

Between 400 and 500 foreign men, of various nationalities, are believed to be in Syrian Kurdish custody. Only Russia has agreed to take back its nationals, according to a senior Kurdish official.

Approximately 2,000 women and children, mostly foreign but also some Syrian, are being held in separate refugee camps, tightly guarded by Kurdish authorities and are believed to be family members of foreign IS members, according to data collected by Human Rights Watch until January 2018.",A look at the Kurdish-run courts trying IS in northern Syria,http://www.tampabay.com/a-look-at-the-kurdish-run-courts-trying-is-in-northern-syria-ap_world2dc5bceeeeea407e836030bc28a2b231

Homs, Aleppo, Raqqa, Daraya. The names leach from our radios in the morning, adorn our nightly news programmes – the camerawork always a little graphically sanitised, even post-watershed – and have been doing so since 2011. The woeful misnomer that is the Syrian “civil war” has now been storming our confused, conflicted consciousnesses longer than the second world war, and Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s Canadian-born chief international correspondent, has been there or thereabouts pretty much all along.

In Syria: The World’s War she was thus uniquely positioned, with unsanitised footage and access to the higher echelons of talking heads, to give us a back-take on the whole shebang. The horrors – the dust and the torture – were all there but so were the tiny ways in which families tried to clean themselves, dress, go to markets, as if bombs weren’t falling around them. Crucially, she also set it in context, marvelling almost applaudingly at the human capacity for venality, blind revenge and descent to further atrocity. Even she, you feel, can’t quite believe that what began as a hopeful protest against some injustices perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad has been allowed to morph into quite such a blithering grand guignol of failed conflicted diplomacy, at times threatening to engulf the wider Middle East, and then wider still.

Doucet marvelled at the human capacity for venality, blind revenge and descent to more atrocity

We saw here how, from such optimistic spring beginnings, a month’s robust torture could turn once-peaceful protesters into hardened rebels. How successive years brought successive game-changers, by which I probably just mean better fighters – first Hezbollah, then Isis, then the Putin machine. How the official “regime” continues to wheedle and to lie: as she interviewed Syrian generals and foreign ministers there was something almost sweet in their outraged refusal to admit to bombings of civilians (despite Doucet’s gentle acres of evidence), like short-trousered kiddie-morons. We saw the aftermath in late 2013 of Obama’s dithering over the crossing, yet again, of one of his “red lines”. We felt, viscerally, the disappointment in the hearts of Syrians; saw, viscerally, the deaths that resulted. Not his finest hour, especially when coupled with Westminster’s pompous doodlings. None said it better than William Hague: “I thought a line had been crossed where we had to take action. After that point, we had almost no influence over the Syrian crisis. It was as if we had walked away and slammed the door and said: ‘You can do what you want. You can kill as many people as you like, with any weapons that you like, there’s nothing you can do to provoke us.’” More than ever, he looks like the best Tory leader we’ve had this century, spat out too soon.

This was a remarkably unshowy couple of nights, unspoilt by intrusive music, whizzy special effects or mawkish heart-tuggy grandstanding and all the more powerful for it. Just a good reporter getting on with telling a vile story, still without end. And quietly letting another one tell itself: how those, rebels and government both, who most claim to speak for “the people”, to have “the people’s interests” at heart, have been the very first to shell, bomb, gas, sniper and torture “their” Syrian people. More than 7 million internally displaced. More than 5 million refugees. These are old figures.

With all this going on, horrors hardly have to be invented – but invented they imaginatively are, especially in Scandinavia. The latest chills arrive courtesy of The Rain, a Netflix special that brings a nice post-apocalyptic froideur to the lowlands of Denmark.

The opener is frenetic, as perhaps needs must. No sooner is Simone preparing for a school exam than her dad hustles her out into a mysterious bunker. The rain falls, and she watches her schoolmates die, infected by some filthy maddening waterborne virus. Then her mum, similarly. Her dad leaves the bunker for tasks unstated: is he accidentally responsible for the virus? Simone and young brother Rasmus are in the bunker for six years. All this in the opener, and it’s time to give a loud “whew” and calm your trembling heart.

It settles rather nicely thereafter to some survivalist teens left to wander, questingly. There are great shots of a deserted Copenhagen, nature reclaiming, the Tivoli Gardens grungy, everyone still petrified of the rain, hungry gangs roaming. So far, so standard post-apocalyptic. It all sounds (and looks) rather promising but I can’t work up the enthusiasm, and the other teen survivors are less than charming. Perhaps I’ve just been spoilt: after seeing the apocalypse that befell Aleppo it’s increasingly hard to care about the fake.

There was a tremendous closer to My Year With the Tribe, in which, over three episodes, Will Millard has essentially laid bare the dreadful cynicism with which film crews have, for years, exploited the “treehouse-dwelling” – ha! – Korowai tribe of western Papua. And the equal cynicism with which the Korowai have exploited them back.

As an anthropological study of a tribe on the very cusp of transition to western, cash values, it could hardly be bettered. Similarly, as an anthropological study of how western film crews have grown increasingly desperate to find just one tribe living deep in any jungle – living in trees, wearing penis-gourds and the rest – and to pay handsomely for the footage, no matter how staged, it was a revelation. Millard – ever companionable, brave, honest, if a little heartbroken by the end – has done us all a service by showing Papua through both ends of the telescope. His alleged friend August turned childishly cruel in this last episode, demanding escalating thousands of dollars, then a boat, then the payment of all his random debts, just to let Will and crew leave the village, or venture further to say a final farewell to two ageing, ill friends. Personally, I would have suggested he go hide his penis-gourd in an anthill.

A sublime find on BBC4 was Mountain, in which mountains were filmed, and filmed lovingly. Even if, as the narration (co-written by Robert Macfarlane no less, and voiced by Willem Dafoe with just the right mix of arch chocolate revenance) said: “Mountains don’t seek our love. Or seek our deaths.” We were vouchsafed the keys to a laughably ancient mystery: mountains indeed see time differently from us. Haunting, beautiful, not least in the intercuts of drone shots with music. The “specially curated” (it says here, in the latest press-released atrocity from the BBC) soundtrack included Arvo Pärt, Greig and, notably, Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, which, for all of its well-worked dependability, retains a surprisingly apt capacity to delight, especially during one searing, slow-mo montage of people falling off cliffs.

21,syria,"In Syria, music runs deeper into the fabric of the place than anywhere else in the world.

Long before the modern state was formed in 1946, Syria had developed rich musical traditions over thousands of years. The diverse religions, sects and ethnicities that inhabited and travelled across the country over the millennia – Muslims, Christians, Jews, Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians and Kurds, to name but a few – all contributed to this eclectic musical heritage.

Songs of ancient Syria

In the 1950s, archaeologists found 29 3,400-year-old clay tablets in a small cubicle – likely a library – in the ancient port city of Ugarit on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. They were mostly broken into tiny fragments, but one, which came to be known as H6, remained in larger pieces. Inscribed on it were lyrics, and underneath them is what researchers believe is the earliest example of musical notation anywhere in the world.

You may also be interested in:

• The world’s oldest centre of learning

• The dessert that’s blocked at borders

These shards of clay are the beginnings of an incomparable musical heritage.

Academics have spent years literally piecing together the tablets, trying to work out what was written on them, what it meant and how the musical notation might sound were it to be played again. The text is in Babylonian cuneiform script, a system of writing that spread throughout the region several millennia ago.

We could read the script... but we didn’t have any idea what it meant

“The problem with this tablet is that – we could read the script because it was written in Babylonian cuneiform, and we know the value of the signs – but we didn’t have any idea what it meant,” said Richard Dumbrill, professor of archaeomusicology at Babylon University in Iraq, who has worked on the Ugarit tablets for more than two decades.

Dumbrill described how he attempted on many occasions to reconstruct the Ugarit tablets in order to translate the text and music inscribed on them: “I took photographs and I tried to build them as a puzzle, but some had been damaged beyond reconstruction.”

The translation difficulties were a product of the text being written in a language known as Hurrian from the north-east Caucasus, probably in modern-day Armenia, but which ended up in Syria’s fertile lands.

“These people migrated towards north-west Syria – it took them a good couple of thousand years – and decided to use the Babylonian signs to write their text and their music,” Dumbrill said. “So it was extremely difficult to translate. However, I managed to find out that the text below the two lines were musical names that were Hurrianised – that is, they were Babylonian but had been transformed on contact with the Hurrian people. And I could find out that it was a melody. It took me about 20 years to translate.”

So what does the earliest musical composition tell us about the people who lived at that time? From Dumbrill’s translations, he believes they had catalogues of songs for occasions of all sorts and moods, not just hymns for religious events.

One song details a bar girl selling beer to her clients, but the tablet known as H6 details a more sober story.

“It’s about a young girl who cannot have any children; she thinks that the reason is because she misbehaved in some way, which is not mentioned,” Dumbrill said. “And from what we can understand of the text, which is quite limited, she goes at night to pray to the goddess Nigal, who was the goddess of the moon. She brings a little pot of tin with sesame seeds or sesame oil in it, which she offers to the goddess, and that’s all we know about the text.”

An ancient musical workshop

But Syria did not produce only the earliest melody. Over time, a rich array of musical instruments on which to play them also formed across the region, such as the lyre, a stringed musical instrument with a yoke and a crossbar, and lutes, which evolved into the modern Arabian oud, a teardrop-shaped plucked string instrument that produces one of the most evocative sounds in the region.

At Mari, an Early Bronze Age city-state on the banks of the Euphrates river in eastern modern-day Syria, researchers in the 20th Century uncovered a number of records detailing the musical instrument-making business of the time.

“There in the palace [at Mari] we discovered a huge number of tablets which were mainly letters and receipts of material from artisans who were requesting leather, raw hide, wood, gold and silver for making instruments,” Dumbrill said. “Therefore we have a very good idea about the instruments that were made about 4,000 years ago. We knew the names of the artisans, we knew the type of instruments they made. They were already influenced by instruments which were not Syrian,” he added, citing the Iranian parahshitum as an example, a type of lyre that became very popular among the girls of the harem at Mari.

Production of musical instruments continued to flourish in Syria over the centuries, and many are preserved in collections open to visitors today.

At the Debbané Palace in the Lebanese coastal city of Saida, for example, a collection of Ottoman-era musical instruments, dating from around the 19th Century, gives visitors an insight into the traditions present across both Lebanon and Syria before the formation of the modern states. Pieces from Syria include ouds and bouzouks (a small lute with a long, slim arm) inlaid with wood and ivory.

“People [visiting] ask, why are there so many musical instruments?” said Ghassan Dimassy, a guide at the Debbané Palace. “We tell them that this is an Ottoman house and the women used to sit and sing.” He mimicked the women playing a musical instrument and the men lying back and relaxing; here, music was the essential backdrop to any leisure occasion.

A music in exile

Last year, Syrian authorities launched a bid to have Aleppo, Syria’s second city, added to Unesco's Creative Cities Network as a ‘City of Music’ to commemorate its heritage. During the 17th Century, Aleppo was renowned for its muwashshah, a form of music combined with lyrics from Andalusian poetry, classical Arabic poetry, or, later on, Syrian or Egyptian conversational Arabic. Muwashshah are performed by a band playing the oud and qanun (a horizontal board with strings plucked to produce a haunting sound like trickling water), as well as the kamanja (a violin-like instrument), a darabukkah (drum), and a daf (tambourine). The form thrived in the city, where it was embraced by both Muslim and Christian populations.

However, significant efforts to preserve Syria’s musical traditions are now also found outside this country, which has entered its eighth year of conflict and where civilians have in large part been forced to focus attention on survival rather than exploring their cultural heritage. Some Syrian youth are making the best of a difficult situation and are bringing Syria's rich musical history into the limelight.

Long an incubator of creative talent, Beirut has become a crucible for preserving Syrian musical heritage. Me'zaf, an organisation founded in the Lebanese capital in 2015, aims to innovate, promote and preserve authentic music from not just Syria, but the Levantine region as a whole, showing how the Middle East’s rich musical traditions precede the modern nation-state borders introduced in the 20th Century.

“A lot of forms were created in Damascus or Aleppo and were taken to Cairo, then forms were created in Cairo and performed in the Levant,” explained Ghassan Sahhab, a Me'zaf leader and Lebanese musicology teacher, composer and qanun player. “We have a rich culture and we have to appreciate it and know our history in order to continue. At the moment, it’s a case of preserving heritage and culture.”

Another musical troupe that formed in Beirut is Assa'aleek, which consists of five Syrians and a Norwegian. The band’s name means ‘the ragamuffins’ or ‘the vagabonds’ in Arabic, and refers to a group of self-proclaimed Robin Hood-type characters who lived during the pre-Islamic era in the Arabian Gulf and tried to change the ways of the ruling class.

This media cannot be played on your device.

“We are similar to the Assa'aleek: we were forced out of our communities and homeland for many reasons,” said Abodi Jatal, percussion player in Assa'aleek.

“It is important to preserve ancient Syrian music because this is our identity, it is history and it is civilisation, after all. This is what we have. This is what we are,” said Assa'aleek vocalist Mona Al Merstany. “It’s not just about a normal country – it’s one of the most ancient countries. It is important to show such things because all people have the right to see beauty.”

It is important to preserve ancient Syrian music because this is our identity

They see music as a way of fighting the injustices faced on a daily basis by people in the region.

“Our lyrics and songs, this is what they are built on,” Jatal said. “We wanted to fight against bad habits, such as harassment against women, and we saw that this is really similar to what the Assa'aleek did, so that’s why we used the name.”

As well as new songs, the band has been performing Syrian folk music since 2013, bringing music from across Syria’s diverse landscapes and communities to audiences in Lebanon.

Syrian music heritage has come a long way since the melody found on the clay tablets at Ugarit. Today, bands such as Assa'aleek are reinventing the definition of Syrian music, bringing it to new audiences.

Meanwhile, they are developing the sounds that museoarchaeologists of the future might one day find, stored on computers, in files or drawers, in Aleppo, Damascus or Beirut, or even Paris, London or Berlin.

Al Merstany sums it up well: “When someone asks me what is Syria, this is what I have to say: the music, the art.”

22,syria,"Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, was speaking to journalists after a scheduled humanitarian task force meeting in Geneva.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over,” he said, amid reports that “tens of thousands of people” from Rural Damascus were preparing to evacuate to Idlib in the north-west of the country.

“We’ve still only 23 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded and we’re now in May,” Mr Egeland said, warning that there was “no cash …available to humanitarian actors” as “desperate, exhausted people arrive now every day in Idlib. There is no money for the operations.”

He called on countries not to slow down their support “before this marathon of suffering is over.”

Mr. Egeland’s comments come amid ongoing aid-access challenges, in many areas of Syria, linked to mass displacement and acute needs caused by more than seven years of war.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over” - Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria

One year ago, well over four million people lived in so-called hard-to-reach locations where aid access was extremely unreliable, and hundreds of thousands more were trapped by surrounding forces.

Today, two million people remain in hard-to-reach areas in Syria and 11,000 still live in besieged locations; but the apparent progress in terms of numbers, is deceptive, the UN Special Advisor explained:

“It is a good thing that people are not any longer living massively in besieged areas, and that much fewer people live in hard-to-reach areas. But when this comes at the cost of horrific battles in heavily populated areas, and when it comes because of agreements made by a small group of military people and politicians, too often humanitarian concerns and the protection concerns for the civilian population is lost.”

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), displacement in some parts of Syria is as high as it was at the beginning of the crisis.

OCHA’s records indicate that for every person who returns home voluntarily, another three people are newly displaced.

Areas of particular concern include Afrin in the north, the former ISIL stronghold of Raqqa, as well as Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus and Yarmouk in the south of the capital - where the UN has highly-restricted access.

But Mr. Egeland said his “worry number one” was Idlib, which is already home to more than two million people.

“They are living out in the open, they are living in congested displacement camps…crammed in collective centres,” he said.

“They arrive at 2am, you know, sort of every night now, just to find that they can hardly get a bed anywhere offered by completely overwhelmed humanitarian actors. So we cannot have a war in Idlib,” he implored.

Amid reports that armed groups are continuing to strike what Mr Egeland called “bad humanitarian agreements” to allow civilians to leave several conflict zones including the besieged Shia towns of Foah and Kafraya in the north-west and Yarmouk south of Damascus, he said it was important that people went to a place of their choosing.

Mr. Egeland also expressed concern for the 40,000 people living in displacement camps near eastern Ghouta – previously home to 390,000 people - amid a reported lack of freedom of movement for civilians, particularly men.

The veteran aid chief also defended the value of the UN-coordinated “deconfliction system” which offers protection to humanitarian locations whose location is communicated to warring parties.

More than 660 sites had now asked the UN to transmit their coordinates to Member States whose militaries are operating within Syria, Mr. Egeland said, and more than 500 of those requests had come this year alone.

“I’m surprised really by those who say they really want to help protect medical facilities, that they are questioning the whole value of trying to get a deconfliction system up in the Syria war, like we have it in Yemen, we have it in Afghanistan, we have it in Mali and many other conflicts,” he added.","‘Marathon of suffering’ in Syria conflict, far from over: UN humanitarian adviser",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008832

The situation facing Syrian children

As the Syrian crisis enters its eighth year, it continues to have a devastating impact on children inside Syria and in neighbouring countries. UNICEF is appealing for funding to meet both the immediate and longer term needs of children and their families, wherever they are.

Over two million school-age children are out-of-school in Syria.

1 in 3 schools in Syria cannot be used because it is either damaged, destroyed or sheltering displaced families or used for military purposes.

Half of all healthcare facilities in Syria are either partially functioning or not functioning at all.

The proportion of people living in extreme poverty in Syria (less than US$1.90 per day) doubled from 34% pre-crisis to nearly 70% today.

6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity in Syria.

More than 5.6 million people, including 2.7 million children, have been living as registered refugees in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey since the onset of the conflict.

25,syria,"At just 10 years old, Yasmeen Qanouz became a voice for her generation through a video smuggled from the Moumayazoun orphanage, her home in Aleppo. Forced to live underground because of bombing by Syrian government forces, she spoke directly to the camera. She spoke for the children sharing the space with her — 47 in total, she said. She begged for help.

""We are scared of the airstrikes..."" she said. ""Please get us out of Aleppo. We want to live like everyone else.""

Yasmeen's generation is in peril: They are the orphans of Syria's war, which conservative estimates number at 100,000. This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley reports on some of the humanitarians who have dedicated themselves to helping these children. One, Elaph Yassin, decided she had to help change the lives of the orphans she met while covering the war for Al Jazeera. Another, Yakzan Shishakly, left a comfortable life in the U.S. to lend a hand with war refugees and ended up building an orphanage.

Moumayazoun Orphanage

But it was the video of Yasmeen that first drew 60 Minutes producers Rachael Morehouse and Henry Schuster to the story. Morehouse had read a UNICEF report stating that 2016 war the worst year for Syrian children since the start of the civil war — and then she came across the video of Yasmeen. Morehouse and Schuster both felt personal ties to the story: She had just given birth to twins; he is the father of a son adopted from an orphanage. ""We thought, 'Wow, this is a story that we really need to pursue,'"" Morehouse says.

The pursuit wasn't easy. The children in the Moumayazoun orphanage, including Yasmeen, had escaped Aleppo, so the 60 Minutes producers had to follow ""digital breadcrumbs"" to find them, says Schuster. First, they tracked the kids to Idlib, but by the time they'd confirmed it, the group had already left. Then, the 60 Minutes team realized the group had made it to Azaz, but by that point, the group was gone again.

""We were always a step behind,"" Schuster recalls.

Eric Kerchner/60 Minutes

Finally, they found Ahmed Hamedo, the director of the Moumayazoun orphanage, which had settled in safer spot within Syria after the group's harrowing escape from Aleppo. The 60 Minutes team was denied access at the Syrian border, so Hamedo met them in Turkey, where he told 60 Minutes about Yasmeen's resolve.

""The girl is very smart and has a strong personality,"" Hamedo said. ""And she's educated and she has the personality of a leader among the children. We, as the administration of the orphanage, we rely on her on many student matters.""

Unable to visit the orphanage in person, Pelley recorded a message for them, asking them what their life is like, what their dreams are. The 60 Minutes team then sent a local cameraman over the border to record their responses.

""I want to be a doctor for little kids,"" Yasmeen replied in the video brought back. ""I am studying so that when I grow up, I'll know where to go, how to get myself together and find a place to live.""

Unlike orphans of other conflicts, Syrian children like Yasmeen will probably not find refuge with American families looking to adopt. Adopting Syrian orphans is virtually impossible for a number of reasons. To begin with, both the custom and the legal practice in Syria puts the onus of caring for orphaned children on the child's extended family.

But for viewers who were moved by the 60 Minutes story about Syrian orphans and feel compelled to help, there's another way: by donating. Since the 60 Minutes team visited, Elaph Yassin ran out of money for the apartment building where she was housing orphans and had to move them to less expensive quarters. Yakzan Shishakly is under constant financial pressure now that he's expanded his school to teach 200 Syrian children.

""Believe me, all of these places could use money,"" Schuster says.

""In regards to the situation in Syria, Shoukry said that the idea of replacing forces with another that may be Arab is a possibility"", Al-Ahram quoted Sameh Shoukry as saying.

""This proposition is not only being discussed by the media, but also during discussions and deliberations amongst officials of states to look into how these ideas could contribute to stabilising Syria"", Al-Ahram quoted Mr Shoukry as saying.

He did not name the countries in question. But an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official told Reuters that Shoukry's comments did not pertain to Egypt.

""The principles that govern sending Egyptian forces outside the country are known to everybody. That won't happen unless it was in line with constitutional mechanisms, and rules and regulations that have been affirmed more than once, such as cases related to United Nations peacekeeping operations"", said Ahmed Abu Zeid in a statement.

Saudi Arabia said last month it was open to sending troops to Syria under wider coalition.

Syria has been wracked by seven years of civil war that has left more than 400,000 people dead, displaced millions and caused one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.
