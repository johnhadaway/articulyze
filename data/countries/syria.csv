President Trump’s response to Saturday’s chemical-weapons attack could redefine his policy toward the war-torn country.

When President Donald Trump said last week that he was committed to a complete U.S. withdrawal from Syria, critics zeroed in on the contradiction between his off-the-cuff comments and the opinions of his top military advisers and national-security staff, who reportedly argued that the U.S. must stay in Syria after the defeat of ISIS in order to prevent its resurgence.

The problem wasn’t just Trump’s instinctive resistance to staying on script. The gap between the president’s positions and those of his staff with respect to Syria was wide. What the president said reflected not only his own beliefs but also what his instincts told him were the opinions of most Americans. After more than 16 years of wars in the Middle East, it’s likely that most of the people who voted for Trump, as well as many of those who didn’t, agreed when he said America’s involvement in the Middle East since 9/11 had produced only debt, death, and devastation. Despite critics across the political spectrum who pointed out that leaving Syria to Russia and Iran was dangerous for the U.S., Israel, and the region, Trump was signaling that he remained as instinctively isolationist as he seemed during his presidential campaign.

Yet the talk of withdrawal was quickly forgotten after reports emerged Saturday of a chemical attack carried out against civilians in the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma by the forces of the Bashar al-Assad regime. As he did after a similar attack a year ago, Trump reacted emotionally. He denounced the Syrian dictator, placed responsibility for the atrocity on both Russia and Iran, and promised a strong response within days.

After more than a year of presidential flattery directed at Moscow, Trump’s willingness to speak ill of Russian president Vladimir Putin is something of a breakthrough. Though the administration has at times acted against Russian interests with respect to Ukraine and other issues, the president’s belief in the possibility of better relations with Russia — as well as his sensitivity to charges about Russian collusion with his campaign — had until now caused him to avoid personal criticisms of Putin or even to speak frankly about Moscow’s aggressive behavior abroad and its attempts to interfere in U.S. elections.

The real question isn’t how many missiles are fired but whether the president is prepared to abandon his illusions about détente with Putin and recognize that pulling out of Syria isn’t a viable option.

Assad’s atrocity seemed to jolt Trump. He appeared, in its aftermath, to be finally waking up to the glaring contradiction between his soft attitude toward Russia and his hostility to Iran. In Syria, the two countries are partners. Getting tough with Iran and restraining its quest for regional hegemony as well as the activities of its terrorist auxiliaries like Hezbollah and allies like Assad required a more clear-headed approach to Russia than Trump had previously been willing to accept.

On Monday, Trump assured the world that a “very tough” response to the Douma attack was on the way. It’s not clear whether the U.S. reaction will be a one-off attack on Syrian targets or something more far-reaching. Either way, the real question isn’t how many missiles are fired but whether the president is prepared to abandon his illusions about détente with Putin and recognize that pulling out of Syria isn’t a viable option. The answer will tell us all what exactly an “America First” foreign policy means in a world in which the president’s desire to avoid more Middle East wars and entanglements cannot be reconciled with the defense of America’s interests and values or those of its allies.

In assessing the situation in Syria, Trump has rightly placed most of the blame on his predecessor. President Obama’s retreat from his “red line” threat to attack Assad if he used chemical weapons was a critical moment for both U.S. foreign policy and the course of the war in Syria. By passing responsibility for the control of the regime’s chemical weapons to the U.N., Obama allowed Moscow to replace the U.S. as the pre-eminent power in the region, enabled Russian and Iranian intervention in the civil war, and made America complicit in the atrocities that these powers would commit. Though Obama would be forced to commit the United States to the fight against ISIS terrorists who gained power as a result of his withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and his unwillingness to intervene in Iran, the lackluster results from those efforts were also a function of his lack of interest in the conflict.

Given his own reluctance to commit the U.S. to “nation building” as well as his desire for a new détente with Russia, there was a great deal of continuity between Trump’s policies in Syria and those of Obama. However, there was one major difference. Trump’s enthusiasm for the battle against ISIS was far greater than that of Obama and his decision to loosen the rules of engagement for U.S. forces was a major factor in the rout of ISIS in 2017, after two years of stalemate under Obama’s leadership.

But Trump also thought ISIS’s defeat could be followed by a U.S. withdrawal that would allow him to concentrate on nation building at home. What he has been slow to realize is that while Obama should shoulder the blame for the current mess in Syria, another retreat on his watch would create an even bigger disaster. With Iran now entrenched in Syria and threatening Israel, and Turkey threatening the Kurdish forces that played a key role in defeating ISIS, the price of U.S. disengagement has gone up. That means that what is needed is not just an effort to punish Assad and his allies for their chemical attacks but a U.S. message to Russia and Iran that America will not allow the region to spiral further out of control.

The irony for Trump is that in December the administration issued a 68-page foreign-policy position paper that sought to define “America First” in a manner that would be consistent with a continued U.S. commitment to its Middle East responsibilities. That document provided a loose outline of a policy of American engagement in the region along with a robust military response to threats to U.S. interests, allies, and values. It gives plenty of intellectual cover for a strong response to Douma and a course correction that will involve Trump’s putting Russia on notice that the United States will not allow Syria to become a playground for Iranian mischief with regard to Israel, attempts to crush the Kurds, or further Assad atrocities.

To send that message, the U.S. will need to maintain its troop presence in the areas reclaimed from ISIS and be willing to use sanctions to place pressure on both Russia and Iran.

It’s been a century since the Atlantic and the Pacific were the boundaries of U.S. national defense. If Trump’s “America First” instincts lead him to treat any response to Assad as a one-time gesture rather than a policy shift, he will be heading down the same disastrous path trod by Obama. Like it or not, punting Syria to Russia and Iran involves consequences that are every bit as unpalatable as the notion of continued American commitment to the region. If Trump fails to do more than firing a few missiles, it will create future troubles much more difficult to overcome.",Syria Crisis: Trump's ‘America First’ Approach Tested,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/04/what-does-america-first-mean-in-syria/
1,syria,"Mr. Trump canceled a trip to Peru and Colombia that was scheduled to start Friday to oversee the response to the Syria attack, but as of early evening, had made no comment about Syria on Twitter or in his public appearances on Tuesday. Instead, he left it to a guest, the visiting emir of Qatar, to express determination to stop atrocities in Syria.

“We see the suffering of the Syrian people,” Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. “And me and the president, we see eye to eye that this matter has to stop immediately. We cannot tolerate with a war criminal, we cannot tolerate with someone who killed more than half a million of his own people.”

Mr. Trump spent part of the day huddled with John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, John R. Bolton, his new national security adviser, and other officials. But his spokeswoman declined to discuss the deliberations.

“As we’ve said, all options are on the table,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, “but I’m not going to get ahead of anything the president may or may not do in response to what’s taken place in Syria.”

Heavily backed by Russian air support and Iranian ground forces, Syria is in a different league than adversaries in other places where the United States is at war. Unlike the Islamic State in various parts of the Middle East, the Taliban in Afghanistan or the Shabab in Somalia, the Syrian government has extensive air defense and missile systems capable of shooting down foreign planes.

Sending bombers and fighters jets, with American or French pilots, to strike Syrian airfields or other facilities is considered risky because it could deepen the conflict if a pilot was shot down. That is why the Pentagon is looking at the same sort of retaliation used last year when two Navy destroyers unleashed a fusillade of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield that was believed to have been used to launch chemical attacks.

But less than 24 hours after that strike, Syrian warplanes were again taking off from the damaged airfield, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. Beyond Al Shayrat base, Syria still had numerous others from which it could launch flights. While Mr. Trump’s advisers argued last year that the strike affected Mr. Assad’s calculations, in the end its limited nature ultimately did not thwart the Syrian government’s ability to launch chemical attacks.

“There’s a tension between the desire to do something bigger than last time and the president’s clear desire not to stay engaged in sustained operations,” said Michèle A. Flournoy, an under secretary of defense under President Barack Obama. “Conceivably, they could design a larger one-off strike or a series of smaller strikes.”

“But at the end of the day, it’s sustained pressure on Assad that’s going to change his calculation about whether to use chemical weapons,” Ms. Flournoy said.

David F. Gordon, policy planning director at the State Department under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump was almost certainly looking to punish Mr. Assad more severely while limiting American engagement.

“What they’re probably searching for is: What can we destroy that weakens this guy?” Mr. Gordon said. “He has to do more than he did last time, and I think he does want to disrupt their capabilities. But I think it’s basically still the one shot — it may be in two waves or something, but I don’t think there’s an ongoing response to this.”

Already, there were indications that Mr. Assad was moving key aircraft to a Russian base near Latakia, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, and taking pains to secure important weapons systems.

The Pentagon does not have an aircraft carrier in the area at the moment, which focuses attention on the U.S.S. Donald Cook or the U.S.S. Porter, two Navy destroyers already in the Mediterranean. The Donald Cook departed Larnaca, Cyprus, on Monday after completing a scheduled port visit, Navy officials said.

The Donald Cook is one of four Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers that generally serve Europe and are part of a NATO rotation, officials said. The United States can use the Donald Cook or the Porter to launch multiple Tomahawk cruise missiles at sites in Syria similar to last year’s operation.

Since last year’s strikes, the United States Central Command has been updating lists of possible military and government targets in Syria, including aircraft hangars, ammunition depots and command headquarters. Defense officials said one possibility was to render certain Syrian airfields incapable of being used in the future to launch chemical attacks.

Last year’s strike destroyed a number of aircraft and their hangars, the Pentagon said at the time, but did not hinder the base’s ability to launch aircraft for long. The American missiles used in the attack, BGM-109 Tomahawks, have a range of around 1,000 miles and carry a warhead that weighs half a ton.

The Donald Cook and the Porter are likely loaded with roughly two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles each. The U.S.S. New York, an amphibious landing ship and part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, is also nearby. The New York can launch transport helicopters and landing craft loaded with Marines, but sending in ground forces is highly unlikely, officials said.

In coming days, the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is scheduled to head to the region. While part of a regularly scheduled deployment, the Truman will deploy to the Mediterranean with a complement of strike and reconnaissance aircraft and surface warships sailing alongside.

Whether allied forces would participate remained unclear. President Emmanuel Macron of France said Tuesday that the allies were still discussing a plan and would announce a decision “in the coming days.”

“We do not wish for any escalation in the region,” said Mr. Macron, who was hosting Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. “But we simply wish that international law, and in particular international humanitarian law, be respected.”

Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, said that those behind the reported chemical attack in Syria must be “held accountable,” although he did not say whether Saudi Arabia would join any response. “We are discussing with our allies the steps to respond,” Mr. Jubeir told reporters in Paris.

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who spoke by telephone with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, also stressed the responsibility of Mr. Assad’s government for the attack “if confirmed.” In a statement summarizing the leaders’ call, the British government said, “They agreed that the international community needed to respond to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.”

In Washington, most lawmakers remained either supportive of military action or noncommittal, but some liberal Democrats objected. Leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus issued a statement calling on the administration to “redouble its efforts to engage our allies and enforce international prohibitions on chemical weapons diplomatically” rather than use force again.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Mr. Trump needed permission from Congress before action.

“He’s a president, not a king, and Congress needs to quit giving him a blank check to wage war against anyone, anywhere,” Mr. Kaine said. “If he strikes Syria without our approval, what will stop him from bombing North Korea or Iran?”",Trump Weighs More Robust Military Strike Against Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-military-strike-syria.html
2,syria,"Prime Minister Theresa May must win MPs’ approval before backing military action in Syria, a motion with cross-party support demands. Stewart McDonald, the SNP’s Westminster defence spokesman, is pressing for a fresh Parliamentary vote on any airstrikes against Bashar al-Assad regime, and has won the backing of some Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs. May sidestepped questions over the issue during a visit to Cambridge on Tuesday after hinting at a press conference earlier in the week the UK could step up its involvement. America is looking to the UK and France for support as President Donald Trump finalises the US response. It follows news of a suspected chemical attack by Syrian government forces in a brutal assault on the rebel-held town of Douma that left more than 40 people - including children - dead.

Rescuers and opposition forces said poison gas was used, an allegation strongly denied by the Assad government and his allies in Iran and Russia. Reports suggested more than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centres with difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth, and burning sensations in the eyes. Families were also reportedly found suffocated in their homes and shelters. US President Donald Trump described Assad as an “animal” after the attack, and warned there would be a “big price to pay”. May is set to speak to US President Donald Trump in a phone call on Tuesday night and will be chairing a National Security Council meeting.

Trump and Emmanuel Macron have already agreed to coordinate a “strong, joint response”, but May appears to be more cautious. “This attack that took place in Douma is a barbaric attack,” she told reporters. “Obviously we are working urgently with our allies and partners to assess what has happened on the ground. “If this is the responsibility of Assad’s regime in Syria then it’s yet another example of the brutality and brazen disregard for their people that they show.”

The Prime Minister faces growing pressure from her own MPs to use executive powers to back military action without MPs’ approval, however. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: “Striking Syria’s stockpiles of chemical weapons would degrade their ability to commit further war crimes and could be done together with allies. It would not require a vote in Parliament.” Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, has also thrown his weight behind an attack, writing in his Evening Standard column: “In view of the enormity of what has been done, if there is a way of preventing its recurrence by the limited use of force that is one thing and I would be supportive.”

Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair has also called on Britain to support US airstrikes, saying “non-intervention is also a policy with consequences”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If the US are taking action, we should be prepared to be alongside them. “Last year they took military action and that was supposed to deter these attacks. It obviously had some impact, but now we have another one of those attacks.” But choosing to act without Parliament’s support could be divisive. McDonald’s motion has the backing of 46 MPs so far, including that of Labour’s Clive Lewis, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and Lib Dem Jo Swinson.

Devastating reports & images point to a heartless, inhumane, illegal chemical attack by Assad's forces, killing innocent Syrian civilians. Int'l community must unequivocally condemn this vicious act.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is not thought to support military action and his party has been widely condemned for a lacklustre response. In a statement which failed to apportion blame, Labour said that “anyone found responsible for using chemical weapons is brought to justice”. The statement said Syrian people had “suffered for too long from the atrocities and brutality of this war, whether committed by the Assad regime, by Jihadist militias, or by their respective international supporters”. Some Labour MPs are likely to back action, however.

3,syria,"David Crane, a Syracuse University professor of practice who helped create a program to document humanitarian crises in Syria, is retiring after teaching for 12 years at the College of Law.

Crane, who graduated from the College of Law in 1980, practices law related to war crimes and crimes against humanity. From 2002-05, Crane served on the Special Court for Sierra Leone. During his tenure, he investigated war crimes that occurred during Sierra Leone’s civil war in the 1990s. He indicted Liberian President Charles Taylor for charges related to war crimes.

While at SU, Crane created the Syrian Accountability Project to document humanitarian crises in Syria. Crane also worked with College of Law students to investigate such crises.

The Daily Orange spoke with Crane to discuss his career at the university and in international law.

The Daily Orange: Why did you choose to attend the College of Law at SU?

David Crane: I had applied to several law schools, and what really decided it for me was my father-in-law. He was a graduate of Syracuse University, Class of 1943. Secondly, my mother was very, very ill living in Liberty, New York. I was either going to Georgetown or Syracuse, so I had decided to go to Syracuse for those reasons.

The D.O.: Can you talk about your time as chief prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone?

D.C.: It was a real privilege and honor to be asked by the international community and the secretary general to go over and seek justice for victims of a horror story who saw the murder, rape and mutilation of over 1.2 million people.

One never seeks that kind of high office — it just comes because you have had a long career with a reputation of getting things done. Creating new organizations and managing them to success, and being someone one can rely on.

The D.O.: What made you want to become a professor at SU?

D.C.: The chancellor at the time, as well as the dean, had reached out to me in March of 2005. I had just submitted my resignation to the secretary general. My work in Sierra Leone was done.

They had asked me if I would like to come back and teach at my alma mater, and I said I would love to, but my wife has a career in the Defense Intelligence Agency. I can’t live in Syracuse — we were living in D.C. And they said, “Well that’s not a problem, we will fly you up.”

And so, I began my long journey of flying up on Tuesday and leaving on Thursday while teaching a full load of classes.

The D.O.: Can you discuss the Syrian Accountability Project?

D.C.: The Syrian National Congress had asked me to come see them in The Hague to advise them on what justice mechanisms might be available to prosecute (Bashar al-Assad) and his henchmen in 2011. I went there to advise them and also decided they needed help in that regard. So, I used my methodology and took what I learned in West Africa and began my work.

We are in (our) eighth year now, compiling a case against all warring parties. Even though I am retiring from Syracuse, the Syrian Accountability Project will move from Syracuse to my consulting firm, and we will continue our work there.

The D.O.: Can you speak about the times you assisted the United Nations Security Council?

D.C.: I have done it many, many ways. I am the one who came up with the idea of the International Independent and Impartial Mechanism for Syria back in August of 2016.

The D.O.: What was the most rewarding thing teaching at SU has brought you?

D.C.: Seeing my students learn and graduate and take over jobs which I had helped put them in and see them flourish. That’s the best part about being a professor, seeing your students take what you taught them and becoming successful citizens.",This SU professor helped document humanitarian crises in Syria.

The surprise change to an event scheduled for later this week came amid Trump's continued effort to negotiate trade deals — and his continued anger over the special counsel's Russia probe and a recent raid on his personal lawyer's residence and office.

Trump met with military officials in the White House Monday evening to deliberate over the administration's response to an alleged chemical weapons attack carried out by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government against its own people.

In comments to the press before the round-table meeting began, however, Trump focused much more on the warranted search of lawyer Michael Cohen's office and residence that morning by the FBI, which had reportedly received a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller.

Trump called the raid ""disgraceful"" and ""a total witch hunt"" in his remarks, and said the entire special counsel's probe of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is ""an attack on our country in a true sense.""

Asked if he would fire Mueller, Trump said: ""Many people have said, 'You should fire him.' Again, they found nothing.""

6,syria,"The video below shows Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine showing off a captured RQ-11B Raven drone that they claimed to have brought down using an electronic warfare attack.

There have been reports of such activity in Ukraine, where the Kremlin is actively supporting an insurgency against the government in Kiev, since 2014. In December 2016, it emerged that Ukraine’s forces were especially disappointed in hand-launched RQ-11B Raven drones they had received from the United States. Russian troops, and the separatists they supported, knocked down those drones with electronic warfare assets and downloaded video footage, which showed the layout and location of Ukrainian positions.

But Russia’s capabilities to jam and intercept video feeds from this category of drones are well established at this point. The country has a wide array of man-portable and vehicle-mounted electronic warfare systems that are reportedly capable of jamming transmissions and also feeding false information into networks, including “ spoofing ” GPS signals and potentially sending parties and vehicles off their intended course.

Though we don’t know what type of U.S. military drones the Russians have been targeting, from the available description these sound like catapult- and hand-launched unmanned aircraft that American special operators , and supporting conventional forces , are almost certainly using in Syria for short-range surveillance missions. These typically carry electro-optical video cameras, but some, such as the AeroVironment RQ-20A Puma and the Boeing Insitu MQ-27A ScanEagle can carry infrared optics and miniaturized signals intelligence equipment.

The unnamed officials told NBC that the jamming was having an “operational impact” and that the Russian equipment was sophisticated enough to break through a number of existing countermeasures, including some jamming-resistant components . “The U.S. military maintains sufficient countermeasures and protections to ensure the safety of our manned and unmanned aircraft, our forces and the missions they support,” Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said in response to the outlet’s request for additional information, refusing to confirm or deny the reports.

On April 10, 2018, NBC News , citing anonymous U.S. government sources, reported that Russia had been launching electronic warfare attacks against unspecified American unmanned planes for weeks. This increased activity came after a series of indiscriminate Syrian government poison gas attacks on rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital Damascus. Those atrocities culminated in a strike on April 7, 2018 that left dozens dead and hundreds injured, which has prompted the United States and its allies to threaten some form of retaliation .

The U.S. military has reportedly seen a spike in Russian forces in Syria jamming the GPS receivers and other data links on its small unmanned aircraft flying over the country. But it’s unclear whether this reflects any significant change in Russia’s overall strategy amid evidence that the Kremlin has been harassing American aircraft over the country in this way to some degree for years, which The War Zone was among the first to reveal .

In Syria specifically, there have been increasing indications that the U.S. military is concerned broadly about the potential for GPS jamming or other disruptions with the navigational network. The War Zone was first to report that at least one weekly U.S. Air Force intelligence summary in 2016, which we obtained in a heavily redacted form via the Freedom of Information Act, included an entire section devoted to the issue. More recently, we were first to report that the U.S. Army was adding anti-jam equipment to a fleet of discreet special operations spy planes in response to operational requirements. Three of these planes had been flying over Iraq as of 2016 – one crashed outside Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region that year, due to engine failure – and may now be conducting operations over Eastern Syria.

USAF via FOIA A portion of the table of contents from a US Air Force Combined Intelligence Fusion Center's (CIFC) weekly intelligence summary for air operations over Iraq and Syria covering the period from Dec. 1 to 7, 2016.

The Russians themselves have made no secret that they have deployed these assets to the country, either. After an unprecedented mass rebel drone attack on its Khmeimim air base and naval outpost in Tartus, both in western Syria, in January 2018, the Kremlin said that it had been able to neutralize some of the unmanned attackers using electronic warfare systems. It's worth noting that both nation state military forces and non-state actors are steadily expanding their use of small drones, including in small groups and semi-autonomous swarms. As such, Russia is hardly alone in developing countermeasures against those types of unmanned aircraft. And it’s hard to imagine that Russia would not take advantage of this capability in its larger effort to impede American activities in Eastern Syria, which is staunchly opposes. Jamming the short-range drones limits the ability American troops to gain a better understanding of the situation around them, which can in turn only hamper their mission planning process and increase risks for them during more extended operations. Jamming would also be a way to help keep U.S. unmanned aircraft out of Western Syria, where Assad's regime is more firmly in control and where his forces continue to commit crimes against humanity with impunity. Still, manned aircraft from the American-led coalition fighting ISIS long ago stopped flying in that part of the country and the dubious de-confliction line Russia and the United States have agreed to in order to separate their operations should preclude any drones from missions there, as well.

Sputnik/Vladimir Astapkovich A Russian Leer-2 electronic warfare system, based on the Tigr 4x4 light armored vehicle, which is one of the smaller known systems in service at present.

In addition, the Russian government has already shown it is willing to commit nebulous proxy forces to direct combat against U.S. personnel and their local Syrian partners. Those mercenary groups proved to be disastrously ineffective against American firepower in an incident in February 2018, which may have forced the Kremlin to reassess the utility of attempting to rely on these groups for any high-end fighting. Jamming the linkages between a drone and its controllers on the ground is also a relatively low-risk proposition for Russia. If it succeeds in destroying the aircraft it is unlikely that an American service member will die in the process, reducing the likelihood of any immediate escalation. The largely opaque relationship actual Russian troops in the country have with private military contractors, militias aligned with Assad, Iranian personnel, and Syrian government forces give the Kremlin significant avenues to deny any responsibility whatsoever.

Vitaly V. Kuzmin Russia's Krasukha electronic warfare systems are some of the country's most powerful. Supposedly they can jam all sorts of systems at long-range, from AWACS to drones, and even possibly satellites.

But while Russia’s GPS jamming and spoofing in Syria is definitely a cause for concern, especially given the steadily worsening ties between the Kremlin and the U.S. government, the full extent of Russian capabilities in this regard in the country and whether there has been any actual shift in policy remain unclear. The sources told NBC News that larger unmanned aircraft, such as MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators, remained unaffected, which might be an indication that the electronic warfare attacks had been relatively localized and not complex enough to jam those drones' microwave satellite communications data links. This would make sense given the increasingly close proximity of American and Russian-backed forces in Syria. U.S. forces throughout the country have been taking up more robust postures with added defenses in recent months in response to threats from various groups.

It also potentially points to the use of more discreet and shorter-range systems that are easier to conceal. This would also help Russia deflect accusations that it is actively targeting U.S. troops in any way. Beyond that, there’s nothing to automatically indicate that the electronic warfare systems the Russians are using in Syria could ward off any larger air and missile strikes the U.S. military or its allies might launch against Assad in response to his chemical weapons attacks, at least not by themselves. Those assets could be worrisome within the context of the larger integrated Russian-Syrian air defense network, but it’s hardly a risk the U.S. government could be unaware of at this point. The U.S. military is aware of the potential difficulties of operating in a GPS degraded or outright denied environment, too, and is increasingly training to mitigate those dangers.

These jets have been a near constant feature in the region for years now and low-observable aircraft would almost certainly spearhead any future attack against Assad due to possible concerns about his air defenses, which are linked with Russian assets in the country.

The truth is, as we at The War Zone have been noting for months, that there is something of a low-level fight between Russia and the United States in Syria already, as well as elsewhere in the world. It’s a hybrid conflict that involves the heavy use of proxy forces and information warfare to create conflicting narratives about what’s actually happening on the ground. Jamming and otherwise harassing small U.S. drones remotely, as well as potentially reducing confidence in GPS-enabled systems, is entirely in line with this over-arching concept of operations. From everything we know, it’s been happening and will likely to continue happening, at least sporadically, for the foreseeable future as the Kremlin continues to agitate for a complete withdrawal of American forces from Syria.

7,syria,"This weekend’s chemical attacks against civilians in Syria—and the Trump administration’s likely military response—highlight an intensifying dilemma underlying international law on the use of force. The confused state of the law, and the state practice increasingly occurring outside of it, threatens to undermine the UN system’s already limited ability to constrain state violence. Given this crisis, improvements to the current legal framework are desperately needed. An improved legal framework using a qualitative threshold—legitimizing humanitarian intervention against regimes that use chemical and biological weapons (CBW) on civilians—can offer a way forward for both protecting civilians and strengthening international law in the UN system.

Few Bases for Action under International Law

Despite the severity of the Syrian regime’s past chemical attacks against civilians, and their almost universal condemnation, the legal justification for previous U.S. strikes against the Syrian regime has been hotly debated. Without falling under the UN Charter’s exceptions for intervention — Security Council authorization under Chapter VIII or Article 51’s provision for self-defense — there seems to be little direct authorization for the strikes under the UN framework. No explicit authorization exists for the use of force outside of these exceptions.

Politically motivated vetoes, as have been cast before by Russia, will likely continue to prevent Security Council authorization for more forceful measures. Similarly, a doctrine of “unilateral” (or unauthorized) humanitarian intervention, which would open the door to legality for interventions not explicitly authorized under the UN Charter, finds limited support among states and legal scholars.

However, despite this proscription in the current UN framework, state practice in Kosovo, Syria, and elsewhere—and the muted reaction of much of the international community—suggest that a notable number of states in the international system may in reality be tacitly accepting a diverging norm. Such divergence was captured by U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley in April 2017, when she said, in response to the Khan Sheikhoun chemical attack, that “when the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action.” Soon after her remarks at the UN, President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to strike the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.

This disconnect between formal legal principle and state practice, as well as the dissonance between the Charter’s guiding principles of both sovereignty and humanity, creates more than just confusion in the international system. Rather, this gap poses a threat to the very legitimacy and capacity of international law to guide state behavior—risking casting international law into irrelevance as states act to promote both state interests and humanitarian principles.

Opposition to Humanitarian Intervention Under Current Law

Perhaps the most fundamental objection to a doctrine of humanitarian intervention under current international law is the subjective nature of determining the legitimacy of any such intervention—in essence, identifying true “humanitarian” crises necessitating the use of force. As noted by many commentators, the difficulty in identifying a just cause remains a significant stumbling block for the development of such a doctrine. One state’s “humanitarian” intervention is often another state’s aggression falsely justified under a humanitarian pretext.

This problem derives from the fact that current bases for humanitarian intervention, as conceived by proponents, rely upon ambiguously defined and implicitly quantitative measures of harm. The current “soft” Responsibility to Protect (R2P) framework, adopted under the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, embodies this ambiguity: In it, UN General Assembly members pledged to take action in cases of “genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” Determination of such crimes, of course, is itself a subjective exercise. What level of civilian atrocity rises to the legal threshold for such crimes: 100,000 deaths? 1,000? 100? What types of atrocities should trigger culpability? And most fundamentally, who should make the determination when triggering crimes occur?

A Qualitative Threshold for Humanitarian Intervention: Responses to CBW Attacks

The Syria crisis, and its associated instances of chemical and biological weapons (CBW) use against civilians, marks a key moment for scholars, statesmen, and practitioners to envision an improved legal framework on humanitarian intervention. The Trump administration’s repeated use of force in Syria, as well as its ongoing acceptance by the vast majority of states, points the way to the development of a qualitative-based legal threshold for unilateral humanitarian inventions: interventions in response to CBW use against civilians.

Instead of relying on ambiguous quantitative thresholds to determine legitimate interventions, the Syria strikes represent an opportunity to consider developing in the UN-system qualitative thresholds for authorizing unilateral humanitarian intervention in cases of Security Council paralysis. Such qualitative thresholds would capitalize on cases where there is little debate regarding the severity of humanitarian need or the interests of states in addressing it—cases such as CBW use against civilians.

As I explored in an earlier analysis, under such a framework, unilateral intervention in response to CBW attacks on civilians could be authorized and deemed legitimate under international law, even without approval by the full Security Council. To provide a further check against such a doctrine becoming a cover for illegitimate state aggression, this framework for R2P intervention against CBW use could require a further condition of approval by a super-majority of permanent Security Council members. Such a framework would ensure that a single vetoing state could not paralyze UN members’ actions against CBW-employing regimes.

Despite many scholars’ and states’ deeply ingrained opposition to a general doctrine of humanitarian intervention, such interventions have gained broader global support in particular cases. Witness the tacit acceptance by many non-Western governments of NATO’s “illegal but legitimate” intervention in Kosovo, or the widespread global support for the April 2017 U.S. strikes in Syria. These cases tell us that it is likely not humanitarian intervention per se that is generally problematic, but the potential for abuse of such doctrine under the current quantitative and subjective measures of assessment.

An official determination of CBW use against civilians, obviously an essential triggering finding under such a legal construct, would be a key procedural element that would need to be established in accordance with UN practice. Such a determination would likely need to be made by an independent, UN-established commission, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or some other body of qualified independent experts.

Such a condition, authorizing but not requiring the use of force, would have the normative benefit of giving the international community greater flexibility to stop CBW use against civilians and save innocent lives in cases of CBW atrocities, while also narrowly limiting contexts under which a single Security Council veto could be disregarded. Under this model, there would be little debate about the legality of the intent of force in response to a humanitarian crisis. Instead, the only issue for dispute would be the factual question of the act of CBW use itself. Such a framework could limit endless debates in the Security Council about whether the nature or harm to civilians rose to the threshold of “genocide” or “ethnic cleansing,” because numbers of deaths or the level of atrocities would not be relevant to the ultimate decision.

Such a framework could generate much greater support among positions traditionally skeptical of a humanitarian intervention doctrine. Many states would likely be more open to such a framework than a traditional doctrine of humanitarian intervention because it’s inherently limited in its scope. That’s because only a few states today possess CBW capability, therefore any such legal framework would pose little threat to states’ security or sovereignty. Additionally, the objective nature of the CBW standard would limit the abuse of the humanitarian criteria: States would find it difficult to justify aggressive interventions as “humanitarian,” as in the case of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. Additionally, this framework could gain greater support from legal formalists based on its bright line, its objective requirements for intervention, and its maintenance of the Security Council’s final role in the authorization of force.

Clearly the political challenges facing such a proposal are formidable. In its 72-year history, the UN has adopted few formal changes to its governing principles on the use of force. Even more daunting, the permanent members of the Security Council have little incentive to dilute their authority over authorizing state force. However, those promoting the Charter’s principle of humanity will find many reasons to support the broadening of international legal provisions to protect civilians. Similarly, those promoting the legitimacy and power of international law will find many reasons to support improving the law’s authority over state practice.

R2P supporters should thus work toward promoting legal principles authorizing unilateral intervention in cases of government CBW usage against civilians, gearing efforts toward beginning formal international consideration on adopting such a provision within the R2P framework—with an ultimate goal of securing adoption within the UN General Assembly and Security Council.

While the possibility of adoption of such a framework may be distant, the conversation associated with this debate could have lasting effects in shaping a currently broken UN system. Such a development could, in the long run, help to promote human rights, deter future CBW attacks, and ultimately strengthen the law’s ability to promote humanity and justice in the international system.

8,syria,"At Wednesday night’s Yad Vashem ceremony marking the start of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – if past speeches are a gauge – will touch on the theme that one of the lessons of the Holocaust is that Israel can, in the final analysis, only rely on itself.



If, as the Russians, Syrians, Iranians and even the Americans said on Monday, Israel was indeed responsible for the predawn attack on the T-4 airbase near Homs in Syria, it is a sign that Netanyahu means what he says every year in those speeches.

Syria claims U.S. launched missile strike on air base; Pentagon denies it, April 9, 2018 (Reuters)Netanyahu and senior members of his cabinet have warned repeatedly over the last number of months that Israel has red lines in Syria, and one of those is that it will not accept or allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence there.Russian President Vladimir Putin has listened politely to Netanyahu say this in any number of face-to-face meetings and telephone conversations but has done nothing to curb Iran’s advances inside Syria. On the contrary, he met last week in Ankara with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and seems to have begun carving up Syria among them.US President Donald Trump, too, has listened politely to Netanyahu talk about Israel’s concerns and red lines in Syria. Nevertheless, he announced last week his desire to bring the 2,000 US troops there back home as soon as possible, something that would leave a gaping vacuum inside Syria that Iran would be only too eager to fill.In other words, neither the US nor Russia is going to pull Israel’s coals out of the fire in Syria. If Israel is serious about preventing Iran from establishing a permanent military base there, it will have to do so by itself.If Israel did carry out Monday’s attack, it needs to be seen within the context of last week’s meeting in Ankara. The message in the attack is clear to all, especially the Iranians: Despite what you all may have agreed upon in Turkey, despite how you may have divided up the country among yourselves, Israel has interests and a say, and intends to act upon them.If indeed Israel did carry out the operation, the timing would also reveal something about its modus operandi: Don’t waste operational opportunities.When the Iranians tried to send a reconnaissance drone into Israel in February, Israel retaliated massively, using it as a justification for an attack that the IDF said destroyed nearly half of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s air defenses.Along those same lines, one should not be surprised if, at the end of the weeks of Hamas-orchestrated protests along the Israel-Gaza border, there will be numerous terrorists known to the IDF among the Palestinians killed. Following the first demonstrations 11 days ago, the IDF identified by name, rank and terrorist organization 10 of the 15 men killed.And following the suspected use by Assad of chemical weapons against a civilian population in Douma on Sunday – with the world, including the Russians, Iranians and Syrians concerned about a retaliatory US attack against the air base from which the chemical weapons originated – this provided another opportunity for Israel to act.Why now? Two reasons: First, because an airbase near Homs used by the Iranians would not be the first place to expect a strike following the alleged chemical attack by Assad’s forces in distant Douma. Second, because the world may be more forgiving – even accepting – of an attack on an airbase anywhere in Syria less than 24 hours after Assad allegedly used chemical weapons to gas men, women and children.Winston Churchill is said to have coined the expression “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Over the years, this has generally been applied to using diplomatic or economic crises to benefit one’s own agenda. Or, as Rahm Emanuel, US president Barack Obama’s chief of staff, said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”If Israel did indeed attack the airbase at T-4, then this adage may very well explain why.",The attack in Syria: 'Never waste a crisis',http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/The-attack-in-Syria-Never-waste-a-crisis-549355

With violence in several areas of Syria UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency today expresses its alarm at the civilian deaths this is causing as well as spiralling new displacement. This is on top of a humanitarian situation that is already desperate; Syrian civilians have more than suffered enough.

Of particular concern is the situation in Douma in Eastern Ghouta where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped. We estimate that more than 133,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta over the past four weeks. This is almost three times the number we reported on 20 March and includes some 45,000 people who are currently being accommodated in eight collective shelters in Rural Damascus. An estimated 44,000, mainly women, children and elderly have so far been allowed to leave the collective shelters after completion of their security screening. UNHCR teams are working with UN and NGO partners to help improve the conditions at these collective shelters, which remain congested. We continue to appeal to all parties to the conflict for proper protection of civilians, including freedom of movement and free choice over where to stay. Family unity must also be respected.

Since the outset of this emergency, as part of the wider UN response, UNHCR has been working to address the needs of the displaced. Our staff are paying daily visits to all the collective shelters where displaced people from Eastern Ghouta are accommodated, to assess needs and help address them. Overcrowded shelters and insufficient sanitation facilities are posing serious health risks. Common concerns we are hearing are a lack of civil documentation, restrictions on freedom of movement, family separation and SGBV risks.

UNHCR’s response to the Eastern Ghouta emergency encompasses the delivery of core relief items, shelter support and protection services. Nearly a quarter or a million urgently need aid, and more than 60,000 people have been reached so far. UNHCR is purchasing clothes locally as many people fled with nothing more than what they were wearing. In addition to a massive shelter effort, UNHCR protection partners have provided legal counseling to 22,000 people.

Meanwhile, we are facing similar challenges and concerns in responding to the humanitarian needs of more than 137,000 Syrians displaced from the Afrin region. Most are scattered across Tal Rifaat, Nubol, Zahraa and surrounding villages in northwest Aleppo, living in makeshift shelters, damaged or unfinished buildings, mosques, warehouses and open-spaces. Some 3,500 people are being accommodated in a tented camp in Fafin to the north of Aleppo. In addition we have distributed more than 1,400 kits for shelter rehabilitation and redeployed 1,000 UNHCR family-sized tents, for use as needed.

Displacement from Afrin has subsided and some returns to the city are taking place. The challenging journey back home for the displaced may take up to four days in some cases. Movements of displaced people towards Aleppo and other government-controlled areas continues to be constrained.

11,syria,"U.N. agencies report an alarming escalation of humanitarian needs in war-torn Syria as violence, displacement and the suffering of the Syrian people reach new heights.

While people throughout Syria are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and protection, U.N. agencies say they are particularly concerned about tens of thousands of civilians trapped in Douma, a town inside eastern Ghouta in the suburbs of Damascus.

Dozens of people reportedly were killed during an alleged chemical attack Saturday in Douma. Spokesman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Jens Laerke, says the United Nations has no access to eastern Ghouta, which is still under siege. He says the U.N. can neither confirm nor deny a chemical attack occurred.

“We are in a place outside of eastern Ghouta in those eight centers where we can provide some aid. We are not in eastern Ghouta. And for these, I should say extremely serious allegations with very severe ramifications - political, military and otherwise, we need to be absolutely sure that what we say is correct,” Laerke said.

The U.N. refugee agency reports more than 133,000 people have fled eastern Ghouta during the past four weeks. Spokesman Andre Mahecic says the UNHCR is working with U.N. and private agencies to help improve the sub-standard conditions at these collective shelters. He says the displaced are in great need of everything, as they have fled their homes with nothing.

“It is particularly difficult for women and children. As you can imagine. If you have only the clothes you wear, you have nowhere to wash them, you have nowhere to change, you have no way of keeping your personal hygiene. And this only adds to all of the risks that these people have been already exposed to and are currently exposed to in the congested shelters,” Mahecic said.

The UNHCR estimates 44,000 people - mainly women, children and the elderly - have completed their security screening and have been allowed to leave the collective shelters. The agency says no constraints should be put on the freedom of movement of civilians. It says they should be free to choose where they wish to go once they leave the centers.",UN: Suffering of Syrian Civilians Reaches New Heights,https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-ghouta-douma-humanitarian-situation/4340403.html
12,syria,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol on Tuesday warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours.

Eurocontrol said that air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles could be used within that period and there was a possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Western allies are discussing possible military action to punish Syria’s President Bashar Assad for a suspected poison gas attack on Saturday on a rebel-held town that long had held out against government forces.

Trump on Tuesday canceled a planned trip to Latin America later this week to focus instead on responding to the Syria incident, the White House said. Trump had on Monday warned of a quick, forceful response once responsibility for the Syria attack was established.

The Eurocontrol warning on its website did not specify the origin of any potential missile threat.

“Due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria with air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles within the next 72 hours, and the possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment, due consideration needs to be taken when planning flight operations in the Eastern Mediterranean/Nicosia FIR area,” it said, referring to the designated airspace.

Aviation regulators in countries including the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany have previously issued warnings against airlines entering Syrian airspace leading most carriers to avoid the area.

The only commercial flights above Syria as of 1:15 am GMT on Wednesday were being flown by Syrian Air and Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.

The Eurocontrol statement included a broader area outside the airspace controlled by Damascus.

The Nicosia flight information region named in the Eurocontrol statement on Tuesday covers the island of Cyprus and surrounding waters, according to a map on the agency’s website. The same map did not designate any specific territory as being the “Eastern Mediterranean” region.

There has been heightened awareness by regulators and airlines of the risks that conflict zones pose to commercial jets since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board.

Last year, North Korea tested missiles without warning, leading some airlines to re-route flights to avoid portions of the Sea of Japan.

13,syria,"National security adviser John Bolton was supposed to lead a White House meeting of the president’s national security team on Monday afternoon, but a surprise visitor showed up and took the reins instead: Mike Pence.

The vice president doesn’t often attend the White House’s Principals Committee meetings, which are typically led by the national security adviser, but Pence guided Monday’s discussion as President Donald Trump’s senior aides debated how to respond to a gruesome chemical weapons attack in Syria, according to four senior administration officials.

Story Continued Below

Pence’s attendance wasn’t listed on his public schedule. Although some meeting attendees viewed his appearance as an attempt to upstage Bolton on his first day as national security adviser, others saw it as an effort by the vice president to offer a steadying hand as Trump confronts a thorny national security dilemma with a foreign policy team in flux and amid the distraction of multiple investigations.

A White House official said the vice president attended the meeting in the president’s place, though the president’s attendance would have turned the gathering into a meeting of his National Security Council — a formal distinction previous administrations have closely adhered to. The same official said Pence has chaired Principals Committee meetings before.

Trump, who has promised that Syrian President Bashar Assad will pay a “big price” for the latest attack, is balancing his public threats to punish Assad with the possibility that airstrikes against Syria could kill Russian soldiers there and create a dangerous crisis with Moscow.

Trump’s national security team is rehashing a debate based on the parameters set forth by the president a year ago when he ordered airstrikes after a chemical weapons attack last April, and administration officials said the president feels strongly that the use of chemicals weapons is a type of barbarism the U.S. cannot tolerate. But foreign policy analysts say the administration has yet to find a way to fundamentally shift the dynamics.

“When he ordered that strike, he in essence bought on to the Obama red line,” said Eric Edelman, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration, referring to the previous administration’s threat — empty, as it turned out — that the use of chemical weapons would spur the U.S. to action. “So now he’s bought on to that red line, he’s gotta enforce it,” Edelman said of Trump.

The president is facing the crisis surrounded by some new faces, like Bolton — and without many old ones, including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, who announced his resignation on Sunday.

The White House said Tuesday that homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert, who has been with the president from the beginning, plans to leave the White House in the coming weeks. And Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo, a trusted Trump adviser, is preparing for his confirmation hearings on Thursday.

The president was briefed on the options put forward by his advisers in Monday's principal's committee meeting, according to a senior administration official. The president has also consulted with French President Emmanuel Macron and, on Tuesday, with British Prime Minister Theresa May.

On Tuesday morning, the White House abruptly announced that Trump would no longer be taking a planned trip to South America this weekend, opting instead to stay in Washington to oversee the Syria situation. Pence will travel to Lima, Peru, instead.

The Syria crisis coincides with the escalation of myriad investigations surrounding Trump’s closest associates, diverting Trump’s attention and sapping his emotion. The FBI raided the office and hotel room of Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Monday, setting off fears inside the White House that the president may move to fire senior Justice Department officials or special counsel Robert Mueller.

The president addressed the raids on Monday night before a meeting with senior military leaders, calling them “an attack on our country.”

“It’s an attack on what we all stand for,” he said. “And here we are talking about Syria and we’re talking about a lot of serious things.”

Trump's critics say his threats may force the U.S. to ill-considered action.

“Trump has boxed himself in. Having chosen a limited strike last year in an attempt to establish deterrence against chemical weapons use, he faces pressure to engage in a larger strike now that deterrence has failed,” said Colin Kahl, who served as national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has pushed the president and other White House aides — sometimes, to the point of frustration and anger — to look past what military officials call the “spray and pray” option to consider what the U.S. is trying to achieve in Syria and whether it has a plan to achieve those aims. A Pentagon spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

James Jeffrey, who worked closely with Mattis as ambassador to Iraq during Mattis’ tenure as head of Central Command, suggested two reasons why the defense secretary might be reluctant to go ahead with strikes.

“Mattis will not want a strike if it doesn’t combine with an overall strategy toward Syria, which this administration does not have,” Jeffrey said.

Edelman, the former Bush administration official, said that last year's Syria strike “wasn’t embedded into an overall strategy on Syria,” which is problematic because it hasn’t deterred Assad from using chemical weapons. “So now the question is how do you establish deterrence? It has to be more painful than the last strike.”

Jeffrey said Mattis may also be trying to reserve military resources and attention for a potential conflict with North Korea — one that aggressive action in Syria might give the North Koreans an opening to precipitate. “As long as a North Korean ICBM capability is on the table, Mattis will not want to be diverted in the Middle East into something that could escalate into a broader regional conflict with Iran,” Jeffrey said.

Others, including some of the president’s informal advisers, are pushing for a much more forceful military response than the limited strike on a Syrian airfield last year aimed at deterring further use of poison gas.

“That has failed,” said retired Army Gen. Jack Keane. “Deterrence is no longer feasible. You have to stop the use of chemical weapons. The only way to make that happen is to destroy the delivery systems or the chemicals themselves — or both.”

That includes the aircraft and helicopters the Syrian army has used to launch the chemical attacks, he said.

“I think [Assad] has about six operational airfields,” Keane added. “It is not as big as it sounds.”

But he acknowledged the presence of Russian technicians at those airfields and is calling on the Trump administration, “if they haven’t already, to tell the Russians all those bases are vulnerable to be struck” and that Moscow should remove its personnel.

He does not believe that Russia wants a bigger fight with United States. Yet there would be other risks to a more aggressive U.S. military response because it would likely require American warplanes — not just cruise missiles fired from ships at sea like last time. “We would have to penetrate Syrian air defenses to do it.”

But Keane said he believes there is a strong reluctance among the Pentagon leadership, including Mattis, to take such aggressive action, for fearing of the conflict spinning out of control.

“They have a minimalist view,” he told POLITICO. “We have to have the spine to stand up for civilization and against the use of chemical weapons to kill men, women and children. We have the means to stop it, and stop it we should.”

14,syria,"HUMANITARIAN aid workers in Syria are struggling to provide emergency relief to civilians in some of the most brutal areas of conflict, owing to mass evacuations ordered by the Syrian government, an aid agency has said.

The advocacy officer for Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon at Christian Aid, Máiréad Collins, said this week that some staff members of its NGO partners on the ground in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus, have been forced to evacuate to government-run IDP camps, which are miles outside of the region.

The aid workers fear that they might be perceived as being “enemies of the Government” because of their NGO status, she said. All men over the age of 15 are unable to leave the camps because their identification has been seized by government security forces.

Hundreds of civilians, including children, have been killed by air strikes conducted by Syrian government forces on the city of Eastern Ghouta over the past month (News, 29 March, 2 March). Some were aided by Russian fighter jets.

But while shelling has lulled in the area in recent weeks, residents have been unable to remain in their homes, Ms Collins warned.

“The people are not being given a choice — it has been described as a humanitarian situation but many people wanted to stay. The option to stay safely has not been given to them.

“[It is] not just the fighting between various groups, and the shelling, but what situation they would face them when the Syrian Government and Russia security forces do come in. It is very uncertain.”

Some residents of Eastern Ghouta have gone to Damascus to stay with family, she said, but “these families are already struggling, so they are not going into a good situation”.

Most of the people of Eastern Ghouta have been sent to Idlib, in northwestern Syria, which remains in the control of rebel groups. Ms Collins fears that this evacuation might cause a “secondary crisis” because of displacement, overcrowding, and outbreaks of violence.

A further 137,000 civilians have been displaced to Idlib from Afrin, an area in the north of the country which has recently been infiltrated by Turkey. Idlib has been referred to as a “perfect kill box” by those who fear that it might become the “next Aleppo”, Ms Colins said.

World Vision have also called on world leaders to recognise the escalating crisis in the city. Its Syria crisis response director, Wynn Flaten, said: “Idlib is extremely overloaded — medical services, clean water and sanitation are becoming more scarce. There are very few schools, and shelter is inadequate. As the crisis goes on, children are facing greater and greater devastation.

“We are calling on the international community to ensure an end to the violence, and a peaceful future for Syria’s children. Humanitarian organisations urgently need access to some of the worst-affected areas, and their safety must be guaranteed by all parties to the conflict.”

The leaders of Russia, Iran, and Turkey met in Ankara this week, without the United States, to discuss a new constitution for Syria, including increasing security in “de-escalation” zones across the country, it has been reported.

The summit on Wednesday brought together the most forceful supporters of President Bashar al-Assad — the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei — with its strongest opponent, the President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan.

It came after the President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced that he would be suspending funds for a planned $200-million stabilisation project in Syria. President Trump also hinted this week that US troops would be withdrawn from the country. There are about 2000 US troops fighting the Islamic State in Syria.

Ms Collins said of the meeting: “The fact that the talks do not include the opposition is problematic; without them it will be very hard to reach a negotiated peace.

“With Syria, there are so many hands in the game and at no point are any of them interested in the protection of the Syrian people. The Syrian people are never at the heart of any of the decisions that leaders are making or have made in the past.”

She concluded: “Civilian protection has to be at the heart of any talks and agreements made.”

The seventh anniversary of the Syrian uprising fell last month. More than 400,000 people have since been killed, including nearly 20,000 children. More than six million Syrians have been internally displaced, and a further six million have crossed the borders into neighbouring countries.

In an interview last week with the Roman Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need, the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop of Homs and Hama, Selwanos Petros Al-Nemeh, lamented the exodus of about half of Christians from Syria since 2011.

“Christians would love to stay and be bound to their country because this is their land,” he said. “What is preventing them from staying is the instability in their work, the insecurity and vulnerability that they are facing, economic difficulties, and dreadful living conditions.”

Residents of the city of Homs were “bewildered by the immensity of the damage” there, and the struggle to get help, he said. “We need a lot of support to rebuild and allow people to return.”",Humanitarian aid agencies call for access to worst-hit parts of Syria,https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/13-april/news/world/humanitarian-aid-agencies-call-for-access-to-worst-hit-parts-of-syria

More than 400,000 dead since 2011. Men, women and children. Dead from chemical-weapons attacks, but also dead from barrel bombings, gunshots, torture, starvation. Dead from routine illnesses and injuries untreated because more than half the country’s public hospitals are damaged or shuttered. Dead while trying to reach safety.

And of the living, some 6 million — half the population — forced to flee their homes.

The country, once a flourishing crossroads for commerce, is now the site of proxy wars between the U.S. and multiple jihadi groups. Between the U.S. and Iran, Israel and Hezbollah, Turkey and the Kurds, and even the U.S. and Russia.

Why? Because Syria’s strongman ruler, Bashar al-Assad, was and remains quite willing to lay waste to his country to save his own regime. Extremist groups of many stripes are eager to exploit the conflict for their own purposes. And every power with the ability to intervene — Syria’s neighbors, Iran, Russia, Europe, and the U.S. under successive administrations — judges its interests in Syria to be both more important than stopping the killing, and less important than the effort it would take to impose and keep a peace.

That is the plain and unattractive truth. Nobody comes off looking good, except the Syrian civilians and their humanitarian helpers who still try to feed families, tend the sick, bury the dead, shelter the refugees, and record the atrocities for history, if not for justice.

So does it matter if Assad uses chemical weapons, again? Do the ghastly deaths of babies have any meaning?

Maybe. Maybe, at minimum, the norm against using chemical weapons can be upheld. Maybe “punishment” by the U.S. and its allies will deter others from using chemicals on other civilians, other children. That seems to be the thinking of the French, the Trump administration, and others calling for retaliatory strikes.

But maybe not. To all appearances, Assad has continued to use chemical weapons unhindered since the last time the United States launched a retaliatory strike one year ago. Human Rights Watch has documented at least five likely uses of chemical weapons by the Syrian government just since November 2017. And since the August 2013 attack that prompted the Obama administration to declare that its red line had been crossed, Human Rights Watch confirms 85 chemical-weapons attacks, the majority traceable to the Assad regime.

Assad — and his adversaries, and others, like the Russia-attributed attack on a former spy and his daughter in England last month — uses chemical weapons exactly because of the terror they produce, because of the awful pictures. They communicate to the living, to those who are not in rebellion: don’t even think about it.

Pinprick missile strikes won’t change that calculus. The presence or absence of U.S. troops on the other side of Syria doesn’t do much to change it either. Trump’s angry tweets aside, the debate over Syria policy that has been ripping up Washington in recent weeks is almost totally irrelevant to the lives of civilians under Assad’s rule.

Washington could do three things to help ease the suffering of Syrians and bring some energy to the stalled, broken search for an end to the fighting. All are deeply unsatisfying. But each, for the cost of a few cruise missiles, would alter thousands of lives for the better.

First, get back to saving the “easy” lives by supporting refugees and displaced people. The Trump administration has pulled the United States out of global coordination on where to send refugees and cut and threatened to cut off U.S. support for overwhelmed UN refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, and elsewhere. And his decision to slash U.S. refugee admissions by more than half — and admissions of Muslims even more drastically — is a godsend to every other government that wants to refuse to do its share.

Second, prevent mass killing from recurring in areas where it has been stopped. The debate over whether or not U.S. troops stay in eastern Syria is the wrong one. The question is how the areas from which ISIS and other jihadi groups have been driven can rebuild security and basic institutions that can resist the urge to be drawn back into violence. Local leaders want to do that, and humanitarian groups like Mercy Corps have detailed proposals for how international civilians can help. If the best the world can do is support Syrians in establishing territories where hospitals operate, terrorists don’t plot, civilians don’t flee, and babies breathe safely, this would be how. But no such plan is on the table in Washington, where the debate imagines that either the U.S. plays no role or that the U.S. military is in charge of reconstruction.

Third, many of the multiple conflicts now playing out in Syria will have to be settled at the negotiating table. Washington has chosen largely to withdraw from the fray — the post of special envoy for Syria is one of many empty diplomatic slots in the State Department — but there is much it could do. The biggest outside actors in Syria, who prop up Assad and even help him kill civilians, are Russia and Iran. Washington is wasting his leverage with its inattention, conflicting policies, and unfulfilled threats. But the Trump administration still has plenty of tools to deploy, and not just military ones, to pressure Moscow and Tehran to rein Assad in; reconvene more productive peace talks; or even do more to mediate between our Turkish NATO allies and the Kurdish forces we empowered, who are on the edge of all-out conflict in the parts of Syria where ISIS has been driven out.

Doing that would require discipline and long-term focus; willingness to think smartly about non-military tools, instead of reflexively toggling between bombs and nothing; and keeping our focus on living Syrian babies every day rather than on dead Syrian babies occasionally. President Trump is terrible at this. But he’s not alone.",The Moral High Ground on Syria Is Empty,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/the-moral-high-ground-on-syria-is-empty.html
17,syria,"The move raised eyebrows among some Latin America specialists, who contended that it constituted a major snub of an important region by a president already held in low regard there, and wasted a chance to assert the United States’ leadership as China looks to broaden its role in the region.

“Trump’s dropping out of the Lima summit is an appalling demonstration of disrespect for Latin America,” said Richard E. Feinberg, a senior Latin America fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor at the University of California San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.

“This has to be seen in the context of a president who has been ranting and railing against Latin America continually for the last several years,” Mr. Feinberg added. “They’re his bête noire. They’re his scapegoat for everything that’s wrong in America, from immigration to narcotics to alleged loss of jobs from trade.”

Mr. Trump was to have traveled to Lima on Friday, and then on to Bogotá for meetings with President Juan Manuel Santos, who is now scheduled to meet with Mr. Pence on the sidelines of the gathering in Peru.

Mr. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., last year when he ordered missile strikes in Syria in response to a chemical attack by government forces. And in 2011, President Barack Obama went ahead with a trip to Brazil while American forces were striking Libya. But White House officials argued that Mr. Trump felt strongly about remaining on United States soil as the situation in Syria unfolded.

The decision appeared to have taken even some senior White House officials by surprise. Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was unaware of the president’s new plans when he told a conservative radio host on Tuesday morning that he would be traveling with Mr. Trump to Latin America this week. He said Mr. Trump would be able to “compartmentalize.”

There were plenty of reasons for Mr. Trump to dread the trip to South America, which promised to include considerable behind-the-scenes friction and little of the flattering pomp and ceremony that he relishes — and to which he was treated during visits last year to Saudi Arabia and China.

The president’s approval rating in Latin America is extraordinarily low, and leaders there have been insulted by his anti-immigrant talk and alarmed by his threats to use military force in Venezuela. The White House had already scaled back Mr. Trump’s trip, trimming what was initially intended as a five-day visit to one that involved fewer than three days on the ground.

Mr. Trump had planned to use that brief time to seek consensus on how to handle the crisis in Venezuela and press his case for better trade deals with Latin American nations. The president’s advisers had played down expectations for major advances during the trip, including saying it was unlikely to produce any breakthroughs on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

They had left open the question of whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, with whom he has had a stormy relationship. The two have clashed on the phone over Mr. Trump’s promises to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and the latest such altercation led them to cancel a tentatively planned visit by Mr. Peña Nieto to the White House in March.

More recently, Mr. Peña Nieto has taken umbrage at Mr. Trump’s decision last week to send National Guard troops to patrol the southern border.

Mr. Obama used the last Summit of the Americas — which brings together 35 countries every three years — to burnish the United States’ image in the hemisphere, holding a historic meeting with President Raúl Castro of Cuba as he pushed to normalize relations with Havana for the first time in a half-century. Mr. Trump has moved to reverse that policy, and critics said his absence in Lima would have broad consequences.

“Skipping the Summit of the Americas sends a terrible message about U.S. disengagement in our hemisphere, compounding negative message of Trump’s Cuba, NAFTA and immigration policies,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, who served as a deputy national security adviser in Mr. Obama’s White House, wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Rhodes said that the United States would have to work with partners in the hemisphere to address the crisis in Venezuela, and that sitting out the summit meeting “just made that harder.”","Trump Cancels Trip to Latin America, Citing Crisis in Syria",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-cancels-trip-latin-america-crisis-syria.html

20,syria,"Prime minister tells his nation: our reaction to Douma atrocity will define who we are

The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has called for a “strong, united and resolute” reaction from the international community to the chemical attack in Douma, a Syrian rebel-held town on the outskirts of Damascus.

Philippe said Paris’s response to the attack – currently being decided – would define France as a nation. “The use of these weapons is not neutral; it says things about the regime and our reaction to the use of these weapons will say things about who we are,” he told parliament.

Philippe said allies of the Syrian regime bore “particular responsibility in this massacre”, alluding to Russia.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly promised that proven chemical weapons use is a “red line” that would prompt French strikes on Syrian government forces, and that Paris is prepared to act alone.

Last summer, a freshly elected Macron sat on the sunny terrace of the Élysée Palace and told the Guardian: “When you fix red lines, if you don’t know how to make sure they are respected, you’re choosing to be weak. That’s not my choice.”

He added: “If chemical weapons are used on the ground and we know how to find out their provenance, France will launch strikes to destroy the chemical weapons stocks.”

Syria has provided Macron with his red line moment. Barack Obama’s red line over Syrian chemical weapons in 2013, and his lack of intervention, came at a time when France’s then president, the socialist François Hollande, had wanted to act but would not go it alone.

Macron’s electorate has always seen his most positive quality as his perceived strength on the international stage. On the home front he is facing difficult strikes over a reshaping of the railways and the government has vowed to stand firm. Internationally, as he has often said, France cannot show weakness.

Macron has been at pains to style himself as a man of his word. “On every issue, I do what I say, and that’s something new,” he promised this autumn, attempting to claim the moral high ground over career politicians’ doublespeak.

A French military response would depend on its intelligence proving both the use of deadly chemical agents by the Syrian regime, and fatalities. Although France would be prepared to strike Syria alone – and recently defence sources said it was logistically possible – it is much more likely to act alongside the US and other international partners. Macron has previously said France would be “perfectly aligned with the US” on this issue and he has spoken to Donald Trump by phone every day recently.

But the pressing question for France is what form any military action might take: what kind of strikes are possible and with what long-term aim? Macron criticised the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy’s Libya intervention in 2011 and the mess it left. He has stressed he does not want a “failed state” or “neoconservative” interventions abroad. He has altered France’s conditions for talks on Syria’s future, saying the deposing of the president, Bashar al-Assad, is not a prerequisite, but the Syria question remains his toughest foreign policy challenge.



French public opinion is already sensitive to airstrikes that could be perceived as making little difference. “We can no longer be content with symbolic strikes, there have to be efficient strikes that show not only our resolve but that the point of no return has been established,” Jean-Paul Paloméros, the former French air force chief of staff, said on Tuesday.

The issue of airstrikes is more complex now than when France wanted to intervene with the US in 2013, because of Russia’s presence and Iran’s role. Paloméros said time was needed for careful strategising. He argued that France needed to plan how to “go far enough without going too far”.",France calls for strong and united response to Syria chemical attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/will-emmanuel-macron-enforce-red-line-syria-chemical-attack

John Bolton takes over as national security adviser today in the midst of a new national security crisis: another chemical attack in Syria. President Trump responded with strongly worded tweets blaming both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warning there would be a “big price to pay.”

Bolton is known for his hawkish views and general belief that the United States should use military power preemptively. Trump’s views on conflicts like that in Syria have been inconsistent, even contradictory. As recently as last week, the president was apparently disagreeing with his own Pentagon when he said the United States should get out of Syria immediately. Yet one of his tweets during the weekend implied that stronger U.S. action might have stopped Assad.

But that’s only the latest crisis. Bolton and the Trump administration will also be confronting the looming diplomatic encounter with North Korea and ongoing challenges like the war in Afghanistan and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. As they do so, keep this basic point in mind: In many of these regional conflicts, the United States has a limited amount of leverage or is at the mercy of forces beyond its control.

That doesn’t mean the United States has no power, or that individuals like Bolton and Trump don’t matter; my book about how presidents shape military interventions argues that they do. But international relations scholars know well that international forces and other countries’ interests and domestic politics can be powerful constraints on what the United States can do to shape events, particularly in regional conflicts. That’s important to remember in the constant ebb and flow of news.

Several recent TMC posts examine those constraints in different parts of the world. Let’s take a look.

China will have a big say in what happens next with North Korea

After Trump’s announcement that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, China and North Korea had a surprise of their own to unleash: Kim made a secretive visit to Beijing. Here at TMC, Rush Doshi explored three takeaways from the meeting. Doshi concludes, “Beijing has strong incentives to push for full involvement in the forthcoming talks. Diplomacy over North Korean denuclearization remains fluid and volatile, but one thing remains clear: Xi Jinping won’t be content to stay on the sidelines.”

China itself has a complex and volatile relationship with North Korea. But whatever Bolton’s and ultimately Trump’s plans for North Korea, they must account for China’s increasingly active role.

Regional conflicts have their own internal dynamics that resist U.S. intervention

Recently, there has been renewed talk of a peace settlement in Afghanistan, where much to Trump’s apparent chagrin, U.S. forces remain on the ground. But how likely is a peace deal?

As Asfandyar Mir lays out clearly in his recent Monkey Cage post, internal dynamics and domestic politics within Afghanistan could derail peace at any step: during negotiations, defining exactly what a deal would look like, dealing with spoilers, putting a deal into force and, finally, possibly spilling back into civil war. The United States has little power to change most of these factors. Indeed, as Greg Jaffe recently wrote at The Post, top military officials now talk about “winning” in conflicts like Afghanistan not in terms of outright victory, but in keeping a permanent presence, an “infinite war.”

Many of Mir’s points about Afghanistan probably also apply to Syria, where realistic military options are hard to identify. Last year, after another alleged chemical attack, the United States struck Syria with a cruise missile. Marc Lynch wrote here that the strike alone wouldn’t shift the overall strategic stalemate in Syria. There is little reason to imagine things are much different this time.

Bolton’s hawkish views come from the era of unchallenged U.S. power after the Cold War — which is coming to an end

Bolton is best known for serving in the George W. Bush administration, when U.S. military power was largely unchallenged. As Joshua Shifrinson argued here at the Monkey Cage, “In an age of overwhelming U.S. military dominance, there is no other country to push back when the United States gets aggressive. As a result, militant and assertive views have more scope to shape policy.” Bolton’s hawkish views are partly a symptom of post-Cold War U.S. world dominance.

Shifrinson concludes that other countries like China may be challenging U.S. economic power, but that the United States still has a clear military advantage. That might make military force look more attractive to many in the White House, “because that is where the United States outcompetes the rest of the world.” Thus, “with U.S. power dominant but waning, Bolton’s elevation reminds us there are few limits to — and some momentum behind — a militaristic U.S. foreign policy.”

Alliances and diplomacy remain important for addressing regional conflicts

Trump and Bolton both appear to disdain alliances and many forms of diplomacy. But the ongoing challenges facing the United States show how important these tools can be.

For example, Stephan Haggard explained here how sanctions have actually worked to bring the confrontation with North Korea to this point. Multilateral coordination, always difficult with sanctions, turned out to be crucial. As Haggard notes, “The concerns now rest with a U.S. administration prone to grand gestures but with a foreign policy bench depleted to some extent by turnover. The United States faces the challenge of coordinating at the multilateral level and with China to maintain the sanctions pressure that will lead to talks.”

Although David Bosco recently argued here that Bolton has an underappreciated record of multilateralism, neither Bolton nor Trump is known for the kind of repeated, patient diplomacy Haggard suggests will be crucial for successful North Korea talks. Indeed, as Mira Rapp-Hooper has pointed out in several pieces here, Trump’s threats against North Korea have more often harmed U.S. alliances than changed the dynamics with Kim.

Taken together, these arguments have a sobering message for the president and his new national security adviser. Trump and Bolton will certainly put their own stamp on U.S. policy over the next few months. But they’ll have to contend with a host of complicated forces beyond their control, and will have less power to shape other regions’ conflicts than they may wish. The United States has had to relearn this lesson many times — often painfully, especially in the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.","Bolton starts today, with a Syria crisis on the agenda.

22,syria,"An attempt to stave off a military confrontation in Syria failed in the UN security council on Tuesday evening, with Russia and western allies unable to compromise on a concerted international response to the use of chemical weapons.

Each side voted against the other’s proposals for setting up a body dedicated to investigating repeated poison gas use in Syria. The US delegation said it had done “everything possible” to accommodate Russian views and that the abortive council session marked a “decisive moment”. Russia said the issue was being used by the US and its allies as a “pretext” to attack Syria.

US, France and Britain agree to respond to Syrian gas attack Read more

The US, UK and France continued to make preparations for military action intended to punish the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which they say is responsible for the latest chemical weapons attack, on the Damascus suburb of Douma on 7 April, killing more than 45 people.

The rising tensions and the dramatic risks of a clash between the major powers was evident in the eastern Mediterranean, where Russian warplanes overflew US and French naval vessels armed with cruise missiles.

Inspectors from the watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) were planning to travel to Syria after receiving an invitation from the Assad regime, but it was unclear whether they would be allowed to reach Douma, and whether their presence there would delay US-led military action.

Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May held phone consultations on Tuesday. Macron told reporters in Paris later that a decision would be made in the coming days following “exchanges of technical and strategic information with our partners, in particular Britain and America”. He said that if airstrikes came, they would target Syrian government chemical facilities.

Macron made the remarks at a Paris press conference alongside the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who offered his country’s support for US-led military action. “If our alliance with our partners requires it, we will be present,” the Saudi leader said, wrapping up a three-day visit to Paris.

Russia’s credibility as a member of the council is now in question Karen Pierce, UK ambassador to the UN

Trump cancelled plans to travel to Peru for a Summit of the Americas, sending his vice-president, Mike Pence, in his place, and the US defence secretary, James Mattis, also cancelled engagements that had been scheduled for the weekend.

In London, May convened a meeting of her national security council, where there is strong support from her most senior ministers for military action.

A Downing Street statement suggested some UK caution by continuing to state the chemical weapons attack had not yet been confirmed.

The US and its European allies have accused the Assad regime of being behind the attack in the rebel-held area of Douma, but Russian officials have claimed that no trace of chemical weapons could be found at the site, and argued that the attack either never took place or was staged by rebels to provide a pretext for western military intervention.

After Trump hinted heavily on Monday that he was on the verge of ordering airstrikes, the US-Russian struggle shifted back once more to the UN security council. Both sides promoted rival resolutions, but compromise was never expected between entrenched positions.

Russia vetoed a US resolution creating a new independent investigative mechanism for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, arguing that it would become a propaganda tool of the west.

Trump says Syria decision imminent as Russia warns of 'grave repercussions' Read more

The Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said the resolution had been designed to fail. “They hope the decision will not pass,” Nebenzai told the council chamber. “This is what they want … in order to justify the use of force against Syria.

“If you take the decision to carry out an illegal military adventure – and we do hope that you will come to your senses – then you will have to bear responsibility for it yourselves.”

Only Bolivia voted with Russia, and China abstained. The 12 other members supported the US initiative. A Russian counter-proposal, establishing an investigative mechanism but leaving final decisions on whom to blame for chemical weapons to the security council, failed to win enough votes in the council.

France described the Russian proposal as a “smokescreen” intended to give cover to the Damascus regime.

“Allowing people to use chemical weapons allows the genie of weapons of mass destruction out of the bottle, and weapons of mass destruction pose an existential threat to all us,” the French envoy, François Delattre, said.

After the vote, Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the UN, said: “Russia’s credibility as a member of the council is now in question.” She added: “We will not stand idly by and watch Russia continue to undermine global norms which have ensured all our security, including Russia’s, for decades. As a [permanent council] member, the United Kingdom will stand up for international peace and security. It is our moral duty.”

By convention, British prime ministers cannot send UK forces into combat action without an explicit vote of MPs. May is aware David Cameron was humiliated when he lost a Commons vote to take military action in 2013 to punish Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Her leadership might not survive a similar defeat.

In anticipation of airstrikes, the Syrian regime is reported to be moving its aircraft to the Russian base at Latakia, presumably in the expectation that they would be safe from destruction there. The US may be intent on grounding as much of the Syrian air force as possible, but will not wish to destroy Russian planes.

The US navy has less firepower in the eastern Mediterranean than it did when Trump ordered punitive missile strikes for chemical weapons use in April last year.

Now there is only one guided missile destroyer, armed with the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in April – the USS Donald Cook, which left the Cypriot port of Larnaca on Monday.

Its twin, the USS Porter, which took part in the last Tomahawk attack, is on a port visit to Cherbourg, France. Another missile cruiser of the same class, the USS Ross, has just completed exercises with the Royal Navy and left Plymouth on Sunday. It would take a few days to come within range. The USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier and its battle group are due to leave Virginia on Wednesday, reportedly bound for the Mediterranean, but it would take several days to reach the Syrian coast.

However, the USS Cook is being accompanied in the area by the French frigate Aquitaine, armed with cruise missiles, which was reported in the French press to have been buzzed by low-flying Russian warplanes over the weekend.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that Trump will not attend the 8th Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru or travel to Bogota, Colombia, as planned, remaining in the United States to “oversee the American response to Syria and to monitor developments around the world.”

The president’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, urged Trump to skip the trip, an official said. This reflects a view in the White House that deeper Russian and Iranian involvement in Syria have complicated calculations about a response to any U.S. military attack, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Moscow has cautioned the U.S. not to launch a military attack.

Trump’s decision to skip the South America trip marks the first time an American president has not attended the summit. Vice-President Mike Pence will travel in Trump’s place, attending the summit in Lima but not travelling to Colombia.

WATCH: Trump threatens military strike against Syria

The international chemical weapons watchdog said it will send “shortly” a fact-finding mission to the Syrian town where the suspected gas attack took place, after receiving a request from the Syrian government and its Russian backers to investigate the allegations. It was not immediately clear whether the announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would delay or avert U.S. military action against Syria.

In New York, U.N. Security Council diplomats said the United States called for a vote on a resolution that would condemn the continuing use of chemical weapons in Syria “in the strongest terms” and establish a new body to determine responsibility for chemical attacks. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of an announcement, said the U.S. asked for a midafternoon vote.

Trump on Monday promised a decision on Syria within hours, although he did not say when a decision would be implemented. He declared that Russia or any other nation found to share responsibility for Saturday’s apparent chemical weapons attack on civilians will “pay a price.”

Amid the tough talk from the White House, the U.S. military appeared to be in position to carry out any attack order. A Navy destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, got underway in the eastern Mediterranean on Monday after completing a port call in Cyprus. The guided missile destroyer is armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, the weapon of choice in a U.S. attack one year ago on an airfield in Syria following an alleged sarin gas attack on civilians.

Also, the Navy said the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its strike group will depart Norfolk, Virginia, on Wednesday for a regularly scheduled deployment to Europe. The Navy does not currently have a carrier in the Persian Gulf.

The White House sharply rejected any suggestion that Trump’s own words about pulling U.S. troops out of Syria had opened the door for the attack, which killed more than 40 people, including children.

Trump, asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin bore any responsibility, responded, “He may, yeah, he may. And if he does it’s going to be very tough, very tough.” He added, “Everybody’s gonna pay a price. He will. Everybody will.”

The Russian military, which has a presence in Syria as a key Assad ally, said its officers had visited the weekend site in a suburb of Damascus, the Syrian capital, and found no evidence to back up reports of poison gas being used. Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, accused Washington of deliberately stoking international tensions by threatening Russia in a tone “beyond the threshold of what is acceptable, even during the Cold War.”

Trump said there was little question that Syria was responsible for the apparent weekend attack, although the government of President Bashar Assad denied it. “To me there’s not much of a doubt, but the generals will figure it out,” Trump said.

He promised a decision on a possible military response within 24 to 48 hours, “probably by the end of today.”

Emphatic in his condemnation of the apparent gas attack, Trump noted graphic pictures of the dead and sickened, calling the assault “heinous,” “atrocious,” “horrible” and “barbaric.”

Fielding questions at the White House on Monday, Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders said it would be “outrageous” to say that Trump’s recent announcement that he intends to remove all U.S. forces from Syria in the coming months had emboldened Assad. “I think that it is outrageous to say that the president of the United States green-lit something as atrocious as the actions that have taken place over the last several days,” she said.

Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, in separate remarks at the Pentagon, also suggested Moscow bore some blame. He criticized Russia for what he suggested was its failure to ensure the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal under terms of a 2013 agreement.

Trump said, “If it’s Russia, if it’s Syria, if it’s Iran, if it’s all of them together, we’ll figure it out.”

An American official said the U.S. was discussing with allies whether they would participate in a retaliatory strike. If Trump decides to proceed quickly, the most likely partner would be France rather than Britain, because of concerns about obtaining permission from Parliament, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the planning publicly and requested anonymity.

As U.S. officials consider whether and how to respond, they are looking at what type of chemical agent might have been used. When Trump ordered airstrikes last year after a chemical weapons attack, it was a response to the use of sarin gas, which is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria has signed. An attack with chlorine, which can be used as a weapon but is not outright banned by the treaty, could raise precedent issues, as there have been numerous recent allegations of chlorine attacks in Syria that have drawn no response from the Trump administration.

24,syria,"The Syrian civil war has fast become the Syrian war: Russia and the Assad regime accused Israel Monday of striking a military airport where Iran is known to operate, reportedly killing 14 people. The assault came a day after the U.S. and France, in a statement, vowed a “strong, joint response” to Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons Saturday in Eastern Ghouta. Details of the strike on T4, as the Tiyas airbase near Homs is known, are still not fully available. Three members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps were reportedly among those killed. Israel, which has previously acknowledged attacking targets inside Syria, hasn’t commented. The Assad regime initially said the U.S. carried out the strike, but later walked back that claim; Syrian state news then attributed it to Israel. The U.S. military denied involvement. Related Stories Another Strike on Syria Could Be Coming

The Logic of Assad's Brutality As Washington debates whether and how to respond to Saturday’s reported chemical attack, the strike on the base was curious not only for its participants but for its location. The U.S. struck near the same base following a chemical attack last year on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, saying the chemical strike had originated there. It’s still unclear what role T4 had in Saturday’s alleged chemical attack in Douma—the base is far from where the attack took place and may not have been involved at all, which raises questions about who ordered the strike, and why. But from the sketchy information available it looks almost like an unrelated move in an Israel/Iran proxy war. SANA, the Syrian news agency, reported that the missiles were fired by Israeli jets in Lebanese airspace. Of eight missiles that were fired, five were shot down, the Russian defense ministry said, and three struck the airbase. Israel says Iran uses the T4 base to transfer weapons to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia group with which it fought a 15-year-long conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israeli officials have previously said that one of their goals in Syria is to keep Iran in check and ensure it keeps its distance from the border with Israel. It fears—with some justification—that Iran will use the proximity to the border and access to Shiite fighters to attack Israel. To this end, Israel, which regards Iran’s theocratic regime an existential threat, has struck targets inside Syria dozens of times since the civil war began in 2011. The largest of those attacks, in February, also involved the T4 base. At the time, an Iranian drone launched from the base entered Israeli territory. In response, Israel struck Iranian targets inside Syria. An Israeli F-16 took Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Two Israeli pilots ejected from the jet and parachuted safely back to their territory. Israel had wanted to stage a larger response, but was reportedly talked back by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Assad’s choice of allies in the Syrian civil war has all but guaranteed the internationalization of the conflict—and this is true of Iran in particular. The Islamic Republic is involved in all of the major regional conflicts: In Iraq, it is trying to preserve its own interests and that of some of its Shiite allies; in Yemen, it is involved in a deadly proxy war with Saudi Arabia; in Lebanon, it backs Hezbollah; and in Syria, it supports Assad. But as Assad consolidates his victory over the rebels, and ISIS is all but defeated, Iran’s role may determine the next phase of the Syrian civil war.",The Strange Geography of the Latest Syria Strike,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/syria-israel-iran/557501/
25,syria,"I am deeply concerned about the continuing massive displacement of close to 700,000 Syrians since the beginning of the year due to ongoing hostilities in the country. The latest displacement comes on top of already 6.5 million internally displaced Syrians and over 5.6 million Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Over half of the Syrian population has now been displaced and are in need of humanitarian and protection assistance.

Civilians in Syria continue to be caught up in horrific violence. Hostilities, including attacks on residential areas, civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, markets, schools have resulted in scores of civilians being killed or injured on a daily basis. This is unacceptable. Humanitarian organizations continue to call for minimum protection standards around civilian evacuations to be respected, including in relation to unconditional access to humanitarian assistance and protection of humanitarian workers. Parties to the conflict, under international humanitarian law, must respect and protect medical facilities and personnel. The level of attacks on health facilities, workers and infrastructure in the first three months of 2018 was three times the rate seen in 2017.

In the country’s northwest Idlib Governorate, over 400,000 women, children and men have reportedly been displaced by recent military operations, including over 300,000 in Idleb and 137,000 from Afrin. Most of those displaced are currently being hosted in improvised and overcrowded collective accommodations, such as schools, unfinished buildings, tents, and mosques, with a lack of privacy compounding protection risks.

The crisis has also dramatically deepened for hundreds of thousands of people in Rural Damascus following a devastating offensive on Eastern Ghouta. Since mid-February 2018, the besieged enclave has witnessed a further escalation in hostilities, with reports of mounting civilian casualties, as well as widespread damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure due to air and ground-based strikes.

An additional 133,000 people are now displaced from Eastern Ghouta. Over 44,000 of these people are in severely overcrowded IDP sites in Rural Damascus, while close to 50,000 others – mostly civilians and some fighters – have been evacuated to Idleb and Aleppo where humanitarian response has already been stretched to breaking point.

I am particularly concerned about renewed and intensive violence in Douma in Eastern Ghouta in recent days, leaving dozens dead or injured. Reports include sustained airstrikes and shelling on the city, the killing of civilians, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and attacks damaging several health facilities. At the same time, there has also been reported shelling on the city of Damascus, reportedly killing and injuring a number of innocent civilians as well.

I am also deeply alarmed by horrific allegations that chemical weapons have been used against civilian populations in Douma. While the United Nations is not in a position to verify these reports, any use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, is abhorrent, and require a thorough investigation.

At the same time, violence is also continuing in the northeast and south of the country, as well as in southern Damascus and northern rural Homs.

It is critical that civilians be protected and I echo the U.N. Secretary-General in calling on all parties to the conflict to ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, including humanitarian access across Syria to all people in need, as per relevant Security Council resolutions.

With civilians continuing to be caught up in appalling violence across Syria, their protection must remain at the centre of our efforts.","Statement by Panos Moumtzis, Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, on Growing Displacement [EN/AR]",https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/statement-panos-moumtzis-regional-humanitarian-coordinator-syria-5
