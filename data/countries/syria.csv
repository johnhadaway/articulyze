0,syria,"Western countries are reportedly planning to bypass Russia’s veto at the UN security council over Syria by referring concerns about the suspected use of chemical weapons to the UN general assembly.

Russia has used its veto 12 times to block UN action targeting the regime of its ally, Bashar al-Assad.

In November, it used its veto to block the extension of a UN mechanism to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons attacks.

Western nations blamed the Syrian government for a poison gas attack on the town of Douma earlier this month, which killed dozens of people and led the US, Britain and France to launch 105 missiles targeting chemical weapons facilities in retaliation.

The Syrian regime and Russia deny involvement or the use of chemical weapons.

Western officials are reportedly supporting the idea of turning to a rarely used diplomatic route in order to clear the impasse, known as “uniting for peace”, which would allow nine members of the security council to refer their concerns to a vote at the general assembly, bypassing Russia’s veto.

A two-thirds majority in the general assembly would then be required to agree upon an attribution mechanism.

“The Russian veto need not be the end of efforts for collective action by the UN,” Ian Martin, a human rights activist and former UN official, told The Guardian.

“The responsibility of asserting accountability for the use of chemical weapons, and for bringing an end to the horrors of the Syrian conflict, rests with the world community as a whole.”

It comes as the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stressed that the latest territorial gains by the Syrian regime and its allies have not brought peace any closer to the country.

“We’re seeing in last few weeks, days ... that military gains, territorial gains and military escalation does not bring a political solution, has not brought any change. On the contrary,” he said.

On Monday, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialised nations united to condemn Russia for what they said was ”a pattern of irresponsible and destabilising” behaviour.

They urged Moscow to help resolve the conflict in Syria and agreed to create a working group to study the Kremlin’s “malign behaviour”.

John Sullivan, the acting US secretary of state, called on Moscow to stop creating impediments to peace in Syria, and to play a role in ending the seven-year-long conflict.

“Russia must be a constructive partner in Syria or will be held accountable,” he said.

Speaking to reporters on the margins of the meeting, foreign secretary Boris Johnson said G7 ministers had agreed on the need to be vigilant about Russia.

“What we decided ... was that we were going to set up a G7 group that would look at Russian malign behaviour in all its manifestations – whether it’s cyber warfare, whether it’s disinformation, assassination attempts, whatever it happens to be, and collectively try to call it out.”

German’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the meeting established “again that there will be no political solution in Syria without Russia ... and that Russia has to contribute its share to such a solution.”

While supporting the air strikes in Syria, the G7 statement said they were “limited, proportionate and necessary – and taken only after exhausting every possible diplomatic option to uphold the international norm against the use of chemical weapons.”",Syria crisis: Western countries plan to bypass Russia's UN veto over Douma chemical attack,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-russia-un-veto-chemical-weapons-civil-war-general-assembly-a8319821.html
1,syria,"The U.S. has a number of actions in responding to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, but it's a more difficult challenge than ""just kind of firing ready, aim here,"" said CBS News Radio military analyst Mike Lyons. But most importantly, Mr. Trump's ""got to be careful not to get goaded into doing something that's not in the best interest of the United States,"" Lyons told CBSN's Meg Oliver Tuesday.

""I think as more time is going on, that window is closing for some kind of response that's going to make any difference on the ground,"" Lyons said, noting that it still needs to be proven if it was a chemical attack.

Reports out of Syria suggest dozens of people were killed in rebel stronghold Douma, near Damascus, on Saturday in attack using chemical weapons. Initial reports from the humanitarian group known as the White Helmets and Syrian American Medical Society indicated that chlorine gas might have been the agent used.

Last year, the U.S. launched 59 tomahawk missiles on a Syrian base that was believed to have launched a chemical attack. Lyons called that response ""small"" and recommended Mr. Trump think ""through whether he wants a tactical response, something quick on the ground, or he's got to think through the strategy hopefully involving our allies.""

The U.S. is still trying to determine what happened in Syria. Mr. Trump, though, tweeted on Sunday ""many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!""

International chemical watchdog groups are on their way into Syria, but Lyons warned that it could be difficult to find remnants of the alleged attack. ""It's hard to make a chemical weapons strike – in most cases, they've come out of helicopters, or planes – you don't want a rocket delivery because it endangers the crew,"" Lyons said.

Lyons said the U.S. is searching for that ""Cuban Missile Crisis moment, where they show the world that Russia is involved."" But, he cautioned, Russia will most likely deny any involvement, and the longer the wait for a response, the less likely remnants will be around.

2,syria,"2017 IN REVIEW

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Civilians in Syria continue to face an ongoing protection crisis. Amid active hostilities in many parts of the country, humanitarian actors remain concerned by the high levels of civilian casualties that continue to be reported and point to violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL),

An estimated 1.7 million people were displaced in the first nine months of 2017 alone, many multiple times. An estimated 721,000 spontaneous/self-organized IDP and refugee returns also took place in 2017, including approximately 66,000 refugees. While the number of people in besieged areas decreased compared to last year, the humanitarian situation for those trapped in the remaining areas is dire. Amid the disruption caused by prolonged hostilities, extensive displacement, family separation and disruption of community networks, access to basic services as well as livelihood opportunities remain scarce. Prices and availability of basic commodities, also affected by unilateral coercive measures, remain a factor of need. As a result, people’s ability to cope is strained and many are unable to meet their basic needs.

In 2017, 6.1 million people were internally displaced with 750,000 people living in last resort sites, and a daily average of 6,550 people displaced each day. 5.3 million people were registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Throughout most of 2017, 2.98 million people lived in besieged and hardto-reach areas, including 419,920 people in 10 UN-declared besieged areas. Lack of civil status documentation remained a serious concern across Syria. 8.2 million people were exposed to explosive hazards in contaminated areas with 33 per cent of hazards located on agricultural land. Some 6.5 million people were food insecure and face large food consumption gaps or are at risk of extreme loss or depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps. A further 4 million people were at risk of becoming food insecure because of exhaustion of productive assets to maintain food consumption.

Less than half of Syria’s health facilities are fully operational. The protracted nature of the crisis has negatively affected immunization coverage rates, reducing immunity and increasing the risk of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as polio (74 cases of cVDPV2 mainly in Deir Ez-Zor and ArRaqqa).

Economic losses are estimated at more than $254 billion. The conflict has damaged or destroyed Syria ‘s infrastructure, impeded access to sources of income, disrupted markets, and triggered currency depreciation. Economic losses from the disruption to the education system are estimated at around $11 billion, equivalent to about 18 per cent of Syria’s 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) further damaging long term economic prospects.

Food production has been drastically reduced, with the total area of land under cultivation having shrunk by 40 per cent. Compounded by difficulties in distributing food staples, a third of the population is now food insecure. Government revenues have plummeted largely due to the decrease in oil exports and disruption of trade. As a result, the country’s GDP has contracted by 55 per cent with further contraction expected.

Hostilities have characterized 2017 and are expected to continue in 2018 concentrated in certain areas. As a result, displacement is anticipated to continue. Based on displacement trends in 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people may be displaced over the course of 2018, some multiple times, in addition to the 6.1 million IDPs in protracted displacement. Approximately one million IDPs may spontaneously return to their areas of origin. Humanitarian access challenges continue to limit humanitarian organizations from regularly reaching the most vulnerable people. Humanitarian needs in Syria remain – according to recent humanitarian analyses – similar in scale and severity to those of last year Humanitarian assistance should be available to millions of people striving to meet their basic needs",Syria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
3,syria,"As Syria’s war grinds along in its seventh year of fighting, the conflict is entering an ominous new phase as President Bashar Assad’s forces step up their offensive operations and the broader proxy war intensifies between several nation states, including Iran and Israel. Assad’s forces have secured the upper hand on the battlefield and are concentrating their efforts in clearing out remaining areas of opposition influence around Damascus. In the coming weeks, look for Assad to focus on eliminating remaining pockets of opposition control around Rastan in the north and in southwestern Syria near the Jordanian border.

At that point, Assad will face an important choice. Does he try to regain control of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, where thousands of civilians and militants fleeing other conflict zones have moved, and where radical groups such as Fatah Sham, which is Al Qaeda in Syria, control large parts of the province? Or does he instead turn east to contest U.S. backed-Kurdish forces and try to regain large portions of the country’s critical oil infrastructure? The latest estimate is that Kurdish forces control territory, including oil and gas fields in eastern Syria, that accounts for about 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. These resources will be critical to the regime’s long-term reconstruction project.

Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Iran in Syria have reached a dangerous new level in recent weeks. In early April, Israel reportedly fired missiles at a Syrian airbase and killed seven Iranians. There are also reports that late Sunday night Israel may have struck military bases used by Iran and its proxy militias near Hama and Aleppo, killing additional Iranians. This comes on the heels of claims by Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisSenators riled after closed-door briefing on Niger investigation Marines investigating active-duty member identified as white supremacist Guard border deployment creates issues for Pentagon MORE that Iran is strengthening its military footprint in Syria and using the country as a platform to transfer increasingly advanced weapons to Hezbollah.

Senior Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that Israel will not accept a large Iranian military presence on its border, and are reportedly now bracing for an Iranian response to the recent missile strikes. So, the potential for a clash between Israel and Iran in Syria has increased sharply of late. It’s worth considering that such a confrontation could escalate quickly and trigger direct attacks inside both Israel and Iran. It could also spill beyond Syria’s borders to Lebanon and Iraq, potentially drawing in Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq.

If all this is not sufficiently worrisome, Turkey’s recent military operations in northwestern Syria around Afrin, as well as Ankara’s on again, off again cooperation with Washington on the final disposition of the strategically important area around the city of Manbij, located just west of the Euphrates River, adds yet another level of complexity to the situation. If Turkey’s overarching objective is to expand its buffer zone to its entire southern border with Syria, we should anticipate additional clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces in the coming months.

Even as the increasingly fraught military situation in Syria absorbs most of the world’s attention, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The latest reliable estimates are that nearly 500,000 Syrians have died thus far in the conflict, and nearly half of Syria’s population before the war is now displaced or seeking asylum outside the country. In fact, according to the United Nations, more than 13 million of Syria’s current population of 18 million people are now dependent on humanitarian assistance. So, in my view, it’s crystal clear that the war that Assad unleashed on his own population more than seven years ago and that external actors, especially Iran and Russia, have fueled, seems poised to enter an ominous next stage. Is there anything that U.S. policymakers might do now to prepare for the next chapter in this conflict?

First, U.S. policymakers might want to delay the timeline for drawing down U.S. forces in Syria. The fight against ISIS in eastern Syria is not yet over, and the removal of U.S. forces could allow ISIS to reconstitute in the no man’s land along the border between Iraq and Syria, potentially jeopardizing the security of Iraq and eventually Jordan. The presence of a limited number of U.S. troops also increases America’s ability to target Al Qaeda elements in western Syria, and does provide, in my view, diplomatic leverage over both the Assad regime and Moscow, which will be critical during future negotiations to end the conflict. In addition, a sudden removal of U.S. forces could put at risk the Syrian Democratic Forces backed by the United States, who were instrumental in the recapture of Raqqa, and who in the absence of U.S. military support will likely become a target for the Assad regime and its allies.

Second, given the recent spike in tensions between Israel and Iran, U.S. policymakers may want to think carefully about ways, including direct messaging to both countries, to limit the potential for that confrontation to spread beyond Syria’s borders, and about U.S. options if that should unfortunately occur. Finally, U.S. policymakers might want to reconsider all of America’s options for tackling the deepening humanitarian nightmare in Syria, from providing increased relief assistance to rethinking the handling of Syria’s displaced population. The situation on the ground will not improve for the foreseeable future, and it is not an exaggeration to say that an entire generation of Syria’s children are at risk.

Despite periodic claims to the contrary, there has never been, nor likely will ever be, an easy policy solution to the Syria crisis. But make no mistake, the conflict is getting worse on many levels and could spark an even broader regional crisis soon. It is incumbent on leaders across the globe to avoid the temptation to look away, and to instead redouble their efforts to identify creative diplomatic options to reduce tensions, minimize civilian casualties, prevent the further use of chemical weapons, and mitigate as much as possible the humanitarian fallout from an international crisis with no end in sight.

4,syria,"Was it necessary to retaliate against the suspected chemical attack in Syria? Yes. It was.

Two reasons. One, there was a red line on the use of chemical weapons. It had to be enforced. Two, you have to enforce the international ban on the use of chemical weapons.

Is it mission accomplished? A leader should never say it is mission accomplished, and certainly not a US president. Is it possible that Bashar Al-Assad and his regime will use chemical weapons again? It is.

We've been here before. This is the second time that the US and its allies have had to act. So it certainly was not mission accomplished.

Where does it leave Syria? Well, sadly, it leaves Syria where Syria was a week ago, before these attacks. The strikes do not change the balance of power on the ground. And the balance of power is still in favour of the Syrian regime and its allies, Iran and Russia.

What should the West do now? The big problem has been for years that there is no consistent Western policy towards Syria. The west has not been willing to use its military might in a significant way.

The situation facing Syrian children

As the Syrian crisis enters its eighth year, it continues to have a devastating impact on children inside Syria and in neighbouring countries. UNICEF is appealing for funding to meet both the immediate and longer term needs of children and their families, wherever they are.

Over two million school-age children are out-of-school in Syria.

1 in 3 schools in Syria cannot be used because it is either damaged, destroyed or sheltering displaced families or used for military purposes.

Half of all healthcare facilities in Syria are either partially functioning or not functioning at all.

The proportion of people living in extreme poverty in Syria (less than US$1.90 per day) doubled from 34% pre-crisis to nearly 70% today.

6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity in Syria.

More than 5.6 million people, including 2.7 million children, have been living as registered refugees in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey since the onset of the conflict.

7,syria,"A recent rally in oil prices to multi-year highs is about much more than the deepening crisis in Syria, analysts told CNBC Thursday.

Crude futures soared to highs not seen since December 2014 on Wednesday, underpinned by greater geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East and heightened concerns over the prospect of imminent military action from Western powers. Ample crude supplies had pared some of the gains on Thursday, though crude futures remained in touching distance of levels not seen in more than three years.

""I think certainly some of what we are seeing is a little bit of geopolitical premium (but) I don't think it is just about Syria,"" Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" Thursday.

Instead, Mallinson argued crude futures had soared to multi-year highs on the back of two main price drivers — concern over the ""wider ramifications"" of heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East and the looming prospect of the U.S. withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal.

Oil prices slipped away from 2018 highs on Thursday, with global benchmark Brent trading at $71.15 in early afternoon deals, down 0.8 percent, and WTI trading at $66.38, around 0.6 percent lower.","Oil price rally is about much more than just Syria crisis, analysts say",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/oil-price-rally-is-about-much-more-than-just-syria-crisis-analysts-say.html
8,syria,"Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, was speaking to journalists after a scheduled humanitarian task force meeting in Geneva.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over,” he said, amid reports that “tens of thousands of people” from Rural Damascus were preparing to evacuate to Idlib in the north-west of the country.

“We’ve still only 23 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded and we’re now in May,” Mr Egeland said, warning that there was “no cash …available to humanitarian actors” as “desperate, exhausted people arrive now every day in Idlib. There is no money for the operations.”

He called on countries not to slow down their support “before this marathon of suffering is over.”

Mr. Egeland’s comments come amid ongoing aid-access challenges, in many areas of Syria, linked to mass displacement and acute needs caused by more than seven years of war.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over” - Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria

One year ago, well over four million people lived in so-called hard-to-reach locations where aid access was extremely unreliable, and hundreds of thousands more were trapped by surrounding forces.

Today, two million people remain in hard-to-reach areas in Syria and 11,000 still live in besieged locations; but the apparent progress in terms of numbers, is deceptive, the UN Special Advisor explained:

“It is a good thing that people are not any longer living massively in besieged areas, and that much fewer people live in hard-to-reach areas. But when this comes at the cost of horrific battles in heavily populated areas, and when it comes because of agreements made by a small group of military people and politicians, too often humanitarian concerns and the protection concerns for the civilian population is lost.”

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), displacement in some parts of Syria is as high as it was at the beginning of the crisis.

OCHA’s records indicate that for every person who returns home voluntarily, another three people are newly displaced.

Areas of particular concern include Afrin in the north, the former ISIL stronghold of Raqqa, as well as Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus and Yarmouk in the south of the capital - where the UN has highly-restricted access.

But Mr. Egeland said his “worry number one” was Idlib, which is already home to more than two million people.

“They are living out in the open, they are living in congested displacement camps…crammed in collective centres,” he said.

“They arrive at 2am, you know, sort of every night now, just to find that they can hardly get a bed anywhere offered by completely overwhelmed humanitarian actors. So we cannot have a war in Idlib,” he implored.

Amid reports that armed groups are continuing to strike what Mr Egeland called “bad humanitarian agreements” to allow civilians to leave several conflict zones including the besieged Shia towns of Foah and Kafraya in the north-west and Yarmouk south of Damascus, he said it was important that people went to a place of their choosing.

Mr. Egeland also expressed concern for the 40,000 people living in displacement camps near eastern Ghouta – previously home to 390,000 people - amid a reported lack of freedom of movement for civilians, particularly men.

The veteran aid chief also defended the value of the UN-coordinated “deconfliction system” which offers protection to humanitarian locations whose location is communicated to warring parties.

More than 660 sites had now asked the UN to transmit their coordinates to Member States whose militaries are operating within Syria, Mr. Egeland said, and more than 500 of those requests had come this year alone.

“I’m surprised really by those who say they really want to help protect medical facilities, that they are questioning the whole value of trying to get a deconfliction system up in the Syria war, like we have it in Yemen, we have it in Afghanistan, we have it in Mali and many other conflicts,” he added.","‘Marathon of suffering’ in Syria conflict, far from over: UN humanitarian adviser",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008832

The key battleground is Syria, but U.S. policy there is still a muddled mess. If Trump is serious about Iran, he needs to get serious about Syria.

Trump barely mentioned Syria in his speech Tuesday announcing U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, other than to include Iranian support for the Bashar al-Assad regime in his list of “sinister activities.” Trump promised to work with allies to block Iran’s “menacing activity across the Middle East” and rightly pointed out that the Iran deal enabled the Iranian regime’s bloody regional expansion.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised in his Tuesday statement that new sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps would cut off its malign regional activity, including “its support for the brutal Assad regime in Syria.” Sanctioning Iran for its crimes in Syria is good, but far from sufficient. Absent a new comprehensive approach in Syria, the worsening situation there could soon spin out of control.

The Israeli government isn’t waiting for the United States to get serious about doing something in Syria. As Trump was speaking to the American people, the Israeli military was reportedly conducting its latest strikes on Iranian military targets inside Syria. The battle is already raging to prevent Tehran from turning Syria into a major base of Iranian military operations, but the United States seems paralyzed.

Even worse, Trump has already declared that he intends to cut and run from Syria. There’s no sign he’s changed his view on that even after striking the Assad regime for the second time last month in response to the Syrian president’s use of chemical weapons on civilians. Despite what Trump tweeted, the mission is not accomplished.

Trump’s freezing of $200 million of U.S. humanitarian and civil support aid to Syrians living outside the control of Assad and Iranian forces is hugely counterproductive. That shortsighted move is affecting the work of the White Helmets, who are literally saving lives. But it has also taken money away from investigations into the war crimes Trump professes to care about.

We know how national security adviser John Bolton feels about Syria. Just weeks before he joined the White House, he told a group of graduate students that both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed to come up with a strategy for stopping Iranian expansion there.

“The collapse of the ISIS territorial caliphate unfortunately has given Iran the prospect of having an arc of control” from Iran to Lebanon, he said.

The Trump administration is still placing too much emphasis on the Kurds and the Iraqi government, which Bolton calls a “satellite” of the Iranian regime. Iran, Russia and Assad aren’t done spreading misery in Syria, and the risks of inaction are severe.

“Iran was thinking of the next possible conflict and we were not,” Bolton said. “It does require a more comprehensive approach than we’ve got right now, given that there’s not much time before conditions worsen, I certainly hope it’s something they come up with.”

In all the briefings this week to explain Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal, no Trump administration could articulate how Syria fits in.

A senior State Department official delegated to explain Trump’s Iran deal decision to reporters answered a question about Syria strategy as follows: “Well, the President’s focus in Syria is on ISIS,” the official said.

So what would a real U.S. strategy for Syria look like? Well, there’s no shortage of ideas. Retired Gen. Jack Keane and the American Enterprise Institute’s Danielle Pletka laid out one set of policies last month.

They argue that the United States should consolidate and strengthen its position in Eastern Syria, work to support Arab Sunnis there who can govern and stabilize liberated areas, arm and support the remaining rebels in Western Syria who are fighting the regime, and solicit physical and financial support from Arab allies, as Bolton reportedly is trying to do. Then the United States and its allies should protect Syrian civilians by taking out the Assad regime’s capability to slaughter them from the air.

The authors correctly note that only severe pressure on Assad will make a negotiated political solution possible. But their call for thousands more U.S. troops is likely a non-starter for Trump. Syrian activists say that, at the very least, Trump must turn back on the spigot of humanitarian aid to show Syrians the United States is not abandoning them.

“Regardless if the Iran deal was good or bad, the Syrian civilians paid the heaviest price for it,” and Iran is set to commit more atrocities against innocents, said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force. “The $200 million of humanitarian support that was withheld by the Trump administration is a fraction of what Syrian civilians desperately need.”

Trump can have both a real Iran strategy and a real Syria strategy, but he can’t have one without the other. The Iran deal is over, but its demise provides a chance — perhaps the last one — for the United States to get Syria right.",Trump’s new Iran strategy succeeds or fails in Syria,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/05/09/trumps-new-iran-strategy-succeeds-or-fails-in-syria/
11,syria,"Highlights

Following the end of displacement from East Ghouta and East Qalamoun in Rural Damascus to the northwest of Syria, new agreements were reached in southern Rural Damascus, Yarmouk camp and northern rural Homs, which are likely to result in additional displacements to north-western Syria.

The UN and humanitarian organizations have a funding requirement of an estimated $100 million to provide life- saving assistance and services to people, who were displaced to northern Syria. This is in addition to the $95 million required to assist those who displaced to areas in rural Damascus, or who remained in areas of East Ghouta that recently shifted control including Duma city.

The security situation in the north-west, particularly in Idleb governorate, deteriorated significantly on 26 April following the onset of a series of targeted killings and an increase in what seems to be criminal activity. The poor security environment has a negative impact on civilians and impairs unfettered humanitarians access.

To respond to the acute needs of these new arrivals to northwestern Syria, the Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator launched the Turkey Humanitarian Fund’s second reserve allocation of $4 million. This is to respond to the urgent and specific needs. The allocation is prioritizing Camp Coordination and Camp Management, Shelter and NFIs and Food Security and Livelihoods response.

Situation Overview

As of mid-April, the displacement of internally-displaced persons (IDPs) from the communities that were previously held by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in Eastern Ghouta came to an end. It is estimated that a total of 66,365 individuals arrived in north-western Syria, of whom 47,188 individuals arrived in Idleb governorate and adjacent NSAG-held areas, and 19,177 individuals arrived in the Euphrates Shield areas in northern rural Aleppo. Negotiations between the parties to the conflict in the Eastern Qalamoun region of Rural Damascus concluded in the movement of 6,235 individuals to northern Syria in mid-April. Of the total, 5,031 individuals ended up in the Euphrates Shield areas in northern rural Aleppo, while the rest moved to Idleb governorate.

Against the backdrop of the ongoing hostilities in southern Damascus city, in late April an agreement was reached between Hayyat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), which controls a small area in the Yarmouk camp, and the Government of Syria (GoS) forces. As per the agreement, 141 individuals, including 17 women and 16 children, moved from the Yarmouk camp area to Idleb governorate on 1 May. In exchange, five medical patients, along with 18 family members, as well as 42 prisoners, who were imprisoned in Idleb governorate were allowed to leave to GoS-held areas in Aleppo governorate. The agreement included the evacuation of large numbers of people from the besieged communities of Foah and Kafraya in Idleb governorate; however, disagreements among the parties to the conflict led to the suspension of this movement. At present, it is unclear whether this movement will take place.

In the communities of Yalda, Babella and Beit Sahm, all in southern Rural Damascus, a similar agreement between the parties to the conflict was reached in late April. The first movement of IDPs from these communities took place on 3 May when 1,643 left for the Euphrates Shield areas in northern rural Aleppo. On 4 May, a convoy carrying 618 IDPs, the majority of whom are reportedly Palestinian refugees, arrived in the Euphrates Shield areas, and were later transported to an IDP camp near Deir Balut village in Afrin district. On 5 May, a convoy carrying 2,705 IDPs arrived in the Euphrates Shield areas; while on 7 May, a convoy carrying 1,612 IDPs from southern Rural Damascus arrived in Idleb governorate.

In the northern countryside of Homs, an agreement was reached following several rounds of negotiations between the parties to the conflict. As per the agreement, the registration of those who want to leave to northern Syria reportedly began on 2 May, and the movement was planned for 5 May, but has not yet started. Several local councils, including the Talbiseh and Ar-Rastan councils, in northern rural Homs issued statements to the humanitarian organizations operating in northern Syria to make the necessary preparations for the arrival of IDPs from the northern Homs enclave.

In north-western Syria, and especially in Idleb governorate, the poor security environment is of concern to newly- arrived IDPs and local populations. In addition to the threats of aerial bombardment and inter-factional fighting between the different armed groups, an increase in targeted killings and criminal activity further exacerbates the security environment. While targeted killings against armed group members have routinely been reported in the north-west, it is concerning that some of these targeted killings and criminal incidents were reportedly directed at non-affiliated individuals. Of note was the incident that took place on 3 May, in which a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device exploded near one of the program facilities of an international NGO (INGO) in Dana town. The explosion resulted in the death of four people, including an INGO watchman, and the wounding of 10 people. Due to insecurity, an INGO suspended its operations on 3 and 4 May; while another humanitarian organization was forced to limit the movement of its ambulances, especially during the early morning and late evening hours. On 28 April, the Education Directorate and Idleb University suspended their activities for two days. Aleppo University suspended activities for three days.

Aside from the security challenges, tensions were reported between some host communities and the new arrivals. A local council in southern rural Idleb reportedly asked a humanitarian organization providing assistance to prioritize the local population over the IDPs in their distribution plans. It is perceived that the additional numbers of IDPs are likely to decrease the quality of life and availability of existing services hitherto enjoyed by host communities, thus increasing tensions and negative perceptions towards newly arrived IDPs.

In addition to the security challenges mentioned above and the lack of shelter capacity, which was mentioned in previous reports, several Turkey-based humanitarian organizations were ordered by the Turkish authorities to refrain from the use of Hawala networks (unofficial money transfer services) to transfer funds from Turkey to Syria for their programming. In Turkey, the use of Hawala is not sanctioned by law and organizations that use it might be subjected to hefty fines. Humanitarian organizations are currently exploring solutions and alternative options to transfer funds to Syria.

With regards to the ongoing response, given the additional explosive hazards contamination caused by the continuous aerial bombardments, Mine Action Sub-Cluster partners scaled up the number of mobile teams to provide direct risk education sessions, and are conducting contamination impact surveys and victim data collection. In addition, the Mine-Action Sub-Cluster continues to integrate risk education materials through other clusters such as the Education and CCCM Clusters. The Shelter and NFI Cluster partners continue to distribute assistance to the affected population. As of 1 April, Cluster partners provided NFIs to a total of 53,397 East Ghouta IDPs. Furthermore, a total of 8,114 East Ghouta IDPs received shelter assistance. To respond to the acute needs of these new arrivals to northwestern Syria, the Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator launched the Turkey Humanitarian Fund’s second reserve allocation of $4 million. This is to respond to the urgent and specific needs. The allocation is prioritizing Camp Coordination and Camp Management, Shelter and NFIs and Food Security and Livelihoods response.

13,syria,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Russia is unlikely to try to limit Israel’s military actions in Syria, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Since intervening in the Syrian civil war on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, Russia has generally turned a blind eye to Israeli attacks on suspected arms transfers and deployments by Assad’s Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies.

But Moscow’s condemnation of an April 9 strike that killed seven Iranian personnel set off speculation in Israel that Russian patience might be wearing thin.

Netanyahu flew to Moscow on Wednesday to meet Putin, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump quit the Iranian nuclear deal and after Syria accused Israel of carrying out a fresh missile strike on an army base near Damascus.

“Given what is happening in Syria at this very moment, there is a need to ensure the continuation of military coordination between the Russian military and the Israel Defence Forces,” Netanyahu told reporters before departing, referring to a hotline designed to prevent the countries clashing accidentally.

After the talks with Putin, Netanyahu sounded upbeat.

“In previous meetings, given statements that were putatively attributed to - or were made by - the Russian side, it was meant to have limited our freedom of action or harm other interests and that didn’t happen, and I have no basis to think that this time will be different,” he told reporters in a phone briefing.

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday that the overnight air strike near Damascus killed at least 15 people, including eight Iranians. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

But the Israelis have said they are on high alert for a possible attack by Iranian forces in Syria, after Tehran vowed to avenge the April 9 strike. Israel has pledged to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from forming a Lebanese-Syria front against it.

Netanyahu’s relationship with Putin has been buoyed by a long-running Israeli courting of Russian sensitivities.

During his 10-hour Moscow visit, the Israeli leader attended, alongside Putin, annual Red Square celebrations of the anniversary of the end of World War Two. Israel recognizes the Russian date, May 9. Most Western powers mark it on May 8.

“When the president of Russia invites the prime minister of the state of the Jews to stand alongside him at the parade symbolizing the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis, its liberation, also, of the (concentration) camps, of Jews and others – for Russia, that is very significant,” Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told the Ynet news site.

With violence in several areas of Syria UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency today expresses its alarm at the civilian deaths this is causing as well as spiralling new displacement. This is on top of a humanitarian situation that is already desperate; Syrian civilians have more than suffered enough.

Of particular concern is the situation in Douma in Eastern Ghouta where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped. We estimate that more than 133,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta over the past four weeks. This is almost three times the number we reported on 20 March and includes some 45,000 people who are currently being accommodated in eight collective shelters in Rural Damascus. An estimated 44,000, mainly women, children and elderly have so far been allowed to leave the collective shelters after completion of their security screening. UNHCR teams are working with UN and NGO partners to help improve the conditions at these collective shelters, which remain congested. We continue to appeal to all parties to the conflict for proper protection of civilians, including freedom of movement and free choice over where to stay. Family unity must also be respected.

Since the outset of this emergency, as part of the wider UN response, UNHCR has been working to address the needs of the displaced. Our staff are paying daily visits to all the collective shelters where displaced people from Eastern Ghouta are accommodated, to assess needs and help address them. Overcrowded shelters and insufficient sanitation facilities are posing serious health risks. Common concerns we are hearing are a lack of civil documentation, restrictions on freedom of movement, family separation and SGBV risks.

UNHCR’s response to the Eastern Ghouta emergency encompasses the delivery of core relief items, shelter support and protection services. Nearly a quarter or a million urgently need aid, and more than 60,000 people have been reached so far. UNHCR is purchasing clothes locally as many people fled with nothing more than what they were wearing. In addition to a massive shelter effort, UNHCR protection partners have provided legal counseling to 22,000 people.

Meanwhile, we are facing similar challenges and concerns in responding to the humanitarian needs of more than 137,000 Syrians displaced from the Afrin region. Most are scattered across Tal Rifaat, Nubol, Zahraa and surrounding villages in northwest Aleppo, living in makeshift shelters, damaged or unfinished buildings, mosques, warehouses and open-spaces. Some 3,500 people are being accommodated in a tented camp in Fafin to the north of Aleppo. In addition we have distributed more than 1,400 kits for shelter rehabilitation and redeployed 1,000 UNHCR family-sized tents, for use as needed.

Displacement from Afrin has subsided and some returns to the city are taking place. The challenging journey back home for the displaced may take up to four days in some cases. Movements of displaced people towards Aleppo and other government-controlled areas continues to be constrained.

The United States, Britain and France have launched a new bid at the United Nations to investigate chemical weapons attacks in Syria in the wake of US-led missile strikes against Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

Despite Trump's bluster, it's unclear what Syria strikes accomplished Read more

Hours after the strikes against chemical weapons facilities in Damascus and Homs, the three allies circulated a joint draft resolution at the security council that also called for unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, enforcement of a ceasefire and a demand that Syria engage in UN-led peace talks.

The move signalled the west’s resolve to return to diplomacy after pre-dawn attacks that Donald Trump praised as “perfectly executed” and “mission accomplished”.

The new diplomatic push came after a stormy security council meeting called by Russia, which branded the military action an “aggression” against Syria and sought condemnation. That bid however failed, with only China and Bolivia voting alongside Russia to condemn the missile strikes. Eight countries opposed condemnation while four abstained.

The draft resolution by the US, UK and France would establish an independent investigation of allegations of toxic gas attacks in Syria with the aim of identifying the perpetrators. Russia in November used its veto three times to bury a previous UN-led inquiry which found that Syrian forces had dropped sarin on the town of Khan Sheikhun in April last year.

The measure would instruct the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to report within 30 days on whether Syria has fully disclosed its chemical weapons stockpile. Teams from the chemical weapons watchdog had been due to visit Douma when Trump ordered Saturday’s strikes.

The west has accused Syria of failing to live up to its commitment to scrap its chemical weapons program, under a 2013 deal reached between the US and Russia.

On the humanitarian side, the measure demands medical evacuations and safe passage for aid convoys to be allowed to all areas.

The text calls for a ceasefire resolution adopted in February – but which never materialised – to finally take hold and demands that Assad’s government engage in peace talks “in good faith, constructively and without preconditions”.

Several rounds of peace talks held under UN auspices in Geneva have failed to yield progress, deadlocked over demands that Assad make way for a political transition.

Negotiations on the draft resolution are set to begin on Monday, but diplomats said it remained unclear when the council would vote on the proposal.

Western diplomats said they were ready to allow time for negotiations to make every effort to bring Russia aboard. Moscow has used its veto 12 times at the security council to block action targeting its Syrian ally.

Addressing the security council on Saturday, US ambassador Nikki Haley said the US was confident the military strikes had crippled Syria’s chemical weapons program.

Haley warned that the US was “locked and loaded” and ready to strike again if any new chemical attack was carried out in Syria.

Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the west of “hooliganism” and demanded it “immediately end its actions against Syria and refrain from them in the future”.

“You are not only placing yourselves above international law, but you are trying to rewrite international law,” Nebenzia said.

The US, Britain and France launched air strikes in response to a suspected chemical attack in the rebel-held town of Douma a week ago that killed at least 40 people.
