“This evening I brought together NGOs working on the ground in Syria. Faced with the humanitarian situation, France is setting up an emergency program of 50 million euros,” Macron said on his official Twitter account.

The funds will be allocated to NGOs and U.N. agencies working on the ground in Syria, including the U.N. office for humanitarian affairs, the French president’s office said.

Some two dozens NGOs participated in the meeting with Macron at the Elysee presidential palace, including Action Aid, Handicap International, the Red Cross, and Care.

According to United Nations estimates, some 13 million people including six million children are in need of humanitarian aid in Syria, ravaged by a seven-year war that has displaced millions.

The United Nations said on Thursday that it was hopeful of getting aid to at least 100,000 Syrians who are desperate for help after months of battle ended years of siege around the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta.",France announces 50 million euro humanitarian aid for Syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aid/france-announces-50-million-euro-humanitarian-aid-for-syria-idUSKBN1HN2Z5

The force joined the U.S. Sixth Fleet on April 18, nearly a week after the United States, Britain and France launched air strikes targeting what Western powers said were Syrian chemical weapons installations.

The Navy said it was a scheduled deployment to support coalition partners, NATO allies and U.S. national security interests.

“We commenced combat operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve,” Truman’s commanding officer Captain Nicholas Dienna said, referring to the coalition operation launched in 2014 against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

“That operation demonstrates ... our resolve to our partners and allies in the region and our continuing fight to eliminate ISIS and their impact to the region,” he said.

Strike fighter squadrons commenced sorties over Syria from the eastern Mediterranean on May 3, the Navy said in a statement.

The most recent aircraft carrier strike group to operate in the sixth fleet was the USS George H.W. Bush which last conducted combat operations from the eastern Mediterranean Sea in July 2017.

The Truman is capable of carrying 90 aircraft, including F-18 Super Hornet fighter jets. It currently has “60 or so” aircraft on board, Truman’s air department officer Commander Steven Djunaedi said.

Several fighter jets were catapulted in sequence on Friday and Saturday from the Truman’s 4.5-acre flight deck and thundered into the sky, a Reuters witness said.

The strike group includes the cruiser USS Normandy and the destroyers Arleigh Burke, Farragut, Forrest Sherman and Bulkeley.

“Our fundamental job, by our presence even alone, is to increase the security and stability here in this part of the world,” Dienna said.

The Nimitz-class carrier was at the center of the U.S. Navy’s strikes against Islamic State in 2016. It returned to its homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, after an extended eight-month deployment.

Officials on board would not say how long its latest deployment was expected to last.

“We’ll be here as long as they need us and we’ll move on when they decide we need to go do something else,” the strike group’s commander Rear Admiral Gene Black said.

The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops on the ground to fight the group.

April’s intervention was the biggest by Western countries against President Bashar Assad and his ally Russia. The countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war.

On Friday, the U.S. Navy said it was re-establishing its Second Fleet, responsible for the northern Atlantic Ocean, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow.

Asked to comment on relations with the Russian navy in the Mediterranean, Dienna said: “We’ve had numerous interactions thus far with the Russians across the Mediterranean.

“I have been involved in virtually all of them and every single one of those has been professional, it’s been courteous and it’s been in accordance with international law.”",U.S. Navy jets begin sorties against IS in Syria from Mediterranean,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-carrier/us-navy-jets-begin-sorties-against-is-in-syria-from-mediterranean-idUSKBN1I81P1

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Civilians in Syria continue to face an ongoing protection crisis. Amid active hostilities in many parts of the country, humanitarian actors remain concerned by the high levels of civilian casualties that continue to be reported and point to violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL),

An estimated 1.7 million people were displaced in the first nine months of 2017 alone, many multiple times. An estimated 721,000 spontaneous/self-organized IDP and refugee returns also took place in 2017, including approximately 66,000 refugees. While the number of people in besieged areas decreased compared to last year, the humanitarian situation for those trapped in the remaining areas is dire. Amid the disruption caused by prolonged hostilities, extensive displacement, family separation and disruption of community networks, access to basic services as well as livelihood opportunities remain scarce. Prices and availability of basic commodities, also affected by unilateral coercive measures, remain a factor of need. As a result, people’s ability to cope is strained and many are unable to meet their basic needs.

In 2017, 6.1 million people were internally displaced with 750,000 people living in last resort sites, and a daily average of 6,550 people displaced each day. 5.3 million people were registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Throughout most of 2017, 2.98 million people lived in besieged and hardto-reach areas, including 419,920 people in 10 UN-declared besieged areas. Lack of civil status documentation remained a serious concern across Syria. 8.2 million people were exposed to explosive hazards in contaminated areas with 33 per cent of hazards located on agricultural land. Some 6.5 million people were food insecure and face large food consumption gaps or are at risk of extreme loss or depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps. A further 4 million people were at risk of becoming food insecure because of exhaustion of productive assets to maintain food consumption.

Less than half of Syria’s health facilities are fully operational. The protracted nature of the crisis has negatively affected immunization coverage rates, reducing immunity and increasing the risk of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as polio (74 cases of cVDPV2 mainly in Deir Ez-Zor and ArRaqqa).

Economic losses are estimated at more than $254 billion. The conflict has damaged or destroyed Syria ‘s infrastructure, impeded access to sources of income, disrupted markets, and triggered currency depreciation. Economic losses from the disruption to the education system are estimated at around $11 billion, equivalent to about 18 per cent of Syria’s 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) further damaging long term economic prospects.

Food production has been drastically reduced, with the total area of land under cultivation having shrunk by 40 per cent. Compounded by difficulties in distributing food staples, a third of the population is now food insecure. Government revenues have plummeted largely due to the decrease in oil exports and disruption of trade. As a result, the country’s GDP has contracted by 55 per cent with further contraction expected.

Hostilities have characterized 2017 and are expected to continue in 2018 concentrated in certain areas. As a result, displacement is anticipated to continue. Based on displacement trends in 2017, an estimated 1.5 million people may be displaced over the course of 2018, some multiple times, in addition to the 6.1 million IDPs in protracted displacement. Approximately one million IDPs may spontaneously return to their areas of origin. Humanitarian access challenges continue to limit humanitarian organizations from regularly reaching the most vulnerable people. Humanitarian needs in Syria remain – according to recent humanitarian analyses – similar in scale and severity to those of last year Humanitarian assistance should be available to millions of people striving to meet their basic needs",Syria Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

With violence in several areas of Syria UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency today expresses its alarm at the civilian deaths this is causing as well as spiralling new displacement. This is on top of a humanitarian situation that is already desperate; Syrian civilians have more than suffered enough.

Of particular concern is the situation in Douma in Eastern Ghouta where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped. We estimate that more than 133,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta over the past four weeks. This is almost three times the number we reported on 20 March and includes some 45,000 people who are currently being accommodated in eight collective shelters in Rural Damascus. An estimated 44,000, mainly women, children and elderly have so far been allowed to leave the collective shelters after completion of their security screening. UNHCR teams are working with UN and NGO partners to help improve the conditions at these collective shelters, which remain congested. We continue to appeal to all parties to the conflict for proper protection of civilians, including freedom of movement and free choice over where to stay. Family unity must also be respected.

Since the outset of this emergency, as part of the wider UN response, UNHCR has been working to address the needs of the displaced. Our staff are paying daily visits to all the collective shelters where displaced people from Eastern Ghouta are accommodated, to assess needs and help address them. Overcrowded shelters and insufficient sanitation facilities are posing serious health risks. Common concerns we are hearing are a lack of civil documentation, restrictions on freedom of movement, family separation and SGBV risks.

UNHCR’s response to the Eastern Ghouta emergency encompasses the delivery of core relief items, shelter support and protection services. Nearly a quarter or a million urgently need aid, and more than 60,000 people have been reached so far. UNHCR is purchasing clothes locally as many people fled with nothing more than what they were wearing. In addition to a massive shelter effort, UNHCR protection partners have provided legal counseling to 22,000 people.

Meanwhile, we are facing similar challenges and concerns in responding to the humanitarian needs of more than 137,000 Syrians displaced from the Afrin region. Most are scattered across Tal Rifaat, Nubol, Zahraa and surrounding villages in northwest Aleppo, living in makeshift shelters, damaged or unfinished buildings, mosques, warehouses and open-spaces. Some 3,500 people are being accommodated in a tented camp in Fafin to the north of Aleppo. In addition we have distributed more than 1,400 kits for shelter rehabilitation and redeployed 1,000 UNHCR family-sized tents, for use as needed.

Displacement from Afrin has subsided and some returns to the city are taking place. The challenging journey back home for the displaced may take up to four days in some cases. Movements of displaced people towards Aleppo and other government-controlled areas continues to be constrained.

5,syria,"Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, was speaking to journalists after a scheduled humanitarian task force meeting in Geneva.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over,” he said, amid reports that “tens of thousands of people” from Rural Damascus were preparing to evacuate to Idlib in the north-west of the country.

“We’ve still only 23 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded and we’re now in May,” Mr Egeland said, warning that there was “no cash …available to humanitarian actors” as “desperate, exhausted people arrive now every day in Idlib. There is no money for the operations.”

He called on countries not to slow down their support “before this marathon of suffering is over.”

Mr. Egeland’s comments come amid ongoing aid-access challenges, in many areas of Syria, linked to mass displacement and acute needs caused by more than seven years of war.

“It’s not over, and that’s what I fear, people think it’s over” - Jan Egeland, Special Adviser to the UN Special Envoy for Syria

One year ago, well over four million people lived in so-called hard-to-reach locations where aid access was extremely unreliable, and hundreds of thousands more were trapped by surrounding forces.

Today, two million people remain in hard-to-reach areas in Syria and 11,000 still live in besieged locations; but the apparent progress in terms of numbers, is deceptive, the UN Special Advisor explained:

“It is a good thing that people are not any longer living massively in besieged areas, and that much fewer people live in hard-to-reach areas. But when this comes at the cost of horrific battles in heavily populated areas, and when it comes because of agreements made by a small group of military people and politicians, too often humanitarian concerns and the protection concerns for the civilian population is lost.”

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), displacement in some parts of Syria is as high as it was at the beginning of the crisis.

OCHA’s records indicate that for every person who returns home voluntarily, another three people are newly displaced.

Areas of particular concern include Afrin in the north, the former ISIL stronghold of Raqqa, as well as Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus and Yarmouk in the south of the capital - where the UN has highly-restricted access.

But Mr. Egeland said his “worry number one” was Idlib, which is already home to more than two million people.

“They are living out in the open, they are living in congested displacement camps…crammed in collective centres,” he said.

“They arrive at 2am, you know, sort of every night now, just to find that they can hardly get a bed anywhere offered by completely overwhelmed humanitarian actors. So we cannot have a war in Idlib,” he implored.

Amid reports that armed groups are continuing to strike what Mr Egeland called “bad humanitarian agreements” to allow civilians to leave several conflict zones including the besieged Shia towns of Foah and Kafraya in the north-west and Yarmouk south of Damascus, he said it was important that people went to a place of their choosing.

Mr. Egeland also expressed concern for the 40,000 people living in displacement camps near eastern Ghouta – previously home to 390,000 people - amid a reported lack of freedom of movement for civilians, particularly men.

The veteran aid chief also defended the value of the UN-coordinated “deconfliction system” which offers protection to humanitarian locations whose location is communicated to warring parties.

More than 660 sites had now asked the UN to transmit their coordinates to Member States whose militaries are operating within Syria, Mr. Egeland said, and more than 500 of those requests had come this year alone.

“I’m surprised really by those who say they really want to help protect medical facilities, that they are questioning the whole value of trying to get a deconfliction system up in the Syria war, like we have it in Yemen, we have it in Afghanistan, we have it in Mali and many other conflicts,” he added.","‘Marathon of suffering’ in Syria conflict, far from over: UN humanitarian adviser",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/05/1008832

KILIS, Turkey

A Turkish aid agency on Monday sent 20 truckloads of humanitarian aid to areas of Syria cleared of terrorists by Turkey's Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations.

Yakup Alaca, an official at the Istanbul-based Humanitarian Relief Foundation’s (IHH) southern Kilis office, told Anadolu Agency that the aid was collected with the support of philanthropists and it will be distributed in safe areas cleared of terror in Syria.

Alaca said 15 truckloads will be sent to Afrin in northwestern Syria and five trucks to nearby Idlib.

""Our trucks are loaded with a lot of materials like flour, eggplant, potatoes, and clothes,"" Alaca added.

Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch on Jan. 20 this year to clear YPG/PKK and Daesh terrorists from Afrin, northwestern Syria amid growing threats from the region.

On March 18, Turkish-backed troops liberated Afrin’s town center, which had been a major hideout for YPG/PKK terrorists since 2012.

Turkey’s other cross-border operation in Syria, Operation Euphrates Shield, took place in August 2016 to March 2017 to support coalition forces and eliminate terror threats along the Turkish border.

Israel and Iran have traded blows over Syria since February, stirring concern that major escalation could be looming ahead of next week’s review decision by U.S. President Donald Trump on the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran.

On April 9, an air strike killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps members at the Syrian base. Tehran blamed Israel and vowed unspecified retaliation, drawing Israeli counter-threats to broaden attacks on Iranian military assets in Syria.

Sharpening these warnings, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Monday that Assad may find himself in Israel’s sights.

“If Assad allows Iran to turn Syria into a military vanguard against us, to attack us from Syrian territory, he should know that would be the end of him, the end of his regime,” Steinitz told the Ynet news site.

Asked if that meant Israel might assassinate Assad, Steinitz said: “His blood would be forfeit.” He also appeared to suggest that his remarks did not reflect Israeli government policy, saying: “I’m not talking about any concrete proposal.”

There was no immediate response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office or from Israel’s Defence Ministry.

A Ynet text story had quoted Steinitz as saying explicitly that Israel would kill Assad, but this was not borne out by a video clip of the interview.

Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and Russia have been reinforcing Damascus against a 7-year-old Syrian rebellion. The Israelis worry that Iran’s garrison will remain, linking with Hezbollah to form a broad Syrian-Lebanese front against them.

On Sunday, Israeli media carried what they described as an alert by Israel’s intelligence services that Iran was planning a missile salvo against Israeli military bases from within Syria.

Some analysts interpreted the publication as a warning to Iran that its plans were known, lest it try to carry out the missile strike without explicitly claiming responsibility.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss Syria, where Moscow wants to see Assad’s rule restored.

“Whoever is interested in Assad’s survival should do the honor of telling Assad to prevent attacks on Israel,” Steinitz said, alluding to Putin.",Israeli minister threatens Assad over any Iranian attacks from Syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-israel/israeli-minister-threatens-assad-over-any-iranian-attacks-from-syria-idUSKBN1I80O4

We've been here before. This is the second time that the US and its allies have had to act. So it certainly was not mission accomplished.

Where does it leave Syria? Well, sadly, it leaves Syria where Syria was a week ago, before these attacks. The strikes do not change the balance of power on the ground. And the balance of power is still in favour of the Syrian regime and its allies, Iran and Russia.

What should the West do now? The big problem has been for years that there is no consistent Western policy towards Syria. The west has not been willing to use its military might in a significant way.

12,syria,"Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan has been ousted only six days into his term, and protests have been voluntarily suspended while the National Assembly decides on his successor.

But political uncertainty in Armenia jeopardises a fragile ceasefire with Azerbaijan over an unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and this in turn has broad strategic implications.

Russia is treaty-bound to aid Armenia in the event of a conflict, while Turkey enjoys close cultural and economic ties with Azerbaijan. Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh could therefore threaten relations between Russia and Turkey as they gradually learn to coexist in the Middle East, especially in Syria.



Russia and Turkey: Syria

Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war is focused on preserving the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia sees the conflict as an opportunity to support Assad and his backers in Iran to challenge the hegemony of US allies in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.

Turkey, however, is focused on containing the Kurdish militia groups who support Assad, specifically the People’s Protection Units (YPG). Turkey views the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish nationalist organisation that has previously taken up arms against the Turkish state, and it has supported the Syrian Free Army to seek regime change in Syria.

Russia and Turkey, therefore, appear to have competing interests in Syria, and the two countries have already experienced direct confrontation: Turkish fighter jets downed a Russian warplane in 2015, accusing it of violating Turkish airspace during a sortie near its border with Syria.

But as the Syrian civil war is winding down, both Russia and Turkey are responding pragmatically to changes on the ground. Islamic State has been eradicated from much of the country, and the Syrian Government has retaken control of key cities from rebel groups. Turkey has sought – and received – Russian approval for airstrikes against the YPG in northern Syria, and the two countries met with Iran in April to cooperate on a post-war plan for stability.

This cooperation, however, could well be threatened by their opposing positions in the Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict: Russia and Turkey have previously traded stern words over Nagorno-Karabakh.



Russia and Turkey: Nagorno-Karabakh

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous, forested region surrounded by Azerbaijan yet populated mostly by ethnic Armenians. Several years of interethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis at the end of the 1980s led a full-scale war between the two countries after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group brokered a ceasefire in 1994, but only a handful of monitors continue to police what is known as the “line of contact”.

The conflict has flared-up several times in the last decade, most recently in April 2016 with an Azerbaijani offensive in the northern part of Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan stated that Turkey would back Azerbaijan “to the end” against Armenia, to which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded by accusing Turkey of one-sidedness in the conflict.

With the stability of the Armenian Government now in question, nervous Armenian commanders in Nagorno-Karabakh or emboldened Azerbaijani troops could trigger a new wave of violence and force Russia and Turkey to again take opposing sides, jeopardising their cooperation in Syria.



Armenia: 8 May

Sargsyan resigned on 23 April. He had reneged on a promise to step down from politics by taking the office of Prime Minister, an office he had created as part of Armenia’s constitutional reforms in 2015. His tenure had been marked by economic stagnation, a failure to address the tension in Nagorno-Karabakh, and accusations of corruption.

The National Assembly is widely expected to nominate protest leader and vocal opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as Sargsyan’s replacement on 8 May. But if Pashinyan cannot gain enough support in the National Assembly, Armenia will go to the polls in a snap election and Nagorno-Karabakh will likely be a campaign issue.

Sargsyan was born there, and his supporters in the area may be extra-sensitive to perceived provocation from Azerbaijan. Pashinyan, for his part, has taken a hard-line attitude toward Azerbaijan as a way to burnish his security credentials, and an election campaign may force him to further clarify his plans for the region.

The best way for Russia and Turkey to avoid being placed into direct confrontation over Nagorno-Karabakh is to collaborate with Armenia and Azerbaijan on the issue through the OSCE Minsk Group. A commitment from all parties to attend further talks once the political crisis in Armenia is resolved may be sufficient; inviting OSCE election monitors to oversee snap elections may be an important next step if a unifying leader cannot be chosen on 8 May.

Even if there is no room for inclusive democratic reform in post-war Syria, it is important that the next development in Armenian politics and Armenia–Azerbaijan relations is not a step backwards for Syria.

President Donald Trump and his national security aides on Thursday discussed U.S. options on Syria, where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a suspected poison gas attack, as a Russian envoy voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow.

Worries about a confrontation between Russia, Syria's big ally, and the West have been running high since Trump said on Wednesday that missiles ""will be coming"" in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7, and lambasted Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Trump tempered those remarks on Thursday and even as he consulted allies such and Britain and France, who could join in any U.S.-led strikes on Syria, there were signs of efforts to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control. ""Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, raising the prospect that an attack might not be as imminent as he seemed to suggest the day before.

Trump met his national security team on the situation in Syria later in the day and ""no final decision has been made,"" the White House said in a statement. ""We are continuing to assess intelligence and are engaged in conversations with our partners and allies,"" it said.

However, US defence secretary James Mattis has said his main concern about a military response was how to stop it ""escalating out of control"",The Guardian reports this mroning. There is no signal that Trump was cooling to the idea of military action, especially given the high stakes in Syria. U.S. officials noted that Washington was still assessing intelligence and coordinating allies.

Trump

Trump spoke to British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday and the two leaders talked about the ""need for a joint response to Syria's use of chemical weapons,"" the White House said. May's office said they agreed on the need to deter Assad's government from further such attacks.

Trump was also due to speak with French President Emmanuel Macron, who said France had proof the Syrian government carried out the attack near Damascus, which aid groups have said killed dozens of people, and will decide whether to strike back when all the necessary information has been gathered.

""We have proof that last week ... chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad,"" Macron said, without offering details of any evidence.

Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.

Two U.S. officials familiar with an investigation of samples from Douma and the symptoms of victims said initial indications that a mix of weaponized chlorine gas and sarin were used in the attack appeared to be correct. But U.S. intelligence agencies have not completed their assessment or reached a final conclusion, the officials said. Russia, Syria and its other main backer, Iran, have said reports of the Douma attack were fabricated by rebels and rescue workers and have accused the United States of seeking to use it as a pretext to attack the Syrian government.

Russia said it deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces. ""They are the guarantors of law and order in the town,"" RIA news agency quoted Russia's defense ministry as saying.

Vladimir Putin

There were signs of a global effort to head off a direct confrontation between Russia and the West. The Kremlin said a crisis communications link with the United States, created to avoid an accidental clash over Syria, was in use. Fears Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations, said he ""cannot exclude"" war between the United States and Russia and urged Washington and its allies to refrain from military action against Syria.

""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,"" he told reporters. ""We hope there will be no point of no return,"" the envoy said. A team of experts from the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was traveling to Syria and will start its investigations on Saturday, the Netherlands-based agency said. It was not clear whether Trump and U.S. allies would wait for the results of the investigation before deciding on a strike.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Congress he believed there was a chemical attack in Syria, but added a short while later that the United States had not made any decision to launch military action. He also suggested he was examining ways to prevent any strikes from triggering a broader conflict. ""I don't want to talk about a specific attack that is not yet in the offing ... This would be pre-decisional,"" Mattis told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. Moscow is estimated to have dozens of aircraft at its Hmeymim air base in Syria including fighters and bombers, as well as 10 to 15 warships and support vessels in the Mediterranean.

The Syrian government and Russian forces in Syria possess truck-mounted surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery weapons systems. Nervous world stock markets showed signs of recovery after Trump's signal that military strikes might not be imminent. Britain's May won backing from her senior ministers to take unspecified action with the United States and France to deter further use of chemical weapons by Syria.

May had recalled the ministers from their Easter holiday for the meeting to discuss Britain's response to what she has cast as a barbaric attack that cannot go unchallenged. Russian ships had left the Tartus naval base in Syria, Interfax news agency quoted a Russian lawmaker as saying. Vladimir Shamanov, who chairs the defense committee of the lower house, said the vessels had departed the base for their own safety, which was ""normal practice"" when there were threats of attack. Any U.S. strike would probably involve the Navy, given the risk to aircraft from Russian and Syrian air defenses. A U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean. Last year, the United States carried out strikes from two Navy destroyers against a Syrian air base after another deadly toxic gas attack on a rebel-controlled area.

DAMASCUS, Syria, 23 April 2018 - Seven years of brutal conflict in Syria and there is no end in sight. Millions of children have never known peace.

Access to basic and lifesaving services has been severely restricted and in some areas completely cut off. More than 13.1 million people, including 5.3 million children, need urgent life-saving assistance in 2018.

In 2017, UNICEF also continued to support the efforts of governments and partners to deliver essential services in refugee camps and host communities in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, benefiting an estimated 2.5 million people, including 1.7 million children.

The situation facing Syrian children

As the Syrian crisis enters its eighth year, it continues to have a devastating impact on children inside Syria and in neighbouring countries. UNICEF is appealing for funding to meet both the immediate and longer term needs of children and their families, wherever they are.

Over two million school-age children are out-of-school in Syria.

1 in 3 schools in Syria cannot be used because it is either damaged, destroyed or sheltering displaced families or used for military purposes.

Half of all healthcare facilities in Syria are either partially functioning or not functioning at all.

The proportion of people living in extreme poverty in Syria (less than US$1.90 per day) doubled from 34% pre-crisis to nearly 70% today.

6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity in Syria.

More than 5.6 million people, including 2.7 million children, have been living as registered refugees in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey since the onset of the conflict.

15,syria,"The U.S. has a number of actions in responding to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, but it's a more difficult challenge than ""just kind of firing ready, aim here,"" said CBS News Radio military analyst Mike Lyons. But most importantly, Mr. Trump's ""got to be careful not to get goaded into doing something that's not in the best interest of the United States,"" Lyons told CBSN's Meg Oliver Tuesday.

""I think as more time is going on, that window is closing for some kind of response that's going to make any difference on the ground,"" Lyons said, noting that it still needs to be proven if it was a chemical attack.

Reports out of Syria suggest dozens of people were killed in rebel stronghold Douma, near Damascus, on Saturday in attack using chemical weapons. Initial reports from the humanitarian group known as the White Helmets and Syrian American Medical Society indicated that chlorine gas might have been the agent used.

Last year, the U.S. launched 59 tomahawk missiles on a Syrian base that was believed to have launched a chemical attack. Lyons called that response ""small"" and recommended Mr. Trump think ""through whether he wants a tactical response, something quick on the ground, or he's got to think through the strategy hopefully involving our allies.""

The U.S. is still trying to determine what happened in Syria. Mr. Trump, though, tweeted on Sunday ""many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!""

International chemical watchdog groups are on their way into Syria, but Lyons warned that it could be difficult to find remnants of the alleged attack. ""It's hard to make a chemical weapons strike – in most cases, they've come out of helicopters, or planes – you don't want a rocket delivery because it endangers the crew,"" Lyons said.

Lyons said the U.S. is searching for that ""Cuban Missile Crisis moment, where they show the world that Russia is involved."" But, he cautioned, Russia will most likely deny any involvement, and the longer the wait for a response, the less likely remnants will be around.

16,syria,"Funding required: $25.27 B

Funding received: $6.26 B

Funding percentage: 24.8%

People in need: 130.6 M

People to receive aid: 95.3 M

Countries affected: 40

As of April 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require US$25.27 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 95.3 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.

Three significant humanitarian resource mobilization events took place in April: the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, 3 April, Geneva, co-hosted by the UN, Sweden and Switzerland, where US$2.01 billion in contributions for 2018 were announced by 40 entities and a further $20.2 million were announced in multi-year funding; the Humanitarian Conference on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 13 April, co-hosted in Geneva by the UN, the Netherlands and the EU, where $528.1 million were pledged by 22 donors for 2018 and a further $38.7 million for 2019-2020; and the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region Brussels II Conference, 24-25 April, co-hosted by the UN and the EU. This drew 36 announcements of humanitarian funding totalling $4.4 billion for 2018 and an additional $3.4 billion for 2019-2020.

The humanitarian funding outlook for the protracted, entrenched humanitarian crisis in DPRK is particularly concerning, with a persistent risk that geo-political tension – even with the recent positive developments – could dampen funding. 10.3 million people in DPRK are estimated to be undernourished. More than one-quarter of children are stunted and 4% wasted, while about 30% of women of reproductive age are anaemic. The lack of safe water and the poor sanitation contribute to high levels of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, which are the most common causes of death among young children. The 2018 Needs and Priorities Plan released in April calls for $111 million to provide food assistance, health and nutrition services and improved access to safe water and sanitation for 6 million highly vulnerable people.

On 20 April, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine briefed Member States in New York on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people after four years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Disrupted access to critical facilities and diminished livelihoods mean that 3.4 million people are without basic supplies and services and need protection and life-saving assistance. Ukraine has the highest proportion of elderly people affected by humanitarian crisis in the world. Some 1.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced across the country, and some 200,000 live in daily fear of shelling. Funding for the HRP is urgently needed.

In 2018, as many as 7 million people in South Sudan need humanitarian assistance to cope with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and grave protection violations including conflict-related sexual violence. This is the world’s third largest refugee crisis: more than 4.2 million people have been displaced, including 1.8 million IDPs and more than 2.4 million refugees.

Severe food insecurity continues to rise as people are unable to plant or harvest and have limited access to humanitarian assistance. With the lean season beginning in May, urgent funding is required to save lives and resources. On 27 April, the DSRSG/RC/HC for South Sudan formally invited the USG to support him in delivering three key messages when he visits the country in mid-May. Namely, calling for a sustainable political solution to the conflict to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis, with IGAD-led peace talks expected to resume in May; urging parties to the conflict, including the numerous splinter groups, to address the insecurity that affects civilians and aid workers; and advocating for resources towards the HRP which is currently funded at 21%.

Humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic have increased from 2.2 million people in need in early 2017 to 2.5 million this year, with a multiplication of hotspots. The spike in tensions and armed violence that erupted in April is also affecting the capital, Bangui. Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70% over the first quarter of 2017, and the number of refugees increased by 30%; effectively, 25% of Central Africans are currently displaced either as IDPs or refugees. Underfunding remains one of the biggest impediments to stepping up the humanitarian response. By end April 2018 the HRP had received less than 10 per cent of its $515.6 million requirements.

By 30 April, 21 donors had contributed a combined $278 million (including pledges) to 17 country-based pooled funds (CBPFs), which translated into financial support for 308 humanitarian projects implemented by 229 partners. These included international NGOs which received $55.3 million (42% of total budget allocations) while UN agencies received $42.6 million (32% of allocations). Support to national NGOs included $33.6 million (25% of allocations) and to the Red Cross / Crescent movement $0.6 million (0.5% of total allocations). The largest amounts were channelled to Yemen ($77.9 million), the whole of Syria response ($41.7 million), Sudan ($28.2 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($26.5 million). New reserve allocations were launched by the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (HF) for $16.2 million and by the occupied Palestinian territories HF for $2.2 million, on top of its first standard allocation of the year for $3.9 million, to respond to immediate health and protection needs in the Gaza Strip. The Turkey HF launched a second reserve allocation for $4 million to cover urgent life-saving needs of people displaced inside besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria.",2018 Humanitarian Funding Update (as of April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2018-humanitarian-funding-update-april-2018
17,syria,"As Syria’s war grinds along in its seventh year of fighting, the conflict is entering an ominous new phase as President Bashar Assad’s forces step up their offensive operations and the broader proxy war intensifies between several nation states, including Iran and Israel. Assad’s forces have secured the upper hand on the battlefield and are concentrating their efforts in clearing out remaining areas of opposition influence around Damascus. In the coming weeks, look for Assad to focus on eliminating remaining pockets of opposition control around Rastan in the north and in southwestern Syria near the Jordanian border.

At that point, Assad will face an important choice. Does he try to regain control of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, where thousands of civilians and militants fleeing other conflict zones have moved, and where radical groups such as Fatah Sham, which is Al Qaeda in Syria, control large parts of the province? Or does he instead turn east to contest U.S. backed-Kurdish forces and try to regain large portions of the country’s critical oil infrastructure? The latest estimate is that Kurdish forces control territory, including oil and gas fields in eastern Syria, that accounts for about 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. These resources will be critical to the regime’s long-term reconstruction project.

Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Iran in Syria have reached a dangerous new level in recent weeks. In early April, Israel reportedly fired missiles at a Syrian airbase and killed seven Iranians. There are also reports that late Sunday night Israel may have struck military bases used by Iran and its proxy militias near Hama and Aleppo, killing additional Iranians. This comes on the heels of claims by Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisWe should oppose Gina Haspel's CIA nomination because of her torture record Overnight Defense: Inside the House's 7B defense policy bill | Bill would authorize Trump's military parade, halt weapons sales to Turkey, allow sanctions waivers for allies with Russian weapons | SEALs discharged over drug use Defense bill would allow sanctions waivers for some allies buying Russian weapons MORE that Iran is strengthening its military footprint in Syria and using the country as a platform to transfer increasingly advanced weapons to Hezbollah.

Senior Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that Israel will not accept a large Iranian military presence on its border, and are reportedly now bracing for an Iranian response to the recent missile strikes. So, the potential for a clash between Israel and Iran in Syria has increased sharply of late. It’s worth considering that such a confrontation could escalate quickly and trigger direct attacks inside both Israel and Iran. It could also spill beyond Syria’s borders to Lebanon and Iraq, potentially drawing in Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq.

If all this is not sufficiently worrisome, Turkey’s recent military operations in northwestern Syria around Afrin, as well as Ankara’s on again, off again cooperation with Washington on the final disposition of the strategically important area around the city of Manbij, located just west of the Euphrates River, adds yet another level of complexity to the situation. If Turkey’s overarching objective is to expand its buffer zone to its entire southern border with Syria, we should anticipate additional clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces in the coming months.

Even as the increasingly fraught military situation in Syria absorbs most of the world’s attention, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The latest reliable estimates are that nearly 500,000 Syrians have died thus far in the conflict, and nearly half of Syria’s population before the war is now displaced or seeking asylum outside the country. In fact, according to the United Nations, more than 13 million of Syria’s current population of 18 million people are now dependent on humanitarian assistance. So, in my view, it’s crystal clear that the war that Assad unleashed on his own population more than seven years ago and that external actors, especially Iran and Russia, have fueled, seems poised to enter an ominous next stage. Is there anything that U.S. policymakers might do now to prepare for the next chapter in this conflict?

First, U.S. policymakers might want to delay the timeline for drawing down U.S. forces in Syria. The fight against ISIS in eastern Syria is not yet over, and the removal of U.S. forces could allow ISIS to reconstitute in the no man’s land along the border between Iraq and Syria, potentially jeopardizing the security of Iraq and eventually Jordan. The presence of a limited number of U.S. troops also increases America’s ability to target Al Qaeda elements in western Syria, and does provide, in my view, diplomatic leverage over both the Assad regime and Moscow, which will be critical during future negotiations to end the conflict. In addition, a sudden removal of U.S. forces could put at risk the Syrian Democratic Forces backed by the United States, who were instrumental in the recapture of Raqqa, and who in the absence of U.S. military support will likely become a target for the Assad regime and its allies.

Second, given the recent spike in tensions between Israel and Iran, U.S. policymakers may want to think carefully about ways, including direct messaging to both countries, to limit the potential for that confrontation to spread beyond Syria’s borders, and about U.S. options if that should unfortunately occur. Finally, U.S. policymakers might want to reconsider all of America’s options for tackling the deepening humanitarian nightmare in Syria, from providing increased relief assistance to rethinking the handling of Syria’s displaced population. The situation on the ground will not improve for the foreseeable future, and it is not an exaggeration to say that an entire generation of Syria’s children are at risk.

Despite periodic claims to the contrary, there has never been, nor likely will ever be, an easy policy solution to the Syria crisis. But make no mistake, the conflict is getting worse on many levels and could spark an even broader regional crisis soon. It is incumbent on leaders across the globe to avoid the temptation to look away, and to instead redouble their efforts to identify creative diplomatic options to reduce tensions, minimize civilian casualties, prevent the further use of chemical weapons, and mitigate as much as possible the humanitarian fallout from an international crisis with no end in sight.
