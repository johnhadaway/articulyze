Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced on the 16th February that former British diplomat Martin Griffiths would be the new UN Envoy for Yemen. Griffiths previously served as an adviser to three special envoys to Syria.

Whilst there were no significant changes in the conflict lines in February, the situation has remained volatile, particularly in Al Hudaydah, Sa'ada, and Aden governorates. Violence is raging along the western coast, with the frontline moving north, and resulting in 100,000 new displacements this month. Internally displaced people (IDPs) move north from Mokha towards Al Hudaydah and Haiz and some displacements are also taking place further south. The continuation of the conflict has led to a challenging operating environment, and poses ongoing threats to movement, making the delivery of supplies difficult and hindering monitoring visits.

The killing and maiming of 53 and 92 children, respectively, was documented and verified this month in 12 governorates. Child casualties have increased by three-fold in Al Hudaydah. Cases of recruitment and use of children in armed conflict are still under verification yet thus far, the Country Task Force of Monitoring and Reporting documented and verified 19 cases of recruitment and use of boys in 11 governorates in February. Additionally, five attacks on schools and hospitals were verified in Taiz compared to two attacks in January. Meanwhile, nearly three quarters of public school teachers, mainly in the north of the country, have not received their salaries in over a year. This has disrupted schooling and contributed to a 20 per cent increase in the number of out-of-school children, from 1.6 million before the war to 2 million today.

With 18,470 new cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/suspected cholera in February, the number of new cases continues to gradually decline (the weekly number of cases has decreased again for the 25th consecutive week). Despite this, the risk of another outbreak looms large with the rainy season expected to begin in parts of the country by April. UNICEF's new focus in the AWD/suspected cholera response will is now on response to IDPs on the frontlines of conflict. In addition to this, there has been a sharp rise in the cases of diphtheria in the country. By the end of the month, a total of 1,216 probable cases were reported with 73 associated deaths, a case fatality rate of 5.9%.",https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018
1,yemen,"Ahead of the upcoming international fundraising conference for Yemen, the United Nations has received nearly $1 billion contributions from Saudi Araba and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), urging other donors to follow suit and help tackle the world’s worst humanitarian crisis there.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his deep gratitude for the $930 million provided on Tuesday evening by the two donor countries to the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.

“I would like to take this occasion to appeal to all the other donors who will be meeting in Geneva next week… to follow the same generosity” shown by the two countries, the UN chief told reporters at the world body’s New York Headquarters, after meeting with Prince Mohamad Bin Salman Al Saud, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince.

“These funds cover almost one-third of the $2.96 billion required to implement the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, which will enable the United Nations and its partners to help alleviate the suffering of millions of vulnerable people across Yemen,” read a statement issued by Mr. Guterres’ office, following the signing of the memorandum on the voluntary contributions.

More than 22 million people in Yemen require humanitarian aid or protection assistance, including 2 million who are internally displaced due to the ongoing conflict between the Government and rebel forces.

On 3 April, donors will meet in the humanitarian pledging conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

In his meeting with the Crown Prince, who is also First Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister, Mr. Guterres said “to give to those in need is a central pillar of Islam,” noting that two-thirds of the refugees are Muslims and are received by Muslim countries.

The Secretary-General and the Crown Prince discussed the obligations of all parties to the conflict under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the critical need for humanitarian access across the country and for all of Yemen’s ports to remain open to both humanitarian and commercial movement.

They also discussed the need for the parties to the conflict to work towards a negotiated political settlement through inclusive intra-Yemeni dialogue.

Mr. Guterres expressed the UN’s readiness to work together with Saudi Arabia for these objectives.

The Case Against the Yemen Intervention

The case for US Support of the Saudi intervention in Yemen rests on two assumptions, that the US is a moderating force in the campaign, preventing further death and destruction, and that the war is a regional proxy struggle against a revisionist Iran. Both assumptions are erroneous, the war is anything but ‘moderated’ and before the intervention, the link between the Houthi rebels and Iran was tenuous at best. Moreover, I argue that to give Iran the sole title of destabilizing power obscures more than it reveals.

In 2012, the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, resigned, handing over the power to his Deputy Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. This was not a smooth transition, and this failure led to the current unrest in Yemen. Moreover, the involvement of Saudi Arabia has created further instability in the country.

While Saudi Arabia accused Iran of providing arms to Houthi rebels and called on the UN Security Council for the imposition of an arms embargo on Iran, it has spent billions in weaponry mostly made by the U.S. and the U.K. to use against Yemen. No one can deny the Saudi government’s atrocities against innocent Yemeni people. According to the UN, out of over 29 million population, approximately one-third are on the verge of famine which has been described as “the biggest famine in the world.” Some 17 million people (60% of the population) are suffering from severe food and water shortages. The Saudis purposefully installed a blockade aimed at stopping the Houthi rebels, preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions of Yemeni people, based on a UN report.

The Saudi- led coalition is comprised seven countries: Egypt, United Arab Emirate, Bahrain, Jordan, Pakistan, Sudan and Kuwait, is supported by the United States, Britain, and Australia. In March of 2015, the coalition launched a bombing campaign against Houthi militias with the objective of restoring Hadi’s presidency. Overall, tens of thousands of people have been killed, suffered from starvation or cholera, including hundreds of children’s deaths, according to the UN.

While Saudi Arabia accused Iran of controlling Houthis militias in Yemen to justify its war, there is very little evidence to support its claim. Iranian authorities deny supporting the rebels and have even discouraged them from capturing Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. In response to the Saudi’s claim, Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswomen for the National Security Council said that “It remains our assessment that Iran does not exert command and control over the Houthis in Yemen.” Moreover, a U.S. intelligence official said, “It is wrong to think of the Houthis as a proxy force for Iran… Yemen’s chaos is a civil war, not a battleground for regional conflict between Iran and the Sunni-ruled Gulf states,” The Huffington Post has reported. Conversely, Saudi Arabia, with its radical Islam ideology supports Sunni extremists has emerged as “the Middle East’s Biggest Danger.”

A Destabilizing Power?

In the 72nd session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, the Saudi delegate expressed his appreciation to Canada for the sponsorship of a draft resolution tabled against five member states, including Iran and Syria, for violation of human rights, underscoring his support of the draft. In response, the Syrian delegate referred to Saudi Wahhabism as “a weapon of mass destruction.” Despite some reforms, such as ending the ban on women driving and allowing them to join the army or anti-corruption measures, Saudi Arabia still remains an autocratic and repressive regime. Yet, Saudi Arabia’s horrific record on human rights abuses, including beheading, is barely covered. Within the kingdom, there is no gender equality and women do not enjoy the same rights as men do. There is no freedom of the press and numerous human rights activists and bloggers that have run afoul of the regime are in prison.

How could Canada sponsor draft resolutions against some Member States, yet overlook Saudi violation of human rights nationwide and worldwide, their destabilizing role in the Middle East, and their involvement in supporting and funding global terrorism including extremist Wahhabism, the origin of several Jihadist groups? How can the United States turn a blind eye to the Saudi government’s inhumane and illegal practices? According to Senator Bob Graham, the former Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, 28 classified pages of the 2002 Congressional Joint Inquiry suggest, “a strong linkage between [the Sep 11] terrorists and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Saudi charities, and other Saudi stakeholders.” Yet, notwithstanding the crimes committed by Saudi Arabia, the Saudis maintain good relations with the two major powers, the U.S. and the U.K. Surprisingly, neither has censured the Saudi government, but rather have signed arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The UK’s BAE Systems has sold 48 typhoon fighters to Saudi Arabia worth € 43 billion, adding to 72 jet fighters.

There was “nothing new” in CBS’ 60 minutes regarding Mohammad Bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince, viewed as the de facto leader. Bin Salman’s remarks were too insignificant to resolve any current crisis; rather, his belligerent language and incendiary rhetoric against Iran and Lebanon signify his antagonistic attitude, contributing to “playing an increasingly destabilizing role” in the region. Houthis’ connection with Iran is exaggerated “without providing solid evidence,” giving Saudi Arabia more justification to intervene in Yemen. The U.S, the U.K, France, and other major powers should halt its support of Saudi Arabian campaign in Yemen. By providing arms support to the Saudis, the powerful states, in fact, are contributing to the deaths of thousands of civilians including children in Yemen. What is Saudi Arabia’s motivation? It is not humanitarian aid, but a political machination to exert its influence and dominance in the region.

As with any conflict situation, people flee violence and leave everything behind. They end up in desperate need of shelter, food, water, sanitation and access to health services. They are also more likely to be exposed to protection risks, including human rights abuses and gender-based violence.

The camp did not feel like a refuge, in a parched patch of nowhere by a bare, black hill. There was nothing in the way of distractions for the displaced people sheltering in tents here, like a playground, a store, a cafe; nothing to prevent thoughts drifting to the war and the dead.

Three years had passed since his father was killed by Yemeni rebels known as the Houthis, but Azzam Shalif seethed at a memory still fresh. They had snatched his father, a teacher, from in front of his house. There had been long and tortured negotiations to reclaim the body. Then there was disbelief when his father, disfigured beyond recognition, was finally brought home.

Now Shalif, who fled and ended up in the camp in a government-controlled area, referred to the parts of Yemen dominated by the Houthis as “enemy” — a classification that included his home town and even his own relatives who had joined the rebels. “The enemy doesn’t understand the word dialogue,” he said when asked how the war might end.

“We have an enemy that doesn’t want any solution,” he said.

Such resentments have pooled in Marib, a pocket of relative, if uneasy, stability that has received tens of thousands of people fleeing battlefields across Yemen during more than three years of civil conflict.

The war has been defined by the terrible violence that the combatants have inflicted on civilians and by a humanitarian crisis called the most severe in the world. It has dark shades of a proxy struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and has caused rising consternation in foreign capitals, including Washington, where a group of lawmakers last week condemned the Trump administration’s involvement in a ruinous conflict by providing military and intelligence assistance to the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis.

[U.S. is resisting calls to end its support for Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s war]

The strains on Yemeni society have been less apparent — the divisions and antipathies that will make it difficult for people to live together again even if the armies stop.





A trip to Marib for journalists this month was organized by the Saudi military, which hoped to showcase what the Saudi government says are its effort to provide aid and financial assistance to Yemen. The trip was also intended to blunt a resilient criticism: that the Saudi-led military coalition backing Yemen’s government bears much of the responsibility for the humanitarian disaster because of its imposition of an air, sea and land blockade.

Yemen’s cities have been scarred or destroyed by Saudi airstrikes or Houthi shelling. But a building boom is underway in Marib city, the capital of Marib province, and there is regular electricity and plenty of fuel. Restaurants have opened and classes are full at the local university. A well-stocked hospital is one of the few able to operate normally in the entire country.

Abd-Rabbo Moftah, the deputy governor, said Marib had “benefited” as Yemenis, including business executives, had flocked to the city and invested there. Others who were displaced found jobs in construction. Together, “they feel they are part of the city,” he said.

But the calm could be deceptive.

Rockets still fall on the city, fired from static front lines a few dozen miles away. A rebel ambush recently destroyed a truck traveling on the highway on the city’s outskirts. The pressures weighing on Marib’s new arrivals were unmistakable: the wrenching separation from families and homes and the hardening animus toward fellow Yemenis who happened to be on the other side of the conflict.

Omran Ammar, a baby-faced soldier guarding a front-line position on a mountaintop overlooking rebel-held territory, said he had been at the same post for about two years, since he was 18 years old. A few times since the war began, he had managed to travel home, across the front lines into rebel territory. But he was happiest at the front, he said, while offering to show reporters decaying corpses of rebel fighters.

He had come from a family of farmers, but now all fought on the government’s side. His duty, as Ammar saw it, was “defending my religion, my honor,” from the rebels. To that end, “I would kill anyone,” he said. “Even my own brother.”

Badr Sharif, 30, stood nearby as the soldier spoke. “We feel sorry. We don’t want to be in this situation. But what can you do?” he said. Sharif, who was studying oil and gas management overseas before the war, now accompanied his brother, a Yemeni official, on his regular visits to the front line.

In the distance was Sanaa, the capital, controlled by the Houthis — a military objective for these soldiers that raised the specter of another sacked Yemeni city. “We don’t want to crush Sanaa,” Sharif said. “Many people are suffering.”

[Yemen’s war is so out of control, allies are turning on one another]

In Marib, there were frequent expressions of gratitude to the Saudi government, which has long been a financial benefactor to the province and its tribes. “They are the only people that helped us,” said Ahmed al-

Dhibaa, a member of an Islamist party that was fiercely opposed to the Houthis, who sat in a bare tent in a Saudi-financed camp.

There were appeals for unity, too, but they were more fleeting. “We are all Yemenis,” people were fond of saying, before insisting that the rebels were “animals” who regarded their enemies as terrorists.

(Kareem Fahim/The Washington Post)

Many have concluded that a division of Yemen, perhaps into federal states, is inevitable, even preferable, to resolve its competing grievances. In southern Yemen, there are renewed calls for secession from northern rulers accused of decades of repression and neglect. North and South Yemen were separate states until 1990, and four years later, they fought a brief civil war.

But even formal division requires some sort of national agreement. And over the past three years, a lengthening tally of perceived wrongs had made such agreement more elusive than

ever before.

The greatest fear is that religious sectarianism between Sunni and Shiite Muslims — the kind of acrimony that has ravaged Iraq — could take hold in Yemen, where such divisions are largely unfamiliar, and that the sectarian nature of the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran could rub off. The Sunni leaders of Saudi Arabia have backed Yemen’s Sunni government forces, while the Shiite government of Iran has backed the Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite group.

The worries accumulate with each assassination, airstrike, car-bomb explosion or kidnapping. Near the front line on the road to Sanaa, someone had painted “No to sectarianism” on the side of a mountain, in what seemed like a warning to soldiers consumed by the most vicious of fights.

“When this fighting takes on religious aspects, it cannot be solved,” said Mohamed el-Sabry, a professor of English at the local university who is originally from Taiz in western Yemen.

Lately, he had encouraged his students to talk about the conflict. “They are worried about their relatives. . . . They are worried about home,” he said. He also taught George Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” which seemed to resonate among pupils fed up with the failures of Yemen’s politicians, many of whom reside comfortably in villas overseas. “This party says they are fighting for us, then that party says they are fighting for us,” he said.

Some of his despairing students have given up hope. “They replaced our dreams, and everything is destroyed,” said Mohammed Mohsin, 24.

“Nothing is as it was,” he said. “There was no advantage to this war.”

6,yemen,"Congress Sours on Saudi Arabia Over Yemen

As Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen enters its fourth year, U.S. lawmakers from both parties are running out of patience with a campaign that has left thousands of civilians dead and helped trigger one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

A concerted White House lobbying effort last week helped defeat a resolution in Congress that would have halted U.S. military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, but Riyadh’s troubles on Capitol Hill are far from over.

A top secret briefing from the U.S. Defense Department, direct appeals from Defense Secretary James Mattis, and phone calls from the White House were enough to avert an embarrassing political outcome in the congressional vote. Still, 44 senators voted for the resolution, sponsored by Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont; Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut; and Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah.

Even lawmakers who opposed the bill blasted Saudi Arabia for failing to do more to end the war and open access to humanitarian aid.

While Saudi Arabia may have dodged a bullet, the political climate in Congress is moving in a hostile direction for the kingdom — and another, more moderate bill aimed at curbing carte blanche U.S. support for the war in Yemen remains on the table.

Four separate congressional votes over the past three years, including last week’s measure, point to deep and growing dissatisfaction with Saudi Arabia. Two U.S. arms sales narrowly won approval, and a proposal allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for damages passed with enough votes to overcome a veto from former President Barack Obama in 2016.

“The temperature is rising,” says Scott Paul, a senior humanitarian policy advisor for Oxfam America. “This is now on a trajectory that’s been in place for three years.”

Despite the congressional mood, President Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, during his visit to Washington last week.

“The relationship is probably the strongest it’s ever been,” Trump told reporters as he sat down with the Saudi heir apparent for lunch.

The Saudis seem to agree. Riyadh has a particularly sympathetic ear in the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The Intercept reported that the crown prince privately boasted Kushner was “in his pocket.”

Shortly after the crown prince paid a visit to the White House, the administration unveiled a major arms sale to Riyadh worth more than $1 billion.

Meanwhile, Houthi rebels — who control much of western Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa, and are alleged to have Iranian-supplied missiles — have stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia. On Sunday night, Houthi rebels launched seven missiles into the kingdom. Saudi Arabia says it intercepted all the missiles, but one person was killed by shrapnel, and video appears to show that the Patriot defense systems didn’t work as well as claimed.

Both the Trump administration and aid organizations working in Yemen sharply condemned the attacks. Yet there’s also concern such attacks could serve as a pretext for Saudi Arabia to ramp up the war.

“These unlawful attacks must not be used as an excuse by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to indiscriminately attack civilians or further exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis,” says Samah Hadid of Amnesty International.

Another bipartisan bill in the Senate aims to tackle just that. Republican Todd Young of Indiana and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are spearheading the effort for the proposed legislation, which is expected to be taken up by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next month.

The bill would require the State Department to certify whether the Saudi-led coalition is taking steps to expand access for food, fuel, and medicine shipments to Yemen; undertaking “an urgent and good faith effort” to pursue a diplomatic settlement of the civil war; and demonstrating it is reducing the risk of civilian casualties in its bombing campaign.

“This will create leverage for the administration and pressure on the Saudis that does not exist today,” a Senate aide says.

Unlike the resolution backed by Sanders and Lee last week, Young and Shaheen’s bill does not propose an immediate halt to U.S. military assistance for the Saudi air war in Yemen. Critics say this latest proposal of undercutting the legislation that failed last week with much less ambitious requirements.

But proponents say this new bill has a better chance of securing support from both sides of the aisle, including from the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee.

Corker opposed the Sanders-Lee resolution last week but promised to hold a hearing on Yemen next month. Corker says he and other lawmakers conveyed a stern message to the crown prince in talks last week and “strongly pushed back on what is happening right now in Yemen and asked them to take strong corrective actions.”

The White House has not stated its position on the new bill, but like with previous administrations, officials oppose any attempt to curtail the executive branch’s freedom of action.

“The United States is taking a number of actions to help the Saudi-led coalition support the Yemeni government and defend Saudi territory while minimizing civilian casualties,” says a State Department spokesperson, including providing equipment and training and advising the Saudi military.

“Without U.S. support and training, it is likely the rate of civilian casualties would increase,” the spokesperson says.

The Saudis and their Persian Gulf allies launched bombing raids in March 2015 hoping to reinstall President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, and the U.S. military has provided intelligence and aerial refueling for coalition aircraft. As civilian casualties have mounted and relief officials have warned of an imminent famine, both the Barack Obama and Trump administrations have pleaded for patience from Congress.

After three years, the arguments are beginning to ring hollow with frustrated lawmakers.

Despite U.S. advice and support, the air war continues to exact a brutal toll on civilians, and lawmakers say repeated Saudi pledges to ease the humanitarian crisis have produced little concrete results. Aid agencies say a de facto Saudi naval blockade has helped fuel a spike in deadly diseases, including 1 million suspected cases of cholera.

Congressional staffers say the Trump administration’s arguments against the resolution last week were almost identical to the case made by officials during Obama’s tenure.

The White House, State Department, and Pentagon argue that halting U.S. military support would damage relations with Riyadh and undercut Washington’s influence, call into question U.S. credibility by abandoning an Arab ally, and place civilians at even more risk without any U.S. advisory role in the air campaign.

“The talking points don’t change,” a Democratic congressional aide says.",http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/26/saudi-arabia-faces-strong-headwinds-in-congress-over-yemen/
7,yemen,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) head of mission Djoen Besselink recently returned from Yemen, where he witnessed how the country’s pervasive conflict has affected nearly every aspect of Yemeni life. Here he describes the situation.

Even before the war, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. Now the war is everywhere, affecting every aspect of people’s lives. Cities and villages have been destroyed. Many people haven’t been paid for the last year and a half. We see a lot of malnutrition and food insecurity because it’s not just about the availability of food, it’s about the money. There are goods to buy in the markets, but people can’t afford them. It’s a disastrous situation.

You can’t speak of a normal life in Yemen. People don’t have time to recover from one crisis before the next ones hit them. It’s crisis on top of crisis. You have the armed conflict; the economic situation, where health workers haven’t been paid; you have outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria; and you have the blockade preventing vital supplies from entering the country. Everything is related and comes on top of the previous problems, but nothing is ever solved. And this has horrible consequences for the people. Yemenis are trapped in this many-layered crisis.

A Crippled Health System

It’s all related. Health workers are not paid, so they flee the country or stop working, and the health system, already crippled by a lack of supplies and stock, collapses. Because their salaries have been stopped, people have no money. So they can’t pay for private care and have to go to the free services, like those provided by MSF.

But then the free clinics are overwhelmed and can’t respond to the massive needs. For example, when I arrived in the country, an MSF maternity hospital would have 200 deliveries per month. But one month we had 1,000 [deliveries], with some people walking nine hours to reach us. But the clinic was only built to deliver 500 babies a month. So some days we were forced to close the doors because we had run out of space.

Deadly Outbreaks

The diphtheria and cholera outbreaks are also a consequence of this. If you have a strong health system, then when cases of cholera or diphtheria appear you can isolate them and prevent the diseases from spreading. Cholera is endemic in Yemen, which means it comes back every few years. But in its current state the health system couldn’t absorb the cases, so MSF had to set up seven cholera treatment centers. We treated over 100,000 cases last year.

In Europe, when you are a child you get vaccinated against diphtheria, so the disease has been eradicated. But in Yemen, with the health system falling apart, people are not getting vaccinated and they get infected.

Addressing Massive Needs

Yemen is one of the largest MSF projects in the world. But that, of course, is not a good sign. It means the needs are very big. We have a huge impact in Yemen simply because we are the only organization providing medical care in most of areas where we work. But sometimes the magnitude of the need is too great and we have to make difficult choices. For me, that’s the biggest challenge: the vastness of the needs.

The situation was very difficult when I arrived in Yemen and it still is. It’s a combination of a lack of access to the people in need and increasing medical needs, as well as a lack of other organizations responding. As MSF, we are not there to find a political solution or end the conflict. We provide medical care.

In the last two years we’ve treated a lot of patients, and the numbers are not decreasing. Based on our experience, the conflict is not declining either. We saw massive spikes in violence in different parts of the country. We are working less than a kilometer from the front line in some areas. Four of our facilities have been hit by airstrikes—one hit close to our medical facility last December and destroyed part of the emergency room. We had to stay in the basement for two weeks in November 2017 when fighting escalated in Sanaa.

Untold Stories

The impact on the population is the side of the story that is missing from most media coverage. They talk about organizations leaving the country and the conflict, but everything has an impact on Yemenis, and they don’t explain that. They don’t explain that when people are not paid, they can’t get medicines or vaccines. The blockade of Yemen’s ports has increased prices and that has caused a lack of both food and water, which affects hygiene conditions. Everything seems to be about politics. But what does it all mean for normal people?

People survive because they have no other choice. They can’t leave. They are forced to live in these conditions. People just try to get to work or to the market to get food, and not get hurt along the way.

People are selling their cars, their jewelry to get the money they need to survive . . . But you can only sell it once, right? There is an informal social safety net, where people help each other. But living a good quality life is very difficult.

The same is true for MSF’s Yemeni staff. They are constantly afraid of what could happen to them or to their families at home while they are working. People are constantly scared because the fighting can start any moment. I once asked a colleague how they deal with the conflict. They just answered: “We duck our heads and continue. There is no other option.” They are the people we support and our staff at the same time.

(ANSAmed) - ROME, MARCH 26 - The people of Yemen are fighting for survival without access to food and clean water, three years since the start of one of the most atrocious conflicts in recent history, said Oxfam in a statement on the crisis in the country.



It said 22 million people there depend on humanitarian aid, and the price of many food items has become unsustainable.



The price of rice, for example, has risen 131%, and nearly 18 million people are going hungry.



Behind all of this is a brutal war that has caused more than 5,500 civilian deaths and forced three million people to flee their homes. With half of the health facilities destroyed or out of service, the country is facing the largest outbreak of cholera in recent decades, with more than one million cases and another 2,000 deaths, Oxfam said.



It said 80% of the population is in urgent need of aid, making Yemen ""the world's worst humanitarian crisis"".



Oxfam said it is working to provide clean water and food in nine of the country's governorates. (ANSAmed).

(CNN) The Middle East today is poised between multiple wars fueling extremism and a burgeoning younger generation looking for a new start.

Prince Mohammed has presented himself as a voice of moderation at home. But abroad, the story is different.

When the White House rolls out the red carpet for the newly empowered crown prince this week, President Trump must prioritize holding him accountable for his country's conduct on the world stage, starting with Yemen.

Yemen presents a catastrophic case study of what can happen when the center cannot hold. The country is consumed by at least five ""mini-states"" at varying degrees of conflict with one another. Their conduct is ruthless and feeds radicalism, but the main players are deaf to pleas from the outside world to end the killing.

Saudi Arabia is not the only culprit in Yemen's descent into hell, but it is the most powerful player. While the Houthis are also guilty, nothing justifies the Saudi-led three-year bombing campaign that has destroyed hospitals and schools and killed countless civilians.

Since December's White House call to end the suffering, the Saudi-led coalition has, according to the Yemen Data Project, carried out over 860 airstrikes in Yemen - one strike roughly every 100 minutes. More than one-third of these have struck civilians, including markets, farms and schools.

Riyadh has generously pledged almost $1 billion to the UN aid appeal for Yemen. But Saudi Arabia cannot play both arsonist and firefighter. Its behavior is damaging Saudi and American reputations, without making the region more secure. Instead, al Qaeda exploits the chaos to expand its foothold in Yemen, and Iran gains clout.

Saudi Arabia's de facto and longstanding blockade of Yemen's main Hodeidah port is, in spite of recent modifications, still preventing large quantities of food, fuel and medicine from reaching millions of people. Commercial flights to the country's main Sana'a airport have been similarly blocked for over 18 months.

A UN panel of experts recently accused Saudi Arabia of using the threat of starvation as a weapon of war.

Our staff from the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council work every day to navigate a byzantine set of inspections and impediments to assist communities in desperate need. Just to travel between the country's two main cities, Aden to Sana'a, humanitarian agencies have to pass through more than 70 checkpoints. And spiking fuel prices due to low supply make the drive more expensive than ever. Several major medical suppliers have already stopped direct deliveries to Yemen, forcing organizations like ours to find alternative and complicated arrangements.

President Trump needs to make Saudi conduct in Yemen a priority in his talks. Three concrete steps are essential.

First, Trump must bring Saudi Arabia to its senses: Piling human suffering on the people of Yemen is not strategic or defensible. Instead, commercial, civilian and humanitarian supplies need to flow freely to all parts of Yemen. This includes granting visas to aid workers and letting UN inspectors do their jobs. It also means demanding a permanent opening all Red Sea ports to commercial imports. The White House's past efforts that resulted in the blockade's temporary lifting proved half measures at best.

Second, President Trump must publicly commit US support to international efforts to restart peace talks. This includes empowering the new UN Special Envoy, and a new UN Security Council resolution that reflects current conflict dynamics, offers a more realistic framework for negotiations without preconditions and demands an immediate ceasefire. Without a political settlement, the human suffering will plummet to new depths and continue to overwhelm responders like IRC and NRC.

Finally, Yemen needs more than a war economy. Aid organizations cannot be a substitute. This means replenishing hard currency reserves in Yemen's Central Bank as promised, and paying essential civil servants.

The US has a unique ability to influence Riyadh's actions. There have been some good words, but so far no effect. This is the moment for Saudi Arabia's closest ally to save it from further destruction, and the chaos that follows in its wake.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/19/opinions/president-trump-bin-salman-yemen-opinion-miliband-intl/index.html
10,yemen,"Watch the MSF Field Report

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) head of mission Djoen Besselink recently returned from Yemen, where he witnessed how the country’s pervasive conflict has affected nearly every aspect of Yemeni life. Here he describes the situation.

Even before the war, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. Now the war is everywhere, affecting every aspect of people’s lives. Cities and villages have been destroyed. Many people haven’t been paid for the last year and a half. We see a lot of malnutrition and food insecurity because it’s not just about the availability of food, it’s about the money. There are goods to buy in the markets, but people can’t afford them. It’s a disastrous situation.

You can’t speak of a normal life in Yemen. People don’t have time to recover from one crisis before the next ones hit them. It’s crisis on top of crisis. You have the armed conflict; the economic situation, where health workers haven’t been paid; you have outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria; and you have the blockade preventing vital supplies from entering the country. Everything is related and comes on top of the previous problems, but nothing is ever solved. And this has horrible consequences for the people. Yemenis are trapped in this many-layered crisis.

A Crippled Health System

It’s all related. Health workers are not paid, so they flee the country or stop working, and the health system, already crippled by a lack of supplies and stock, collapses. Because their salaries have been stopped, people have no money. So they can’t pay for private care and have to go to the free services, like those provided by MSF.

But then the free clinics are overwhelmed and can’t respond to the massive needs. For example, when I arrived in the country, an MSF maternity hospital would have 200 deliveries per month. But one month we had 1,000 [deliveries], with some people walking nine hours to reach us. But the clinic was only built to deliver 500 babies a month. So some days we were forced to close the doors because we had run out of space.

Deadly Outbreaks

The diphtheria and cholera outbreaks are also a consequence of this. If you have a strong health system, then when cases of cholera or diphtheria appear you can isolate them and prevent the diseases from spreading. Cholera is endemic in Yemen, which means it comes back every few years. But in its current state the health system couldn’t absorb the cases, so MSF had to set up seven cholera treatment centers. We treated over 100,000 cases last year.

In Europe, when you are a child you get vaccinated against diphtheria, so the disease has been eradicated. But in Yemen, with the health system falling apart, people are not getting vaccinated and they get infected.

Addressing Massive Needs

Yemen is one of the largest MSF projects in the world. But that, of course, is not a good sign. It means the needs are very big. We have a huge impact in Yemen simply because we are the only organization providing medical care in most of areas where we work. But sometimes the magnitude of the need is too great and we have to make difficult choices. For me, that’s the biggest challenge: the vastness of the needs.

The situation was very difficult when I arrived in Yemen and it still is. It’s a combination of a lack of access to the people in need and increasing medical needs, as well as a lack of other organizations responding. As MSF, we are not there to find a political solution or end the conflict. We provide medical care.

In the last two years we’ve treated a lot of patients, and the numbers are not decreasing. Based on our experience, the conflict is not declining either. We saw massive spikes in violence in different parts of the country. We are working less than a kilometer from the front line in some areas. Four of our facilities have been hit by airstrikes—one hit close to our medical facility last December and destroyed part of the emergency room. We had to stay in the basement for two weeks in November 2017 when fighting escalated in Sanaa.

Untold Stories

The impact on the population is the side of the story that is missing from most media coverage. They talk about organizations leaving the country and the conflict, but everything has an impact on Yemenis, and they don’t explain that. They don’t explain that when people are not paid, they can’t get medicines or vaccines. The blockade of Yemen’s ports has increased prices and that has caused a lack of both food and water, which affects hygiene conditions. Everything seems to be about politics. But what does it all mean for normal people?

People survive because they have no other choice. They can’t leave. They are forced to live in these conditions. People just try to get to work or to the market to get food, and not get hurt along the way.

People are selling their cars, their jewelry to get the money they need to survive . . . But you can only sell it once, right? There is an informal social safety net, where people help each other. But living a good quality life is very difficult.

The same is true for MSF’s Yemeni staff. They are constantly afraid of what could happen to them or to their families at home while they are working. People are constantly scared because the fighting can start any moment. I once asked a colleague how they deal with the conflict. They just answered: “We duck our heads and continue. There is no other option.” They are the people we support and our staff at the same time. Leaving the incredible Yemenis I worked with was not easy.

12,yemen,"ADEN (Reuters) - Suspected al Qaeda militants attacked a military checkpoint in southeastern Yemen, killing at least nine soldiers from a local force backed by a member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the country, an official said on Thursday.

The official said that five suspected militants also died during the gun attack late on Wednesday outside al-Mukala, the Hadramout provincial capital, against a unit of the Hadrami Elite Forces.

The unit was set up and trained by the United Arab Emirates, as part of a strategy to combat al Qaeda, which had exploited a three-year civil war and tried to expand its control in the area before they were driven out.

Hisham al-Jaberi, a local military commander, said at least four other soldiers from the Hadrami Elite Forces were also wounded in the attack in an area called Wadi Hajar.

Al Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), had briefly seized control of Mukalla and several other towns and cities in the neighboring Shabwa, Abyan and al-Bayda provinces. Local forces, backed by the UAE member of the Saudi-led coalition drove them out in a series of military operations over the past two years.

But militants still operate in remote areas in southeastern Yemen, including in Abyan, Shabwa and al-Bayda.

The Saudi-led coalition, which includes the UAE, is fighting in Yemen against Iran-aligned Houthis, who seized large parts of the country in a series of operations that began in late 2014, culminating in forcing the internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee into exile in Saudi Arabia.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/nine-soldiers-five-militants-killed-in-attack-on-elite-yemeni-force-idUSKBN1H51E4

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presents a cheque for $930 million to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at UN headquarters in New York. (AP)

The Arab world's poorest country is in the grips of a stalemated war and what the UN calls the worst humanitarian crisis.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates gave $930 million to UN humanitarian efforts in Yemen on Tuesday as a war between a Saudi-led military coalition and Yemen's rebels enters its fourth year.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented the previously pledged donation to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as the two discussed Yemen.

The Arab world's poorest country is in the grips of a stalemated war and what the UN calls the worst humanitarian crisis, with 22 million people needing aid.

Guterres thanked Prince Mohammed for the contribution, which covers nearly a third of the total the UN is seeking for Yemen humanitarian aid this year.

""On the other hand, we know that there is no humanitarian solution for humanitarian problems,"" Guterres added. ""The solution is political, and we are entirely at your disposal to work together to find a political solution when that becomes possible.""

The UN said Guterres and the Prince also discussed protecting civilians and needs for humanitarian access and open ports.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir called the meeting ""very productive and comprehensive.""

He said the two talked about avoiding foreign intervention in Yemen, particularly from Iran.

Western countries and UN researchers have accused Iran of supplying arms to the Yemeni rebels Houthis. Iran denies it, though a growing body of evidence contradicts the claim.

The US provides logistical support and weaponry to the Saudi-led coalition.

The Houthis and their allies seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September 2014. The war began six months later, with the coalition backing Yemen's internationally recognised government. Over 10,000 people have been killed. On Sunday, the rebels fired a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting Saudi Arabia.

The billionaire philanthropist is rolling out the red carpet for Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who is overseeing the mass starvation and death of children in Yemen.

Despots who happen to be in Washington’s good standing get a pass, no matter how horrific and well-documented their crimes may be.

On the front page of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation website, the philanthropic organization identifies a key priority for disbursing its unparalleled $40.3 billion endowment: “Ensure more children and young people survive and thrive.”

Yet today Bill Gates welcomes Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who is overseeing the mass starvation and death of children in Yemen. As part of his U.S. tour, the crown prince—who also serves as Minister of Defense, among other titles—is slated to travel to Seattle, where Gates is reportedly hosting him on March 30 at a meeting focused on technology.

The visit comes just days after the three-year anniversary of the Saudi-led war on Yemen, which has left nearly all of the country’s children “in desperate need of humanitarian assistance,” according to UNICEF. Abetted by U.S. vessels, a Saudi naval blockade has choked off food and medical supplies, driving a famine and the largest-ever recorded cholera outbreak.

Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition—which includes the United States, United Kingdom and Gulf allies—has unleashed a vicious bombing campaign on Yemen’s civilian infrastructure, hitting hospitals, weddings and funerals. No one knows exactly how many Yemeni civilians have died since the bombing started, but UN estimates usually settle on 10,000. Though this has been the most popular total for over a year now, the actual number is likely much higher, given the difficulty in calculating the number of people killed by bombs, famine and disease.

With U.S. assistance, the Saudi-led coalition has repeatedly bombed schools, in some cases striking the same facility multiple times, suggesting that the schools were intentionally targeted. These attacks are notable in light of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s stated focus on improving education and ensuring that students graduate.

The prince’s visit will not mark the first collaboration between bin Salman and Gates. After meeting with the prince in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh last fall, Gates announced a joint venture with the Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz (MiSK) Foundation to launch a $10 million “Grand Challenges” initiative aimed at fostering “innovation to solve key health and development problems.” (A pitiful sum in its own right, at 0.000006 percent the estimated worth of the Saudi state oil company.)

Gates is not the only prominent figure actively validating and normalizing bin Salman, whose brutal crackdown on his political opponents has garnered him gushing coverage as a “reformer” in the U.S. press. Oprah Winfrey and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger are just some of the people bin Salman was slated to meet, according to a leaked itinerary.

But by laying out the red carpet for bin Salman, Gates is displaying a new level of moral odiousness, as the tech icon has reinvented himself as a philanthropist and dedicated champion of humanity—namely children.

The billionaire has built his foundation’s name on its humanitarian mission and, through that branding, developed a philanthropic empire. As the largest private funder of the World Health Organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has the power to sidestep governments and shape the political agenda of international entities like the United Nations.

It goes without saying that accused war criminals hailing from nations that are geopolitical foes of the United States would not be met with the same warm reception. But despots who happen to be in Washington’s good standing get a pass, no matter how horrific and well-documented their crimes may be. Even the U.S. State Department found in 2016 that the United States, in its support for the Saudi bombing of Yemen, is exposing itself to war crimes prosecution.

Thanks to the dogged work of activists, the Saudi onslaught is increasingly falling out of favor in U.S. Congress, with a recent political push to end U.S. support for the Saudi war narrowly failing in the Senate on March 20. While lawmakers fail to bring an end to the U.S. war, private foundations are even less accountable, beholden only to their internal leadership—safe from any meaningful public control.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation claims it is a responsible steward of the largest endowment in the United States, stating in its code of conduct: “We are honest, fair and trustworthy in our foundation activities and relationships.” Gates’ ongoing relationship with one of the worst perpetrators of child suffering in the world does not inspire confidence that this principle is being followed—at least not in the most baseline moral sense.",http://inthesetimes.com/article/21025/Bill-Gates-Melinda-Founation-Saudi-Prince-Mohammad-bin-Salman-Yemen

The deconfliction mechanism informs the Saudi-Led Coalition (SLC) of humanitarian movements and static locations in Yemen. It aims at ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian premises, personnel, equipment and activities in areas of active military operations (airstrikes, shelling, conflict, etc.). The deconfliction mechanism was established in April 2015 upon the request of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Sana’a to ensure a safe delivery of humanitarian assistance in Yemen.

UNOCHA serves as the conduit between humanitarian organisations that wish to share their data (locations and/or movements information), and the focal point(s) assigned by the Saudi-led Coalition (SLC); Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Committee (EHOC).

Using the deconfliction mechanism does not constitute a legally binding agreement between any of the involved parties, and does not guarantee the safety of personnel, facilities, or sites. OCHA will not verify the data / information provided. Organisations are required to verify the accuracy of their data / information prior to submission to OCHA.

To be noted, the notification of humanitarian locations, activities, movements and personnel to the military through UNOCHA is voluntary. The process of notification is intended to help promote the safety and security of humanitarian locations, activities and personnel but is without prejudice to the responsibility for upholding IHL that lies solely with the warring parties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/deconfliction-mechanism-humanitarian-organisations-operating-yemen-mission-movements
16,yemen,"Common sense would suggest Iran toning down its language and measures as domestic and international pressures increase.

One cannot claim Tehran’s rulers lack common sense, as many accused Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi. The Iranian regime has been in power for four decades and their mentality hinges on pragmatism with the sole objective of maintaining their existence to the utmost extent.

Sunday night, local time, Saudi civilians became the target of seven ballistic missiles fired by the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen.

“The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels fired three missiles at Riyadh and four others at the southern cities of Khamis Mushait, Jizan and Najran,” according to reports.

Saudi Patriot missile air defense batteries were able to destroy at least one projectile heading for an urban area, reports indicate. These batteries are programmable to allow missiles headed for remote areas lacking civilian population to hit the ground, preventing the unnecessary deployment of costly Patriot missiles.

This turn of events is resulting in a long slate of negative international reactions.

The United Nations, a long slate of Middle East countries, the United States and European Union have condemned the missile attacks, recommitting their support for the Kingdom.

London, despite its history of seeking to maintain ties with Tehran and expanding economic relations, grilled the latest developments in strong terms.

“We question why Iran is spending significant revenue in a country with which it has no real historical ties or interests,” reads a joint statement from Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt.

The text also calls for Iran to stop transferring weapons into Yemen. This is a litmus test for Tehran to prove it favors ending the violence and establishing peace in the Arab World’s poorest country. A test the Iranian regime has and will continue to fail, considering its nature of trekking from one crisis to another.

In line with this argument, Iran’s regular army chief commander again voiced threats of total annihilation against Israel.

“We will finish off Israel’s life within less than 25 years,” said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi referring to a comment by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

This goes alongside the necessity for senior Iranian regime officials to save face in times of increasing domestic unrest parallel to elevating international isolation.

“We must choose between hard & harder. If we don’t accept the hard methods, we will have to succumb to more difficult circumstances,” said Iran’s Deputy Trade Minister Ali Sarzaeem.

Such comments from Iran come as the Trump administration undergoes major reshuffling, with analysts believing increasing pressure on Iran is a major focus.

After more than a year’s work with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, President Donald Trump’s move to appoint CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his top diplomat is raising eyebrows across the globe, including most importantly in Tehran. Tillerson is well-known for convincing Trump, along with former National Security H.R. McMaster, to stick to the controversial Iran nuclear deal for a year.

With a new Secretary of State, and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton set to take over as National Security Advisor, many believe the coffin is completing for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iran nuclear agreement is formally known.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2018/03/29/why-did-yemens-iran-backed-houthis-fire-missiles-into-saudi-arabia/
17,yemen,"Cooking gas and fuel shortages

The shortage of cooking gas in several northern governorates has entered the second month. Available gas is retailing at about 8,000 YER per 20-litre cylinder, compared to about 5,000 YER three weeks ago.

The official price is 3,000 YER per 20-litre cylinder.

In Al Hudaydah, Sana’a and Sa’ada, the authorities are distributing gas through local leaders to lessen congestion at gas stations and distribution points. In Sa’ada, black market gas costs 8,000-10.000 YER per cylinder. Many families and bakeries are now cooking with firewood. Fuel shortages are reported in southern governorates following the break-up of an earlier import monopoly. In February, average prices of diesel and petrol increased by two per cent across Yemen. In Shabwah governorate, the increase was significant – 17 per cent for diesel and 13 per cent for petrol. UNVIM data shows that before the November 2017 blockade of Yemen’s ports, nearly one-third of the monthly fuel import requirements of about 544,000 MT were being met. Since then, monthly imports have dropped by nearly a half. In the first two weeks of March, just 92,560MT of fuel was imported.

UPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS

Sa’ada Hub: Conflict has escalated in Sa’ada governorate, with a high level of civilian impact incidents and casualties, including women and children. According to the Protection Cluster, airstrikes, shelling and ground fighting have impacted homes, farms and civilian infrastructure; and increased the risk of unexploded ordnances. In neighbouring Al Jawf governorate, escalated fighting is reported in several districts, with casualties. The violence has affected humanitarian movements, access and response within Al Jawf and Sa’ada governorates.

The ongoing violence in Sa’ada and Al Jawf has triggered new displacement, according to local authorities. Humanitarian partners report an urgent need to provide shelter, non-food items and food to at least 20 newly displaced households that are living in an open area in Rajwaza district in Al Jawf. There is also need to assist about 200 newly displaced families in Sa’ada and an estimated 500 households that have returned to their areas of origin in Sha’da and Al Dhaher districts in Sa’ada governorate.

Ibb Hub: Humanitarian partners are concerned about access challenges in Taizz governorate, including disruptions of movement along the Aden-Taizz city road. This road is a key transport route for humanitarian supplies, civilians and commercial goods. On 19 March, heavy clashes in Al Beirain area of Al Maafer district temporarily closed the road for six hours. Discussions are on-going with local parties about the option of using another road from Ibb to Taizz to enhance civilian movement and the delivery of humanitarian supplies.

Violence in Taizz governorate has displaced increasing numbers of civilians. In the last three weeks, clashes in Al Mukha district displaced about 126 families from AlZahra sub-district to Wadi Kabeer area in Al Mashaleha sub-district. This week, clashes were reported in Naqueel As Silw and in the southern areas near Khaled military camp.

Aden Hub: Recent assessments in Abyan governorate show that there is space for partners to respond to growing needs of displaced people in Khanfir and Zingibar districts. The needs vary from food, water, shelter and education. About 74 per cent of the assessed population were food-insecure and 57 per cent severely food-insecure. As of 13 March, UNHCR assistance had reached 5,710 IDPs in Khanfir district and 2,540 IDPs in Zingibar district. In Shoqra district, a rapid WASH assessment of 430 recently displaced households from Al Hudaydah found drinking water to be a major problem.

Since December, humanitarian partners operating in the southern governorates have recorded at least 8,670 displaced households; of whom 54 per cent originated from Hudaydah. An assessment by an international partner found that 42 per cent of the total population of Hays and Al Khawkah districts in Hudaydah have moved out, mostly to Al Mukha, Aden and Abyan.

Al Hudaydah Hub: Fighting in Hays, Al Tuhayat and Al Garrahi districts of Al Hudaydah continues to displace hundreds of families. This week, local authorities reported that 223 families were displaced to Jabal Ras district, 59 to Al Hudaydah city and 13 to As Salif district.

In Al Hudaydah city, local authorities are accommodating newly displaced families in a residential compound.

Humanitarian partners have raised concerns over the legality of accommodating IDPs in private property, but will provide basic assistance to the affected families.

Local authorities are establishing a camp in Zabid city and have put up tents to accommodate new IDPs.

The authorities have requested support from the humanitarian community in Al Hudaydah. In Abs district in nearby Hajjah governorate, OXFAM is supporting 7,111 vulnerable families from both displaced and the host community with cash assistance amounting to 29,500 YER per household.

Sana’a Hub: A recent mission to Bani Hushaysh district in Sana’a governorate found that the district has a large number of IDPs coming from Nihm district. Most of the IDPs are renting accommodation at an average monthly rate of 20,000-25,000 YER which is beyond what they can afford, given that most of them lack stable income.

Protection partners report an increase in civilian impact incidents in the Sana’a hub, from five last week to eight this week. These were primarily in Marib, specifically in Sirwah district. Although the number of incidents increased, civilian casualties fell, dropping from eight to four.

The Secretary-General and the Crown Prince discussed the obligations of all parties to the conflict under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the critical need for humanitarian access across the country and for all of Yemen’s ports to remain open to both humanitarian and commercial movement.

They also discussed the need for the parties to the conflict to work towards a negotiated political settlement through inclusive intra-Yemeni dialogue.

Mr. Guterres expressed the UN’s readiness to work together with Saudi Arabia for these objectives.

19,yemen,"The denouncement against such launches, including the use of ballistic missiles, came in a Press Statement issued late Wednesday by the Council, which said that the 25 March attacks ‘threatened civilian areas and resulted in at least one fatality.”

The Statement said the 15-member body “underlined that such attacks pose a serious national security threat to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as a wider threat to regional security.”

Since the uprisings in Yemen broke out in early 2011, the UN has been engaged in helping Yemenis to find a peaceful solution. However, on 26 March 2015, a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia intervened militarily at the request of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi to secure the return of the Government to Sana’a, which had been seized by Houthi militias and allied units of the armed forces.

Three years on, the fighting is raging and the ensuing humanitarian crisis has only deepened in a country that was already one of the region’s poorest.

In the Statement, the Council “reiterated the need for all parties to return to dialogue as the only means of delivering a negotiated political settlement and engage constructively with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, with a view towards swiftly reaching a final and comprehensive agreement to end the conflict and address the ongoing humanitarian crisis.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1006211
20,yemen,"New York-based activist Summer Nasser has coaxed bodega owners into sending aid to Yemen. She’s helped organize rallies against US immigration policies, even flown to Geneva to testify before the UN Human Rights Council about Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.

It’s hard to believe she’s just 23 and still a student.

Yemen, the country where her parents were born and where she spent most of her school vacations, is in turmoil. But when Summer returned there in February 2015 for her wedding, she never could have imagined the nation’s political crisis escalating into a deadly regional war, practically overnight.

Three years later, with the war still raging, I ask her about the spring of 2015 when the fighting overtook Yemen, just as she was to be married.

'I had flowers shipped in from Ethiopia, and I had to cancel that'

I’ve spoken with Summer about Yemen many times, but this is the first time we have met in person. She and her husband, Muntaser Yaghnam, sit in the living room of their apartment in Mount Vernon, New York, just north of the Bronx, where Summer was born.

Muntaser remembers meeting Summer online in 2011.

“She was in New York City, and we were chatting on Facebook. And I was posting pictures of projects,” he says.

It was the Arab Spring, and Muntaser was an activist in Yemen helping to feed, clothe and house Yemenis escaping from the southern province of Abyan, which was being overrun by al-Qaeda.

“I was explaining how dire the need is of people in Yemen, and she was really interested,” Muntaser recalls

Summer smiles. “He was actively following my publications. He enjoyed it,” she says of her frequent blog posts on Yemen, then pauses, and turns to her husband. “Did you enjoy it?”

They laugh.

I am struck by how eager they are to talk. Knowing they had to escape a war, I am impressed by how at ease they are.

In 2013, Summer was visiting her family in southern Yemen when she and Muntaser first met face-to-face. “After that, I mean, we clicked,” he says. “We liked each other.”

The next year they became engaged.

Muntaser studied English literature at Sana’a University, in Yemen's capital. He peppers his speech with casual English phrases such as “like,” “I mean” and “really.” For our interview, he's wearing jeans, a sweater and a leather jacket, short hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He drives for Uber in New York City.

In February 2015, Summer and Muntaser were set to rendezvous in southern Yemen — to be married. They’d booked a venue in Aden, made all the arrangements. This would be Summer’s dream wedding, with family and friends coming from America and all around Yemen.

But as the wedding day grew near, the rebel group Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, swept south from their ancestral base in northern Yemen. The green area of the map marks the territory controlled by the Houths in early March 2015.

Following a coup, Yemen's president and his cabinet fled to Aden with the Houthi army at their heels. The war had come to Summer's doorstep.

She remembers the night when the Saudi-led coalition began to bomb Houthi fighters in Aden. “The street wars broke out, and the first bomb fell from a Saudi jet that night, and there was just me and my mom and my siblings.”

Muntaser was still 200 miles north in Sana’a, the capital, texting and calling.

“I mean, people ... shooting and bombardment and everything. I was so worried about her and her family,” he says.

The wedding was off.

“Nobody would attend the wedding, anyway,” Summer says, a little ruefully. “I had flowers shipped in from Ethiopia, and I had to cancel that. I was really bummed out.”

“I really felt devastated because we had been waiting for this for too long,” Muntaser says.

As they recall that time three years ago, it's clear that this remains a difficult subject for them. Seeing them together this day, hanging on each other's words, it's easy to imagine the pain and anxiety they must have felt, stuck hundreds of miles apart in a shooting war that showed no signs of ending.

“I used to wake up at night,” Summer says, “and my sister — we would take shifts of when to sleep. She would do morning; I would do night. And each of us would hold a weapon.""

'My mom sees the planes and she freaks out'

Life became untenable in Aden. People who could leave, did. Summer’s mom brought the family north, through Houthi territory, to try to find safe passage out of Yemen.

But Summer and Muntaser were determined to marry. The families hastily arranged a wedding on April 30 in Sana’a at Muntaser’s family home. Even though it is controlled by the Houthi rebels, Sana’a is not troubled by ground fighting. In Sana’a, the threat comes from fighter jets flown by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The militaries of both countries receive considerable support from the United States and Britain.

Summer knew it wouldn't be her dream wedding.

Her dad, who lives in the US, wouldn’t be there. Nobody from the US could fly in, because the runway at Sana’a International Airport was cratered, and all of Yemeni airspace was closed. For similar reasons, Summer's relatives from the South wouldn't be there.

“I know she was really devastated about the wedding,” Muntaser says. “It's the first and the only wedding for a man or a woman, so she was really sad. But we were going through very tough circumstances. We had to do it that way.” There were dozens of wedding guests, but they were mostly Muntaser's family and friends.

Summer still thinks about her wedding day.

“I was with the ladies on the second floor, the men were on the first. And all I hear is the women, you know, shouting and doing all these happy sounds. And then I hear gunshots. It's a very traditional thing here, if there's a marriage ceremony. Once the sheik or the imam says OK [and] blesses your marriage, [the men] start shooting in the air.” Then the groom is brought to the bride.

Summer and Muntaser have few photos from Yemen in 2015. This one, taken the day they were married, shows Muntaser in a traditional Yemeni wedding outfit.

“At first he comes in, and everybody starts clapping,” she recalls.

“And dancing — like, playing some music, you know,” Muntaser adds.

Summer and Muntaser now seem to be remembering the wedding minute-by-minute.

“Yeah,” Summer continues, “and he kissed my forehead, and we went into the the Arabian room — a setting that they have in every traditional home — and the family was there. A woman came up congratulating, and his brothers and his father, all of them. And then, they all they all stepped out. We got to have our time.”

But not a lot of time.

The building where they married is right next to a military base, held by the Houthis and frequently targeted by coalition jets. Muntaser seems almost blasé talking about the air strikes, which occurred nightly, as if they were just an inconvenience, something to put up with. Summer also takes the war in stride.

“We left early, because everybody leaves early due to the [airstrikes],” she recalls. “We were leaving the house, and all we hear is the planes. And you see them flashing, right? And I said, 'oh my God,' like, holy crap.”

Summer and Muntaser were about to drive off together, their first moments truly alone as a married couple. But even that would be denied them.

“My mom sees the planes and she freaks out,” Summer says. “She jumped in the car and all the siblings, we all got squished in one car. Because the first airstrike hit. And it was very close.”

In Yemen, the war touches everything.

Summer and Muntaser spent their wedding night at a downtown hotel, accompanied by the sound of soaring jets and explosions. “I could not sleep because of the airstrikes. Yeah, it was really bad,” she recalls.

“I remember the doors really shaking because of how strong the earth was shaking, because of the rockets hitting,” Muntaser says.

“My mom would call every 10 minutes,” Summer adds. “'Are you OK.' 'No, mom — are you OK?' You know?”

“We have to sleep, every night, checking our phones.""

Throughout the spring of 2015, Summer became a go-to American in Yemen for foreign news outlets including the New York Times, Voice of America, Al-Jazeera, the BBC, Britain’s Daily Mail, Fox News and us here at PRI’s The World. This, Summer says, was part of why she stayed: to be able to help tell Yemen's story to the world.

But when weeks had become months, and the war still showed no signs of ending, she and Muntaser chose to leave Yemen to start their life together in America.

They first tried, and failed, to cross by land into Saudi Arabia. At the end of June they boarded a flight from Sana’a to Amman, Jordan. It was the first time Muntaser had been outside Yemen. But without a US visa, he could go no further.

The couple tells me they were frustrated by how little help they could get from the US embassy in Amman.

In November 2015, Summer went back to New York, alone. Muntaser would remain in the Jordanian capital while Summer resumed her classes at Concordia College and worked through her local congressional representative to expedite a visa for him.

It took nine months for the paperwork to clear. Then Muntaser boarded a plane to New York City.

“It was August 28, and I was tracking him on his plane, where he was,"" Summer remembers with a broad smile. ""And when I picked him up at the airport he was so excited. And I gave him a hug and I said, ‘Welcome to your new home. And this is it.’ I took him to the car, and we drove around. We drove everywhere. We drove over the bridges. And he couldn't believe it, he was so excited. I said ‘You're going to have to let me focus on driving, because I can't drive when you're so excited.’”

Summer pauses.

“To be together, it was truly a blessing after all of that. To be honest now, thinking about it, I'm like, ‘Wow, this is really what we went through?”

Summer and Muntaser escaped the war. But they haven't left it behind.

“We have to wake up every morning and we have to sleep, every night, checking our phones. That last 10 minutes before 10:00, we have to check our social networks. We have to check our family,” Summer says.

The couple keep busy schedules, Muntaser driving for Uber, and Summer completing her undergraduate degree and working as a paralegal. But they make time to help the people of Yemen.

“Being Yemeni in America,” Muntaser says, “we are, like, we are blessed here, we are safe, we have a good income. So we end up joining [the] Yemen Aid [charity] organization, where we are talking about the Yemen situation and how we can send help and implement projects.""

Yemen Aid is a non-profit charity founded in 2016 by Summer and a group of Yemeni American professionals determined to inform the public about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and to do something about it. Summer is its executive director. Muntaser is its chief operating officer. They run a speaker’s bureau. They do fundraising and find ways to relieve some of the widespread suffering in Yemen.

When we spoke at the end of February, their group had just sent a 40-foot shipping container filled with medical equipment and supplies to hospitals in Yemen. A second container is in transit. Summer and Muntaser expect it to arrive in Aden on April 10, near the anniverary of their wedding.",https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-03-27/getting-married-amid-airstrikes-yemen
21,yemen,"This week the war in Yemen enters its fourth year. Since the start of the conflict, basic services in Yemen have become nonexistent. More than half of all health facilities in the country are nonfunctional, and three-quarters of the population, 22 million people, are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.

What makes this conflict so heartbreaking is its cruelty, the warring factions deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. International humanitarian law stipulates that hospitals, schools and similar facilities remain off limits to combatants. Both government forces and militants have violated these laws. According to the Yemen Data Project, least 4,500 airstrikes have hit gas, electric, transportation and other essential infrastructures, including 68 strikes on health clinics and hospitals and 342 on educational buildings. The destruction has pushed eight million people to the brink of starvation, 1.8 million of them children suffering acute malnourishment.

Yemen is on the verge of becoming a failed state. Mothers helplessly watch their children grow ill.

Since the outbreak of fighting, the International Rescue Committee has been on the ground in Yemen doing incredible work under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions. Each working day our mobile health clinics travel up to five hours in remote mountainous regions to reach isolated people entirely dependent upon our health care services. The IRC screens children for moderate and severe malnutrition and puts those in acute distress on nutrition regimes. We provide immunization to stop the spread of disease and livesaving medicine to those already ill. Sadly, this work amounts to a drop in the bucket compared to the suffering afflicting Yemen.

Abdul Ghafar lives in a remote village in the mountains. The nearest medical facility is an IRC-supported health center two hours away. There are no cars available, and even if there were, the cost of gasoline has skyrocketed since the start of the war. The IRC mobile health clinic comes to Abdul’s village every Wednesday.

But early one Monday morning, his three-year-old son, Abdullah, became ill, “One night, he was vomiting and having diarrhea,” Abdul recalls. “I knew the IRC mobile clinic was coming here in two days.”

Cholera is a fatal bacterial disease, typically contracted from infected water and causing severe vomiting and diarrhea. It can kill within hours if left untreated. Yemen is experiencing the largest outbreak of cholera in recorded history, having surpassing one million suspected cases last December.

Abdul brought his son to the IRC clinic that Wednesday, where Abdullah was given an IV drip and medicine. The boy was also suffering from severe acute malnutrition. But he was lucky … he survived the ordeal, although his life, like everyone’s in the village, is fragile.

Abdullah was born the same year civil war erupted in Yemen. “Ever since this child was born, he has been sick,” laments Abdul. “Sometimes we have one meal a day. Sometimes we don’t eat at all. I am not thinking about me eating, I think about my children. I buy juice or biscuits and feed them that. This is all we have. Without the IRC, my son was going to die in my arms.”

As the war wages on, more civilians are put at risk. “The wars and the fighting is the reason my son is always sick, and why I cannot find a job,” says Abdul. “I just want safety and security. Everyone needs to be able to feel safe when they leave their home.”",https://www.rescue.org/article/worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-yemen

Enlarge this image toggle caption Arezou Rezvani/NPR Arezou Rezvani/NPR

The war in Yemen is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Largely started as an internal fight between rebels and their government, it's now a much more bloody battleground in the regional rivalry between Iran — which backs the rebels — and Saudi Arabia, which backs the government.

An NPR team spent weeks working to get a picture of the war, which has often taken place out of public view. NPR traveled with the Saudi military into Yemen, interviewed people in rebel-controlled zones, and then traveled to Djibouti, in East Africa, a destination for Yemeni refugees.

What emerged were the stories of people like Ola Ali Salim.

Salim is a citizen of Yemen, now a refugee. She had one daughter with her husband, who supported the family by driving a motorcycle, carrying one or two passengers at a time on the back of the seat.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Arezou Rezvani/NPR Arezou Rezvani/NPR

Last year, her husband was driving around the capital city, Sanaa, when it erupted in violence. A former president was trying to switch sides in the civil war and was killed. Sanaa was also being bombed by a Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Amid explosions and gunfire, Salim simply stopped hearing from her spouse.

""He never called. We don't know any news of him, so the only explanation is that he's dead,"" she told NPR. ""They didn't find the body.""

It was only her latest loss. In a separate incident, three of her cousins were killed in what she believed to be an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition — the only side in the battle with an air force.

In December, she packed a few belongings and traveled to the coast, hiding her grief beneath the black head covering, or niqab, which Yemeni women are expected to wear. She brought along her 12-year-old daughter. They boarded a small boat that bobbed across the Gulf of Aden in the middle of the night. They arrived in the African country of Djibouti, where NPR interviewed her.

Djibouti can have something of the feel of the movie Casablanca — a former French African colony, which serves as a way station or last refuge for the desperate. But there was nothing romantic about Salim's flight. She lives in a United Nations refugee camp in a tent with a floor of desert sand. She is within sight of the water and nearly within sight of the country where she lost her husband.

The war that displaced Salim has a U.S. connection, which was on exhibit in Washington this week. Saudi Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House and got a warm welcome from President Trump, who showed pictures of U.S. military hardware sold to Saudi Arabia.

A globalized conflict

The U.S. has provided targeting information, equipment and aircraft refueling to the Saudi air campaign, which has been widely criticized for being indiscriminate and killing civilians in places like hospitals, funerals and homes. Several thousand civilians have been killed since 2015, when the Saudis got into the war. On Tuesday, the day the prince met Trump, the U.S. Senate defeated a resolution 55-44 that would have limited what the U.S. can do to support the Saudi war effort.

The issue will likely come up again. While both sides – the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition — have killed, detained or displaced civilians, much of the international focus has been on how the Saudi-led campaign escalated the violence.

The Saudis, along with a coalition that includes the United Arab Emirates, argue that they are countering a dangerous rebel faction backed by Iran. They note that Houthis have fired missiles – allegedly Iranian-made – into Saudi territory.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Inskeep/NPR Steve Inskeep/NPR

In the face of international criticism, the Saudis have cracked open a window on their side of the war. They have begun inviting reporters to view small portions of their battle lines. So in early March, the NPR team boarded a U.S.-built, Saudi-owned C-130 transport plane for a flight into Yemen to assess.

After arriving, the team drove into the mountains and to an observation post more than 8,000 feet above sea level, soldiers from Yemen's army took turns with binoculars peering into the valley. Somewhere over the horizon, the Houthis control Sanaa.

At the observation post, a Yemeni soldier, Lt. Ahkram Messen, told reporters that his parents live on the rebel side of this divided nation. ""They are waiting on me to come,"" he said.

A senior officer, Gen. Nasser al-Thebani, said the Yemeni army strategy was ""to liberate all Yemeni territory.""

But soldiers at this forward position indicated they had been guarding the same line for two years without much movement. Yemen's army, which collapsed almost without firing a shot when the Houthis took the capital in 2014, remains a lightly trained force of uncertain strength.

Saudis prop up the Yemeni government to an extraordinary degree. Saudis pay the army. Saudi planes provide air cover, fire the artillery and use special forces to work with the lightly armed Yemeni government troops. This month, Saudi Arabia had to drop $2 billion in the Yemeni central bank to stave off a currency collapse. Yemen's president does not even live in Yemen; he lives in Saudi Arabia for safety.

Globalized criticism

Saudi officials recently emphasized their efforts to deliver humanitarian aid. One U.S. diplomat acknowledged these efforts but said they have not been enough. Even in Marib, which has ties to Saudi Arabia, there are long lines for gasoline — and Marib is more prosperous than most cities.

Rebel-held areas have had no electricity for years. Food is available, but inflation makes it nearly impossible to afford.

Dr. Najla al-Sonboli, a doctor at a maternal hospital in the capital, described an economic collapse. ""Our staff have no salary for 1 1/2 years,"" she said. ""We have a shortage of medicines for our patients."" Cholera, which has swept parts of the country, is expected to intensify in the hot summer months.

Much of the chaos can be blamed on Houthi rebels. Refugees who fled the area told us that there is scant governance, merely a multitude of young men with Kalashnikov rifles at checkpoints.

But there are also the airstrikes of the Saudi-led coalition. A military base across the street from Sonboli's hospital has been bombed again and again. ""This happens during the day, any part of the day, anytime,"" she said.

Human rights groups and reporters document other civilian sites that were struck: a different hospital, houses, a market, a funeral. The Saudis have begun to acknowledge some mistaken bombings — 11 so far. Outside groups count far more.

Under pressure, the Saudis have been in contact with the Houthi rebels and are believed to have made quiet efforts to arrange a peace.

But Saudi officials remain profoundly concerned about the spreading influence of Iran — and so does the Trump administration.

On a recent visit to the region, CIA Director Mike Pompeo showed a sharp interest in Yemen. He had a long meeting with U.S. diplomats about the country. Since then, Pompeo has been nominated to a post of even greater influence, secretary of state, where one of the many questions facing him will be what to do about Yemen's war.

Arezou Rezvani and Emily Ochsenschlager with Morning Edition contributed to this report.",https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/22/595002666/how-global-politics-made-yemens-humanitarian-disaster
23,yemen,"RIYADH (Reuters) - A missile attack this week on Riyadh has raised the risk of an escalation in the Yemen war in a region riven with interwoven conflicts, but a direct confrontation between arch-foes Saudi Arabia and Iran still appears unlikely.

Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now touring the United States, must balance animosity toward Iran with the need for stability as he pitches the kingdom’s economic transformation plan to foreign investors and drums up support for containing Iran’s regional influence.

However, Iranian authorities - facing the prospect of a more hawkish U.S. administration with Donald Trump’s appointments last week of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo as national security adviser and secretary of state - might crank up pressure in the Yemen war as a form of deterrence, diplomats and analysts say.

Saudi Arabia sharpened its rhetoric against Tehran after Saudi forces shot down a flurry of missiles launched by the Iran-aligned Houthis on Saudi cities late on Sunday. One of the missiles caused the war’s first casualties in the Saudi capital Riyadh when falling debris struck a home and killed an Egyptian man and injured two others.

Saudi King Salman, in comments carried by state media, pledged on Tuesday to “firmly and decisively thwart any hostile attempts” targeting the kingdom’s security and stability.

A day earlier, the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement accused it of using Iranian-made missiles and said that Saudi Arabia reserved the right to respond to Iran when and how it deemed appropriate.

The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 in a campaign to restore its internationally recognized government after it was driven into exile by Houthi forces.

“Iran is the appendicitis in the body of the world and should fix itself or else the world will fix the Iranian situation,” spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.

Iran has repeatedly denied giving missiles to the Houthis.

FEW MILITARY OPTIONS

Analysts said that in the short term, the Saudi leadership is unlikely to respond aggressively amid increased international scrutiny of the three-year-old Yemen conflict, which has given rise to the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis.

“Prince Mohammed would like to be viewed as a more restrained and composed leader” while touring his closest Western ally, the United States, according to Ehsan Khoman, Head of Research and Strategist for MENA at MUFG.

“(He) may leverage the recent Houthi missile attacks to strengthen his narrative that Iran’s encroachment is undermining regional stability and that a more concerted international effort is needed to contain Iran.”

The Yemen conflict pits a coalition of Western-friendly states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Houthis, who are sympathetic to Iran but deny being a pawn of its Shi’ite Muslim theocracy.

Yemen’s war fits into a broader decades-long struggle for supremacy between Middle East powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia, which fund and train proxy forces in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and accuse each other of backing terrorism.

Military escalation in response to the latest rocket salvo could mean more coalition air strikes - which have been widely criticized for killing civilians - or mobilizing the Saudi National Guard from a mostly static position along the border to undertake a concerted ground assault inside northern Yemen.

Diplomats and analysts say that the coalition has few other options short of direct action against an Iranian target, something that remains unlikely unless a Houthi rocket takes out a valuable Saudi asset.

Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh that were intercepted, the coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation, and it was partially lifted.

“They may make similar moves in order to be seen to be doing something, but it won’t really change the dynamics of the conflict,” said Jane Kinninmont, Middle East expert at Chatham House in London.

“My concern is that they could be tempted to take some action directly against some Iranian target, and that any such course of action could escalate further.”

Consultancy Eurasia Group said that a successful Houthi strike on a prized Saudi target would probably prompt a firm military response from Riyadh to try to deter Iran.

Analysts said that while a direct Saudi-Iranian showdown is unlikely, miscalculation remains a risk.

MEDIATION EFFORTS

Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to Yemen’s war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross-border strikes and limit the spread of Iran’s imprint in territory overlooking important trade routes.

The United Nations says more than 10,000 people have died in the war, and 22.2 million Yemenis - three-quarters of the population - need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history.

Analysts said that while Saudi Arabia will probably double down on its military campaign in Yemen to oust the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and reinstate President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, it may continue to support mediation efforts.

However, the appointments of Bolton and Pompeo in Washington could encourage Iran to ramp up activities in Yemen to signal its ability and willingness to undermine the United States and its partners, Eurasia Group said.

Economists have played down the impact of the Houthi attacks on the Saudi economy, which Prince Mohammed is trying to wean off oil exports with a slate of reforms that include cutting energy subsidies and expanding the private sector.

Investors may have already largely priced in risks from Houthi missile strikes. But an intensification of the Yemen conflict and certainly an escalation to direct conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia could scare off foreign investors.

24,yemen,"The US story that Iran is supplying missiles to Yemeni rebels is reminiscent of the Bush-era false claim that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Lies about ‘made in Iran’ missiles fit Trump’s tactics

We must speak with one voice in exposing the regime for what it is — a threat to the peace and security of the whole world, said US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last December, trying to drum up support for stronger international sanctions against Iran, and maybe even an actual attack on the country. Here we go again.

Those old enough to remember the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq will recall the deluge of doctored American ‘intelligence’ reports about alleged Iraqi “weapons of mass destruction” that were used to justify the attack. ‘Everybody’ was in danger, presumably including Bolivia, Switzerland and Nepal, so everybody must support the invasion.

In the end, the United States got its war — and found no evidence whatever of an active Iraqi programme to build weapons of mass destruction. But no lessons have been learned. Haley at the United Nations was laying a foundation of lies for a comparable Trump adventure in the Middle East. Same story different day.

The storyline goes as follows. Iran is an aggressive and expansionist power that threatens everybody everywhere. The proof is that it is helping the bad guys in Yemen, known as the Houthis, to launch missile attacks on innocent Saudi citizens. In fact, it is actually giving the evil Houthis the missiles.

The Houthis, a large Shia tribe in northern Yemen, are indeed rebels, and they now control most of the country, including the capital. This greatly angered the Saudi Arabians who installed the previous Government in 2012 as a way of shutting down the Arab Spring uprising in Yemen.

The Saudis didn’t like seeing their man overthrown, so they created a nine-country coalition of Sunni Arab states and started bombing Yemen in 2015. According to the UN, at least 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured since the coalition intervened in Yemen’s war. But on March 25, one of the highly inaccurate Houthi missiles killed one person in a suburb of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.

The anti-Iran propaganda machine went into high gear. “This aggressive and hostile action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves that the Iranian regime continues to support the (Houthi) armed group with military capabilities,” said coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki. And the inimitable Nikki Haley said that the missile “might as well have had ‘Made in Iran’ stickers” on it.

This is the nub of the matter: Is Iran actually supplying missiles to the Houthis that are being fired at Saudi Arabia? If so, then the United States, Saudi Arabia’s main ally, has an excuse to attack Iran.

The American accusation basically depends on the ignorant but widespread belief that Yemenis, and in particular, Shia rebels from the north, are too ‘backward’ to be able to make or upgrade missiles themselves. But most of the Yemeni armed forces’ weapons, including a variety of short-range ballistic missiles based on the old Soviet ‘Scud’ series, fell into the Houthis’ hands in 2015-16.

None of those original missiles could have reached Riyadh, but extending the range of a simple rocket like the Scud is not rocket science. You just reduce the weight of the warhead and lengthen the body of the rocket to carry extra fuel.

The Houthis have lots of people with metal fabrication and basic engineering skills, and it appears that they did exactly that. The upgraded missile is inaccurate (only one Saudi casualty in at least 40 launches) because lengthening it and lightening the warhead changes the balance, but it cheers the Houthis up because it lets them retaliate for all the bombing.

Jane’s Information Group Ltd, established in 1898, is the world’s leading independent provider of intelligence and analysis on defense matters. Here is what Jeremy Binnie, Middle East/Africa Editor of Jane’s Defence Weekly, said about Yemen’s rockets in 2017 in Jane’s Intelligence Review: “The Burkan-2 appears to use a new type of warhead section that is locally fabricated. Both Iran and North Korea have displayed Scud derivatives with shuttlecock-shaped warheads, but none of these match the Yemeni version. The range of the Burkan missiles also appears to have been extended by a reduction in the weight of their warheads.”

No nonsense about ‘made in Iran’ stickers. The Yemenis aren’t stupid, and they did it themselves. But the other story suits the Trump Administration’s purposes better.
