Cameroon is once more blessed with the presence of yet another group of medical practitioners to help the needy with 500 surgeries. Anaesthesias, gynaecologists, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, surgeons, urologists, a neurosurgeon, a plastic surgeon and an ENT, alongside seven volunteers from Indian under the Rotary Foundation of the Rotary International, District 9150, are at the end of their 10-day humanitarian mission in Cameroon.

During a cocktail reception of the team of surgeons by the Honorary Consul of India to Cameroon, J. Ravikumar, it filtered out that they have carried out 400 surgeries two days to the end of their mission. According to Rajendra K Saboo, former Rotary International President, the doctors who are at the top of their specialities in India are committed to serve Cameroonians free of charge.

""The General Hospital, Gynaeco-obstetrician and Paediatric Hospital in Douala as well as the Laquintinie hospital involved do not have to collect money from patients"", he reiterated. The free surgery is accompanied with free drugs, fluids, consumables and some equipment, he added.

In the presence of Team Leader and Project Chair, PDG Ranjit K Bhatia, the former Rotary International President said the medics have done remarkable work going by the kind of prostate, mask and cataracts removed among others.

Glade with the opportunity given them to reach out to people below poverty line, Rajendra Saboo said they have been carrying out such missions for 19 years and it is their first time in Cameroon. ""We have been to over 20 African countries including Congo, Gabon and Ruanda demonstrating our slogan, 'Rotary: making a Difference'"", he disclosed.

On his part, the Honorary Consul, J. Ravikumar, acclaimed the medics selfless philosophy for the health and wellbeing of Cameroonians. He said India has one million doctors of modern medicine and spends only one per cent of GDP on medical facilities for citizens.",Cameroon: Humanitarian Work - Indian Doctors Operate Over 400 Needy Patients,http://allafrica.com/stories/201804190607.html
1,cameroon,"A series of protests over the use of French, the perceived exclusion of English-speaking Cameroonians from the economy and politics provoked a sustained government crackdown and spawned an armed separatist struggle.

One journalist based in the Southwest capital of Buea told DW how the situation affects his work and personal safety. He asked that his identity be withheld out of fear of repercussions.

DW: There is a heavy security presence on the streets here and the region at large is in crisis. How do you go about your work under these conditions?

Sincerely, I cannot work because the government of Cameroon has put in some very strong repressive measures to make sure journalists don't report stories the way they have to. I'll give you an example: journalists are restricted from going to the war-torn areas. Those who even attempt to go there are being arrested.

Even when we report stories in our newspapers, on radio or TV, we receive messages from the governor's office or from the office of the minister of information telling us we should tell them who gave us the information.

I reported on an attack on the convoy of government officials who visited war-torn areas and I was called to the governor's office to say when I was there and how i got the information. I didn't feel I was treated humanely.

What do you mean they didn't treat you humanely?

I told them I had no source. I was told to sit on the ground and my shoes were removed. They used all forms of interrogation to make me give the information. I refused. I was put in the bunker in the governor's office for 30 minutes but still did not give the information. They told me I was lying and I was given two slaps - hefty slaps.

As a journalist, have you also experienced pressure from the separatist side?

They've also been threatening journalists. I have received threats. When I talked aboutthe fact that separatists are also committing atrocities – they are beheading people – I received death threats.

They want the story to be told supporting them. One of them who took the time to reach me on Facebook to explain why they are threatening me said they are not killing civilians. If they have to kill anybody, it would be government spies [he said].

We have many journalists who have decided to be quiet, especially in the war-torn areas. Journalists there don't even practice. If you report in such area you can easily be targeted and killed.

Yes, a lot of pressure is coming from the separatists. So far, the separatists have been very collaborative. They've been able to string in information through WhatsApp messages and all of that on what is happening on the ground, with images too.

On one occasion you were stopped at a checkpoint by militant separatists. Can you recall what happened that day?

The Ambazonian Defence Force (ADF) intercepted our bus and told everybody to come down and present identification to show that you are Anglophone. They asked us to support them in any way we can. Some people gave them food, others gave them money and the like.

So that is how we saw our way out of it, and they allowed us to go. It was at first a very terrorizing situation because you saw some 90 hefty men, but you also saw some four very young people, as young as 15 in the ADF. The 15-year-old was the one terrorising two Francophones.

Did he carry a gun too?

Yes, he had an AK47. One of them said: ""My home village has been entirely burned down. I don't have anywhere to live, I would rather be killed."" They had guns, some of them had machetes.

What happened to the French-speaking passengers?

I cannot tell because our bus had to leave with them still with the ADF. But we later heard from social media that the two men were only beaten, maltreated and sent back by bus. So they were not killed.

Civil servants are being threatened in the region. Are they able to go about their lives here?

They are very traumatized. Even as they have left the war torn areas and they are in a safer area, they are still traumatized because they get these anonymous calls and text messages. The normal trend is, the Ambazonians are advocating for no schools. They think having no schools at the moment will help tell the world their real story. Teachers who have summoned the courage to work are being threatened.

On April 25, a teacher was shot in Kumba and April 27 another was shot in Muyuka. Unfortunately, because of the crisis and because they are defying the instruction of the Ambazonians, they are being targeted and killed.

How about other civil servants? Are they also targeted?

Those working in war-torn areas have been told to leave the government and join the Ambazonian side. If you join the Ambazonians, you'll be able to work freely and you will not take command from the government side and you won't be targeted. So many of these civil servants have decided to be toeing the line of the government and they are being targeted.

Although we have not confirmed cases of civil servants who have been killed, we know of many who have been brutalized, including one administrator who was shot in the head twice.

So many civil servants are now in Buea because they feel it is safer since the military is in high number there.

Cameroonians who oppose to the independence for Anglophone regions have also taken to the streets

Is it safe in Buea?

People are arrested almost on a daily basis. The prison in Buea was meant for a little more than 1,500 people, but at the moment it holds more than 5,000 prisoners, many linked to the Ambazonian struggle. They are facing inhumane conditions.

Are they tried in court?

At the moment Buea doesn't try those linked to the Ambazonian crisis. Before March some trials took place, but information came from Yaounde that all trials should stop and the prominent prisoners be sent there.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

A joint high-level mission was conducted from 7-9 February to Bamenda and Mamfe in the North West and South West regions, comprising the Humanitarian Coordinator and the representatives of UNICEF and UNHCR, alongside the Director of Civil Protection of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation (MINATD). The mission met with regional, administrative, traditional and religious leaders, as well as NGOs. The mission materialised in light of reports of increased violence and displacements in the region.

The North West and South West regions have historically been underprivileged, compared to the Francophone regions in Cameroon, generating grievances among the Anglophone population. Since October 2016, these frustrations morphed into political demands, leading to protests and strikes. Since the beginning of the crisis, at least 150 people have been killed during the demonstrations and clashes between the armed secessionist groups and military/security forces of Cameroon, including 64 civilians, according to local and international media. Following the declaration of independence of the putative state of Ambazonia by the secessionist movement on 1 October 2017, the situation has further deteriorated and the situation continues to be tense, with four government officials already kidnapped since January 2018. One major impact of this crisis has been the deprivation of access to education for children, with the majority of schools reportedly closed for most of the school year 2016/2017, and many continuing to be closed for the school year 2017/2018. Even with some schools reopening, many parents have decided not to send their children to schools, due to threats by the secessionist elements. According to local authorities, at least 32,000 children have been out of school since November 2017.

Based on the information received during the February high-level mission, as well as a needs assessment conducted by UNICEF in November 2017, UNICEF is developing a strategy to respond to the needs ofthe children affected by the crisis, focusing on providing a protective environment, including to those displaced, where children could engage in educational and recreational activities. Potential partners have been identified and discussions on the collaboration have already been initiated.

The crisis in Far North region continues to affect children and vulnerable populations. A field mission was conducted by UNICEF on 7 February in the Zamai site, Mayo Tsanaga department, to follow up on the response activities for 361 returnees from Nigeria (235 of whom are children) who fled captivity from Boko Haram. Upon arrival, the mission learnt that the Zamai site has received 236 new arrival IDPs since mid-January, who were displaced from Moskota, Zheleved, Nyechewe, and Tchebe-Tchebe villages near the border with Nigeria, which has increased the burden on the host community, despite the ongoing response by UNICEF and other humanitarian partners. Of the 179 children for whom UNICEF partner ALDEPA collected the transfer notes, only 79 children (58 boys and 21 girls) were enrolled in school at the time of the visit. The school located next to the site is currently overcrowded, with 948 students enrolled in a school with the capacity for 360. UNICEF continues to support the multisectoral response for these returnees and explores the ways to fill in the gaps identified.

A joint country office-Maroua sub-office mission has been organised on 8 February 2018 to visit Amchide and Limani. Amchide and Limani are the towns near the Nigerian border that suffered attacks by the armed groups affiliated with Boko Haram between 2014-2017, and this was the first UNICEF mission to this area since the crisis started in 2014 as the area was inaccessible due to insecurity. The impact of the conflict was plainly visible with destroyed houses, deserted shops, hospitals and schools as well as walls with countless gunshot holes. The economic burden of paying rent in the displaced locations, coupled with improved security attributed to the presence of the Rapid Intervention Force, has motivated people to return to these areas since November 2017. According to the multi-sectoral assessment report by the Rapid Response Mechanism supported by international NGOs PUI and ACF conducted in January 2018, there are 8,000 and 4,857 returnees in Limani and Amchide respectively. Needs are significant in all the sectors; however, the priority needs reported by the people were health, education and food. A more detailed needs assessment is planned by UNICEF in April 2018 to better refine its intervention strategy.

In East region, UNICEF participated in the multi-sectoral participatory assessment, Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) assessment, conducted by UNHCR in the villages hosting Central African Republic (CAR) refugees in Batouri, Meiganga, Touboro, Bertoua and Betare Oya communes. Livelihood and empowerment gaps, access to education, health care, and water and sanitation services have been identified as priority needs.

According to local sources, the sexual exploitation of adolescent girls and child labor persist inGaroua Boulai, Betare Oya, Kette and Ngaoui communes, with additional mine sites opening. UNICEF plans to conduct a detailed needs assessment in April and May 2018.

The CAR crisis faces a significant funding gap as the needs transition from humanitarian to longer-term issues of structural development. With humanitarian funding withdrawing, there are no resources available to respond to the needs of new asylum seekers, while continuing to support over 232,000 CAR refugees who remain in Cameroon. In February, UNHCR pre-registered 517 new arrivals who had fled villages in the northwest of the CAR.","UNICEF Cameroon Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/unicef-cameroon-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018
3,cameroon,"The Cameroon government has reportedly banned the Catholic Church from extending humanitarian aid to persons fleeing the security crisis in the restive Anglophone regions.

According to a journalists with Equinoxe TV, a renown priest had bee questioned for distributing foodstuff to people stranded by the ongoing crisis.

“I am reliably informed that church leaders have been banned from assisting displaced anglophones who fled military brutality and burnings of their houses. A renown man of God has equally received a query from the state for distributing foodstuff to the people in despair,” Mimi Mefo said in a tweet.

Efforts to reach a Cameroonian government official for a comment on the issue proved abortive as non was available to respond to our call.

Thousands of Cameroonians have routinely fled their homes into forests for fear of attack by the security forces. The army has repeatedly dismissed attacks on civilian populations stressing that its actions are within limits of its operation.

The United Nations refugee agency in neighbouring Nigeria has recorded over 20,000 refugees who fled the fighting back home. They are said to be living in dire straits as the UNHCR continues to seek funding to support them.

The Catholic Church has been a vocal civil society group all through the crisis in Cameroon’s Northwest and Southwest (Anglophone) regions. They have repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

The international Crisis Group has identified the church as the most potent political mediator between the government and separatist elements.

It’s April 26 report titled: Cameroon’s Anglophone Crisis: How the Catholic Church Can Promote Dialogue, averred that the clergy needed to united with a strong common position (between federalism vs. decentralisation) in order to be seen as credible mediators.",Cameroon govt blocking humanitarian aid to fleeing Anglophones?,http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/04/cameroon-govt-blocking-humanitarian-aid-to-fleeing-anglophones/
4,cameroon,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – One of the world’s leading conflict-resolution organizations says the Catholic Church is the only institution that can mediate the “Anglophone crisis” in Cameroon.

In a new report, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group says other than the Catholic clergy, “there are few prospective peacemakers.”

“If no one fills that role, the separatist sentiment already voiced by many Anglophones will continue to grow, fueling further violence and exacerbating the ongoing insurgency in the Anglophone regions, with elections in late 2018 a flashpoint,” the rights group says in a report.

Since 2016, English speakers in the Central African country have been protesting against what they say is gross marginalization by the Francophone-dominated administration. They have also been complaining about the use of French in Common Law courts and Anglophone schools.

RELATED: Cameroon bishops urge president to resolve Anglophone crisis with dialogue

The two English-speaking regions – in the northwest and southwest of the country – constitute 20 percent of Cameroon’s over 24 million people. The Catholic Church is the largest religious group in the country, representing about 40 percent of all Cameroonians.

The government has been accused of razing entire villages and extrajudicial killings in their hunt against separatists, who are calling on the English-speaking areas to form a new country, called ‘Ambazonia.’

Separatists have also been accused of atrocities, and have attacked Cameroonian security forces, and kidnapped opponents for ransom.

On April 30, separatists kidnapped Father William Neba, the principal of a Catholic college, in the middle of Mass, although he was released later.

The International Crisis Group estimates at least 100 civilians and 43 soldiers have been killed in the conflict in the last seven months, with the number of militants killed remaining unknown.

In addition, some 34,000 refugees are “sheltering in precarious conditions in Nigeria and about 40,000 persons are displaced in the Southwest Anglophone region.”

RELATED: Influx of Cameroon refugees into Nigeria worries Catholic Church

Opposition parties, the United Nations, and the nation’s Catholic bishops have called on the government and separatists to dialogue, but the Francophone-dominated government has long rejected the historical grievances of Anglophone Cameroonians, and the separatists say any talks should be overseen by an independent external body.

In the face of the escalating violence, the International Crisis Group says the Catholic Church remains the only institution with the moral authority to broker a peace deal.

Noting that “the Catholic Church could help break this dangerous stalemate,” the organization said the Catholic Church remains to be the only institution present in all ten regions of the country and claims a plurality of the population as adherents.

“Cameroonians take its views seriously,” the report says.

The Church must repair its own divisions first

Although the bishops have been united in calling for dialogue to end the crisis, there is a contrast to how the Anglophone bishops and Francophone bishops view the origins of the situation.

Anglophone bishops have described the killings as “a growing genocide” and published a long and detailed statement Oct. 4, 2017, in which they decried a “warlike atmosphere” of killings, looting and arson carried out by “young people” and acts of “brutality, torture, inhuman and unjustified treatment meted out” by the “forces of law and order.”

However, the Francophone bishops have been more measured in their statements and avoided terms such as “genocide.”

RELATED: English-speaking and French-speaking bishops divided over Cameroon crisis

Archbishop Samuel Kleda of Douala, Cameroon’s largest city, is the president of the bishops’ conference, and avoided inflammatory language when he recently called for peace.

“In the name of our common citizenship, brotherhood and humanity, the defense of legitimate interests must go hand in hand with social harmony, which is what is being sought … Violence, regardless of its source, does not build, it destroys,” he said.

The archbishop pointed out that all regions of Cameroon face problems which, he said, can be resolved through dialogue, arguing that decentralization would resolve many regional problems in Cameroon, including the Anglophone problem.

His statement was criticized by many clergymen in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, who insist the Anglophone problem is unique.

Father Gerald Jumbam said that by including the ‘Anglophone Problem’ with all other problems in the country, Kleda was ignoring a key historical fact: That English and French-speaking Cameroons were two countries that had decided to come together and that they had done so under agreed terms which have been jettisoned to the disadvantage of Anglophones.

RELATED: Catholic bishops, government clash over “genocide” claims in Cameroon

In a lengthy response to Kleda, Jumbam wrote that by virtue of their history, Anglophone Cameroonians “cannot be loyal subjects to the despicable and tyrannous Yaoundé government. Archbishop, you speak of decentralization and you offer us it as the best gift you think fitting for the resolution of this crisis? We are determined to decline a gift so laden with spurious promises and deceitful propensities.”

Jumbam was referring to the nation’s colonial history, which involves 3 different European countries.

Initially administered as a German Protectorate in 1884, Cameroon would later be shared with France and Britain as League of Nations Mandates after Germany was defeated in the First World War.

The end of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations saw the two parts of Cameroon transition from mandated territories to UN Trust Territories.

In 1960, the northern part of Cameroon administered by France gained its independence. The southern part administered by Britain as part of Nigeria was in 1961 subject to a plebiscite in which they were offered independence by reuniting with their francophone Cameroonian “brothers” or by remaining part of Nigeria.

The results showed an overwhelming desire by English-speaking Cameroonians to reunite with the French-speaking part of Cameroon.

The “marriage” was guaranteed by a Federal Constitution that was ostensibly meant to preserve and protect the minority Anglophones and their colonial heritage. But in 1972 then-President Ahmadou Ahidjo organized a referendum that dissolved the federation in favor of a united republic, thereby removing the protections Anglophones enjoyed.

Church leaders in Anglophone Cameroon have accused Kleda of failing to acknowledge that the ‘Anglophone Problem’ exists.

They also complained that he didn’t condemn the arrests and detention of Anglophone leaders and the “grotesque campaign of human savagery and barbarism perpetrated on the people of Southern Cameroons by the government,” and by lumping the issue with other problems in the country, the archbishop was following the government line.

Despite these tensions within the episcopate, the International Crisis Group still thinks the bishops are the best hope for peace in the country.

“It is not too late for the Church to bridge these divides. Anglophone and Francophone bishops should come together in a public statement to affirm their neutrality on the issue most contentious in the crisis – that of federalism versus decentralization – and state their willingness to mediate,” the organization said.

The Group said that if the clergy are able “to project neutrality and win trust on both sides,” it “might play a behind-the-scenes role to allow for indirect communication” between the separatists and the government.

It said such a unity of purpose could be useful in pushing for the release of Anglophone leaders now locked up in Cameroonian prisons, and for amnesty to be granted to those who have fled the country.

Both measures, according to the International Crisis Group, are necessary prerequisites for talks.",Experts calls Church ‘only hope’ in Cameroon’s ‘Anglophone crisis’,https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/05/05/experts-calls-church-only-hope-in-cameroons-anglophone-crisis/
5,cameroon,"Cameroonians swept up in a conflict between anglophone separatists and the government are facing a humanitarian crisis, aid groups say as they struggle to reach people in remote areas that have become virtually off-limits.

They have ""numerous humanitarian needs"", said Allegra Maria Del Pilar Baiocchi, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Cameroon. ""Beyond the violence, (the crisis) has an impact on health, on employment,"" she told AFP.

Separatist ambitions have long simmered in two minority anglophone regions in the west of the country, where people complain of being marginalised by the French-speaking elite.

The push for separation was galvanised by a heavy deployment of government troops last August, spurring a low-intensity conflict with sporadic attacks on symbols of the state.

""As with any armed conflict, civilians suffer the consequences of the violence, insecurity and fear,"" said Alberto Jodra Marcos, who heads the Swiss branch of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Cameroon.

According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people are internally displaced in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, a one-time German colony that was divided between France and Britain after World War I.

In the worst-hit areas of Mamfe and Kumba in the southwest, some 40 000 people are estimated to have fled their homes.

But some fear the numbers affected could be much greater, with one humanitarian worker saying it was impossible to quantify the displacement given the limited access. The government has imposed curfews on civilians in both regions, and aid groups are rarely allowed in.

'War situation'

""It's difficult for organisations like ours to carry out missions on the ground,"" said Agbor Bala Nkongho, director of the NGO Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa. ""We are in a war situation. We can't send people everywhere.""



As well as those who are internally displaced, many Cameroonians have fled the violence to neighbouring Nigeria. SEMA, a Nigerian relief agency, said some 34 000 have taken refuge in Nigeria's Cross River State.

The state has said it will set up and fund a refugee camp with UN backing, but for now local communities are sheltering the majority of the Cameroonian refugees, according to SEMA chief John Inaku.

""The situation is very difficult for us,"" said Peter Kechi, the village chief of Bashu, which is some five kilometres from the border and whose population has ballooned from 1 500 to 4 000 in a few months.

""We are taking refugees into our homes and our bedrooms, with sometimes 20 people sleeping in the same room,"" Kechi said.

Locals say the refugees cross the border on foot through heavily forested mountainous areas, making it difficult to record their arrival.

The UN has registered 20 485 Cameroonians in Nigeria, according to Baiocchi, who added that ""the arrivals are continuing"".

Following a fact-finding mission in Cameroon's anglophone regions, ""we know more or less where the needs are... the next step is how to respond to them,"" she said, reached by telephone from the Gabonese capital Libreville.

Jodra Marcos of MSF said its workers had carried out training on how to care for the ""wounded and traumatised"" and donated medicines and equipment in anglophone areas.

However, ""many communities (are) in a precarious situation"" after staff have fled and some clinics have closed, he noted.

Separatists have been blamed for the torching of schools in the areas, while aid groups and residents also regularly accuse the army of carrying out abuses against civilians.

Early this month a human rights activist charged that soldiers killed several civilians by setting fire to their homes.

A security source, for his part, accused ""some aid groups"" of spreading disinformation.

The government in Yaounde has repeatedly denied accusations of excessive violence and extortion.

6,cameroon,"In Cameroon, Biya Pursues Journalist Mancho Bibixy, Silence From UN Of Soft Censor Guterres

By Matthew Russell Lee UNITED NATIONS, May 6 – Amid the worsening crackdown by the army of 36-year Cameroon president Paul Biya in the country's Anglophone areas, a video circulated depicting soldiers burning down homes. Click here for one upload of it. Noted by many residents and activists: blue helmet of the type used by UN peacekeepers. On April 30 Inner City Press asked UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric about the video, the day after publishing a story about it, in Google News. Dujarric said he hadn't seen the video but militaries should not use UN equipment or colors, presumably when burning civilians homes down. April 30 Q&A video here; transcript below. That is a typical UN response under Guterres, particularly on Cameroon where Guterres took Paul Biya's golden statue last October. Biya is locking up journalists; for now what Guterres does is have ""his"" UN Security hinder the Press, including most recently on May 5 here, Inner City Press which has asked about Cameroon and the statue he took since it happened. The Cameroon Journalists’ Trade Union, SNJC in Cameroon has called on Biya to drop all charges against Anglophone journalists Mancho Bibixy and Thomas Awah Junior, both jailed at the Kondengui prison in Yaounde.

The SNJC made the call in Douala on World Press Freedom Day, when Guterres' UN was engaged in censorship, complete with a barely audible video message from traveling Guterres. The two are due back in court on May 8. Mancho Bibixy, a journalist and history teacher was arrested in Bamenda in January 2017 after leading a ""coffin revolution"" on the streets to protest against the state of roads. Dzenyagha Thomas Awah Junior was also arrested in Bamenda during the same period and transferred to Yaounde for allegedly being in possession of SCNC documents. Ah, freedom of the press, under direct attack in Cameroon and persistently hindered and undermined in the UN of Antonio Guterres and his Global Communicator Alison Smale. They've made their restrictions on Inner City Press pervasive, including requiring minders and blocking access, refusing to answer petitions: call it soft censorship. From the April 30 UN transcript: Inner City Press: a video emerged over the weekend from Cameroon showing or depicting soldiers burning people's homes in the Anglophone areas, and what… what a lot of people focused on is that one of them, at least, is wearing a blue helmet. I don't think it means the UN is doing it, but I do wonder, what are the rules? I wanted to ask you, what are the rules if people have served in UN peacekeeping missions… have you seen the video?



Spokesman: ""I haven't seen that particular video, so I can't comment on the particular helmet, whether it was just blue or a UN helmet. We have seen, in different parts of the world, various security forces and army… we've seen reports of them using equipment that they own, which had been painted white or blue and reused domestically. It is a responsibility to ensure that no equipment that has UN markings is ever used in any domestic operation. But, again, I'm not… that's a matter… that's an issue of principle. I haven't… I can't comment on that specific report."" Hours later, still nothing.

The lack of confidence in the UN in these areas, and on this issue, was inflamed as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in October 2017 stopped by Yaounde on his way from the Central African Republic (where the UN pays Biya's government for peacekeepers who have been charged with sexual abuse). Guterres did not meet with any opposition figures, and accepted a golden statue from Biya. Guterres' envoy Francois Lounceny Fall has publicly said that secessionist are extremists, the word used by Biya to justify the scorched earth strategy exemplified by the video. Inner City Press asked UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zaid why his Office hasn't updated the death figures and he claimed it was because the UN has no access.

Guterres' humanitarian Assistant Secretary General Ursula Mueller visited Cameroon, but not the Anglophone areas. (Inner City Press asked her why, here). Human Rights Watch didn't even include Cameroon in its 2018 “World Report,” and told Inner City Press this is because it does not view it as among the 90 most serious problems in the world.

Guterres' Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed as in Abuja in her native Nigeria when 47 Cameroonians were illegally sent back by the Buhari government. Buhari will be in Washington on April 30 and a protest of Ambazonians is planned. Earlier in April, Inner City Press asked the US State Department about the refoulement to Cameroon and received a day later a statement. But what will happen on this video, and on the underlying issues? Watch this site. ***

Cameroon’s largest city, Douala, is one of the most important economic centers in Central Africa, and Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital, is over 100 years old and full of stories. In addition, Cameroon has a diverse landscape ranging from gorgeous tropical beaches to breathtaking mountain vistas. Cameroon’s Atlantic coast alone has been an important and scenic sailing destination for hundreds of years. The country is not only rich in wildlife and flora; with more than 200 ethnic groups living under one flag, Cameroon is steeped in cultural heritage, arts, crafts, and history.

What to Do in Cameroon

1. Musée de Douala: A must-see for art aficionados, this museum is located inside Douala City Hall, also known as the Hôtel de Ville de Douala. Featuring collections of Bamoun and Bamileke art, the Musée de Douala contains thrones, statues, and more relics from the country’s precolonial period. The building also has a shopping area with wood and brass sculptures available for purchase.

2. Limbe Botanical Garden: Founded by a group of Germans in 1892, the Limbe Botanic Garden served initially as a test center for crop species foreign to Cameroon, among them coffee, cocoa, rubber, and sugarcane. A 1988 renovation of the garden brought a new focus on conservation to the organization, encouraging the protection of Cameroonian forests and sustainable agricultural practices. It makes for a peaceful escape from bustling Limbe and features thematic gardens, large trees, and picturesque views of nearby Mount Cameroon.

3. Mile Six Beach: In the Southwest province, along the coast of the South Atlantic Ocean, lies Mile Six Beach, renowned for its perfect surfing waves. Not too crowded but close enough to be convenient, Mile Six offers a calm setting for picnicking, sunbathing, and other beach activities. Nearby Korup National Park has more than 50 species of mammals and three forest reserves.

4. Mangrove Swamps: One of the most easily accessible West African bird-watching locations, Cameroon’s mangrove swamps are also some of the richest. Because of its 900-some species of birds, we recommend covering a combination of both highland and lowland areas for the best mixture of specialty and endemic species.

5. Hike Mount Cameroon: Mount Cameroon, at 13,353 feet (4,070 meters,) is the highest point in Cameroon. It rises almost straight out of the coast, through a tropical rain forest, and has a bare summit that is sometimes dusted with snow. An active volcano, Mount Cameroon trickles lava down almost all the way to the sea, although it’s difficult to see the peak of the mountain because of cloud cover. Debuncha, at the southwestern corner of the mountain, is said to be the second-wettest place in the world.

6. Korup National Park: Recognized as Africa’s oldest and most diverse rain forest, Korup National Park is located in the Southwest province of Cameroon at the base of Mount Cameroon. The park features more than 620 species of trees and shrubs, 480 species of herbs, 400 species of birds, and an astonishing 1,000 species of butterflies. Known for its large selection of primates, Korup contains a variety of rare and endangered monkeys like the chimpanzee, red-capped mangabey, and red-eared monkey. Over 160 types of mammals live in the park, along with 130 kinds of fish. Mangrove swamp tours by boat around the Pelican Islands afford a peek into the fishing villages situated on the riverbanks.

7. Ring Road: The path that connects the most well-known attractions of Cameroon is known as Ring Road. Located in Bamenda in the Northwest province of Cameroon, the area has a picturesque, hilly horizon and an English-speaking population. Ring Road makes for an easily accessible (but slightly bumpy) way of seeing a number of attractions in a defined setting.

8. Parc National de Waza: Open from November until June, Waza National Park can claim the prize as Cameroon’s most famous national park. Featuring snapshot-worthy animals, the park can be viewed by automobile (a park guide is required for each vehicle). While camping isn’t allowed within the confines of the park, accommodations are available in the nearby village of Waza.

9. Kribi: A relaxing beach resort and seaport on the Gulf of Guinea coast, Kribi is located near the mouth of the Kienké River, approximately 49.5 miles (80 kilometers) south of Doula. Among the nearby attractions are the Lobé Waterfalls, and roads inland extend as far as Lolodorf, through the Littoral Evergreen Forest. A great spot for tanning and relaxing on sandy beaches, Kribi is a good halfway point to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea via the border town of Ebolowa.

10. Dja Faunal Reserve: Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Dja Faunal is a protected rain forest with an assortment of flora and fauna. Ninety percent of the area having been left undisturbed, the reserve is guarded by the Dja River, which creates a natural barrier against the outside world. With its 107 mammalian species, this area protects five endangered ones.

When to Go

The best months for travel to Cameroon are January through April, when temperatures are moderate and the climate is dry. Luckily for you, the lowest airfares can also be found during that time. Be mindful of your terrain. Often, the mountains and plateaus can register a significant drop in temperature or a change in weather, while the coast is often warmer and more humid.

Getting In and Around

Visas: In most cases, you will need a visa to enter Cameroon. If you’re flying into the country, arrange your visa with your local embassy before your trip. If you’re traveling by land, it might be possible to arrange a visa with Cameroon’s neighboring countries, but we do advise taking care of this matter before you hit the road.

Recommended immunizations include yellow fever, hepatitis A and B, typhoid, and meningitis. Plan to pack antimalarial medications, insect repellent, and loose, long-sleeved clothing to protect yourself from mosquito bites.

Transportation: There are three major airports in Cameroon: Douala International Airport (DLA), Nsimalen International Airport (NSI), and Yaounde International Airport (YAO). The one you are most likely to use is the Doula International Airport, as it is located in the economic capital of the country and is the busiest in the nation. Domestically, there is regular daily service between Douala, Yaounde, and other smaller towns.

Among the international carriers are British Airways, Delta, KLM, Northwest, Lufthansa, and United Airlines. Most flights arrive via Europe or other major African cities.

Cameroon’s train system, CamRail, travels from Douala to Yaounde, Yaounde to Ngaoundere (we recommend this route as a great way to travel between the northern region and the southern), Douala to Kumba, and more. You may travel by minibus or bush taxi from Yaoundé and Douala to most neighboring countries unless a particular border is closed. Once you get to the border, you might have to change buses, so check schedules before traveling.

Cabs are common in most cities; cab sharing is often encouraged as a way to save money, but be alert and aware if you decide to travel with strangers. A taxi can also be hired for the day without sharing for about $100 in American currency.

8,cameroon,"A social worker in the South West Region has raised an alarm of an impending humanitarian crisis that may hit the Region, if nothing is done to rescue some 30,000 villagers drawn from three cocoa producing villages in Fako Division of the South West Region of Cameroon from the wild.

The social worker, who spoke to Journalducameroun.com on condition of anonymity on Thursday, May 5, 2018, said if Government does not step in to rescue the people of Munyenge, Ikata and Bafia, who have been wondering in cocoa farms and the wild, following clashes between the military and the separatist forces, then she should be prepared to face the worst humanitarian crisis in the history of Cameroon.

According to her, most of those who are fleeing from the clashes between the security and restorationist forces are mostly pregnant women, children and the elderly.

The social worker further revealed that the situation is further compounded by the fact that all medical facilities in the three villages have been shutdown, as the medics themselves are running away into safety.

“Both the military and civilians alike are dying because medical facilities both private and public within these affected villages have been shut down. Healthcare givers in these health institutions forcefully discharged their patients and ordered them to leave their respective hospitals as they struggled to safe their own lives first.”

She said even churches are not spared as security forces are ransacking everywhere to fish out any suspected element of the Ambazonia Defence Forces.

“As the military went in search of the separatist forces, houses were razed to ashes, including Palaces of Chiefs and ancestral. This is what is going to trigger a humanitarian crisis in the South West Region because the entire Region is being reduced to ashes and the Government, Ministers, Senators, Parliamentarians are not saying anything. It stated in Kembong and then proceeded to Kwa-Kwa and Ndian. Kupe-Muanenguba recently experienced the inferno and now Munyenge in Fako, where do the Government through the military want this people to go? There is need for for an urgent solution to this crisis and burning down villages is not helping the situation,” the social worker stated.

It would be recalled that Munyenge, Bafia and Ikata have been volatile battle grounds in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis between Ambazonia Defence Forces and Government security operatives.

But matters degenerated again on Saturday, April 28, 2018, when the military launched an onslaught in the three villages, forcing thousands in this cocoa producing basin to escape into their cocoa farms.

These locals have reportedly been spending their nights around cocoa ovens for the fear of rains, while others have migrated to neighbouring Muyuka, Ekona, Ediki, Kumba, Malende, Buea among other towns as the wait on Government to solve this problem once and for all.","Humanitarian crisis feared in SW, as Munyenge, Bafia locals wonder in forest",https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/humanitarian-crisis-feared-sw-munyenge-bafia-locals-wonder-forest/
9,cameroon,"The Roman Catholic Church should mediate in the crisis in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, where separatists and security forces are embroiled in a dangerous conflict, a think-tank urged on Thursday.

""The Catholic Church could help break this dangerous stalemate,"" the International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report.

""Other than the Catholic clergy, there are few prospective peacemakers,"" it said. ""If no-one fills that role, the separatist sentiment already voiced by many Anglophones will continue to grow, fuelling further violence and exacerbating the on-going insurgency in the Anglophone regions, with elections in late 2018 a flashpoint.""

The crisis began in 2016, when activists in Cameroon's Anglophone minority stepped up a campaign for greater autonomy.

Their demands were rejected by President Paul Biya, prompting radicals to make a full-blown declaration of independence last October.

Since then, 31 members of the security forces have been killed by separatists, according to an AFP toll based on official figures. The number of armed separatists or civilians killed by police and troops is unknown.

At the same time, humanitarian needs in the Anglophone regions have grown. According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting.

The ICG said the church could help by stating ""its impartiality"" on the big question facing Anglophone regions – federalism versus decentralisation.

""A clergy able to project a position of neutrality could work with other trusted actors to mediate between Anglophone leaders and the state and stem a dangerous and growing crisis,"" it said.

The Church is one of Cameroon's strongest institutions, as it is present in all of the country's 10 regions and nearly a third of the population is Catholic, the report said.

It cautioned though that the Church also had to overcome its own divisions between French- and English-speaking clergy.

Cameroon's Northwest and Southwest Regions are home to most of the country's Anglophones – a minority of about 20% in the predominantly French-speaking country of 23.4 million.

Within the minority, a perception of injustice has grown that Anglophones suffer discrimination in the economy, education and the judicial system at the hands of the francophone majority.

The Anglophone presence is a legacy of the colonial period in Africa.

France and Britain divided up the former German colony under League of Nations mandates after World War I.

A year after the French-ruled territory became independent in 1961, the southern part of British Cameroons was integrated into a federal system.

Federalism was then scrapped 11 years later for a ""united republic"" – a centralised system that 85-year-old Biya, in power for more than 35 years, has said will not be changed.

The ICG warned last October that ""murderous repression"" by the authorities would only feed secessionism – a warning that the government lashed as an attempt to destabilise the country.

10,cameroon,"Benin and Cameroon appear to have escaped MTN’s chopping block.

MTN Group Ltd. said Thursday it has all but resolved disputes with the governments and regulators in the two West African markets, suggesting they won’t be abandoned in a widespread review of its sprawling empire.

In Benin, which accounts for about 2 percent of the Johannesburg-based company’s subscribers, Africa’s biggest mobile-phone operator by sales agreed to pay 70 billion CFA Francs ($126 million) to settle a dispute over frequency fees and secure a five-year license extension. In Cameroon, MTN is on the verge of signing revised terms even after revenue in the country declined and rival Vodafone Group Plc pulled out.

MTN had been at odds with authorities in both countries over the terms of its licenses, and Chief Financial Officer Ralph Mupita said in March that the company could walk away if the situations proved impossible to resolve. That made both favorites for a potential exit by MTN as Chief Executive Officer Rob Shuter weighs whether the company really needs to be in all 22 of its markets across Africa and the Middle East.

The spotlight now turns to Yemen and Afghanistan, two of only four countries where MTN lost customers in the three months through March. The declines contributed to a 1.3 percent quarter-on-quarter slump in the company’s Middle East and North Africa region, and both nations have been beset by military conflicts that have hampered business.

“They will probably wait for those markets to stabilize to some extent and potentially exit at a good price,” Peter Takaendesa, a money manager at Cape Town-based Mergence Investment Managers, said by phone. “It’s too early for them to exit now.”

Overall, however, MTN painted a rosy picture in its first-quarter update released on Thursday. Subscriber numbers gained 1.9 percent -- compared with a fall in the same three-month period last year -- while revenue soared in Nigeria and Iran, two of the company’s three biggest markets. In South Africa, the profit margin widened even as the company lavished cash on its network.

The shares responded accordingly, accelerating as much as 5.5 percent to 133 rand, the highest in almost two months. That said, the stock remains about the half the value of a 2014 peak -- before a $5 billion regulatory fine in Nigeria heralded the start of more challenging times.

“The key positives is that their margins have recovered faster than expected in Nigeria and South Africa,” Takaendesa said.","MTN Puts Out Fires in Benin, Cameroon to Shore Up African Base",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/mtn-puts-out-fires-in-benin-cameroon-to-shore-up-african-base

On his part, Somalia’s Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo lauded the efforts of journalists across the country promising to protect the constitutional right of freedom of expression.

Disinformation, slander and lies for selfish gains, have eclipsed the dissemination of real news.

Incidentally, the two countries are noted for gross rights abuse against journalists in the line of their work. Somali journalists have often been shot dead by militants operating in parts of the Horn of Africa nation. Arrest and detention of journalists also happens from time to time.

In Cameroon, international rights groups have reported that the government employs an atmosphere of fear and restrictions that force journalists to self-censor their work for fear of detention and high fines.

Some journalists in the country’s Anglophone regions have also been arrested in the line of their work. The country’s communications minister, however, pegs press freedom to the number of media houses operating in the Central African nation.

About World Press Freedom Day

World Press Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in December 1993, following the recommendation of UNESCO’s General Conference. Since then, 3 May, the anniversary of the Declaration of Windhoek is celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom Day.

It is an opportunity to: celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom; assess the state of press freedom throughout the world; defend the media from attacks on their independence and pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

The 2018 Theme is: ‘Keeping Power in Check: Media, Justice and The Rule of Law.’ According to the U.N., the theme of the 2018 celebration highlights the importance of an enabling legal environment for press freedom, and gives special attention to the role of an independent judiciary in ensuring legal guarantees for press freedom and the prosecution of crimes against journalists.

At the same time, the theme addresses the role of the media in sustainable development, especially during elections – as a watchdog fostering transparency, accountability and the rule of law.

The theme also aims to explore legislative gaps with regard to freedom of expression and information online, and the risks of regulating online speech.","Cameroon, Somalia presidents speak on World Press Freedom Day",http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/03/cameroon-somalia-presidents-speak-on-world-press-freedom-day/
12,cameroon,"Forced repatriations are illegal and play into Boko Haram’s narrative that states are unwilling to protect people.

Cameroon has forcibly returned 385 refugees to Nigeria this year, most of them in the past month, a United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) report reveals. This despite the country’s commitment as recently as 2017 to facilitate the safe return of Nigerian refugees fleeing Boko Haram violence.

By doing this, Cameroon is violating both national and international law. It is also putting vulnerable refugees at risk, and is eroding the effectiveness of protection frameworks and supporting extremist narratives.

Roughly 110 000 Nigerians have fled to Cameroon from Boko Haram-related violence. Of these, the UNHCR has registered 87 600. The Minawao refugee camp was built in 2013 specifically for Nigerians. The camp has capacity for 20 000 but reports indicate it hosts over 70 000. At least 30 000 additional refugees have been living in villages surrounding the Minawao camp and make up the bulk of the forced returns.

Equating Nigerian nationals with extremism is false and distracts from the real issues

The Cameroonian government claims that Nigerian refugees constitute a security and economic threat, but has provided no evidence that Nigerian asylum seekers or refugees have been involved in attacks. Despite mounting evidence, Cameroon denies deporting refugees and claims they have merely moved people to safer localities.

After two years of quiet efforts to curtail forced returns, the UNHCR published two reports in May 2017 documenting over 90 000 returns since January 2015. The UNHCR has since formed a tripartite commission with Nigeria and Cameroon to facilitate safe, voluntary returns that Cameroon has repeatedly violated.

A September 2017 report by Human Rights Watch claimed Cameroon had summarily deported more than 100 000 Nigerians, with evidence that soldiers beat people to force them to comply. Allegations of torture and human rights abuses, including unlawful detention, torture and killing, have been lodged against the Cameroonian government.

New Nigerian arrivals are reportedly being aggressively screened, accused of being members or wives of Boko Haram, tortured and moved to remote locations away from UNHCR access. Gross abuses have been reported in the Minawao camp, including a lack of food, water and healthcare and restrictions on refugees’ rights to move freely.

Boko Haram has had far more success recruiting Cameroonians than infiltrating Nigerian refugee flows

Cameroon has a legitimate right to monitor who is in the country, but assuming Nigerian nationals are linked to extremists is false and distracts from the real issues. It also has dangerous consequences. Refugees forcefully returned from Cameroon to north-east Nigeria face displacement and destitution.

They are returned to a conflict region with no access to resources or support. Overcrowding is severe, housing is scarce and food is in short supply. Women are particularly vulnerable and face sexual exploitation. Children are being separated from their families. Some returnees, including children, are weakened by malnutrition and a lack of medical care and die during deportations.

The non-refoulement principle – which forbids countries from returning asylum seekers or refugees to countries where they face danger – is at the heart of international refugee conventions. Cameroon is a state party to both the 1969 Organisation of African Unity Refugee Convention and the 1951 Refugee Convention of Geneva and has incorporated these prohibitions into its own laws. By forcibly returning people, Cameroon is contravening national and international law and tarnishing its long history of hosting refugees.

Conducting forced returns erodes the authority of international laws to protect refugees. It sets a dangerous precedent and is part of an international trend of growing hostilities and shrinking protection for refugees.

Returning refugees as a security measure is a particularly dangerous precedent in the Lake Chad Basin

Returning refugees as a security measure is a particularly dangerous precedent in the Lake Chad Basin, where Chad, Niger and Nigeria all face extremist threats and have tenuous human rights records. Analysis by the Institute for Security Studies argues that if other countries follow Cameroon, this would worsen an already dire situation. Worryingly, in February 2018, Nigeria – possibly in response to this practice – was similarly accused of forcibly returning 47 Cameroonian asylum seekers.

By repatriating people fleeing Boko Haram, Cameroon is forcing vulnerable people into situations that inherently contain many of the factors that fuel radicalisation. And this is happening in a region where Boko Haram is actively recruiting. Plus, one of Boko Haram’s objectives is to delegitimise governments as ruling entities. This is a central narrative of the extremist group, as are claims that states are illegitimate and unwilling to protect people.

Whether intentionally or by default, states that violate international and national human rights laws, and expose vulnerable people to imminent threat and poverty, lend significant weight to Boko Haram narratives.

Meanwhile Boko Haram activity in Cameroon has increased. It has displaced an estimated 200 000 Cameroonians internally and is recruiting members using a mix of coercion and financial incentives, particularly among disaffected youth. Up to 4 000 Cameroonians are believed to have joined Boko Haram. Evidence thus far indicates the group has had far more success in recruiting Cameroonians than infiltrating Nigerian refugee flows.

Responding effectively to Boko Haram in Cameroon requires practical, evidence-based efforts that address the root causes of extremism in a particular context. This must be done without violating the rights of refugees, or creating conditions that could worsen violent extremism.

As a signatory to international conventions governing refugees, Cameroon must reconsider its policy on deportations, and comply with international and national law to protect refugee rights. It must further allow entry of all asylum seekers and provide access to refugee registration. Programmes that counter Boko Haram recruitment must be started, and should include socio-economic development and education, particularly among disaffected youth.",Cameroon’s forced returns put Nigerian refugees at risk,https://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/cameroon-s-forced-returns-put-nigerian-refugees-risk

14,cameroon,"The British Foreign Affairs Chief, Boris Johnson, has reiterated the United Kingdom’s call for dialogue in solving the political and security crisis in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions.

Johnson’s views were made when he met Prime Minister Philemon Yang on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London.

After holding what he described as important talks with the Premier who represented President Paul Biya, Johnson added: “Urgent need to pursue dialogue, decentralisation and respect human rights in Anglophone Regions as President Paul Biya has previously committed. “

He stressed that the UK will support peace, prosperity and security for its friends in Cameroon. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has a security alert in place for the Anglophone regions – NorthWest and SouthWest – cautioning citizens against travel to those areas.

The security situation in the region has been chaotic for the better part of this year in an armed confrontation that started in October 2017. Separatists under the banner of the so-called Ambazonia republic attempted to secede from Cameroon and were met with heavy security crackdown.

President Biya is on record to have said that dialogue was the only way out but very little has been done in that respect. The last time dialogue came up, it was by Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji, who stressed that the government was only going to speak with persons seeking a united country.","Cameroon needs urgent dialogue, human rights to solve Anglophone crisis – U.K.",http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/20/cameroon-needs-urgent-dialogue-human-rights-to-solve-anglophone-crisis-uk/
15,cameroon,"They have “numerous humanitarian needs”, said Allegra Maria Del Pilar Baiocchi, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Cameroon. “Beyond the violence, (the crisis) has an impact on health, on employment,” she told AFP.

Separatist ambitions have long simmered in two minority anglophone regions in the west of the country, where people complain of being marginalised by the French-speaking elite.

The push for separation was galvanised by a heavy deployment of government troops last August, spurring a low-intensity conflict with sporadic attacks on symbols of the state.

“As with any armed conflict, civilians suffer the consequences of the violence, insecurity and fear,” said Alberto Jodra Marcos, who heads the Swiss branch of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Cameroon.

According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people are internally displaced in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, a one-time German colony that was divided between France and Britain after World War I.

In the worst-hit areas of Mamfe and Kumba in the southwest, some 40,000 people are estimated to have fled their homes.

But some fear the numbers affected could be much greater, with one humanitarian worker saying it was impossible to quantify the displacement given the limited access. The government has imposed curfews on civilians in both regions, and aid groups are rarely allowed in.

– ‘War situation’ –

“It’s difficult for organisations like ours to carry out missions on the ground,” said Agbor Bala Nkongho, director of the NGO Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa. “We are in a war situation. We can’t send people everywhere.”

As well as those who are internally displaced, many Cameroonians have fled the violence to neighbouring Nigeria. SEMA, a Nigerian relief agency, said some 34,000 have taken refuge in Nigeria’s Cross River State.

The state has said it will set up and fund a refugee camp with UN backing, but for now local communities are sheltering the majority of the Cameroonian refugees, according to SEMA chief John Inaku.

“The situation is very difficult for us,” said Peter Kechi, the village chief of Bashu, which is some five kilometres (three miles) from the border and whose population has ballooned from 1,500 to 4,000 in a few months.

“We are taking refugees into our homes and our bedrooms, with sometimes 20 people sleeping in the same room,” Kechi said.

Locals say the refugees cross the border on foot through heavily forested mountainous areas, making it difficult to record their arrival.

The UN has registered 20,485 Cameroonians in Nigeria, according to Baiocchi, who added that “the arrivals are continuing”.

Following a fact-finding mission in Cameroon’s anglophone regions, “we know more or less where the needs are… the next step is how to respond to them,” she said, reached by telephone from the Gabonese capital Libreville.

Jodra Marcos of MSF said its workers had carried out training on how to care for the “wounded and traumatised” and donated medicines and equipment in anglophone areas.

However, “many communities (are) in a precarious situation” after staff have fled and some clinics have closed, he noted.

Separatists have been blamed for the torching of schools in the areas, while aid groups and residents also regularly accuse the army of carrying out abuses against civilians.

Early this month a human rights activist charged that soldiers killed several civilians by setting fire to their homes.

A security source, for his part, accused “some aid groups” of spreading disinformation.

The Central African nation is beset by Boko Haram insurgency in its Far North region whiles the Anglophone crisis continues to pose a security challenge to the government in the Northwest and Southwest i.e. Anglophone regions.

According to the U.S. Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2017, the military, police and gendarmerie – paramilitary – forces were using among others arbitrary killings, forced disappearances and prolonged military / unofficial detentions in the three regions.

In its Executive Summary relating to the country, the report said: “The most significant human rights issues included: arbitrary and unlawful killings through excessive use of force by security forces; disappearances by security forces and Boko Haram.”

It went on to mention: “torture and abuse by security forces including in military and unofficial detention facilities; prolonged arbitrary detentions including of suspected Boko Haram supporters and individuals in the Anglophone regions.”

Then there was the issue of “harsh and life threatening prison conditions; violations of freedoms of expression and assembly; periodic government restrictions on access to the internet; trafficking in persons; criminalization and arrest of individuals engaged in consensual same-sex sexual conduct; and violations of workers’ rights.”

The government has deployed a military unit the BIR, which continues to engage with Boko Haram insurgents in the Far North region. Communities in the region have been attacked mostly by suicide bombers and raids by the group.

Over in the Anglophone region, guerilla style attacks on security forces by suspected separatists under the so-called Ambazonia republic banner has led to the formation of a new military unit headquartered in the capital of the northwest region, Bamenda.

There has been a sustained call for dialogue to solve the crisis even though the government has insisted that it will only engage with persons with the unity of the nation at heart.

Separatists have killed over 20 security forces, locals have fled their homes for fear of being caught in the cross fire with thousands now seeking asylum in neighbouring Nigeria.","Cameroon forces in gross abuse over Anglophone, Boko Haram crisis – U.S. report",http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/22/cameroon-forces-in-gross-abuse-over-anglophone-boko-haram-crisis-us-report/
17,cameroon,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
18,cameroon,"A Cameroonian media man and activist, Mancho Bibixy, has averred that the courts were complicit in the raging political and security crisis facing the Central African nation.

Mancho and six others were earlier this week convicted of terrorism and other charges including secession and hostility against the state. Their trial, which lasted months, was held by a military court in the capital Yaounde. Sentencing is reserved till May 8th, 2018.

Cameroon media said he was acquitted of some other charges as rebellion, civil war, destruction of property, killing and non-possession of an ID. Another accused was however acquitted and discharged.

Mancho Bibixy has been acquitted of other charges;(rebellion, civil war, destruction of property,killing and non possession of id) but guilty of terrorism, secession and revolution …This story is developing; final verdict awaited..Stay tuned.. Source:Francis AJUMANE — Mimi237 (@Mimimefo237) April 25, 2018

Even though his lawyers have said they will appeal the ruling, the outspoken Mancho delivered a message to the trial judge during his last appearance stressing that the court had taken the line of fuelling the Anglophone crisis.

“You have an opportunity to begin solving the Anglophone crisis or add more fuel to the fire. History will be the final judge,” he is quoted to have said. The terrorism charge largely stems from their actions supposedly “threatening Cameroon’s sovereignty.”

He first appeared in a coffin at a protest in Bamenda (capital of the Northwest region) in November 2016. His action it is said was to convey the message that minority English-speaking Cameroonians “seemed to have died before their real death” and therefore they had nothing to fear but to speak against the injustices.

The other accused persons include: Tsi Conrad, The Emile Agwe, Tangwa Maloin Tangwa, Azelecha Martin, Guingah Valentine, Junior Awahro Thomas. They were all ordered to pay 579m CFA francs ($1m; £770,000) in damages.

19,cameroon,"WASHINGTON, May 1, 2018 – The World Bank approved an International Development Association (IDA)* package of $274 million today for four projects focusing on helping refugees and host communities in Cameroon with access to health care, education, social safety nets, and social and economic infrastructure. The package includes a $130 million grant from the IDA Refugee Sub-Window. The country is the first to benefit from $2 billion of dedicated funding provided by IDA to support low-income countries hosting large numbers of refugees.

Cameroon has a long history of hosting refugees from neighboring countries. Today it generously hosts almost 350,000 refugees from the Central African Republic and Nigeria, with about 10,000 new arrivals since the start of 2018 alone. Cameroon is also party to most major international agreements relevant to refugees.

“These resources are critical to support the government in bringing adequate services to refugees and their host communities. Most refugees live side by side with Cameroonians in the regions that are already the poorest and most fragile of Cameroon, including the area subject to Boko Haram attacks. The four projects will work together in an integrated manner to bring multi-sector solutions to the complex problems of refugees and their host communities,” said Elisabeth Huybens, World Bank Country Director for Cameroon.

Working in coordination, the package – consisting of the Social Safety Net Project, Health System Performance Reinforcement Project, Community Development Program Support Project and the Education Reform Support Project – aims to improve access to health care and education for both refugees and host communities, include the most vulnerable households in social safety nets, and make sure that municipal development plans are developed jointly by host communities and refugees and deliver small public works that are critical to host communities and refugees alike.

To ensure success of these operations, a strong refugee protection framework remains essential.

The package was developed in close collaboration with the government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This strong collaboration will continue throughout implementation.

“UNHCR welcomes this crucial new support to improve access to health, education and other social services for refugees and the local Cameroonians hosting them through projects jointly developed by UNHCR, the World Bank and local authorities. This new approach shows how the presence of refugees can bring development opportunities to hosting areas,” said Kouassi Lazare Etien, UNHCR’s Representative in Cameroon.

*The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world’s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people’s lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 75 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.5 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $18 billion over the last three years, with about 54 percent going to Africa.

20,cameroon,"Boko Haram fighters have attacked villages in the Far North region of Cameroon leaving at least a dozen dead, several soldiers wounded and the villages torched in a large operation involving hundreds of attackers, some of whom used villagers as human shields.

Children gathered in little groups along the road shout to welcome the Cameroon military in Mabanda, a northern village on the border with Nigeria. It is one of the villages that suffered the latest Boko Haram assaults this week.



43-year old village elder Alihou Idrissu says groups of fighters infiltrated the faithful praying in Mosques and sellers and buyers on their market day Wednesday.



He says one group of eight armed men invaded the Mosque while they were praying and ordered the Imam and all Muslims present to lead them to a nearby Cameroon military post. He says those who objected were killed.



Idrissu says the militants operated for over two hours and killed at least 14 villagers whom they accused of failing to inform Boko Haram when Cameroon army arrived in their village ahead of raids on the insurgents' strongholds in the Sambissa forest last month.



Jean Pierre Ndanga, a Cameroon military officer in Mabanda says they found it extremely difficult to fight back because the invaders were using villagers as human shields.



He says when he ordered his troops to get down from their military jeep and move towards hundreds of villagers they saw marching towards the Mabanda village square, they suddenly heard gunshots and immediately understood that Boko Haram fighters were using the people as shields. He says he and many of the troops were wounded as they struggled to retreat to protect the villagers.



Jean Pierre was rushed to the Mabanda health center alongside dozens of injured military and villagers. Laboratory technician Dieudonne Besong says they attended to all of the wounded without discrimination.



He says many villagers had their lives saved thanks to the immediate intervention of health workers. He says four seriously wounded villagers were given the same surgical treatment as wounded military men.



Cameroon's military says the militants fled to neighboring Nigeria after the attack but at least 7 of the insurgents were killed.



Cameroon's semi-arid far North region has been a target of Boko Haram suicide bombings and raids for close to nine years as the Islamist insurgency spilled over the border from Nigeria, killing at least 25,000 in the Lake Chad basin shared by Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

On behalf of the Honourable Marie- Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs has announced the donation of 27 million dollars (estimated at FCFA 11.3 billion) as funding to humanitarian assistance to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. This was the subject of discussion ,besides examining bilateral ties between both countries, in an audience granted the Canadian envoy and his delegation on April 10, 2018 by the Minister Delegate at the Ministry of External Relations in charge of Cooperation with the Islamic World, Adoum Gargoum. Accompanied by the Canadian High Commissioner to Cameroon, Nathalie O'Neil, amongst others, Matt DeCourcey said bilateral relations between Cameroon and Canada are evolving on a very good note given their bilingualism character. Highlighting on the reason for the aid, he said Cameroon is host to several refugees from neigbouring countries and therefore in need of humanitarian assistance. ""In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics.

In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and the Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host countries,"" he stated. Information from a factsheet handed to journalists indicates that Canada's contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, clean water, health care, protection services including psychological and livelihoods support. ""Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. Canada is proud to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. This support will save lives and help to alleviate the suffering of people living in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria,"" DeCourcey is quoted in the document.",Cameroon: Humanitarian Assistance - Canada Donates Fcfa 11.3 Billion,http://allafrica.com/stories/201804120192.html
