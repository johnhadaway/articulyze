Forty percent of Cameroon’s 23.7 million people live below the poverty line and human development indicators remain low. Poverty has a strong regional dimension concentrated in the Far North, North, Adamaoua and East regions.

In Cameroon’s northern regions situated in the Sahelian band, communities are the most deprived as a result of years of successive natural disasters and below average harvests with little means to resist the continuous cycle of shocks and stresses.

The number of people facing food insecurity in Cameroon is estimated at 3.9 million, including 211,000 severely food insecure. The four priority regions of Far North, North, Adamaoua and East totalled 2.5 million of food-insecure people (CFSVA 2017). This figure represents 36.7 percent of the total population of these regions.

Stunting is a major public health issue in the northern Cameroon, with levels reaching 40.9 percent in the Far North region, and 38.4 percent in the East region (SMART survey 2017).

The global acute malnutrition (GAM) in the four regions is around 5 percent of precariousness threshold (Far North 4.5 percent, North 6.5 percent, Adamaoua 4.5 percent and East 4.8 percent). Far North region accounts for 75 percent of the lategrowth children in the four regions surveyed.

1,cameroon,"The Cameroon government has finally broken its silence on the state of separatists deported from Nigeria in early January 2018.

In an interview with the RFI English service, Information Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary, said all the detainees were in good health and being treated in accordance with the law.

He said three months on, investigations were ongoing to ascertain which charges were going to be leveled against them. He also stressed that they were enjoying all constitutional rights and would most likely be tried in a military tribunal.

They’re engineering, they’re masterminding all what is taking place in the country – assassinations, burning public institutions – you cannot imagine the kind of ordeal our population are submitted to in the northwest and southwest, and they are at the helm.

“All of them are doing very well, all of them are in very good health, all of them are enjoying whatever is enshrined in our constitution, the law of the republic.

“Which means that in case any need be, as far as the health is concerned, they receive all doctors or anyone who is capable of addressing the problem that they are confronted with.

“But I would like to emphasize the fact that whatever is taking place right now is being done in accordance with our law and penal court procedure,” the Minister said.

Supporters of the detained separatists hold that their lawyers have not been given access to their clients, the Minister addresses that point by saying that whatever processes are ongoing are within the laws of the country.

He accused the detainees of being the brain behind all the chaos that has rocked the Anglophone regions of the country. “They’re engineering, they’re masterminding all what is taking place in the country – assassinations, burning public institutions – you cannot imagine the kind of ordeal our population are submitted to in the northwest and southwest, and they are at the helm,” said Bakary.

“The likelihood that they will be court marshaled is obvious, because as I told you many people have been killed are being killed. Many people have already been slaughtered … the judiciary system will charge,” he added.

The group of over 40 detainees include the known leader of the so called interim government of Ambazonia, Sissuku Ayuk Tabe. Their extradition was criticised by the United Nation who called out Nigeria for breaching international law.

The secessionists declared an independent state called Ambazonia Republic on Oct. 1, 2017. Since then, violent scenes that have resulted in loss of lives for both the secessionists and government forces have played out in the Northwest and Southwest regions.

At the end of World War One, Germany’s colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors, laying down the basis for a language split that still persists.

English speakers make up less than a fifth of the population of Cameroon, concentrated in former British territory near the Nigerian border that was joined to the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country’s politics since.

The crisis which has attracted considerable international attention has become the gravest challenge yet to President Paul Biya, who is set to seek a renewal of his 35-years in power in an election slated for later this year.","Cameroon govt says detained separatists are in good health, enjoying rights",http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/10/cameroon-govt-says-detained-separatists-are-in-good-health-enjoying-rights/
2,cameroon,"The epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency has always been in Nigeria’s northeastern-most Borno State. Since 2013, however, the insurgency has spilled over the border into Cameroon. Boko Haram attacks killed nearly 2,500 Cameroonians between 2014 and 2017, according to Cameroon’s defense ministry (aa.com.tr, October 30, 2017). Most attacks in Cameroon are by the Abubakr Shekau-led faction of Boko Haram, whereas the Abu Musab al-Barnawi-led Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) faction operates closer to the Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Chad borders and has even clashed with U.S. forces in Niger’s Diffa region, according to an unclassified U.S. government report (documentcloud.org, December 2017).

In addition, an estimated 26 million people in the Lake Chad region have been “affected” by Boko Haram violence, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), while more than 2.6 million have been displaced (unhcr.org, February 24, 2017). This year, in January alone, Cameroon suffered about 30 Boko Haram attacks, with 26 people killed as a result (Xinhua [Yaounde], February 6).

Although Cameroon has had notable success in tackling Boko Haram in the years since 2013, the group is still able to inflict violence on the country, taking a toll both in human and economic terms. The spillover from fighting in Nigeria and the associated humanitarian concerns will persist in Cameroon, but the country is adopting new counter-insurgency measures in coordination with Nigeria that give some reason for optimism.

Entry Into Cameroon

In 2013, Boko Haram initiated operations in Cameroon in order to establish supply lines, equipping its fighters in Nigeria with arms from Cameroonian towns such as Fotokol, on the border with Nigeria. In some cases, the weapons came from even further afield, in Chad, and passed through Cameroonian towns such as Kousseri. Government officials, including the former mayor of Fotokol, Ramat Moussa, were among those arrested for arms trafficking. The mayor, arrested in September 2014, was found to have an armory under his house. Although he was suspected of supplying Boko Haram, he was acquitted in December 2017 after spending three years in detention (news24.com, December 27, 2017).

Boko Haram also exploited Cameroon as a (relative) safe haven for retreat after a Nigerian state of emergency offensive in 2013 forced the group to abandon urban positions for the mountains and towns along the Cameroonian border. Some of Boko Haram’s first battles with Cameroonian forces occurred as the military tried to prevent Boko Haram from crossing the border (AP, January 16, 2014). After one border clash in Banki in January 2014, Boko Haram released fliers in Cameroon in the name of Abubakr Shekau, warning that pro-government vigilantes would “pay dearly for what you do unless you repent” and telling Cameroon that “we have not attacked you, do not attack us” (fr.africatime.com, February 6, 2014).

Starting in February 2013, Boko Haram operations in northern Cameroon extended to kidnapping foreigners. In total, Boko Haram kidnapped 22 foreigners in five operations carried out between 2013 and 2015, as well as abducting a Cameroon traditional leader and some of his family members. Members of the Ansaru faction who reintegrated with Boko Haram assisted in at least the first two kidnapping operations, though it is likely they had a hand in all five (France 24, November 16, 2013).

The abductions were a huge success for Boko Haram, netting the group more than $10 million. According to one journalist with close ties to Boko Haram’s leadership, this was the group’s “biggest war chest” (storify.com, November 1, 2014). In addition, the government released many of the Cameroonian Boko Haram members arrested for smuggling arms in exchanges for the foreign hostages.

Current Operations

Boko Haram activity appears to have ramped down considerably in recent years. By 2015, the group’s arms smuggling operations in Cameroon had apparently been reduced, likely due to a number of major busts, including the one in Fotokol. In addition, there have been no kidnappings of foreigners in northern Cameroon since 2015, although this could be because foreigners now rarely travel there and not necessarily due to improved security.

However, since 2015, Boko Haram has carried out a number of suicide attacks where the perpetrators are women or young girls. Those attacks, as well as being costly in terms of loss of life, have been psychologically painful for communities. On December 31, 2017, one suicide attack at a café in Bia by a girl killed one person and injured 28 others (Vanguard, December 31, 2017). On February 12, Cameroonian forces shot and killed two other female suicide bombers in Kolofata “without waiting for military command.” Struck by bullets, the girls’ explosives appear to have detonated, and three soldiers were wounded collaterally (Cameroon Concord, February 13). The war has unsurprisingly taken a psychological toll on Cameroonian forces, starkly displayed on February 1 when a soldier shot dead two women and a boy in Mora in what was reported as “an act of madness” (IOL, February 1).

Although there are fewer border raids now than in 2013, they continue and are deadly. On February 6, five men and a pregnant woman were killed and two others were injured when Boko Haram raided the Cameroonian border town of Mayo-Tsanaga. Boko Haram also burned houses and churches during the attack (Xinhua [Yaounde], February 6). Other attacks may not prove to be deadly but are economically costly, such attacks in which Boko Haram steals hundreds of cattle (Reliefweb, December 13, 2017).

Cameroon’s Response

Cameroon’s response has been multi-faceted and relatively successful. Cameroon has partnered increasingly closely with Nigeria and, since February, its soldiers have been part of Nigeria’s “Operation Lafiya Dole,” Abuja’s counter-insurgency force fighting Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria (Premium Times, February 6). Retired Major General Babagana Mohammed Monguno reaffirmed in February Nigeria’s commitment that “no territory of Nigeria would be used as a staging ground to destabilize Cameroon.” In one notable success, a joint operation saw Nigerian and Cameroon troops kill 35 Boko Haram fighters (Vanguard, February 28).

In January, the country also began construction of a 10-hectare “rehabilitation center” intended to reintegrate ex-Boko Haram fighters with the support of traditional leaders. Of the first participants in this program, 186 are currently held in the base of the Multinational Joint Taskforce in Mora (L’Oeil du Sahel [Yaounde], January 17).

Yet another Cameroonian response may have been “deal making” with Boko Haram—the negotiator and mastermind of Boko Haram’s kidnappings of foreign hostages in Cameroon was released from prison in October 2017 under somewhat unclear terms (Camer.be, October 26, 2017). In the short-term, such deal making may keep Boko Haram at bay, but in the longer-term it could become a liability if Cameroon is unable to meet Boko Haram’s demands and the group extracts its revenge.",Boko Haram’s Backyard: The Ongoing Battle in Cameroon,https://jamestown.org/program/boko-harams-backyard-ongoing-battle-cameroon/

That said, I am happy to hear that the information is coming from the government spokesperson who is well know to cover up all the atrocities committed by the regime of Paul Biya he speaks on behalf of.

First can we define the word separatist? Separating from what legal union? This is definitely a fabricated story or a hostage drama with the La Republique forces of lawlessness and disorder being the main actors. More than 50 villages in southern Cameroon have been brought down to ashes with many villagers killed and several of them rendered refugees in neighbouring Nigeria.

Last time, it was Tunisians kidnapped and it was blamed on separatists. Meanwhile, Biya's government wanted to prove to the Tunisians it has managed to rescue its citizens so that the illegal arms seized in Tunisia en route from Russia to Cameroon can be released.

Believe you me, there is natural film acting (genocide) ongoing in southern Cameroon perpetrated by Biya and his brutal forces and all it takes is to get a camera and film it for free.

Concerted Efforts Result in Almost 4,000 Baptisms in Cameroon

Church unites in providing community outreach, small group and public evangelism.

The concerted efforts of church members, overseas speakers, and health professionals resulted in almost 4,000 baptisms in Cameroon in February 2018. Baptisms crowned the “harvest” phase of the Pentecost 2018 series, an outreach and evangelistic initiative of the West-Central Africa Division (WAD), a church region which includes Cameroon and 21 other nations in Central and West Africa.

The public commitment of new members through baptism came at the end of a series of biblical messages delivered from January 28 to February 17, 2018, on 611 public sites. Public evangelism was driven by the support ministry of 3,482 small groups, and a series of planned acts of community service and charity.

Cameroon Union Mission (CMUM) evangelism director Meting Jean Pourrat shared that he was able to witness God’s assistance throughout the logistically-challenging initiative. “Once again God has led us through, but I believe we can still do better than this to the glory of God,” he said.

Moving, Shocking Testimonies

The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) Cameroon, the humanitarian arm of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, partnered with CMUM Evangelism and Health departments. Together, they coordinated a Health Mobile Clinic to provide healthcare to the landlocked populations of Elat, in the Central region, and Zoguela, in the East.

Several medical specialists joined the initiative, including cardiologists, ophthalmologists, dentists, gynecologists, laboratory technicians, and nurses.

During field operations, the medical team encountered a desperate case involving a desperate father. His daughter Edima Géneviève had been severely burned and was sent home to die. The Adventist team, however, provided spiritual, clinical and financial support to the family. Today, Edima has a normal life and her father—along with those in the Elat village are smiling again. “Seventh-day Adventists have been a blessing,” Edima’s father said.

A few days later, the mobile clinic team came across a newborn baby thrown in a plastic package in the bush. Due to the quick work of the medical professionals, the child was saved from the ants that had attacked his face. His eyes had been spared. Emotions were visible as the village residents realized God’s name had been glorified, said those who were present.

The Evangelistic Phase

Community outreach and service initiatives opened doors and made it possible for the Church to launch the final phase of evangelistic preaching. Meetings were held on house porches and lounges, public spaces, and local churches. Church member volunteers — young and old, men and women — contributed to the success of the initiative.

Besides local preachers, guest speakers from the WAD headquarters and the world church preached in various venues across the country.

“I felt blessed as every evening I was able to share God’s Word,” said Stella, a church member who attended and listened to General Conference associate secretary Hensley Moorooven preaching in the capital city of Yaoundé. “People were blessed and grateful to God for [Moorooven’s] simple yet deep presentations.”

At the end of the series, the first wave of baptismal ceremonies resulted in 3,741 new members across Cameroon. Another 1,000 people are still studying the Bible and plan to be baptized in the near future.

Involvement for Retention

Mobilization of church members for the “Total Member Involvement” program — an initiative of the world church to get every member involved in sharing Jesus — can still be improved, believe regional church leaders. Statistics now reveal church membership has reached 108,000 members worshipping in almost 1,500 churches and groups in Cameroon. The challenge, however, is how to nurture and keep those members “in the fold.”

Leaders shared the regional church is now implementing an intentional plan to help new members succeed. “By involving every newly baptized member in missionary and community activities, we will make strong disciples committed to prayer and Bible studies,” said CMUM president Assembe Valere.

The 163 pastors called to minister to church members in Cameroon recently attended a spiritual retreat with General Conference Ministerial Association leaders Jerry and Janet Page as guest speakers.

“It was all about rekindling the flame so that the authentic experience of the early Christian Church can be reproduced,” leaders said. “It was a beautiful conclusion of Pentecost 2018 in Cameroon. It really rained.”

6,cameroon,"The government of Cameroon will accept dialogue as part of measures to end the Anglophone crisis, Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji is reported to have said.

He however stresses that the sole condition to the dialogue being that it will be held with persons who are advancing the unity of Cameroon as a nation.

His view effectively means that the Central African country is not going to engage armed separatists whose activities continue to threaten members of the security forces and disrupt life in the Northwest and Southwest of the country – the Anglophone regions.

“We can still solve the problem without burning, looting, raping, destroying. The government is ready to dialogue with those who seek the oneness of Cameroon,” the Minister said in a visit to Buea, capital of the Southwest region on Tuesday.

Atanga is one of two Anglophones who were handed positions in the government following a cabinet reshuffle carried out by long-serving leader, Paul Biya.

What has become known as the Anglophone crisis, has riled the country’s two English-speaking regions. A previous cry against discrimination and marginalization from French-majority Cameroon has now taken a violent turn.

Secessionists under the so-called Ambazonia Republic continue to push for a breakaway from Cameroon – a move the government has flatly rejected. After a crackdown on protests in October last year during a planned symbolic independence declaration, the secessionists turned to arms.

They have since attacked and killed over twenty members of government forces – police, soldiers and gendarmes. They have also kidnapped two government officials. A soldier after burning his vehicle and a government official who appeared in a video begging to be rescued.

The call for dialogue has continually been made by several countries and groups but has yet to be seriously pursued. A number of the separatists leaders have been arrested and deported from Nigeria since January but they have yet to appear in court.

The humanitarian crisis arising from the situation has also led to Cameroonians fleeing the Anglophone regions in their thousands.

Last week, the body of a Tunisian engineer working for construction firm Soroubat was found near Kumba in Southwest Province after the military rescued a compatriot and two Cameroonian technicians kidnapped by separatists, the government believes.

If, as alleged, the militant Ambazonian Defence Force (ADF) was responsible, this latest incident will exacerbate fears of a political meltdown in a region already dotted with ghost towns — fields of ripe cocoa beans are left unattended while teachers and lawyers remain on strike.

Militants ambush police and attack army checkpoints while a military crackdown on dissent has allegedly resulted in many fatalities and scores detained without due process, prompting a civilian exodus.

Systematically denied economic opportunity, Anglophones have for decades been largely excluded from the political process, inspiring activists to demand their own state — Ambazonia — co-extensive with the former UK-administered United Nations Trust Territory of Southern Cameroons.

Public opinion is divided between those embracing the separatist movement and those who believe violence only undermines recent gains.

The token appointment of an English speaker as prime minister has been maintained, while President Paul Biya's two more loyal Anglophones have ministerial roles.

However, Biya has not accepted demands to reinstate the Anglophone region's original federal status.

Respected figures such as upstream consultant Simon Tamfu, a Northwesterner and ex-head of exploration at state oil company SNH, believe the struggle for autonomy has been hijacked by militants.

Herman Cohen, a former assistant Secretary of State for Africa says the government must go back for the original federal system that was in his view ‘illegally abolished’ during the tenure of the country’s first president Ahmadou Ahidjo.

Ahidjo the country’s first president governed with a federal system for the first twelve years of his presidency. But in 1972, the federal system was abolished for a United Republic of Cameroon directed from Yaounde.

#Cameroon government must understand that only solution to West Cameroon crisis is a return to original federal system that was illegally abolished during Ahidjo administration. — Herman J. Cohen (@CohenOnAfrica) March 8, 2018

There has been a resurgence in the push by southern Cameroonians to secede from French-dominant Cameroon. A similar agitation started in the late 1990s. The recent one (October 2017 till date) started as peaceful protests against marginalization till the government cracked down on protesters.

It has now taken a violent turn as separatists elements have staged guerilla style attacks on security forces killing over twenty of them. The two Anglophone regions (North West and South West) have also been under curfew for the last few months.

Ahidjo stepped down as president in 1982 and Paul Biya took over the reigns.

Critics argue that the current governance structure concentrates power in the presidency despite two chambers of the legislature – the 180-member National Assembly and the 100-member Senate. The President is elected for a seven-year mandate.

While accompanying the Head of State to the People's Republic of China, the First Lady will interact with partners related to her charity works.

Relationship between the People's Republic of China and the First Lady of Cameroon, Chantal Biya in her humanitarian activities dates back to some two decades. And the relationship is still waxing strong with the Chinese partners always ready to provide material and technical support to actions taken by Mrs Biya in order to raise public awareness on the fight against poverty, disease, misery and all types of exclusion in urban and rural areas as well as to prevent and ease human hardship and ensure the protection, education, social and health needs of mothers and children in Cameroon and beyond.

While in China, the First Lady will certainly have much to discuss with her Chinese partners who do not only admire her humanitarian actions but have on several occasions supported the gesture, manifested through associations she created such as the Circle of Friends of Cameroon (CERAC), the Chantal Biya Foundation (CBF) and the Pan-African NGO-African Synergy against AIDS and Suffering.

One cannot enumerate all the social and humanitarian actions Mrs Biya has carried out over the years. But that which is certain is the support she gets from the People's Republic of China. This has mostly been seen through the Ambassadors of the People's Republic of China to Cameroon. Sometime in 2015, the Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon, Wei Wenhua and wife paid a maiden visit at the Chantal Biya Foundation in Yaounde.

The Chinese diplomat and wife did not just go there to know what the Foundation was all about but also with diverse gifts worth about FCFA six million, meant to facilitate the daily functioning of the Foundation's kitchen which provides food to over 1,200 abandoned and sick children each day. During that visit, Ambassador Wei Wenhua said having knowledge about the humanitarian activities of the First Lady of Cameroon, he and the wife, could not visit her Foundation without bringing something not only for the children in the Foundation but also to support and reinforce the cooperation ties that exist between Cameroon and the People's Republic of China which is also geared towards improving the living standards of the needy in the society.

Last year, the Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon donated foodstuff and other basic items to the Chantal Biya Foundation in Yaounde. The gift, worth some FCFA nine million was destined to assist vulnerable people in the North and South West Regions of the country.

Worthy to note is on January 13, 2009, at the East Wing of the Unity Palace, when Chantal Biya received the then People's Republic of China Ambassador to Cameroon, Huang Changqing in an audience during which the Chinese diplomat did not only congratulate her on her remarkable humanitarian efforts, but also stressed the constant support of the Chinese government to the social activities of the First Lady.

In 2003 and 2004, an association called La Foundation des femmes de Chine offered sewing machines to the CBF to promote the wellbeing of Cameroonian young girls as well as medical equipment.

Another Chinese association ""l'Association du peuple chinois pour l'amitié avec l'étranger (APCAE) offered gifts of didactic material, computers, foodstuffs, etc. to the Chantal Biya Foundation. The different wives of Chinese Ambassadors to Cameroon have also not been indifferent to the activities of CERAC.

During their stay in Cameroon, they have all joined the diplomat wing of CERAC in weaving the fabric of solidarity in combating poverty in rural areas, supporting charity and health care organisations as well as sensitising national and international opinion to the sufferings of the underprivileged. Chantal Biya's stay in China will obviously be a fulfilling one.

According to a press release issued recently by Cameroon’s UNDP, The strategic objective of the continued assistance from the government of Japan aims to support the Government of Cameroon at reinforcing the resilience of those affected by displacement and violent extremism in the East, and the three Northern regions of the country. This support will also support the Government of Cameroon’s role in peacekeeping operations across the region.

Speaking on the support contributions, the Ambassador of Japan, H.E Kunio Okamura, said “The contribution reiterates the support and solidarity of the Japanese people towards Cameroon and shows great respect for the hard work accomplished by the Government of Cameroon and United Nations organizations to provide sustainable solutions to the growing and urgent needs of populations affected by crises”.

The release also states that the funding is principally allocated to the United Nations Development Program(UNDP), to be jointly implemented by the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR).

According to the release, Japan’s support is allocated as follows:

2,060,000 USD for “Empowering Youth for Peace, Security and Resilience in the Far North of Cameroon” (to be jointly implemented by UNDP and UNFPA). The general objective of the project is to ensure that peace and stability around the Lake Chad basin is improved by addressing conflict and violent extremism through economically empowering vulnerable groups (young men and women) and strengthening the capacity of communities to address violent extremism and reintegrate vulnerable people.

1,000,000 USD for “Providing assistance to IDPs, refugees, returnees and host communities in the Far North region of Cameroon” (jointly with UNHCR). The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the levers of peace and to build stability in designated high priority areas “villages of opportunity” through the promotion of social cohesion and conflict resolutions mechanisms, the provision of livelihood support, as well as support for the improvement of overall living conditions of vulnerable populations.

1,660,000 USD for “Support to EIFORCES’ Capacity Building for Security and Peace Interventions” to be implemented through UNDP. The project aims at strengthening the institutional capacity of the International School for Security Force (EIFORCES), through strategic planning capabilities, updating the quality of its training equipment to meet international standards, and developing its research and networking activities to reinforce civilian and police contributions to national security, multidimensional Peace Support Operations and humanitarian assistance in the Central African Sub region and beyond. About 6,276 personnel including Gendarme, Police, academics, civil servants and members of the civil society, mostly from Central Africa and West Africa are the direct beneficiaries of the project.

600,000 USD for “Protection and Solutions for CAR and Nigerian refugees and IDPs in Cameroon” to be implemented through UNHCRThis project will provide international protection to CAR and Nigerian refugees in Cameroon through biometric registration, accurate and timely documentation, and access to legal assistance, preserving the civil and humanitarian character of seven sites in the East and Adamaoua and the camp in the Far North. Also, to prevent and respond to identified Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) cases, especially among women and girls, provide legal assistance, prevention and response services to children at risk, capacity building and advocacy for administrative authorities.

“Four years after the beginning of the multiple crisis impacting Cameroon, it is crucial to invest in empowering youth for peace, security, and resilience, whilst at the same time providing solutions to returnees and host communities. The new contribution of Japan is the expression of solidarity of Japanese people and a recognition of the generosity of Cameroonian people in hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees and Internal Displaced People (IDPs)” said the Resident Coordinator of the UN System in Cameroon- Allegra Baiocchi.

605 refugees have received shelter assistance in Cross River state since Jan. 2018

675 medical consultations provided in Cross River state since Jan. 2018

Highlights

Led by UNHCR, humanitarian partners including national relief agencies, UN Agencies and NGOs held the monthly technical coordination meeting on the Cameroonian refugees’ influx in Cross River state on 22 March. Progress presentations were made by UNHCR, ICRC, Nigeria Red Cross, Save the Children, UNFPA, CARITAS, WHO,

UNICEF, NCFRMI and SEMA. The coordination meeting participants agreed to map who does what, where (3Ws) to better coordinate the response and target beneficiaries and resources efficiently.

Gaps highlighted during the meeting include, improving the health referral system with necessary partnerships to make resources available for needed secondary and tertiary health care services. Furthermore, identified cases of tuberculosis need immediate assistance. Also, in areas where refugees have not been reached with assistance so far, some further displacements have been observed though their destinations have not been ascertained at this point. As a result of limited resources and access challenges, some refugees in the southeastern states have not been reached with assistance.

Local authorities in Cross River state have granted 10 hectares of land for the establishment of a refugee settlement in Ogoja, Yala LGA. The piece of land has the capacity to host 2,000 refugees. However, it is observed that groundwater on the site is not potable. Also given the capacity of the land (to host 2,000 refugees), the Office will request for additional land. UNHCR plans to create settlement sites with refugee groups that are not larger in size than the population in neighbouring host communities to ensure peaceful co-existence.

Population Movements

There are continuing reports of new arrivals of Cameroonian refugees in the southeastern states of Akwa Ibom, Benue, Cross River and Taraba in Nigeria. As of 23 March, UNHCR and Nigerian authorities have registered 20,485 Cameroonian refugees in the southeastern states.

UNHCR Response

BENUE: Three new partnerships have been entered into with local partners to provide shelter, health, WASH and protection monitoring services to refugees, including SGBV and child protection.

On 25 March, the UNHCR Regional Representative for West Africa, Liz Ahua, handed over non-food items (NFIs) to the Governor of Benue, Samuel Ortom. The NFIs are a contribution to support internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Benue state, where tens of thousands of vulnerable populations have fled their homes as a result of recurring violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen.

During the reporting period, the Office undertook site planning, WASH, shelter and road access assessments at (Anyake) Kwande LGA site ahead of ongoing relocation plans.

CROSS RIVER STATE: In Ikom LGA, protection monitoring continued and assessments reveal that refugees are ready to relocate and they have the necessary skills to undertake shelter construction. However, host communities are afraid they will no longer benefit from the assistance they receive as a result of the presence of refugees.

HEALTH: The international medical humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF OCB-Onitsha Belgium) will extend support to Cameroonian refugees in sites hosting the largest number of refugees in Cross River state. Meanwhile in Kwande, Benue, MSF-OCA Holland will provide health assistance to refugees.",Nigeria – Flash Update - Nigeria/Cameroon situation 19-23 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-flash-update-nigeriacameroon-situation-19-23-march-2018
12,cameroon,"A group of Cameroonian separatists arrested in Nigeria and transferred to Cameroon are being treated in accordance with the law, the country’s information minister has told RFI. Supporters of the jailed Anglophones as well as rights groups say the separatists have not been given access to lawyers or charged with any offence.

“All of them are doing very well, all of them are in very good health, all of them are enjoying whatever is enshrined in our constitution,” said Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon’s government spokesperson.

The separatists, including Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, leader of the self-proclaimed interim government of Ambazonia, were arrested in Nigeria at the start of January. A group of 47 Anglophones was then transferred to Yaoundé through a legally questionable extradition process.

“They’re enjoying all of their rights,” said Bakary, in a telephone interview. “When all the investigations are completed, they will be charged and brought to book,” the information minister added.

Q&A: Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon's information minister

Bakary said he had no idea what charges the separatists would face, but suggested the Anglophones could face a military tribunal.

The government previously described the 47 separatists as “terrorists” when they were forcibly deported by the Nigerian government at the end of January.

“They’re engineering, they’re masterminding all what is taking place in the country – assassinations, burning public institutions – you cannot imagine the kind of ordeal our population are submitted to in the northwest and southwest, and they are at the helm,” said Bakary.

Separatists

The self-proclaimed interim government of Ambazonia is worried because their leader and other members of the group have not been given access to a lawyer, nor have family members been able to visit them.

“Nobody knows whether they’re alive – they’ve not been seen for three months since they were abducted and then transferred to Cameroon,” Chris Anu, a spokesperson for the self-declared interim government.

Anu said they have hired lawyers to represent the detained Anglophones, but the lawyers have been unable to visit them. Neither have family members been able to see or talk to them.

“We do not know any facility in which they’re being held,” said Anu, in a telephone interview from the US. “The burden is theirs to prove that they’re terrorists,” he added, referring to the lack of any formal charges brought by the Cameroonian government.

Q&A: Chris Anu, spokesperson, self-declared interim government of Ambazonia

“The international community has rejected the fate of these guys who were abducted and allowed to languish in detention without any trial or charges,” said the separatist spokesperson. “Why can’t they take them to court and prove the charges of terrorism.”

The self-declared independent body blames the Cameroonian government for the ongoing crisis in the northwest and southwest of the country.

“If there are acts of terrorism or if there are any terrorists in Cameroon, it is the Cameroon government and its soldiers,” said Anu. “You have probably read reports of the Cameroon government razing whole towns or villages,” he added.

Human rights

International human rights groups have also voiced concerns about the fate of the Anglophone separatists three months after their original arrest.

“Those extradited should not be allowed to simply vanish without a trace,” Ilaria Allegrozzi, a researcher for Amnesty International, told RFI.

“Cameroonian authorities need to shed light on the whereabouts and health of those who have been extradited from Nigeria to Cameroon, in January 2018, including 10 leaders of the independence movement in the Anglophone regions,” Allegrozzi said.

“By holding those people in secret, without any charge, the Cameroonian authorities are failing to respect both national and international law,” the Amnesty researcher said in emailed comments. “They should immediately allow them to have access to lawyers, families and provide medical care to those who need it.”

Ayuk Tabe had been leading a campaign for the creation of a separate English-speaking entity apart from the Francophone administration in Yaoundé.

Tensions in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions have heightened over recent months. The crisis began with protests over perceived marginalisation of Anglophones by the Francophone majority. The government responded with a crackdown including curfews, raids and restrictions on travel. More recently armed separatists groups have launched attacks against Cameroonian security forces.","Cameroon Anglophone separatists 'doing well' after three months held incommunicado, says government",http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20180409-cameroon-anglophone-separatists-doing-well-after-three-months-held-incommunicado-say

""Mbeng is in the hands of the supporters of secession,"" lawyer Agbor Nkongho, a friend of the judge and head of a campaign group called the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, told AFP.

He was abducted on Sunday morning, Nkongho said, confirming information on social media.

14,cameroon,"Yaounde, 26 March 2018 – The Government of Japan has again renewed its support for internally displaced persons and refugees as well as supporting peace and security in Cameroon, by granting new contributions of over 5 million US dollars to programmes of United Nations agencies in 2018.

The strategic objective of this continued assistance from the government of Japan aims to support the Government of Cameroon at reinforcing the resilience of those affected by displacement and violent extremism in the East, and the three Northern regions of the country. This support will also support the Government of Cameroon’s role in peacekeeping operations across the region.

According to the Ambassador of Japan, H.E Kunio Okamura, ""This contribution reiterates the support and solidarity of the Japanese people towards Cameroon and shows great respect for the hard work accomplished by the Government of Cameroon and United Nations organizations to provide sustainable solutions to the growing and urgent needs of populations affected by crises”.

This funding is principally allocated to the United Nations Development Program(UNDP), to be jointly implemented by the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR).

Japan’s support is allocated as follows:

2,060,000 USD for “Empowering Youth for Peace, Security and Resilience in the Far North of Cameroon” (to be jointly implemented by UNDP and UNFPA). The general objective of the project is to ensure that peace and stability around the Lake Chad basin is improved by addressing conflict and violent extremism through economically empowering vulnerable groups (young men and women) and strengthening the capacity of communities to address violent extremism and reintegrate vulnerable people.

1,000,000 USD for “Providing assistance to IDPs, refugees, returnees and host communities in the Far North region of Cameroon” (jointly with UNHCR). The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the levers of peace and to build stability in designated high priority areas “villages of opportunity” through the promotion of social cohesion and conflict resolutions mechanisms, the provision of livelihood support, as well as support for the improvement of overall living conditions of vulnerable populations.

1,660,000 USD for “Support to EIFORCES' Capacity Building for Security and Peace Interventions” to be implemented through UNDP. The project aims at strengthening the institutional capacity of the International School for Security Force (EIFORCES), through strategic planning capabilities, updating the quality of its training equipment to meet international standards, and developing its research and networking activities to reinforce civilian and police contributions to national security, multidimensional Peace Support Operations and humanitarian assistance in the Central African Sub region and beyond. About 6,276 personnel including Gendarme, Police, academics, civil servants and members of the civil society, mostly from Central Africa and West Africa are the direct beneficiaries of the project.

600,000 USD for “Protection and Solutions for CAR and Nigerian refugees and IDPs in Cameroon” to be implemented through UNHCRThis project will provide international protection to CAR and Nigerian refugees in Cameroon through biometric registration, accurate and timely documentation, and access to legal assistance, preserving the civil and humanitarian character of seven sites in the East and Adamaoua and the camp in the Far North. Also, to prevent and respond to identified Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) cases, especially among women and girls, provide legal assistance, prevention and response services to children at risk, capacity building and advocacy for administrative authorities.

Seyi Wilfred has won his second fight in the 75kg boxing competition at the ongoing Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. The victory has put smile on the Cameroonian delegation out there in Australia as the chances for winning medals appear to be slimmer every day.

It has not been an easy start for Cameroonian athletes at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. Even though the men's basketball team won their first game against India and the first victories of Seyi Wilfried and Arsene Fokou in boxing, all does not seem to be going on well for team Cameroon given the high level of the competition.

Six days into the competition Cameroon is still in search of medals. Yesterday, April 8, 2018 was a difficult day for Cameroonian athletes. In 100m athletics race Appes Ekanga finished fifth in the heats and was eliminated from the competition. Charifa Labarang did not finish the race in her group. She suffered a thigh stretch that put her out of the competition.

Marie Giselle Eleme was equally eliminated in the competition. Another bad news for Cameroon was in weightlifting. Fouodji Sonkbou Archangeline finished 9th while Minkoumba Petit David was 6th. On Saturday Donald Nkoh (85kg) finished fourth after lifting a total of 326kg. In basketball Cameroon lost to England 81-54 during their second outing.

Cameroon has thus been eliminated from the competition. With two of Cameroonian boxers Azangue Aubierge (69kg) and Simplice Fotsala out of the race the hope for Cameroon lies on Fokou Arserne (+91kg). Arsene Fokou will enter the ring on Tuesday April 10, 2018. He will fight with Keddy Agnes from Seychelles. The bronze medalist at the World Boxing Championship in Hamburg, Germany in 2017 is a medal hopeful and is expected to help Cameroon bag home a medal in his category.

Apart from that Cameroon is still hoping for medals in athletics. The Secretary General of the Cameron Athletics Federation, Charles Kouh Kotteh said Cameroon has a good relay team and that there is still hope for medals for the team. He said in the field event Cameroon can count on triple jump and long jump athlete, Sandrine Mboumi, Mayack II in the same disciplines.",Cameroon: Commonwealth Games - Medal Chances Slimmer for Team Cameroon,http://allafrica.com/stories/201804090617.html
16,cameroon,"(Business in Cameroon) - During the 2016-2017 coffee campaign, Cameroonian coffee roaster processed 5,609 tons of the commodity, the national cocoa and coffee council ONCC reveals. This represents an increase of more than 2,000 tons compared to the 3,424 tons roasted during the previous campaign.

The board in its analysis of the campaign explains that since 2012, the volume of coffee roasted has been on the rise due notably to the institutionalization of FESTICOFFEE, the various measures taken to promote the Cameroonian coffee.

Renowned for its particular taste, the Cameroonian coffee is valued by food professionals. Indeed, during the coffee awards organized in France by Agence de valorisation des produits agricoles (AVPA) on April 4, 2018, five Cameroonian coffee brands were awarded. They thus grabbed more than half of the 9 prizes awarded by Philippe Juglar, the president of AVPA.

Let’s note that the AVPA is organized every year in France and this year’s edition was organized on the sidelines of the sixth general assembly of the African and Malagasy robusta agency (Agence des cafés robusta d’Afrique et de Madagascar-ACRAM).

17,cameroon,"Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has sent an open letter to the African Union Chairperson and President of Rwanda Paul Kagame urging him to “urgently call an Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (AU) to suspend the rights of membership of Cameroon from the AU to put pressure on the government to end alleged torture and ill-treatment of 47 political activists forcibly returned to Cameroon by the Nigerian authorities, enforced disappearances, politically motivated trials, and gross and systematic violations of citizens’ human rights in the country.”

The organization also urged the AU to “maintain targeted travel sanctions and asset freezes against the authorities until they meet specific human rights and good governance benchmarks.”

In the letter dated 9 March 2018 and signed by SERAP deputy director Timothy Adewale the organization said: “Despite the massive violations of citizens’ human rights, and the continued absence of accountability in Cameroon, the AU has largely remained on the sidelines. Failure to act in the face of the gross and systematic violations by the authorities would seriously undermine the credibility of the AU and the legitimacy of its Constitutive Act, including its commitment to fight impunity as expressed in Articles 4(h) and (o) of the Act.”

The organization said, “The AU Constitutive Act identifies respect for human rights, and the rule of law as universal values and requires all member states to promote and adhere to them. By taking punitive action against the government of Cameroon for disregarding the fundamental principles of the AU, African leaders will be helping to achieve a positive resolution of the lingering human rights and humanitarian crisis in that country.”

According to the organization, “The AU now must recognize and openly acknowledge that the situation in Cameroon threatens the entire region. AU leaders cannot continue to ignore the violations of human rights inflicted on the people of Cameroon by their own government and now must take serious steps to help alleviate their suffering and end continuing abuses.

African Union

The letter read in part: “SERAP urges the AU to intervene effectively to end Cameroon’s long-standing human rights and humanitarian crisis. Only strong and concerted pressure on the government can end the country’s human rights and humanitarian emergency.”

“The government’s longstanding assault on political freedoms and human rights lies at the heart of Cameroon’s political crisis. Enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture of political detainees have continued for many years, as the authorities routinely arrest and harass political activists, and violently break up peaceful protests.”

“According to our information, 47 refugees and asylum seekers, mostly leaders of the people of Southern Cameroon and who were recently forcibly returned to Cameroon have continued to face torture, ill-treatment, politically motivated trial and other human rights abuses by the government.”

“The AU should publicly condemn ongoing torture and ill-treatment of the 47 political activists facing persecution and abuses by authorities and call for their immediate and unconditional release.”

“The situation in Cameroon is characterized by widespread and massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law with growing numbers of victims lacking access to an effective remedy. The authorities continue to use state institutions such as the police and the justice system as a weapon against political activists, opposition leaders, civil society activists, and human rights defenders.”

“Arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and unlawful detentions, as well as reports of torture and abuse by the Cameroon authorities violate Cameroon’s regional and international human rights obligations and commitments including under the AU Constitutive Act and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.”

SERAP, therefore, urged the AU to:

In accordance with the AU Constitutive Act, hold an Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU to suspend the government of Cameroon from the organization if-within a specific timeframe-it does not release the 47 political activists, end politically motivated trials of opposition leaders and civil society activists, end enforced disappearances and torture, and meet specific human rights and good governance principles set by the AU;

Urge full accountability for the perpetrators of human rights abuses, including prosecutions of all persons responsible in accordance with international due process standards, as well as appropriate remedies for victims of abuses;

Agbor Bala Nkongho, director of the NGO Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, posted on his Facebook page, a chilling account that describes a miliary raid on a remote village in the region.

“On Tuesday, April 3, the Cameroonian army attacked and burned several houses in Mungo Vendeur, a small village located about 40 km from Nguti to Koupé-Manengouba (South-West). Ms Egbe Maria Ndonge was burned to death in her house while she slept,” said Nkongho.

Cameroon has been independent since 1960 and has no lessons to learn in the way its defence forces legally pursue their missions of securing populations.

“We have received reports of 6 civilians killed and reports of civilian killings in the village. Intentionally killing civilians and destroying civilian property are war crimes, which should be thoroughly investigated,” he continued.

Nkongho was one of the leaders of the first uprising of the English-speaking protest at the end of 2016. Arrested in mid-2017, he was released in September by presidential decree.

It is in this area that 12 Italian and Swiss tourists were briefly arrested by armed men on Monday, according to their travel agency.

The army responds

“Cameroon has been independent since 1960 and has no lessons to learn in the way its defence forces legally pursue their missions of securing populations. We also do not intend to respond to maneuvers of intoxication and diversion,” Colonel Didier Badjeck, spokesman for the Cameroonian army, contacted by telephone from Libreville, told AFP.

“It is extraordinary how some of these so-called actors of the region have resorted to faking the truth, or transforming it. We ask that evidence of these alleged abuses by our forces is presented to us,” he added.

Since the end of 2017, the security situation has deteriorated considerably in the English-speaking regions of the North-West and South-West, with armed separatist groups multiplying violent actions against state forces and kidnapping civil servants.

Yaoundé responded by force, deploying a strong security apparatus. The army has been accused several times of abuses through testimonies in the press and on social networks.

Observers fear that the Anglophone crisis could disrupt presidential elections scheduled to be held at the end of 2018.

Separately, six municipal councillors in the Northwest Region were released in a military operation, the authorities said.

The anglophone question in Cameroon is a legacy of the colonial period in Africa.

France and Britain divided up the former German colony under League of Nations mandates after World War I.

A year after the French-ruled territory became independent in 1961, the southern part of British Cameroons was integrated into a federal system. Federalism was scrapped 11 years later for a “united republic”.",Former top judge kidnapped in troubled Cameroon region,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/former-top-judge-kidnapped-troubled-cameroon-region/
23,cameroon,"Cameroon has banned the sale of arms and ammunition in six regions of the country, including the two English-speaking regions where a deep socio-political crisis has played out for over a year, the authorities announced Thursday.

The Minister of Territorial Administration, Paul Atanga Nji, has decreed “the prohibition, until further notice, of the sale of hunting and protection weapons and their ammunition in the Adamaoua, Central, Littoral, West, North-West and South-West regions”, according to a statement.

“To date, the number of firearms in circulation far exceeds the number of authorizations duly granted by the competent authorities,” the minister said in the text.

To date, the number of firearms in circulation far exceeds the number of authorizations duly granted by the competent authorities.

Cameroon has ten regions. Among these, the two English-speaking regions (Southwest and Northwest) have been at the center of a political crisis since the end of 2016 awhile their neighbouring regions (Littoral, West) are also affected by the ban.

For more than three months, the Anglophone crisis has turned into an armed conflict of low intensity, where an armed branch of the Anglophone separatists, who are agitating for secession from Cameroon and the creation of a new state, “Ambazonia”, is fighting the security forces deployed in numbers by Yaoundé.

English-speaking separatists have killed 28 members of the security forces since late 2017, according to an AFP compilation based on official statements. Other observers in Yaoundé speak of a higher toll.

In addition, the Amadoua region affected by the ban is neighbouring the Central African Republic, where state authority is weak in provinces where armed groups fight for control of resources and influence.

According to the text, the armouries of the six regions concerned will have to be closed and an inventory of the weapons which are there will have to be drawn up.

The minister has asked holders of unauthorized weapons to turn them over to local authorities and those with legally recognized weapons to register.

In November and February, the authorities in the south-west and north-west respectively banned the sale of arms in their regions on a temporary basis.

Presidential elections are scheduled to be held later this year, even as the ruling party Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM) won 63 out of the 70 senate seats in local elections held on March 25.
