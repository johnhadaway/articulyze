0,cameroon,"The unrest in Cameroon's English-speaking areas continues as separatists attack government officials and soldiers burn villages. DW's Adrian Kriesch reports many are now looking to the Catholic Church for help.

Agbor Gilbert Ebot has slept no more than two hours, he is exhausted.

Nevertheless, the organizer of the Cameroon International Film Festival has been up since 6 a.m, headed to the police station in Buea, capital of the Southwest region of Cameroon, in the pouring rain.

Three members of an actors' workshop were forced to spend the night at the station because they had forgotten their papers. ""If you go to the bathroom, or just walk from the living room to the kitchen, you need to bring your ID card,"" Ebot says, adding that security forces don't take infringements lightly; they immediately arrest people and put them behind bars. Ebot negotiates with the police, and a few hours later, the acting students are free to go again.

Raking in money during the crisis

Most Buea locals have similar stories to tell. Ever since the conflict in Cameroon's English-speaking areas escalated, security forces are omnipresent. Truckloads of heavily armed soldiers patrol the city at night. It's a militarized state, says a local journalist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. Residents suspected of being members of the so-called Ambazonia Defense Forces who are fighting for independence from Yaounde are arrested all the time, he says, adding that he has visited people held at the police station, where the conditions are a disaster. Those detained could not expect an actual trial, and bribes to get them released are common, the reporter told DW. ""A lot of money is being made from this crisis.""

The country's colonial past is still today behind the tensions.

Cameroon gained independence in the 1960s, when the former French-speaking mandated territory was joined with the English-language regions. The country has two official languages, two education systems, two legal systems. However, the minority in the Anglophone southwest has felt disadvantaged and marginalized for years. In 2016, lawyers in the English-speaking region took to the streets, followed by a teacher strike and more protests. The government ignored their demands and instead reacted with a security crackdown. Several protesters were killed, the Internet was switched off for three months while strikes paralyzed schools, and businesses closed one day a week for special ""ghost town days.""

President declares war on separatists

Paul Biya, Cameroon's President who's been in power for more than 35 years, instituted a Commission for Bilingualism and Multiculturalism, but many English-language speakers argue that is not enough. Demonstrations flared again in late 2017, and security forces killed at least 40 people. The protest became radicalized, various separatist groups formed, killing security and state officials they believed to be police informers. The president has since declared war on the separatists.

Now the battles lines are drawn. More than 100 civilians and 40 security officers have died. The International Crisis Group (ICG) has urged the Catholic Church to mediate in the conflict. The church represents one out of three Cameroonians, it is a powerful force.

""I agree, but it will be very difficult under the present circumstances,"" Buea bishop Emmanuel Busho told DW, adding that the top authority in the country isn't prepared to enter into a dialogue. ""They are trying to dictate the conditions for a dialogue but we believe we need to speak as equals - if you pose conditions, there can be no dialogue.""

Church is divided

The government has refused to speak to the radical groups. DW asked for but was not granted an interview with a government representative. In 2016, the Catholic bishops wrote the president a letter detailing the Anglophone Cameroonians' worries but the government accused the bishops of fueling the conflict. Moreover, even the Francophone and the Anglophone bishops don't see eye to eye. ""We trust the Catholic Church in the Anglophone areas, but not the bishops in the French-speaking areas,"" an activist who supports the separatists told DW. The Francophone bishops are regarded loyal to the government he added: ""Before the crisis, both chose sides.""

Whether or not the church can act as mediator will depend on whether the bishops can agree. If they can't, the conflict threatens to escalate further. Separatists have told DW they would do everything in their power to prevent presidential elections scheduled for October — hoping to force the government to the negotiating table.",Cameroon: Can the Catholic Church Mediate in the Anglophone Crisis?,http://allafrica.com/stories/201805080211.html
1,cameroon,"Cameroonians swept up in a conflict between anglophone separatists and the government are facing a humanitarian crisis, aid groups say as they struggle to reach people in remote areas that have become virtually off-limits.

They have ""numerous humanitarian needs"", said Allegra Maria Del Pilar Baiocchi, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Cameroon. ""Beyond the violence, (the crisis) has an impact on health, on employment,"" she told AFP.

Separatist ambitions have long simmered in two minority anglophone regions in the west of the country, where people complain of being marginalised by the French-speaking elite.

The push for separation was galvanised by a heavy deployment of government troops last August, spurring a low-intensity conflict with sporadic attacks on symbols of the state.

""As with any armed conflict, civilians suffer the consequences of the violence, insecurity and fear,"" said Alberto Jodra Marcos, who heads the Swiss branch of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Cameroon.

According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people are internally displaced in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, a one-time German colony that was divided between France and Britain after World War I.

In the worst-hit areas of Mamfe and Kumba in the southwest, some 40,000 people are estimated to have fled their homes.

But some fear the numbers affected could be much greater, with one humanitarian worker saying it was impossible to quantify the displacement given the limited access. The government has imposed curfews on civilians in both regions, and aid groups are rarely allowed in.

'War situation'

""It's difficult for organisations like ours to carry out missions on the ground,"" said Agbor Bala Nkongho, director of the NGO Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa. ""We are in a war situation. We can't send people everywhere.""

As well as those who are internally displaced, many Cameroonians have fled the violence to neighbouring Nigeria. SEMA, a Nigerian relief agency, said some 34,000 have taken refuge in Nigeria's Cross River State.

The state has said it will set up and fund a refugee camp with UN backing, but for now local communities are sheltering the majority of the Cameroonian refugees, according to SEMA chief John Inaku.

""The situation is very difficult for us,"" said Peter Kechi, the village chief of Bashu, which is some five kilometres (three miles) from the border and whose population has ballooned from 1,500 to 4,000 in a few months.

""We are taking refugees into our homes and our bedrooms, with sometimes 20 people sleeping in the same room,"" Kechi said.

Locals say the refugees cross the border on foot through heavily forested mountainous areas, making it difficult to record their arrival.

The UN has registered 20,485 Cameroonians in Nigeria, according to Baiocchi, who added that ""the arrivals are continuing"".

Following a fact-finding mission in Cameroon's anglophone regions, ""we know more or less where the needs are... the next step is how to respond to them,"" she said, reached by telephone from the Gabonese capital Libreville.

Jodra Marcos of MSF said its workers had carried out training on how to care for the ""wounded and traumatised"" and donated medicines and equipment in anglophone areas.

However, ""many communities (are) in a precarious situation"" after staff have fled and some clinics have closed, he noted.

Separatists have been blamed for the torching of schools in the areas, while aid groups and residents also regularly accuse the army of carrying out abuses against civilians.

Early this month a human rights activist charged that soldiers killed several civilians by setting fire to their homes.

A security source, for his part, accused ""some aid groups"" of spreading disinformation.

The government in Yaounde has repeatedly denied accusations of excessive violence and extortion.

UNHCR appreciates the contribution of EUR300,000 by the European Commission's department for overseas humanitarian aid (ECHO) towards the response to the Cameroon refugee situation in Nigeria.

NCFRMI and UNHCR completed registration in Sardauna LGA, Taraba state on 20 April bringing the total figures of Cameroonian refugees in Nigeria to 21,291. In Boki LGA, Cross River, seven new villages are reportedly hosting an unverified number of new refugees. UNHCR and NCFRMI are planning registration missions to the said villages.

On 24 April, UNHCR chaired the monthly technical coordination meeting in Calabar on Cameroonian refugees to assess the multi-sectoral response to the refugee influx in Nigeria’s southeastern states. As key outcomes of the meeting, the Ministry of Health (MOH) committed to taking measures to ensure that refugees receive free primary healthcare services in Cross River state. Also, the Cross River state Primary Health Care Development Agency indicated that it is recruiting additional healthcare workers to meet increasing demand as a result of the refugee influx across the state.

The UNHCR Office organised a two-day training for partners from 26 to 27 April in Ikom LGA. Some 25 UNHCR partner staff including, BENGONET, FJDP, HIFAS, Rhema-Care, Caritas and Mediatrix, took part in the training, which focused on strengthening their knowledge on humanitarian principles, protection monitoring, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, among others. Meanwhile, a registration training was organised from 25 to 27 April for 10 NCFRMI staff. These trainings aim to enable an effective response to the Cameroon refugee situation.

UNHCR Response

During the reporting period in Cross River state, UNHCR partner, HIFAS, provided health care assistance to 17 refugees referred to three health centres in Ikom and Etung LGAs. The Ikom LGA has provided power supply for the borehole water pumping system at the transit shelter in Ikom as a temporary measure to assist some 300 refugees.

The absence of specialized healthcare services at referral health centres in Oban and Akamkpa LGAs will lead to referrals of special health cases to tertiary health centres in Calabar LGA. This will result in higher transportation costs and require an increase in health response envelope.

Negotiations for a refugee relocation site in Sankwala, Obanliku LGA were concluded during the reporting period. UNHCR partner, Rhema-Care, requested that local authorities seal the deal with a formal letter indicating the donation of the land site.

Some 171 unregistered refugees were identified during protection monitoring in Cross River. It was also noted that refugees in Cross River are undertaking secondary movements within the state in search of assistance and better living conditions. Meanwhile, new arrivals were reported in Boki, Ikom, Etung, and Akamkpa LGAs.

Despite response to the refugee influx in Cross River, gaps in assistance remain significant. The refugee shelter in Amana and Ikom are overcrowded and needs identified include lamps, mattresses, blankets and kitchen sets.

In Benue, Kwande LGA, UNHCR and partners undertook a multifunctional team mission to Abande and Anyake villages, Kwande LGA, on 2 May to continue refugee sensitization on relocation and mobilize host community support for relocation. The team included partners namely, MSF, FJDP, BENGONET and SEMA. Two bridges in the host community on the relocation route need urgent repairs. Host community requested renovation of the school where refugees are hosted and a borehole, among others, as a demonstration of appreciation for hosting the refugees.

The relocation of the refugees in Abande is tentatively set to start on 15 May, meanwhile, the digging of five wells has begun at the location, where three of the wells will serve the host community and two will serve the refugees.",Nigeria – Flash Update - Nigeria/Cameroon situation 23 April - 4 May 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-flash-update-nigeriacameroon-situation-23-april-4-may-2018

It is the case in Buea this morning where denizens got up to a relative calm after sounds of gunshots were heard in the town on Sunday night though it is still unclear who were the authors.

It is the same calm reigning in Belo, North West Region of Cameroon as reports from the area say the Divisional Officer of the locality Nkongho Nicholas Manchang is now working from his residence after his office was burnt down by unidentified men on Friday.

Reports streaming from Belo on Monday morning say the DO’s residence is heavily guarded following Friday’s incident while the town is deserted as a result of recent happenings in the town.

Mbengwi also got up on Monday morning to relative calm after squirmishes between security forces and armed men at the market square forced villagers to desert the area while motorcycles were reportedly set ablaze.

Back in the South West Region, pictures of the lifeless, mutilated and beheaded body of a soldier circulated on social media as sources say the soldier was killed in Muyengue. The area has since been deserted by villagers following heavy fightings between security forces and gun men. It is the same scenario in Mbalangi where movement was paralysed for hours following heavy fighting that led to several villagers taking refuge in the bushes.","Anglophone crisis: Soldier beheaded in Muyuka, Belo DO’s office burnt",https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/anglo-crisis-soldier-beheaded-muyuka-belo-dos-office-burnt/

Cameroon is once more blessed with the presence of yet another group of medical practitioners to help the needy with 500 surgeries. Anaesthesias, gynaecologists, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, surgeons, urologists, a neurosurgeon, a plastic surgeon and an ENT, alongside seven volunteers from Indian under the Rotary Foundation of the Rotary International, District 9150, are at the end of their 10-day humanitarian mission in Cameroon.

During a cocktail reception of the team of surgeons by the Honorary Consul of India to Cameroon, J. Ravikumar, it filtered out that they have carried out 400 surgeries two days to the end of their mission. According to Rajendra K Saboo, former Rotary International President, the doctors who are at the top of their specialities in India are committed to serve Cameroonians free of charge.

""The General Hospital, Gynaeco-obstetrician and Paediatric Hospital in Douala as well as the Laquintinie hospital involved do not have to collect money from patients"", he reiterated. The free surgery is accompanied with free drugs, fluids, consumables and some equipment, he added.

In the presence of Team Leader and Project Chair, PDG Ranjit K Bhatia, the former Rotary International President said the medics have done remarkable work going by the kind of prostate, mask and cataracts removed among others.

Glade with the opportunity given them to reach out to people below poverty line, Rajendra Saboo said they have been carrying out such missions for 19 years and it is their first time in Cameroon. ""We have been to over 20 African countries including Congo, Gabon and Ruanda demonstrating our slogan, 'Rotary: making a Difference'"", he disclosed.

On his part, the Honorary Consul, J. Ravikumar, acclaimed the medics selfless philosophy for the health and wellbeing of Cameroonians.

The social worker, who spoke to Journalducameroun.com on condition of anonymity on Thursday, May 5, 2018, said if Government does not step in to rescue the people of Munyenge, Ikata and Bafia, who have been wondering in cocoa farms and the wild, following clashes between the military and the separatist forces, then she should be prepared to face the worst humanitarian crisis in the history of Cameroon.

According to her, most of those who are fleeing from the clashes between the security and restorationist forces are mostly pregnant women, children and the elderly.

The social worker further revealed that the situation is further compounded by the fact that all medical facilities in the three villages have been shutdown, as the medics themselves are running away into safety.

“Both the military and civilians alike are dying because medical facilities both private and public within these affected villages have been shut down. Healthcare givers in these health institutions forcefully discharged their patients and ordered them to leave their respective hospitals as they struggled to safe their own lives first.”

She said even churches are not spared as security forces are ransacking everywhere to fish out any suspected element of the Ambazonia Defence Forces.

“As the military went in search of the separatist forces, houses were razed to ashes, including Palaces of Chiefs and ancestral. This is what is going to trigger a humanitarian crisis in the South West Region because the entire Region is being reduced to ashes and the Government, Ministers, Senators, Parliamentarians are not saying anything.

It would be recalled that Munyenge, Bafia and Ikata have been volatile battle grounds in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis between Ambazonia Defence Forces and Government security operatives.

But matters degenerated again on Saturday, April 28, 2018, when the military launched an onslaught in the three villages, forcing thousands in this cocoa producing basin to escape into their cocoa farms.

These locals have reportedly been spending their nights around cocoa ovens for the fear of rains, while others have migrated to neighbouring Muyuka, Ekona, Ediki, Kumba, Malende, Buea among other towns as the wait on Government to solve this problem once and for all.","Humanitarian crisis feared in SW, as Munyenge, Bafia locals wonder in forest",https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/humanitarian-crisis-feared-sw-munyenge-bafia-locals-wonder-forest/

Despite military successes scored against Boko Haram jihadists, it will take years to “completely eliminate” the group, a United Nations envoy told AFP Tuesday.

“Boko Haram has proven to be a resilient group…I think it will take time to totally eliminate,” said Muhammad Ibn Chambas, special envoy to the UN secretary general for West Africa and the Sahel.

“What we are seeing is that Boko Haram has become part of an international terrorism network.”

Chambas was speaking on the sidelines of a Lake Chad regional summit in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and birthplace of Boko Haram.

Governors from four countries straddling the lake —- Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon — are meeting for two days to discuss regional cooperation on stabilisation, peace building and sustainable development in the area.

His remarks come at a time the Nigerian government and military is insisting that the war against Boko Haram is over, despite a recent spate of attacks by the extremists.

On May 1 at least 86 people were killed in twin suicide attacks targeting a mosque and a nearby market in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state.

Chambas said that the Islamist insurgents were likely still holding on to territory in the region.

“It is relative,” he said in response to reports that Boko Haram was holding territory in the northeast states of Yobe and Borno.

“As long as they are not totally defeated obviously they are present in some areas”.

The Islamist insurgency has killed at least 20,000 people in nine years of violence that has spilled from northeast Nigeria into Niger, Chad and Cameroon, creating a dire humanitarian crisis.

The four countries formed the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to fight the Islamic extremists who criss-cross the porous borders in the remote region.

Chambas commended the MNJTF counter terrorism fight as “appreciably successful” but warned it was far from over.

“We of course ask that the MNJTF remains vigilant in its fight against Boko Haram, we cannot take it for granted and assume they have been totally defeated”.

In December 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari declared Boko Haram had been “technically defeated” after reclaiming swathes of territory back from the jihadists.

But claims that the jihadists are a spent force have been put under scrutiny as the jihadists continued to launch deadly suicide and gun attacks on military and civilian targets.",Boko Haram will take years to ‘eliminate’: UN envoy,https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/boko-haram-will-take-years-to-eliminate-un-envoy/

According to official statistics, the day is celebrated on every May 8, because it marks the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant, founder of the Red Cross and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The day is celebrated annually in order to commemorate principles of International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It is meant to pay tribute to the participants of the event and their contribution for helping people in need. After World War I, Red Cross was introduced in order to call for peace. This was done as part of international commission of 14th International Conference of the Red Cross. Red Cross Truce principles were approved at 15th International Conference at Tokyo in 1934.

The permission to make World Red Cross Day an annual event was by the International Federation of the Red Cross Societies (IFRC) General Assembly to League of the Red Cross Societies (LORCS). The day was first celebrated in 1948, when it was officially named as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day.

The day is celebrated internationally in order to reduce suffering and enable people live a more dignified life. The idea is to protect them from emergencies and natural disasters such as epidemics, earthquakes and floods. The day is celebrated in Red Cross Organisations across the world by helping people with independence, humanity, impartiality, universality, unity and neutrality – the fundamental principles of the organisation.

As part of the celebration of the day, International Committee of Red Cross and its members organise programmes and events that encourage volunteers to promote their humanitarian activities. The volunteers are supposed to help people who are suffering from any kind of problem.

Cameroon media said he was acquitted of some other charges as rebellion, civil war, destruction of property, killing and non-possession of an ID. Another accused was however acquitted and discharged.

Even though his lawyers have said they will appeal the ruling, the outspoken Mancho delivered a message to the trial judge during his last appearance stressing that the court had taken the line of fuelling the Anglophone crisis.

“You have an opportunity to begin solving the Anglophone crisis or add more fuel to the fire. History will be the final judge,” he is quoted to have said. The terrorism charge largely stems from their actions supposedly “threatening Cameroon’s sovereignty.”

He first appeared in a coffin at a protest in Bamenda (capital of the Northwest region) in November 2016. His action it is said was to convey the message that minority English-speaking Cameroonians “seemed to have died before their real death” and therefore they had nothing to fear but to speak against the injustices.

interview

As the separatist crisis in Cameroon's English-speaking regions escalates, DW talks to a journalist in Buea who is trying to report on it despite bad encounters with both sides.

A series of protests over the use of French, the perceived exclusion of English-speaking Cameroonians from the economy and politics provoked a sustained government crackdown and spawned an armed separatist struggle.

One journalist based in the Southwest capital of Buea told DW how the situation affects his work and personal safety. He asked that his identity be withheld out of fear of repercussions.

DW: There is a heavy security presence on the streets here and the region at large is in crisis. How do you go about your work under these conditions?

Sincerely, I cannot work because the government of Cameroon has put in some very strong repressive measures to make sure journalists don't report stories the way they have to. I'll give you an example: journalists are restricted from going to the war-torn areas. Those who even attempt to go there are being arrested.

Even when we report stories in our newspapers, on radio or TV, we receive messages from the governor's office or from the office of the minister of information telling us we should tell them who gave us the information.

I reported on an attack on the convoy of government officials who visited war-torn areas and I was called to the governor's office to say when I was there and how i got the information. I didn't feel I was treated humanely.

What do you mean they didn't treat you humanely?

I told them I had no source. I was told to sit on the ground and my shoes were removed. They used all forms of interrogation to make me give the information. I refused. I was put in the bunker in the governor's office for 30 minutes but still did not give the information. They told me I was lying and I was given two slaps - hefty slaps.

As a journalist, have you also experienced pressure from the separatist side?

They've also been threatening journalists. I have received threats. When I talked about the fact that separatists are also committing atrocities – they are beheading people – I received death threats.

They want the story to be told supporting them. One of them who took the time to reach me on Facebook to explain why they are threatening me said they are not killing civilians. If they have to kill anybody, it would be government spies [he said].

We have many journalists who have decided to be quiet, especially in the war-torn areas. Journalists there don't even practice. If you report in such area you can easily be targeted and killed.

Yes, a lot of pressure is coming from the separatists. So far, the separatists have been very collaborative. They've been able to string in information through WhatsApp messages and all of that on what is happening on the ground, with images too.

On one occasion you were stopped at a checkpoint by militant separatists. Can you recall what happened that day?

The Ambazonian Defence Force (ADF) intercepted our bus and told everybody to come down and present identification to show that you are Anglophone. They asked us to support them in any way we can. Some people gave them food, others gave them money and the like.

So that is how we saw our way out of it, and they allowed us to go. It was at first a very terrorizing situation because you saw some 90 hefty men, but you also saw some four very young people, as young as 15 in the ADF. The 15-year-old was the one terrorising two Francophones.

Did he carry a gun too?

Yes, he had an AK47. One of them said: ""My home village has been entirely burned down. I don't have anywhere to live, I would rather be killed."" They had guns, some of them had machetes.

What happened to the French-speaking passengers?

I cannot tell because our bus had to leave with them still with the ADF. But we later heard from social media that the two men were only beaten, maltreated and sent back by bus. So they were not killed.

Civil servants are being threatened in the region. Are they able to go about their lives here?

They are very traumatized. Even as they have left the war torn areas and they are in a safer area, they are still traumatized because they get these anonymous calls and text messages. The normal trend is, the Ambazonians are advocating for no schools. They think having no schools at the moment will help tell the world their real story. Teachers who have summoned the courage to work are being threatened.

On April 25, a teacher was shot in Kumba and April 27 another was shot in Muyuka. Unfortunately, because of the crisis and because they are defying the instruction of the Ambazonians, they are being targeted and killed.

How about other civil servants? Are they also targeted?

Those working in war-torn areas have been told to leave the government and join the Ambazonian side. If you join the Ambazonians, you'll be able to work freely and you will not take command from the government side and you won't be targeted. So many of these civil servants have decided to be toeing the line of the government and they are being targeted.

Although we have not confirmed cases of civil servants who have been killed, we know of many who have been brutalized, including one administrator who was shot in the head twice.

So many civil servants are now in Buea because they feel it is safer since the military is in high number there.

Is it safe in Buea?

People are arrested almost on a daily basis. The prison in Buea was meant for a little more than 1,500 people, but at the moment it holds more than 5,000 prisoners, many linked to the Ambazonian struggle. They are facing inhumane conditions.

Are they tried in court?

At the moment Buea doesn't try those linked to the Ambazonian crisis. Before March some trials took place, but information came from Yaounde that all trials should stop and the prominent prisoners be sent there.

13,cameroon,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – One of the world’s leading conflict-resolution organizations says the Catholic Church is the only institution that can mediate the “Anglophone crisis” in Cameroon.

In a new report, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group says other than the Catholic clergy, “there are few prospective peacemakers.”

“If no one fills that role, the separatist sentiment already voiced by many Anglophones will continue to grow, fueling further violence and exacerbating the ongoing insurgency in the Anglophone regions, with elections in late 2018 a flashpoint,” the rights group says in a report.

Since 2016, English speakers in the Central African country have been protesting against what they say is gross marginalization by the Francophone-dominated administration. They have also been complaining about the use of French in Common Law courts and Anglophone schools.

RELATED: Cameroon bishops urge president to resolve Anglophone crisis with dialogue

The two English-speaking regions – in the northwest and southwest of the country – constitute 20 percent of Cameroon’s over 24 million people. The Catholic Church is the largest religious group in the country, representing about 40 percent of all Cameroonians.

The government has been accused of razing entire villages and extrajudicial killings in their hunt against separatists, who are calling on the English-speaking areas to form a new country, called ‘Ambazonia.’

Separatists have also been accused of atrocities, and have attacked Cameroonian security forces, and kidnapped opponents for ransom.

On April 30, separatists kidnapped Father William Neba, the principal of a Catholic college, in the middle of Mass, although he was released later.

The International Crisis Group estimates at least 100 civilians and 43 soldiers have been killed in the conflict in the last seven months, with the number of militants killed remaining unknown.

In addition, some 34,000 refugees are “sheltering in precarious conditions in Nigeria and about 40,000 persons are displaced in the Southwest Anglophone region.”

RELATED: Influx of Cameroon refugees into Nigeria worries Catholic Church

Opposition parties, the United Nations, and the nation’s Catholic bishops have called on the government and separatists to dialogue, but the Francophone-dominated government has long rejected the historical grievances of Anglophone Cameroonians, and the separatists say any talks should be overseen by an independent external body.

In the face of the escalating violence, the International Crisis Group says the Catholic Church remains the only institution with the moral authority to broker a peace deal.

Noting that “the Catholic Church could help break this dangerous stalemate,” the organization said the Catholic Church remains to be the only institution present in all ten regions of the country and claims a plurality of the population as adherents.

“Cameroonians take its views seriously,” the report says.

The Church must repair its own divisions first

Although the bishops have been united in calling for dialogue to end the crisis, there is a contrast to how the Anglophone bishops and Francophone bishops view the origins of the situation.

Anglophone bishops have described the killings as “a growing genocide” and published a long and detailed statement Oct. 4, 2017, in which they decried a “warlike atmosphere” of killings, looting and arson carried out by “young people” and acts of “brutality, torture, inhuman and unjustified treatment meted out” by the “forces of law and order.”

However, the Francophone bishops have been more measured in their statements and avoided terms such as “genocide.”

RELATED: English-speaking and French-speaking bishops divided over Cameroon crisis

Archbishop Samuel Kleda of Douala, Cameroon’s largest city, is the president of the bishops’ conference, and avoided inflammatory language when he recently called for peace.

“In the name of our common citizenship, brotherhood and humanity, the defense of legitimate interests must go hand in hand with social harmony, which is what is being sought … Violence, regardless of its source, does not build, it destroys,” he said.

The archbishop pointed out that all regions of Cameroon face problems which, he said, can be resolved through dialogue, arguing that decentralization would resolve many regional problems in Cameroon, including the Anglophone problem.

His statement was criticized by many clergymen in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, who insist the Anglophone problem is unique.

Father Gerald Jumbam said that by including the ‘Anglophone Problem’ with all other problems in the country, Kleda was ignoring a key historical fact: That English and French-speaking Cameroons were two countries that had decided to come together and that they had done so under agreed terms which have been jettisoned to the disadvantage of Anglophones.

RELATED: Catholic bishops, government clash over “genocide” claims in Cameroon

In a lengthy response to Kleda, Jumbam wrote that by virtue of their history, Anglophone Cameroonians “cannot be loyal subjects to the despicable and tyrannous Yaoundé government. Archbishop, you speak of decentralization and you offer us it as the best gift you think fitting for the resolution of this crisis? We are determined to decline a gift so laden with spurious promises and deceitful propensities.”

Jumbam was referring to the nation’s colonial history, which involves 3 different European countries.

Initially administered as a German Protectorate in 1884, Cameroon would later be shared with France and Britain as League of Nations Mandates after Germany was defeated in the First World War.

The end of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations saw the two parts of Cameroon transition from mandated territories to UN Trust Territories.

In 1960, the northern part of Cameroon administered by France gained its independence. The southern part administered by Britain as part of Nigeria was in 1961 subject to a plebiscite in which they were offered independence by reuniting with their francophone Cameroonian “brothers” or by remaining part of Nigeria.

The results showed an overwhelming desire by English-speaking Cameroonians to reunite with the French-speaking part of Cameroon.

The “marriage” was guaranteed by a Federal Constitution that was ostensibly meant to preserve and protect the minority Anglophones and their colonial heritage. But in 1972 then-President Ahmadou Ahidjo organized a referendum that dissolved the federation in favor of a united republic, thereby removing the protections Anglophones enjoyed.

Church leaders in Anglophone Cameroon have accused Kleda of failing to acknowledge that the ‘Anglophone Problem’ exists.

They also complained that he didn’t condemn the arrests and detention of Anglophone leaders and the “grotesque campaign of human savagery and barbarism perpetrated on the people of Southern Cameroons by the government,” and by lumping the issue with other problems in the country, the archbishop was following the government line.

Despite these tensions within the episcopate, the International Crisis Group still thinks the bishops are the best hope for peace in the country.

“It is not too late for the Church to bridge these divides. Anglophone and Francophone bishops should come together in a public statement to affirm their neutrality on the issue most contentious in the crisis – that of federalism versus decentralization – and state their willingness to mediate,” the organization said.

The Group said that if the clergy are able “to project neutrality and win trust on both sides,” it “might play a behind-the-scenes role to allow for indirect communication” between the separatists and the government.

It said such a unity of purpose could be useful in pushing for the release of Anglophone leaders now locked up in Cameroonian prisons, and for amnesty to be granted to those who have fled the country.

• As of 28 February 2018, less than $100,000 has been received, leaving a funding gap of $23.3 million – a serious impact on the capacity to respond to humanitarian needs, particularly with a new crisis emerging in the Anglophone regions

• A high-level mission comprised of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the representatives of UNICEF and UNHCR took place in Bamenda and Mamfe in the North West and South West regions. The mission confirmed the growing concerns over the security situation and the plight of people affected by this crisis.

• Since November 2017, over 12,000 people have reportedly returned to Amchide and Limani, the villages that suffered the brutal attacks by the armed groups affiliated with Boko Haram. Priority needs identified by an exploratory mission are health, education and food.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

A joint high-level mission was conducted from 7-9 February to Bamenda and Mamfe in the North West and South West regions, comprising the Humanitarian Coordinator and the representatives of UNICEF and UNHCR, alongside the Director of Civil Protection of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation (MINATD). The mission met with regional, administrative, traditional and religious leaders, as well as NGOs. The mission materialised in light of reports of increased violence and displacements in the region.

The North West and South West regions have historically been underprivileged, compared to the Francophone regions in Cameroon, generating grievances among the Anglophone population. Since October 2016, these frustrations morphed into political demands, leading to protests and strikes. Since the beginning of the crisis, at least 150 people have been killed during the demonstrations and clashes between the armed secessionist groups and military/security forces of Cameroon, including 64 civilians, according to local and international media. Following the declaration of independence of the putative state of Ambazonia by the secessionist movement on 1 October 2017, the situation has further deteriorated and the situation continues to be tense, with four government officials already kidnapped since January 2018. One major impact of this crisis has been the deprivation of access to education for children, with the majority of schools reportedly closed for most of the school year 2016/2017, and many continuing to be closed for the school year 2017/2018. Even with some schools reopening, many parents have decided not to send their children to schools, due to threats by the secessionist elements. According to local authorities, at least 32,000 children have been out of school since November 2017.

Based on the information received during the February high-level mission, as well as a needs assessment conducted by UNICEF in November 2017, UNICEF is developing a strategy to respond to the needs ofthe children affected by the crisis, focusing on providing a protective environment, including to those displaced, where children could engage in educational and recreational activities. Potential partners have been identified and discussions on the collaboration have already been initiated.

The crisis in Far North region continues to affect children and vulnerable populations. A field mission was conducted by UNICEF on 7 February in the Zamai site, Mayo Tsanaga department, to follow up on the response activities for 361 returnees from Nigeria (235 of whom are children) who fled captivity from Boko Haram. Upon arrival, the mission learnt that the Zamai site has received 236 new arrival IDPs since mid-January, who were displaced from Moskota, Zheleved, Nyechewe, and Tchebe-Tchebe villages near the border with Nigeria, which has increased the burden on the host community, despite the ongoing response by UNICEF and other humanitarian partners. Of the 179 children for whom UNICEF partner ALDEPA collected the transfer notes, only 79 children (58 boys and 21 girls) were enrolled in school at the time of the visit. The school located next to the site is currently overcrowded, with 948 students enrolled in a school with the capacity for 360. UNICEF continues to support the multisectoral response for these returnees and explores the ways to fill in the gaps identified.

A joint country office-Maroua sub-office mission has been organised on 8 February 2018 to visit Amchide and Limani. Amchide and Limani are the towns near the Nigerian border that suffered attacks by the armed groups affiliated with Boko Haram between 2014-2017, and this was the first UNICEF mission to this area since the crisis started in 2014 as the area was inaccessible due to insecurity. The impact of the conflict was plainly visible with destroyed houses, deserted shops, hospitals and schools as well as walls with countless gunshot holes. The economic burden of paying rent in the displaced locations, coupled with improved security attributed to the presence of the Rapid Intervention Force, has motivated people to return to these areas since November 2017. According to the multi-sectoral assessment report by the Rapid Response Mechanism supported by international NGOs PUI and ACF conducted in January 2018, there are 8,000 and 4,857 returnees in Limani and Amchide respectively. Needs are significant in all the sectors; however, the priority needs reported by the people were health, education and food. A more detailed needs assessment is planned by UNICEF in April 2018 to better refine its intervention strategy.

In East region, UNICEF participated in the multi-sectoral participatory assessment, Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) assessment, conducted by UNHCR in the villages hosting Central African Republic (CAR) refugees in Batouri, Meiganga, Touboro, Bertoua and Betare Oya communes. Livelihood and empowerment gaps, access to education, health care, and water and sanitation services have been identified as priority needs.

According to local sources, the sexual exploitation of adolescent girls and child labor persist inGaroua Boulai, Betare Oya, Kette and Ngaoui communes, with additional mine sites opening. UNICEF plans to conduct a detailed needs assessment in April and May 2018.

The CAR crisis faces a significant funding gap as the needs transition from humanitarian to longer-term issues of structural development. With humanitarian funding withdrawing, there are no resources available to respond to the needs of new asylum seekers, while continuing to support over 232,000 CAR refugees who remain in Cameroon. In February, UNHCR pre-registered 517 new arrivals who had fled villages in the northwest of the CAR.","UNICEF Cameroon Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/unicef-cameroon-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018
