On behalf of the Honourable Marie- Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs has announced the donation of 27 million dollars (estimated at FCFA 11.3 billion) as funding to humanitarian assistance to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. This was the subject of discussion ,besides examining bilateral ties between both countries, in an audience granted the Canadian envoy and his delegation on April 10, 2018 by the Minister Delegate at the Ministry of External Relations in charge of Cooperation with the Islamic World, Adoum Gargoum. Accompanied by the Canadian High Commissioner to Cameroon, Nathalie O'Neil, amongst others, Matt DeCourcey said bilateral relations between Cameroon and Canada are evolving on a very good note given their bilingualism character. Highlighting on the reason for the aid, he said Cameroon is host to several refugees from neigbouring countries and therefore in need of humanitarian assistance. ""In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics.

In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and the Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host countries,"" he stated. Information from a factsheet handed to journalists indicates that Canada's contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, clean water, health care, protection services including psychological and livelihoods support. ""Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters.

Raking in money during the crisis

Most Buea locals have similar stories to tell. Ever since the conflict in Cameroon's English-speaking areas escalated, security forces are omnipresent. Truckloads of heavily armed soldiers patrol the city at night. It's a militarized state, says a local journalist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. Residents suspected of being members of the so-called Ambazonia Defense Forces who are fighting for independence from Yaounde are arrested all the time, he says, adding that he has visited people held at the police station, where the conditions are a disaster. Those detained could not expect an actual trial, and bribes to get them released are common, the reporter told DW. ""A lot of money is being made from this crisis.""

The country's colonial past is still today behind the tensions.

We must speak as equals, urges Buea bishop Emmanuel Busho

Cameroon gained independence in the 1960s, when the former French-speaking mandated territory was joined with the English-language regions. The country has two official languages, two education systems, two legal systems. However, the minority in the Anglophone southwest has felt disadvantaged and marginalized for years. In 2016, lawyers in the English-speaking region took to the streets, followed by a teacher strike and more protests. The government ignored their demands and instead reacted with a security crackdown. Several protesters were killed, the Internet was switched off for three months while strikes paralyzed schools, and businesses closed one day a week for special ""ghost town days.""

President declares war on separatists

Paul Biya, Cameroon's President who's been in power for more than 35 years, instituted a Commission for Bilingualism and Multiculturalism, but many English-language speakers argue that is not enough. Demonstrations flared again in late 2017, and security forces killed at least 40 people. The protest became radicalized, various separatist groups formed, killing security and state officials they believed to be police informers. The president has since declared war on the separatists.

Now the battles lines are drawn. More than 100 civilians and 40 security officers have died. The International Crisis Group (ICG) has urged the Catholic Church to mediate in the conflict. The church represents one out of three Cameroonians, it is a powerful force.

""I agree, but it will be very difficult under the present circumstances,"" Buea bishop Emmanuel Busho told DW, adding that the top authority in the country isn't prepared to enter into a dialogue. ""They are trying to dictate the conditions for a dialogue but we believe we need to speak as equals - if you pose conditions, there can be no dialogue.""

Peaceful protests were ignored, now violence is the only option, this separatist says

Church is divided

The government has refused to speak to the radical groups. DW asked for but was not granted an interview with a government representative. In 2016, the Catholic bishops wrote the president a letter detailing the Anglophone Cameroonians' worries but the government accused the bishops of fueling the conflict. Moreover, even the Francophone and the Anglophone bishops don't see eye to eye. ""We trust the Catholic Church in the Anglophone areas, but not the bishops in the French-speaking areas,"" an activist who supports the separatists told DW. The Francophone bishops are regarded loyal to the government he added: ""Before the crisis, both chose sides.""

Whether or not the church can act as mediator will depend on whether the bishops can agree. If they can't, the conflict threatens to escalate further. Separatists have told DW they would do everything in their power to prevent presidential elections scheduled for October — hoping to force the government to the negotiating table.",Can the Catholic Church mediate in Cameroon's Anglophone crisis?,http://www.dw.com/en/can-the-catholic-church-mediate-in-cameroons-anglophone-crisis/a-43687381
2,cameroon,"They have “numerous humanitarian needs”, said Allegra Maria Del Pilar Baiocchi, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Cameroon. “Beyond the violence, (the crisis) has an impact on health, on employment,” she told AFP.

Separatist ambitions have long simmered in two minority anglophone regions in the west of the country, where people complain of being marginalised by the French-speaking elite.

The push for separation was galvanised by a heavy deployment of government troops last August, spurring a low-intensity conflict with sporadic attacks on symbols of the state.

“As with any armed conflict, civilians suffer the consequences of the violence, insecurity and fear,” said Alberto Jodra Marcos, who heads the Swiss branch of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Cameroon.

According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people are internally displaced in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, a one-time German colony that was divided between France and Britain after World War I.

In the worst-hit areas of Mamfe and Kumba in the southwest, some 40,000 people are estimated to have fled their homes.

But some fear the numbers affected could be much greater, with one humanitarian worker saying it was impossible to quantify the displacement given the limited access. The government has imposed curfews on civilians in both regions, and aid groups are rarely allowed in.

– ‘War situation’ –

“It’s difficult for organisations like ours to carry out missions on the ground,” said Agbor Bala Nkongho, director of the NGO Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa. “We are in a war situation. We can’t send people everywhere.”

As well as those who are internally displaced, many Cameroonians have fled the violence to neighbouring Nigeria. SEMA, a Nigerian relief agency, said some 34,000 have taken refuge in Nigeria’s Cross River State.

The state has said it will set up and fund a refugee camp with UN backing, but for now local communities are sheltering the majority of the Cameroonian refugees, according to SEMA chief John Inaku.

“The situation is very difficult for us,” said Peter Kechi, the village chief of Bashu, which is some five kilometres (three miles) from the border and whose population has ballooned from 1,500 to 4,000 in a few months.

“We are taking refugees into our homes and our bedrooms, with sometimes 20 people sleeping in the same room,” Kechi said.

Locals say the refugees cross the border on foot through heavily forested mountainous areas, making it difficult to record their arrival.

The UN has registered 20,485 Cameroonians in Nigeria, according to Baiocchi, who added that “the arrivals are continuing”.

Following a fact-finding mission in Cameroon’s anglophone regions, “we know more or less where the needs are… the next step is how to respond to them,” she said, reached by telephone from the Gabonese capital Libreville.

Jodra Marcos of MSF said its workers had carried out training on how to care for the “wounded and traumatised” and donated medicines and equipment in anglophone areas.

However, “many communities (are) in a precarious situation” after staff have fled and some clinics have closed, he noted.

Separatists have been blamed for the torching of schools in the areas, while aid groups and residents also regularly accuse the army of carrying out abuses against civilians.

Early this month a human rights activist charged that soldiers killed several civilians by setting fire to their homes.

A security source, for his part, accused “some aid groups” of spreading disinformation.

YAOUNDE, Cameroon, April 10, 2018/APO Group/ –On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

Quick facts

In 2018, 3.3 million people will need life-saving assistance in Cameroon to meet their basic needs. This represents an increase of approximately 14% since 2017.

The funding announced today is in addition to the nearly $20 million in humanitarian assistance already announced in 2018. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s total contribution this year for Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria to over $47 million.

In February 2018, Minister Bibeau visited Maiduguri and Bama, in northeast Nigeria, where she met with members of communities affected by the Lake Chad Basin crisis, including survivors of gender-based violence, children and new mothers, as well as representatives of key humanitarian organizations.

6,cameroon,"A social worker in the South West Region has raised an alarm of an impending humanitarian crisis that may hit the Region, if nothing is done to rescue some 30,000 villagers drawn from three cocoa producing villages in Fako Division of the South West Region of Cameroon from the wild.

The social worker, who spoke to Journalducameroun.com on condition of anonymity on Thursday, May 5, 2018, said if Government does not step in to rescue the people of Munyenge, Ikata and Bafia, who have been wondering in cocoa farms and the wild, following clashes between the military and the separatist forces, then she should be prepared to face the worst humanitarian crisis in the history of Cameroon.

According to her, most of those who are fleeing from the clashes between the security and restorationist forces are mostly pregnant women, children and the elderly.

The social worker further revealed that the situation is further compounded by the fact that all medical facilities in the three villages have been shutdown, as the medics themselves are running away into safety.

“Both the military and civilians alike are dying because medical facilities both private and public within these affected villages have been shut down. Healthcare givers in these health institutions forcefully discharged their patients and ordered them to leave their respective hospitals as they struggled to safe their own lives first.”

She said even churches are not spared as security forces are ransacking everywhere to fish out any suspected element of the Ambazonia Defence Forces.

“As the military went in search of the separatist forces, houses were razed to ashes, including Palaces of Chiefs and ancestral. This is what is going to trigger a humanitarian crisis in the South West Region because the entire Region is being reduced to ashes and the Government, Ministers, Senators, Parliamentarians are not saying anything. It stated in Kembong and then proceeded to Kwa-Kwa and Ndian. Kupe-Muanenguba recently experienced the inferno and now Munyenge in Fako, where do the Government through the military want this people to go? There is need for for an urgent solution to this crisis and burning down villages is not helping the situation,” the social worker stated.

It would be recalled that Munyenge, Bafia and Ikata have been volatile battle grounds in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis between Ambazonia Defence Forces and Government security operatives.

But matters degenerated again on Saturday, April 28, 2018, when the military launched an onslaught in the three villages, forcing thousands in this cocoa producing basin to escape into their cocoa farms.

These locals have reportedly been spending their nights around cocoa ovens for the fear of rains, while others have migrated to neighbouring Muyuka, Ekona, Ediki, Kumba, Malende, Buea among other towns as the wait on Government to solve this problem once and for all.","Humanitarian crisis feared in SW, as Munyenge, Bafia locals wonder in forest",https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/humanitarian-crisis-feared-sw-munyenge-bafia-locals-wonder-forest/
7,cameroon,"Cameroon security forces have been cited as engaging in significant human rights abuse in respect of armed combat they are engaged in across three regions of the country, a United States government report has said.

The Central African nation is beset by Boko Haram insurgency in its Far North region whiles the Anglophone crisis continues to pose a security challenge to the government in the Northwest and Southwest i.e. Anglophone regions.

According to the U.S. Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2017, the military, police and gendarmerie – paramilitary – forces were using among others arbitrary killings, forced disappearances and prolonged military / unofficial detentions in the three regions.

In its Executive Summary relating to the country, the report said: “The most significant human rights issues included: arbitrary and unlawful killings through excessive use of force by security forces; disappearances by security forces and Boko Haram.”

It went on to mention: “torture and abuse by security forces including in military and unofficial detention facilities; prolonged arbitrary detentions including of suspected Boko Haram supporters and individuals in the Anglophone regions.”

Then there was the issue of “harsh and life threatening prison conditions; violations of freedoms of expression and assembly; periodic government restrictions on access to the internet; trafficking in persons; criminalization and arrest of individuals engaged in consensual same-sex sexual conduct; and violations of workers’ rights.”

The government has deployed a military unit the BIR, which continues to engage with Boko Haram insurgents in the Far North region. Communities in the region have been attacked mostly by suicide bombers and raids by the group.

Over in the Anglophone region, guerilla style attacks on security forces by suspected separatists under the so-called Ambazonia republic banner has led to the formation of a new military unit headquartered in the capital of the northwest region, Bamenda.

There has been a sustained call for dialogue to solve the crisis even though the government has insisted that it will only engage with persons with the unity of the nation at heart.

Separatists have killed over 20 security forces, locals have fled their homes for fear of being caught in the cross fire with thousands now seeking asylum in neighbouring Nigeria.","Cameroon forces in gross abuse over Anglophone, Boko Haram crisis – U.S. report",http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/22/cameroon-forces-in-gross-abuse-over-anglophone-boko-haram-crisis-us-report/

• As of 28 February 2018, less than $100,000 has been received, leaving a funding gap of $23.3 million – a serious impact on the capacity to respond to humanitarian needs, particularly with a new crisis emerging in the Anglophone regions

• A high-level mission comprised of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the representatives of UNICEF and UNHCR took place in Bamenda and Mamfe in the North West and South West regions. The mission confirmed the growing concerns over the security situation and the plight of people affected by this crisis.

• Since November 2017, over 12,000 people have reportedly returned to Amchide and Limani, the villages that suffered the brutal attacks by the armed groups affiliated with Boko Haram. Priority needs identified by an exploratory mission are health, education and food.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

A joint high-level mission was conducted from 7-9 February to Bamenda and Mamfe in the North West and South West regions, comprising the Humanitarian Coordinator and the representatives of UNICEF and UNHCR, alongside the Director of Civil Protection of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation (MINATD). The mission met with regional, administrative, traditional and religious leaders, as well as NGOs. The mission materialised in light of reports of increased violence and displacements in the region.

The North West and South West regions have historically been underprivileged, compared to the Francophone regions in Cameroon, generating grievances among the Anglophone population. Since October 2016, these frustrations morphed into political demands, leading to protests and strikes. Since the beginning of the crisis, at least 150 people have been killed during the demonstrations and clashes between the armed secessionist groups and military/security forces of Cameroon, including 64 civilians, according to local and international media. Following the declaration of independence of the putative state of Ambazonia by the secessionist movement on 1 October 2017, the situation has further deteriorated and the situation continues to be tense, with four government officials already kidnapped since January 2018. One major impact of this crisis has been the deprivation of access to education for children, with the majority of schools reportedly closed for most of the school year 2016/2017, and many continuing to be closed for the school year 2017/2018. Even with some schools reopening, many parents have decided not to send their children to schools, due to threats by the secessionist elements. According to local authorities, at least 32,000 children have been out of school since November 2017.

Based on the information received during the February high-level mission, as well as a needs assessment conducted by UNICEF in November 2017, UNICEF is developing a strategy to respond to the needs ofthe children affected by the crisis, focusing on providing a protective environment, including to those displaced, where children could engage in educational and recreational activities. Potential partners have been identified and discussions on the collaboration have already been initiated.

The crisis in Far North region continues to affect children and vulnerable populations. A field mission was conducted by UNICEF on 7 February in the Zamai site, Mayo Tsanaga department, to follow up on the response activities for 361 returnees from Nigeria (235 of whom are children) who fled captivity from Boko Haram. Upon arrival, the mission learnt that the Zamai site has received 236 new arrival IDPs since mid-January, who were displaced from Moskota, Zheleved, Nyechewe, and Tchebe-Tchebe villages near the border with Nigeria, which has increased the burden on the host community, despite the ongoing response by UNICEF and other humanitarian partners. Of the 179 children for whom UNICEF partner ALDEPA collected the transfer notes, only 79 children (58 boys and 21 girls) were enrolled in school at the time of the visit. The school located next to the site is currently overcrowded, with 948 students enrolled in a school with the capacity for 360. UNICEF continues to support the multisectoral response for these returnees and explores the ways to fill in the gaps identified.

A joint country office-Maroua sub-office mission has been organised on 8 February 2018 to visit Amchide and Limani. Amchide and Limani are the towns near the Nigerian border that suffered attacks by the armed groups affiliated with Boko Haram between 2014-2017, and this was the first UNICEF mission to this area since the crisis started in 2014 as the area was inaccessible due to insecurity. The impact of the conflict was plainly visible with destroyed houses, deserted shops, hospitals and schools as well as walls with countless gunshot holes. The economic burden of paying rent in the displaced locations, coupled with improved security attributed to the presence of the Rapid Intervention Force, has motivated people to return to these areas since November 2017. According to the multi-sectoral assessment report by the Rapid Response Mechanism supported by international NGOs PUI and ACF conducted in January 2018, there are 8,000 and 4,857 returnees in Limani and Amchide respectively. Needs are significant in all the sectors; however, the priority needs reported by the people were health, education and food. A more detailed needs assessment is planned by UNICEF in April 2018 to better refine its intervention strategy.

In East region, UNICEF participated in the multi-sectoral participatory assessment, Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) assessment, conducted by UNHCR in the villages hosting Central African Republic (CAR) refugees in Batouri, Meiganga, Touboro, Bertoua and Betare Oya communes. Livelihood and empowerment gaps, access to education, health care, and water and sanitation services have been identified as priority needs.

According to local sources, the sexual exploitation of adolescent girls and child labor persist inGaroua Boulai, Betare Oya, Kette and Ngaoui communes, with additional mine sites opening. UNICEF plans to conduct a detailed needs assessment in April and May 2018.

The CAR crisis faces a significant funding gap as the needs transition from humanitarian to longer-term issues of structural development. With humanitarian funding withdrawing, there are no resources available to respond to the needs of new asylum seekers, while continuing to support over 232,000 CAR refugees who remain in Cameroon. In February, UNHCR pre-registered 517 new arrivals who had fled villages in the northwest of the CAR.","UNICEF Cameroon Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/unicef-cameroon-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

“You have an opportunity to begin solving the Anglophone crisis or add more fuel to the fire. History will be the final judge,” he is quoted to have said. The terrorism charge largely stems from their actions supposedly “threatening Cameroon’s sovereignty.”

He first appeared in a coffin at a protest in Bamenda (capital of the Northwest region) in November 2016. His action it is said was to convey the message that minority English-speaking Cameroonians “seemed to have died before their real death” and therefore they had nothing to fear but to speak against the injustices.

The other accused persons include: Tsi Conrad, The Emile Agwe, Tangwa Maloin Tangwa, Azelecha Martin, Guingah Valentine, Junior Awahro Thomas. They were all ordered to pay 579m CFA francs ($1m; £770,000) in damages.

12,cameroon,"A series of protests over the use of French, the perceived exclusion of English-speaking Cameroonians from the economy and politics provoked a sustained government crackdown and spawned an armed separatist struggle.

One journalist based in the Southwest capital of Buea told DW how the situation affects his work and personal safety. He asked that his identity be withheld out of fear of repercussions.

DW: There is a heavy security presence on the streets here and the region at large is in crisis. How do you go about your work under these conditions?

Sincerely, I cannot work because the government of Cameroon has put in some very strong repressive measures to make sure journalists don't report stories the way they have to. I'll give you an example: journalists are restricted from going to the war-torn areas. Those who even attempt to go there are being arrested.

Even when we report stories in our newspapers, on radio or TV, we receive messages from the governor's office or from the office of the minister of information telling us we should tell them who gave us the information.

I reported on an attack on the convoy of government officials who visited war-torn areas and I was called to the governor's office to say when I was there and how i got the information. I didn't feel I was treated humanely.

What do you mean they didn't treat you humanely?

I told them I had no source. I was told to sit on the ground and my shoes were removed. They used all forms of interrogation to make me give the information. I refused. I was put in the bunker in the governor's office for 30 minutes but still did not give the information. They told me I was lying and I was given two slaps - hefty slaps.

As a journalist, have you also experienced pressure from the separatist side?

They've also been threatening journalists. I have received threats. When I talked aboutthe fact that separatists are also committing atrocities – they are beheading people – I received death threats.

They want the story to be told supporting them. One of them who took the time to reach me on Facebook to explain why they are threatening me said they are not killing civilians. If they have to kill anybody, it would be government spies [he said].

We have many journalists who have decided to be quiet, especially in the war-torn areas. Journalists there don't even practice. If you report in such area you can easily be targeted and killed.

Yes, a lot of pressure is coming from the separatists. So far, the separatists have been very collaborative. They've been able to string in information through WhatsApp messages and all of that on what is happening on the ground, with images too.

On one occasion you were stopped at a checkpoint by militant separatists. Can you recall what happened that day?

The Ambazonian Defence Force (ADF) intercepted our bus and told everybody to come down and present identification to show that you are Anglophone. They asked us to support them in any way we can. Some people gave them food, others gave them money and the like.

So that is how we saw our way out of it, and they allowed us to go. It was at first a very terrorizing situation because you saw some 90 hefty men, but you also saw some four very young people, as young as 15 in the ADF. The 15-year-old was the one terrorising two Francophones.

Did he carry a gun too?

Yes, he had an AK47. One of them said: ""My home village has been entirely burned down. I don't have anywhere to live, I would rather be killed."" They had guns, some of them had machetes.

What happened to the French-speaking passengers?

I cannot tell because our bus had to leave with them still with the ADF. But we later heard from social media that the two men were only beaten, maltreated and sent back by bus. So they were not killed.

Civil servants are being threatened in the region. Are they able to go about their lives here?

They are very traumatized. Even as they have left the war torn areas and they are in a safer area, they are still traumatized because they get these anonymous calls and text messages. The normal trend is, the Ambazonians are advocating for no schools. They think having no schools at the moment will help tell the world their real story. Teachers who have summoned the courage to work are being threatened.

On April 25, a teacher was shot in Kumba and April 27 another was shot in Muyuka. Unfortunately, because of the crisis and because they are defying the instruction of the Ambazonians, they are being targeted and killed.

How about other civil servants? Are they also targeted?

Those working in war-torn areas have been told to leave the government and join the Ambazonian side. If you join the Ambazonians, you'll be able to work freely and you will not take command from the government side and you won't be targeted. So many of these civil servants have decided to be toeing the line of the government and they are being targeted.

Although we have not confirmed cases of civil servants who have been killed, we know of many who have been brutalized, including one administrator who was shot in the head twice.

So many civil servants are now in Buea because they feel it is safer since the military is in high number there.

Cameroonians who oppose to the independence for Anglophone regions have also taken to the streets

Is it safe in Buea?

People are arrested almost on a daily basis. The prison in Buea was meant for a little more than 1,500 people, but at the moment it holds more than 5,000 prisoners, many linked to the Ambazonian struggle. They are facing inhumane conditions.

Are they tried in court?

At the moment Buea doesn't try those linked to the Ambazonian crisis. Before March some trials took place, but information came from Yaounde that all trials should stop and the prominent prisoners be sent there.

13,cameroon,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – One of the world’s leading conflict-resolution organizations says the Catholic Church is the only institution that can mediate the “Anglophone crisis” in Cameroon.

In a new report, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group says other than the Catholic clergy, “there are few prospective peacemakers.”

“If no one fills that role, the separatist sentiment already voiced by many Anglophones will continue to grow, fueling further violence and exacerbating the ongoing insurgency in the Anglophone regions, with elections in late 2018 a flashpoint,” the rights group says in a report.

Since 2016, English speakers in the Central African country have been protesting against what they say is gross marginalization by the Francophone-dominated administration. They have also been complaining about the use of French in Common Law courts and Anglophone schools.

RELATED: Cameroon bishops urge president to resolve Anglophone crisis with dialogue

The two English-speaking regions – in the northwest and southwest of the country – constitute 20 percent of Cameroon’s over 24 million people. The Catholic Church is the largest religious group in the country, representing about 40 percent of all Cameroonians.

The government has been accused of razing entire villages and extrajudicial killings in their hunt against separatists, who are calling on the English-speaking areas to form a new country, called ‘Ambazonia.’

Separatists have also been accused of atrocities, and have attacked Cameroonian security forces, and kidnapped opponents for ransom.

On April 30, separatists kidnapped Father William Neba, the principal of a Catholic college, in the middle of Mass, although he was released later.

The International Crisis Group estimates at least 100 civilians and 43 soldiers have been killed in the conflict in the last seven months, with the number of militants killed remaining unknown.

In addition, some 34,000 refugees are “sheltering in precarious conditions in Nigeria and about 40,000 persons are displaced in the Southwest Anglophone region.”

RELATED: Influx of Cameroon refugees into Nigeria worries Catholic Church

Opposition parties, the United Nations, and the nation’s Catholic bishops have called on the government and separatists to dialogue, but the Francophone-dominated government has long rejected the historical grievances of Anglophone Cameroonians, and the separatists say any talks should be overseen by an independent external body.

In the face of the escalating violence, the International Crisis Group says the Catholic Church remains the only institution with the moral authority to broker a peace deal.

Noting that “the Catholic Church could help break this dangerous stalemate,” the organization said the Catholic Church remains to be the only institution present in all ten regions of the country and claims a plurality of the population as adherents.

“Cameroonians take its views seriously,” the report says.

The Church must repair its own divisions first

Although the bishops have been united in calling for dialogue to end the crisis, there is a contrast to how the Anglophone bishops and Francophone bishops view the origins of the situation.

Anglophone bishops have described the killings as “a growing genocide” and published a long and detailed statement Oct. 4, 2017, in which they decried a “warlike atmosphere” of killings, looting and arson carried out by “young people” and acts of “brutality, torture, inhuman and unjustified treatment meted out” by the “forces of law and order.”

However, the Francophone bishops have been more measured in their statements and avoided terms such as “genocide.”

RELATED: English-speaking and French-speaking bishops divided over Cameroon crisis

Archbishop Samuel Kleda of Douala, Cameroon’s largest city, is the president of the bishops’ conference, and avoided inflammatory language when he recently called for peace.

“In the name of our common citizenship, brotherhood and humanity, the defense of legitimate interests must go hand in hand with social harmony, which is what is being sought … Violence, regardless of its source, does not build, it destroys,” he said.

The archbishop pointed out that all regions of Cameroon face problems which, he said, can be resolved through dialogue, arguing that decentralization would resolve many regional problems in Cameroon, including the Anglophone problem.

His statement was criticized by many clergymen in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, who insist the Anglophone problem is unique.

Father Gerald Jumbam said that by including the ‘Anglophone Problem’ with all other problems in the country, Kleda was ignoring a key historical fact: That English and French-speaking Cameroons were two countries that had decided to come together and that they had done so under agreed terms which have been jettisoned to the disadvantage of Anglophones.

RELATED: Catholic bishops, government clash over “genocide” claims in Cameroon

In a lengthy response to Kleda, Jumbam wrote that by virtue of their history, Anglophone Cameroonians “cannot be loyal subjects to the despicable and tyrannous Yaoundé government. Archbishop, you speak of decentralization and you offer us it as the best gift you think fitting for the resolution of this crisis? We are determined to decline a gift so laden with spurious promises and deceitful propensities.”

Jumbam was referring to the nation’s colonial history, which involves 3 different European countries.

Initially administered as a German Protectorate in 1884, Cameroon would later be shared with France and Britain as League of Nations Mandates after Germany was defeated in the First World War.

The end of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations saw the two parts of Cameroon transition from mandated territories to UN Trust Territories.

In 1960, the northern part of Cameroon administered by France gained its independence. The southern part administered by Britain as part of Nigeria was in 1961 subject to a plebiscite in which they were offered independence by reuniting with their francophone Cameroonian “brothers” or by remaining part of Nigeria.

The results showed an overwhelming desire by English-speaking Cameroonians to reunite with the French-speaking part of Cameroon.

The “marriage” was guaranteed by a Federal Constitution that was ostensibly meant to preserve and protect the minority Anglophones and their colonial heritage. But in 1972 then-President Ahmadou Ahidjo organized a referendum that dissolved the federation in favor of a united republic, thereby removing the protections Anglophones enjoyed.

Church leaders in Anglophone Cameroon have accused Kleda of failing to acknowledge that the ‘Anglophone Problem’ exists.

They also complained that he didn’t condemn the arrests and detention of Anglophone leaders and the “grotesque campaign of human savagery and barbarism perpetrated on the people of Southern Cameroons by the government,” and by lumping the issue with other problems in the country, the archbishop was following the government line.

Despite these tensions within the episcopate, the International Crisis Group still thinks the bishops are the best hope for peace in the country.

“It is not too late for the Church to bridge these divides. Anglophone and Francophone bishops should come together in a public statement to affirm their neutrality on the issue most contentious in the crisis – that of federalism versus decentralization – and state their willingness to mediate,” the organization said.

The Group said that if the clergy are able “to project neutrality and win trust on both sides,” it “might play a behind-the-scenes role to allow for indirect communication” between the separatists and the government.

It said such a unity of purpose could be useful in pushing for the release of Anglophone leaders now locked up in Cameroonian prisons, and for amnesty to be granted to those who have fled the country.

Both measures, according to the International Crisis Group, are necessary prerequisites for talks.",Experts calls Church ‘only hope’ in Cameroon’s ‘Anglophone crisis’,https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/05/05/experts-calls-church-only-hope-in-cameroons-anglophone-crisis/
14,cameroon,"The Roman Catholic Church should mediate in the crisis in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, where separatists and security forces are embroiled in a dangerous conflict, a think-tank urged on Thursday.

""The Catholic Church could help break this dangerous stalemate,"" the International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report.

""Other than the Catholic clergy, there are few prospective peacemakers,"" it said. ""If no-one fills that role, the separatist sentiment already voiced by many Anglophones will continue to grow, fuelling further violence and exacerbating the on-going insurgency in the Anglophone regions, with elections in late 2018 a flashpoint.""

The crisis began in 2016, when activists in Cameroon's Anglophone minority stepped up a campaign for greater autonomy.

Their demands were rejected by President Paul Biya, prompting radicals to make a full-blown declaration of independence last October.

Since then, 31 members of the security forces have been killed by separatists, according to an AFP toll based on official figures. The number of armed separatists or civilians killed by police and troops is unknown.

At the same time, humanitarian needs in the Anglophone regions have grown. According to UN estimates, tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting.

The ICG said the church could help by stating ""its impartiality"" on the big question facing Anglophone regions – federalism versus decentralisation.

""A clergy able to project a position of neutrality could work with other trusted actors to mediate between Anglophone leaders and the state and stem a dangerous and growing crisis,"" it said.

The Church is one of Cameroon's strongest institutions, as it is present in all of the country's 10 regions and nearly a third of the population is Catholic, the report said.

It cautioned though that the Church also had to overcome its own divisions between French- and English-speaking clergy.

Cameroon's Northwest and Southwest Regions are home to most of the country's Anglophones – a minority of about 20% in the predominantly French-speaking country of 23.4 million.

Within the minority, a perception of injustice has grown that Anglophones suffer discrimination in the economy, education and the judicial system at the hands of the francophone majority.

The Anglophone presence is a legacy of the colonial period in Africa.

France and Britain divided up the former German colony under League of Nations mandates after World War I.

A year after the French-ruled territory became independent in 1961, the southern part of British Cameroons was integrated into a federal system.

Federalism was then scrapped 11 years later for a ""united republic"" – a centralised system that 85-year-old Biya, in power for more than 35 years, has said will not be changed.

The ICG warned last October that ""murderous repression"" by the authorities would only feed secessionism – a warning that the government lashed as an attempt to destabilise the country.

According to a journalists with Equinoxe TV, a renown priest had bee questioned for distributing foodstuff to people stranded by the ongoing crisis.

“I am reliably informed that church leaders have been banned from assisting displaced anglophones who fled military brutality and burnings of their houses. A renown man of God has equally received a query from the state for distributing foodstuff to the people in despair,” Mimi Mefo said in a tweet.

Efforts to reach a Cameroonian government official for a comment on the issue proved abortive as non was available to respond to our call.

Thousands of Cameroonians have routinely fled their homes into forests for fear of attack by the security forces. The army has repeatedly dismissed attacks on civilian populations stressing that its actions are within limits of its operation.

The United Nations refugee agency in neighbouring Nigeria has recorded over 20,000 refugees who fled the fighting back home. They are said to be living in dire straits as the UNHCR continues to seek funding to support them.

The Catholic Church has been a vocal civil society group all through the crisis in Cameroon’s Northwest and Southwest (Anglophone) regions. They have repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

The international Crisis Group has identified the church as the most potent political mediator between the government and separatist elements.

16,cameroon,"In Cameroon, Biya Remands Journalist Elvis McCarthy, Silence From UN Of Soft Censor Guterres

By Matthew Russell Lee UNITED NATIONS, May 7 – Amid the worsening crackdown by the army of 36-year Cameroon president Paul Biya in the country's Anglophone areas, a video circulated depicting soldiers burning down homes. Click here for one upload of it. Noted by many residents and activists: blue helmet of the type used by UN peacekeepers. On April 30 Inner City Press asked UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric about the video, the day after publishing a story about it, in Google News. Dujarric said he hadn't seen the video but militaries should not use UN equipment or colors, presumably when burning civilians homes down. April 30 Q&A video here; transcript below. That is a typical UN response under Guterres, particularly on Cameroon where Guterres took Paul Biya's golden statue last October. Biya is locking up journalists; for now what Guterres does is have ""his"" UN Security hinder the Press, including most recently on May 5 here, Inner City Press which has asked about Cameroon and the statue he took since it happened. Now a Biya military tribunal on April 10 ordered that Akumbom Elvis McCarthy , a news broadcaster for Abakwa FM Radio, a privately owned broadcaster based in the Bamenda region, be remanded in custody for a renewable six-month period while police investigate claims that the journalist aired ""secessionist propaganda."" So much for free speech and freedom of the press. The Cameroon Journalists’ Trade Union, SNJC in Cameroon has called on Biya to drop all charges against Anglophone journalists Mancho Bibixy and Thomas Awah Junior, both jailed at the Kondengui prison in Yaounde.

The SNJC made the call in Douala on World Press Freedom Day, when Guterres' UN was engaged in censorship, complete with a barely audible video message from traveling Guterres. The two are due back in court on May 8. Mancho Bibixy, a journalist and history teacher was arrested in Bamenda in January 2017 after leading a ""coffin revolution"" on the streets to protest against the state of roads. Dzenyagha Thomas Awah Junior was also arrested in Bamenda during the same period and transferred to Yaounde for allegedly being in possession of SCNC documents. Ah, freedom of the press, under direct attack in Cameroon and persistently hindered and undermined in the UN of Antonio Guterres and his Global Communicator Alison Smale. They've made their restrictions on Inner City Press pervasive, including requiring minders and blocking access, refusing to answer petitions: call it soft censorship. From the April 30 UN transcript: Inner City Press: a video emerged over the weekend from Cameroon showing or depicting soldiers burning people's homes in the Anglophone areas, and what… what a lot of people focused on is that one of them, at least, is wearing a blue helmet. I don't think it means the UN is doing it, but I do wonder, what are the rules? I wanted to ask you, what are the rules if people have served in UN peacekeeping missions… have you seen the video?



Spokesman: ""I haven't seen that particular video, so I can't comment on the particular helmet, whether it was just blue or a UN helmet. We have seen, in different parts of the world, various security forces and army… we've seen reports of them using equipment that they own, which had been painted white or blue and reused domestically. It is a responsibility to ensure that no equipment that has UN markings is ever used in any domestic operation. But, again, I'm not… that's a matter… that's an issue of principle. I haven't… I can't comment on that specific report."" Hours later, still nothing.

The lack of confidence in the UN in these areas, and on this issue, was inflamed as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in October 2017 stopped by Yaounde on his way from the Central African Republic (where the UN pays Biya's government for peacekeepers who have been charged with sexual abuse). Guterres did not meet with any opposition figures, and accepted a golden statue from Biya. Guterres' envoy Francois Lounceny Fall has publicly said that secessionist are extremists, the word used by Biya to justify the scorched earth strategy exemplified by the video. Inner City Press asked UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zaid why his Office hasn't updated the death figures and he claimed it was because the UN has no access.

Guterres' humanitarian Assistant Secretary General Ursula Mueller visited Cameroon, but not the Anglophone areas. (Inner City Press asked her why, here). Human Rights Watch didn't even include Cameroon in its 2018 “World Report,” and told Inner City Press this is because it does not view it as among the 90 most serious problems in the world.

Guterres' Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed as in Abuja in her native Nigeria when 47 Cameroonians were illegally sent back by the Buhari government. Buhari will be in Washington on April 30 and a protest of Ambazonians is planned. Earlier in April, Inner City Press asked the US State Department about the refoulement to Cameroon and received a day later a statement. But what will happen on this video, and on the underlying issues? Watch this site. ***
