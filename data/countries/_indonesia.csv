0,indonesia,"Indonesia’s new central bank governor knows a thing or two about crisis management. That’s about to come in handy.

Since joining Bank Indonesia in 1984, Perry Warjiyo has seen the fall of a dictator, the collapse of the financial sector -- more than once -- and the odd market tantrum. In October last year, he sensed a new calamity around the corner, warning that the tightening of U.S. monetary policy meant trouble ahead for Southeast Asia’s largest economy.

Fast forward five months and the rupiah has tanked against the dollar to be among the worst performing currencies in Asia, foreign investors are ditching Indonesian stocks and bonds, while the central bank was last month forced to tap $4 billion of foreign reserves to defend the currency.

“Given his understanding of the global economy and experience in handling financial crises, he is an asset to Indonesia,” said Fauzi Ichsan, chief executive officer of Indonesia’s Deposit Insurance Corp. He is a combination of the traditional Javanese man and an international technocrat.”

As the U.S. presses ahead with its interest-rate hike timetable, 59-year-old Warjiyo -- who has served as deputy governor since 2013 -- is seen as a safe pair of hands in volatile times. He’ll take the reins at Indonesia’s central bank in May as the economy struggles for traction even after eight rate cuts, and as a trade war further threatens its nascent recovery.

His candidature was endorsed by a panel of lawmakers on Wednesday and he will still need the approval of the parliament.

“Maintaining stability and pushing for growth are things that must not be contradicted, but must be synergized,” Warjiyo said at his confirmation hearing. “This is where I play my role and make Bank Indonesia to be pro-stability, but also pro-growth, so that we can develop the national economy and bring prosperity to the people.”

Warjiyo forecast growth of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent this year, compared with 5.1 percent expansion in 2017.

Policy MixMaster

While the economy is growing below the 7 percent target set by President Joko Widodo, inflation eased to a 14-month low in February. That’s given the central bank room to focus on guarding the currency, which has fallen 2.7 percent since the end of January. Bank Indonesia held its benchmark interest rate for a sixth straight month last week, with its attention firmly on the rupiah instead.

Former finance minister Rizal Ramli says Warjiyo will bring a wealth of experience to the role, needed at a time when the economy is facing significant headwinds.

“Indonesia is quite vulnerable to any major change in global markets,” he said in an interview on Monday. “With the U.S. and new Fed governor Jerome Powell determined to raise rates, that’s going to create further pressure for the rupiah.”

The village schools in Central Java where Warjiyo spent his formative years, amid rice paddy fields and under the shadow of an active volcano, are a far cry from the likes of Tokyo, Geneva and Washington where he would later further his education. Having earned his economics degree at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in 1982, Warjiyo was later awarded a PhD from Iowa State University in the U.S. in 1991.

Bank Adviser

He was already advising Indonesia’s central bank governor as the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, and as the ensuing carnage saw the downfall of the Suharto regime the following year after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Having witnessed the fallout, he sharpened his skills with a course on financial crises in emerging markets at the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1999.

Warjiyo later took up a post as an executive director with the International Monetary Fund in Washington between 2007 and 2009, just as the global financial crisis moved like a wrecking ball through economies around the world. He returned to Bank Indonesia in 2009 and was appointed for a five-year term as deputy governor in 2013.

The president, known as Jokowi, will be looking to Warjiyo to help steer the economy through the current turbulence. And with the 2019 presidential election campaign due to kick off in September, he’ll also be hoping Warjiyo can help fire up economic growth.

Warjiyo, who went to the same university as Jokowi, will likely have the president’s ear, according to Ramli.

“He is a nice guy and easy to get along with,"" he said of Warjiyo. “He will try to find a compromise, a consensus.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/forged-in-crisis-newest-asian-central-bank-chief-comes-prepared

While Indonesia might be able to step forward with its proposal for a peace roadmap in Afghanistan, some structural problems could constrain its attempts to get involved, writes Ahmad Rizky M. Umar.

Indonesia is set to host talks among Indonesian and Afghan Islamic clerics in Bogor, south of Jakarta, at the end of March. This dialogue, part of Indonesia’s bid to mediate the peace process in the long-standing Afghan conflict, will involve the Indonesian Ulema Council and Afghanistan’s Islamic clerics.

Representatives of the Taliban were expected to attend, only to later reject the invitation to participate.

The talks follow Indonesian President Joko (Jokowi) Widodo’s visit to Kabul earlier this year, and are not the first time Indonesia has attempted to mediate a peace process. In 2016 Jakarta hosted the 5th Extraordinary OIC Summit on Palestine and Al-Quds Al-Sharif, which served as a bid to mediate the Israel-Palestine peace process.

Similarly, the Indonesian Government collaborated with civil society organisations in mediating the Mindanao peace process in the Philippines, providing humanitarian aid and engaging in negotiations to free two Indonesian fisherman held hostage by Abu Sayyaf militants since November 2016.

Historically, Indonesia has been well-regarded for its quiet but decisive mediation role in conflict resolution processes in Cambodia the 1980s, as well as for its actions in achieving peaceful resolutions to internal religious conflicts in Ambon and Aceh.

But is this experience sufficient to justify a greater role for Indonesia as an effective and impartial peace broker in Afghanistan?

There are two good opportunities and three limitations to this prospect, all of which need to be taken into account by Jakarta before it seriously engages with the Afghan peace process. While Indonesia might be able to step forward with its proposal for a peace roadmap in Afghanistan, some structural problems might constrain its attempts to get involved.

Let’s begin with the opportunities. One gain from the talks might be greater recognition of Indonesia’s humanitarian diplomacy. During Mr Jokowi’s presidency, Indonesia has taken a lead both in sending humanitarian aid to Rohingya refugees, and responding to the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. This leadership has not only involved the government (particularly the Foreign Ministry) but also a network of religious-based civil society organisations. By hosting the Afghan talks, Indonesia could expand its humanitarian network.

The second opportunity is for increased cooperation in the social and educational sector. Although Indonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, it currently hosts more than 13,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other Middle Eastern countries. The talks among Islamic clerics should been seen as a chance to build social and educational cooperation; for example, by providing scholarships to refugees in Indonesia, or through educational exchange programs.

However, structural factors might constrain these opportunities.

The first obstacle could be the overuse of Islam in foreign policy. Of course, the Bogor talks aim to use Islam as a model of peaceful conflict resolution in world politics; but we should remember that Islam in Afghanistan not only has different characteristics to Islam in Indonesia but also a different historical trajectory.

Islam in Afghanistan is politically linked with tribal and ethnic groups with various political interests. This makes conflict resolution more complicated than in Ambon.

This leads to the second obstacle: limitations to Indonesia’s engagement with Islamic political forces in Afghanistan.

The Taliban, for example, is vastly different to Indonesian jihadi militia that can be confronted with “deradicalisation” programs. This obstacle was made clear by the Taliban’s withdrawal from the talks, although they seem to be interested in the broader peace offer made by the Afghan Government. It is important for Indonesia to engage with the Taliban, whose political aspirations are closer to insurgency than more religious dissent.

It is also important to understand the geopolitical context of the Afghan conflict, which is shaped by a long-standing rivalry with the United States and Soviet Union (in the past), and by the interethnic contestations that followed the US invasion. Indonesia might host dialogues as a means to facilitate a peace process, but this is not enough. Jakarta needs to consider the strategic environment in South Asia before engaging as an impartial mediator.

Nevertheless, these talks could be a starting point to articulate the new spirit of Indonesia’s foreign policy. Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi has reinvigorated Indonesia’s commitment towards humanitarianism and world peace. The talks in Bogor offer a venue to test this commitment and bring the new face of Indonesia’s humanitarian diplomacy to international politics.

2,indonesia,"In the tumultuous months after protests and riots wracked Jakarta, bringing down Indonesian president Haji Muhammad Suharto in May 1998, a British political consultancy arrived on the scene.

SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA), says it came to southeast Asia’s most populous nation at the behest of “pro-democratic groups” to “assist with a national campaign of political reform and democratization.” The country was still reeling from the Asian economic crisis that started in 1997 and the exit of a leader who had held on to power for three decades. The British firm’s assignment eventually included surveying thousands of Indonesians, managing communications for politicians and, most curiously, organizing large rallies at universities to help students “let off steam,” according to company documents accessed by Quartz.

The documents, issued around 2013, also highlight SCL’s role in nearby countries. In Thailand, the company claims to have spent nine months surveying voters before staging an intervention on behalf of multiple political parties.

SCL later morphed into CA, which allegedly used the data of some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Its purported ability to affect large numbers of people seems to have been tested and honed a decade and a half earlier, in the political upheaval of southeast Asia. The documents provide a more detailed—if one-sided—insight into the workings of SCL beyond what former employees like Christopher Wylie have described in interviews and testimonies. In total, SCL claims to have worked on more than 100 election campaigns across 32 countries.

After Suharto’s fall

Amid the violence that marked the aftermath of Suharto’s 1998 resignation, SCL was tasked with managing growing frustration with the new administration of president BJ Habibie. To better understand the sentiment of Indonesia’s 220 million people, spread across 33 provinces, the company rolled out a countrywide survey that had 72,000 respondents. The documents outline the findings:

It was clear from the research that it was the younger “university” age-group that were the principle instigators of the unrest and conversely the older generation were weary of insubordination having been suppressed for so long that they had come to tacitly accept their lot in life. Consequently, it was decided to focus on the 18-25 M/F (male/female) segment of the population and to redirect their frustration away from civil unrest.

SCL then focused its research around secondary schools and local universities, and discovered that the rise in insubordination was partly triggered by the increased presence of police and military troops on the streets. Eventually, it decided to sponsor “organized avenues of protests” to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations. This was apparently done with the cooperation of the Indonesian government, which initially had some misgivings about such large gatherings.

“Large rallies were organised at each university. This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country,” the SCL documents said. “The events were so large that there was a general feeling amongst students that their voice really had been heard.”

SCL claims its methods worked, dramatically reducing civil unrest, convincing Habibie to step down, and leading to elections that brought Abdurrahman Wahid to power in 1999.

The documents don’t specify who SCL initially worked for in Indonesia, but they indicate that the company managed the election campaign of Wahid’s National Awakening Party. There is, in fact, a one-line testimony from Wahid: “I am indebted to SCL for their strategic management of my election success.”

However, there are doubts about the effectiveness of SCL’s work. President Wahid, for instance, was impeached in 2001 after presiding over a chaotic administration that failed to stabilise the country. All of SCL’s efforts—including reportedly setting up a slick operations centre with 25 computers and 16 flat-screen monitors—evidently did little to help Wahid’s situation.

Indonesia experts also question if SCL could have made much of a difference in tamping down violence. “I think this is an exaggeration,” said Ian Wilson, a lecturer at Australia’s Murdoch University. “It would have been, at most, one small element among all that were taking place at the time.

“The forces and interests at play and jostling for influence were simply on too big a scale to have been influenced significantly in such a way. The protest also had been going on for months, if not years, at different levels of scale and intensity,” Wilson added.

Before Thaksin’s coming

In Thailand, too, SCL claims to have set up a large operation that went on for months.

The documents don’t provide exact timelines, but the company appears to have got started sometime before the 2001 elections that swept telecom billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra into power. In this case, SCL’s mandate was to ascertain the scale of vote-buying behavior—a longstanding issue in the southeast Asian country—that had inflated the cost of running an election campaign to around $1 billion, according to the company’s estimates.

“The research showed that the vote buying practice had become so endemic that an entire industry of dealers had emerged to broker the voter groups and funders,” the documents said. “It was quite commonplace for voters to sell their votes twice—and then not vote at all!”

As in Indonesia, SCL set up a research project to collate data from all 79 constituencies, using a staff of more than 1,200 that worked over nine months. The objective was to assess the underlying motivation of voters and identify how open a particular constituency was to accepting a change in vote-buying behavior.

In 50% of the constituencies assessed, the research found, vote-buying did not impact the electoral result, a finding that SCL claims was worth $250 million alone. However, the company identified 91 constituencies where money did matter. “In these constituencies a more direct behavioural intervention was required which consisted of a full-spectrum approach (FSA) combining social pressure, economic penalties, legal framework and enhanced monitoring,” the documents suggested.

Apparently, with “the cooperation of most of the major political parties,” SCL implemented a six-month intervention. The result: Shinawatra, one of Thailand’s richest men, won the 2001 polls. SCL also insists that vote-buying dropped by 31%, a result it pegs at around $420 million in value.

Chuan Leekpai, former leader of Thailand’s Democrat Party who served as prime minister twice, wrote a glowing review of SCL’s services. “Winning an election is about choosing your battles carefully. SCL made clear those conflicts that could be won, those that could not, and those that had to be hard fought for,” said Leekpai, according to the documents.

It is entirely plausible that international political consultancies like SCL may have been engaged by Thailand’s major political parties. “There’s no doubt that some Thai political parties have commissioned international consultants to work on improving their electability, and this was certainly the case for Thaksin’s Thai Rak Thai Party in 2001,” said Duncan McCargo, a Thailand expert and professor at the University of Leeds. “Thai political parties want to win elections and some of them brought in whatever expertise they could to advise them.”

However, there is some skepticism about the possibility of multiple parties supporting a project to stop vote-buying, as the SCL documents suggest. “Vote-buying has been a widespread issue of concern in Thailand and was the basis of considerable public interest/moral panic in the 1980s and 1990s… the 1997 constitution included various provisions designed to combat and reduce vote-buying,” McCargo explained. “There was broad popular support for these changes, though I can’t say that translates to ‘cross-party’ support.”

4,indonesia,"The recent misuse of data belonging to tens of millions of Facebook users has shown that Indonesian netizens must improve their awareness on data privacy, a digital rights group has said.

Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet) regional coordinator Damar Juniarto said on Thursday that by neglecting the importance of data privacy, threats to Indonesia’s democracy and citizen privacy would grow.

“Please be critical if any party requests that you submit your data,” Damar said. “We must be on alert each time we see an unclear third party app in our social media [accounts],” he added.

As reported earlier, Facebook was implicated in a data hijacking case, in which Cambridge Analytics, a British firm linked to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was found to have used the data of 50 million users of the social network company.

Damar explained how large amounts of data in social networks, including Facebook, could be misused.

“The data is valuable, so it can be sold to irresponsible people,” Damar said. “There are many cases of online fraud, in which the perpetrators use lots of personal information they collect on social media.”

Damar said the data hijacking could be replicated in the upcoming regional elections and 2019 presidential and legislative elections.

“It’s urgent for the government to speed up the deliberation of a data protection law,” he said. Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of Facebook users in the world, with 130 million accounts, or 6 percent of the total global users.

6,indonesia,"On March 29, this year’s iteration of the annual U.S.-led Pacific Partnership, the largest annual multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission in the Asia-Pacific, moved to Southeast Asia beginning with Indonesia. The ongoing exercise has once again put the spotlight on the evolution of U.S. drills in the region as part of its broader defense engagement.

As I have noted before, there are a whole range of U.S. or U.S.-led exercises involving Asia in general and Southeast Asia and particular, from the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise to the smaller Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training (SEACAT) exercise. Over the past few years, we have seen Washington and regional partners work on expanding some aspects of these exercises amid changing strategic realities (See: “What Did the Latest US Asia Maritime Security Exercise Achieve?”).

Pacific Partnership itself began in 2006 following the December 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of Southeast Asia. Led by the U.S. Navy in partnership with other like-minded countries and non-governmental organizations, it sees the combined force visiting several host nations every year and engaging in a variety of local outreach efforts to improve boost capabilities, build relationships, and bolster collective ability to respond to natural disasters.

The list of countries under the annual Pacific Partnership missions tends to feature a mix of continuity and change depending on the year. This year’s Pacific Partnership, which was planned for months culminating in the planning conference in mid-January, was set to feature military and civilian personnel from the United States as well as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Peru, and Japan, with mission stops including Micronesia, Sri Lanka, Japan as well as a few Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam out to June.

Several of the other distinguishing features we have seen in previous years were also set to continue this year, including the utilization of a multinational command-and-control structure (this year with a deputy mission commander from the United Kingdom and a mission chief of staff from Australia) and the highlighting of the role of women in HA/DR efforts in line with the Women Peace and Security Program initiative.

This year’s iteration of Pacific Partnership officially got underway in February, with the USNS Mercy departing the home port of San Diego on February 23, where it, along with the expeditionary fast transport ship USNS Fall River, would make separate mission stops as is usually the case.

On March 28, the U.S. Navy officially announced that Pacific Partnership was moving to Indonesia. The exercise activities in Bengkulu, Indonesia, which will last through April 12, will include civil engineering projects, conducting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) readiness drills, and partnering in community outreach engagements in the local Bengkulu community.

But of the various Southeast Asian stops, the one that has grabbed the most headlines thus far has been the Vietnam one. That is no surprise. As I have been noting in these pages, the high level of activity in U.S.-Vietnam defense ties, with some historic moves including the recent visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier there, have focused more attention to naval interactions tied to the bilateral relationship (See: “Why a First US Aircraft Carrier Vietnam Visit Matters”).",https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/us-pacific-partnership-2018-moves-to-southeast-asia/

9,indonesia,"As more countries move away from drug prohibition, Indonesia is about to step up its efforts to defend it. Proposed revisions to the country's criminal code promote harsh penalties for the use and possession of narcotics - including society's ultimate sanction, the death penalty - instead of a health-oriented approach. Rather than enabling a safer, healthier future for the world's fourth largest population, the changes guarantee a surge in prison overcrowding, inflated public health costs, decreased access to health care, and increased drug trafficking, availability, and misuse.

The current criminal code (KUHP) is nearly identical to the penal code issued by the Dutch colonial authorities in 1918, which was retained when Indonesia gained independence in 1945. Its long-overdue revamp, which is in the final stages of deliberation in the House of Representatives, contains a new set of alarming provisions, including some that criminalise homosexuality, extramarital sex, and criticism of the president.

The latest draft revisions have been widely condemned by rights organisations. The United Nations human rights chief deemed the proposed amendments ""inherently discriminatory"", arguing that their sanctions fall disproportionately on the most marginalised segments of society. Last month, activists from the so-called Civil Society Alliance to Reject the Draft Criminal Code organised several protests rejecting the parliament's proposals. Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights warned against the rushed adoption of the current criminal code revisions, calling for more input from the public.

Yet while the media and public have focused on the wider set of KUHP amendments, the inclusion of strict penalties for non-violent drug users has nearly slipped in unnoticed. The draft bill contains 22 articles on the use, possession, couriering, and smuggling of narcotics, all of which are treated as criminal offenses punishable with jail time, or in severe cases, death by firing squad.

A selective copy and paste job

Stiff repercussions for the use and supply of drugs are not a new development in this Muslim-majority, archipelago nation. Indonesia was rendered infamous by its harrowing execution of 14 prisoners in 2015, and more recently, by encouraging on-the-spot shootings of suspected drug dealers without due process.

Drug use and supply have been strictly regulated in Indonesia since 1976 (law no. 9), with subsequent amendments introduced in 2009 (law no. 35). The nation's current drug policy incarnation - which akin to the criminal code, is coincidentally under government review - endorses jail time and civil rights sanctions for those caught using psychotropic substances.

Despite favouring a punitive slant, 2009 amendments to the drug law are tempered by provisions aimed at steering drug users away from the criminal justice system and into rehabilitation. For instance, in cases involving drug use the law provides judges with wide discretion to impose drug treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. Despite ongoing challenges in terms of implementation, the formal recognition of substance use as a complex medical issue requiring health measures offers a lifeline to millions of drug users.

The draft version of the Criminal Code that we consulted (from February 2, 2018) reproduces the provisions on the punishment of drug use from Indonesia's current drug law nearly verbatim, but excludes others focused on health.

One of the most problematic proposals is the lack of distinction between those who use drugs recreationally with those who traffic drugs. In what is arguably one of the broadest, most elusive provisions, draft article 701 lumps together the ""ownership, possession, storage, purchase, or cultivation of narcotics, even in cases where the narcotics are for their own use."" In this way, the revised criminal code blanket criminalizes vastly different infractions, while failing to recognize drug dependence as a health concern.

Criminalisation of drug use produces added harms

After decades of fighting a brutal war on drugs, the Indonesian government has not been able to offer any convincing evidence that prison time, brutal crackdowns, or executions have curbed drug crime and reduced recreational use.

Counter to the government's claims that the death penalty has a deterrent effect, in practice drug crimes in Indonesia increased in the months after the 2015 executions. At the same time, law enforcement-heavy crackdowns have had no documented effect on drug use rates. Levels of illicit drug consumption in Indonesia have remained relatively stable since the early 2000s, and are much lower than rates found in the United States and many countries in Europe.

The uneven implementation of Indonesia's current drug law means that many drug users, especially those who cannot afford to pay bribes, continue to be thrown in jail. According to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Indonesian prisons are up to 273 percent over capacity, with drugs being the chief reason people end up in prison. As of February 2018, 84 percent of all prisoners across the archipelago, amounting to 82,467 men and women, were incarcerated on narcotics-related offences. Among prisoners held on narcotics-related charges, 32 percent were non-violent drug users.

Evidence from several countries with harsh approaches shows that criminalisation results in a domino effect of public health problems, too. Penalisation of drug use increases societal stigma and discrimination against recreational drug users, which can drive them away from seeking health care and fuel HIV and AIDS epidemics. Should the proposed criminal code bill become law next month, the outcomes will be more of the same.

Shedding colonial legacies?

Rather than doing away with remnants of Dutch colonial legacy, rights lawyers argue that the proposed codification of a strictly punitive approach to drugs in the criminal code is far more regressive than its colonial predecessor.

The Netherlands - a country with a relatively permissive approach to drugs - has managed to maintain stable cannabis rates among youth, low rates of HIV among hard drug users, and low levels of drug crime. These health and social benefits were achieved not with the heavy fist of law enforcement, but with pragmatic policies that placed narcotics interventions in the hands of public health authorities.

Faced with explosive heroin-fueled HIV epidemics in the 1980s and a failing, costly war on drugs in many of its European neighbours, the Netherlands adopted a set of policies now known as the ""Dutch model"". These included substantial investments in comprehensive health and social services like needle syringe programs and safe consumptions rooms where users could access clean drug injection equipment and seek counselling and treatment. These measures are credited with sparing the Netherlands many of the public health and criminal justice system costs incurred by countries with tougher approaches. By comparison, Indonesia's proposed RKUHP changes - which introduce new forms of discrimination focused solely on crime and punishment - would send the country backwards several decades.

Legal advocates have argued that narcotics should remain within the scope of the current drug law. Although in the eyes of many it is far from just, it retains the possibility of improvement. As a ""living"" document responsive to societal changes, the existing drug law is dynamic and amenable to reform. By contrast, the formal legal processes involved in amending the criminal code are cumbersome, inflexible, and lengthy. Discussions on the revisions started in the 1960s. It has taken until 2018 for criminal code revision to become a legislative priority.

At a time when much of the world is starting to understand the disastrous effects of prohibition, Indonesia should learn from its own drug war history, and move forward rather than backwards. There may not be another chance for reform for another 50 years.

Indonesia's national skateboarding team suffers a training crisis in the leadup to the Asian Games: an uncomfortable rash caused by a caterpillar infestation at the training venue.

Indonesia's national skateboarding team has suffered a training crisis in the leadup to the Asian Games: an uncomfortable rash caused by a caterpillar infestation at the training venue.

Key points: The caterpillar crisis is just one of many problems facing host nation Indonesia

Many of the venues are yet to be finished, and Jakarta's traffic may be a problem

The skaters are trying to stay focused to 'prove that Indonesia can get a gold medal'

""There's a lot of rambutan trees so there's lots of caterpillars,"" veteran skater Pevi Permana said.

""When the wind blows the hairs of the caterpillars are carried by the wind and get onto our skin and we get all itchy.

""It was super itchy — I've got red bumps all over me and my skin had to be medicated.""

It is so bad the team has shifted to a new venue in outer Jakarta — but the caterpillar crisis is just one of many problems facing host nation Indonesia ahead of the Asian Games in August.

Plenty of venues in the host cities of Jakarta and Palembang in South Sumatra are not finished: the velodrome, the horse riding facilities, the squash venue, four soccer stadiums in West Java, the roller skating rink and the light rail in Palembang that is supposed to get tourists to the venues.

President Joko Widodo has told the organisers to get a move on.

The Sports Ministry's Gatot Dewabroto told the ABC he is confident everything will be ready on time.

There remains a fair amount of concern though about getting competitors 17 kilometres from the athletes' village to the venues. Jakarta's roads are awful and the traffic is apocalyptic.

Authorities say they will provide police escorts to push through the congestion, and they are planning on reducing traffic by ordering local schools to close for the duration of the Games.

Mr Dewabroto says the students will study from home under a scheme they are calling ""long distance education"".

The Games also fall during Eid al-Adha — an Islamic festival that involves livestock for sale on the city streets which are inspected and bought so they can be donated to the city's poor.

The cattle and goats are normally slaughtered at local mosques before the meat is handed out.

It is a pretty challenging sight for tourists and athletes and there is a risk the blood and smell will upset the equestrian competitors' horses.

The Sports Ministry says it has shifted some saleyards and asked mosques around the venues to consider doing the slaughter somewhere else.

Skaters out to prove Indonesia 'can get a gold medal'

Aside from avoiding the caterpillars, the skateboarders are staying away from logistical concerns.

They are trying to stay focused on their training schedule.

""I'm going to prove that Indonesia can get a gold medal,"" said Permana, who is one of his nation's few professional skaters.

""I used to think that skateboarding was only suitable for people from overseas. Especially for Americans because it's from there. But then I found out that there were a lot of Asians joining the international competitions as well so that inspired me.

""It's just about how I train consistently so I can be equal to those Americans or Europeans.""

The training session we watched begins in the late afternoon — when Jakarta's scorching heat has softened slightly.

As dusk approaches it is an intoxicating scene at the park, where there is a soundtrack of the call to prayer and the backdrop includes the minaret of the local mosque as well as huge tropical thunderheads building to the west.

Smoke from burning rubbish wafts across the park, giving the whole scene a kind of cinematic filter.

If only you did not have to breathe it in.

The squad are all soaked with sweat as they push themselves in their new venue.

One of the team's younger members, 20-year-old Aldy Agustiano, already has a list of injuries that would compare with that of a veteran AFL ruckman.

""I've got four stitches under my left eye. I broke my left pinky finger. I've got five stitches here,"" he said, pointing to his finger.

""Of course there's my ankle — every skateboarder would have this — my left ankle was fractured. The back of my head was wounded and on my left shoulder, the ligament was broken.""

12,indonesia,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia - where one in three children have been physically attacked in school - to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.

The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).

“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.

Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 - or 18 million students - experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.

The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programs, it said.

“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying program to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.

“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”

The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.

Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-education-celebrities/david-beckham-tackles-bullying-and-violence-in-indonesian-schools-idUSKBN1H4235

14,indonesia,"Indonesia will need an estimated $4.6 billion to restore some 20,000 square kilometers (7,720 square miles) of degraded peatland by its self-imposed deadline of 2020, a study suggests.

To date, however, funding for the project that began in 2016 amounts to less than $200 million, with the result that only 5 percent of the restoration target has been achieved.

The study authors say the Indonesian government faces a dilemma over whether to concentrate its resources in a smaller area or risk potentially ineffective restoration methods to cover the entire target area.

JAKARTA — High costs and a lack of funding stand in the way of Indonesia achieving its target for the restoration of degraded peatland across the country, a new study says.

The government in 2016 embarked on a program to restore 20,000 square kilometers (7,720 square miles) of degraded peat forest by 2020. The cost for this undertaking, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia, will likely exceed $4.6 billion.

To date, however, the Indonesian government has budgeted just $200 million for the initiative, according to the study, and the results are telling: only 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles) of peatland, or 10 percent of the total, had been rewetted by the end of 2017.

That funding includes 34 million Norwegian krone ($4.4 million) from the Norwegian government and $134.6 million from the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany and the Netherlands. For its part, the Indonesian government initially allocated the equivalent of $60.5 million from its 2017 spending budget.

The $200 million figure cited in the study, though, used the lowest cost projections available and did not account for the subsequent slashing of Indonesia’s contribution by half, as part of wider cost-cutting measures by the Ministry of Finance.

Preventing fires

The peat-restoration initiative was born out of the need to prevent the kinds of land and forest fires that devastated huge swaths of the country in 2015. While such fires are an annual occurrence linked to the clearing of land for commercial agriculture, the burning and haze in 2015 were exacerbated by the draining of peat forests, which render the permanently moist peat soil dry and highly combustible.

Peat forests are globally significant both for their ability to store carbon dioxide and for their biodiversity. In Indonesia, peatlands in Sumatra are home to critically endangered species such as orangutans, rhinos and tigers.

“Restoring peat will, therefore, be critical not only for Indonesia to achieve its emission reduction target, but also to provide habitat for these species,” Amanda Hansson, a co-author of the new study, told Mongabay.

To protect these landscapes, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in 2016 established the Peatland Restoration Agency, or BRG.

Hansson and her team used data from the BRG to examine the case of peatland restoration in Sumatra, Papua and Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. They classified peat forests based on their fire, logging and drainage histories, as well as their current hydrological conditions.

They found that peat areas with low-intensity fires were more easily restored than those that had experienced high-intensity fires, with the former showing greater signs of unassisted recovery compared to the latter.

But the biggest determinant of the total cost of restoration, the researchers found, is the width of the canals dug to drain the peat soil in preparation for planting. The wider the canals, typically associated with oil palm plantations, the more difficult, and more expensive, it is to restore the peat areas, Hansson said.

“I was particularly surprised by the high cost associated with restoring wide canals, which can reach up to $23,500 per hectare,” or about $9,500 per acre, she said. “Restoring peat which has been drained using large-scale canals can quickly become very expensive.”

Restoring or rewetting small-scale agricultural landscapes, however, is relatively inexpensive, starting at around $400 per hectare. These areas typically have much smaller canals that can be dammed much more cheaply.

Funding gap

Peat areas that have been drained and burned for commercial use make up the bulk of BRG’s working area, driving the potential cost of the entire endeavor to $4.6 billion, the study estimated.

The stark difference between the actual funding allocated and the money required to successfully restore the targeted 20,000 square kilometers of peatland leaves Indonesia facing a difficult decision, Hansson said.

“This shortfall means Indonesia will have to choose between using best-practice methods in smaller areas or using cheaper and potentially ineffective restoration methods to reinstate larger areas of degraded peat forest,” she said.

The government, she added, would have to address the shortfall if it wanted to meet the target.

“Attracting global funding will be essential for Indonesia in realizing this target, and developing a cost estimate may help in highlighting the need for international support in this process,” Hansson said.

When asked about the findings, BRG head Nazir Foead said he had not yet read the study but would look into it.

15,indonesia,"The parent company of British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica (CA) may have been operating in South-east Asia as far back as two decades ago, managing civil unrest in Indonesia and paving the way for Thaksin Shinawatra to take power in Thailand, news website Quartz has reported.

British political consultancy SCL Group claims to have arrived in Indonesia after president Suharto was brought down in 1998, according to company documents issued around 2013 that were accessed by Quartz.

SCL eventually became CA, which is now alleged to have used the data of 50 million Facebook users to influence voters during Mr Donald Trump's 2016 United States presidential campaign.

SCL said it began operating in Indonesia at the request of ""pro-democratic groups"" to ""assist with a national campaign of political reform and democratisation"" in a country reeling from the Asian economic crisis, as well as the loss of a leader who had been in power for over 30 years, the Quartz report said. Quartz is owned by Atlantic Media, publisher of The Atlantic, National Journal and Government Executive.

In total, SCL claims to have worked on more than 100 election campaigns across 32 countries, Quartz reported. Previous media reports say these included claims that it had helped political parties in Malaysia, India, Kenya and Brazil.

INDONESIA CIVIL UNREST

In Indonesia, according to the SCL documents, the firm went on to survey thousands of Indonesians, manage communications for politicians and even organise large rallies at universities to help students ""let off steam"".

SCL said it was tasked with managing growing frustration with the new administration of president B.J. Habibie and surveyed 72,000 of the country's 220 million people.

In Indonesia in 1998, SCL said it decided to sponsor ""organised avenues of protests"" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations. But Indonesia expert Ian Wilson of Australia's Murdoch University said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an ""exaggeration"".

The documents seen by Quartz show that the younger ""university"" age group mainly instigated the unrest, while the older generation was wary of insubordination, having been suppressed for so long.

SCL decided to focus on 18-to 25-year-old Indonesians and direct their frustration away from civil unrest. Research in schools and universities found many of them were unhappy about the increased police and military presence on the streets.

SCL made the decision to sponsor ""organised avenues of protests"" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations - apparently with the cooperation of the Indonesian government.

""This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country,"" the SCL documents said.

""The events were so large that there was a general feeling among students that their voice really had been heard.""

SCL claims its methods dramatically reduced civil unrest and convinced then President Habibie to step down, leading to the 1999 polls that brought Mr Abdurrahman Wahid to power. The documents, Quartz said, indicate SCL ran the election campaign of Mr Abdurrahman's National Awakening Party.

Indonesia expert Ian Wilson, a lecturer at Australia's Murdoch University, said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an ""exaggeration"".

""It would have been, at most, one small element among all that were taking place at the time,"" he told Quartz. ""The forces and interests at play and jostling for influence were simply on too big a scale to have been influenced significantly in such a way.""

THAI ELECTION DATA

The SCL documents say the company entered Thailand some time before the 2001 elections that saw telecoms billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra taking power.

SCL was tasked with gauging the scale of vote-buying behaviour that had inflated the cost of an election campaign to an estimated US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion).

""Vote buying had become so endemic that an entire industry of dealers had emerged to broker the voter groups and funders,"" the documents said, as quoted by Quartz.

""It was quite commonplace for voters to sell their votes twice - and then not vote at all!""

SCL claimed to have employed more than 1,200 staff who collected data from over nine months and found that in half of the constituencies, vote buying did not impact the electoral result, a discovery that the company claimed was worth US$250 million alone.

However, in the other constituencies ""a more direct behavioural intervention was required"", which the SCL papers suggested could involve ""social pressure, economic penalties, legal framework and enhanced monitoring"".

SCL said it intervened for six months, apparently with ""the cooperation of most of the major political parties"", and Thaksin went on to win the 2001 election.

Thailand expert and University of Leeds professor Duncan McCargo told Quartz: ""There's no doubt that some Thai political parties have commissioned international consultants to work on improving their electability, and this was certainly the case for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party in 2001.""

He was sceptical, however, that different parties could have supported a project to stop vote buying. ""The 1997 Constitution included various provisions designed to combat and reduce vote buying,"" he explained. ""There was broad popular support for these changes, though I can't say that translates to 'cross-party' support.""

Quartz said it had contacted CA and SCL for comment.",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/controversial-firm-linked-to-s-e-asia
16,indonesia,"SINGAPORE - As Indonesia gears up for a series of elections culminating in the presidential election next year, a community network against falsehoods is launching what it calls hoax crisis centres next month.

Mafindo network founder, Mr Septiaji Eko Nugroho, said such a centre will bring together stakeholders including the police, election supervisory board, netizens, academics, community and religious leaders to dispute misinformation quickly.

These hoax crisis centres will be set up in three provinces, as part of measures being lined up by Mafindo to identify and debunk falsehoods during election season in Indonesia.

Another possible measure is a “custom search engine” featuring the Google platform but listing only legitimate sites such as that of registered media organisations. Said Mr Septiaji: “This is the approach we are going to advocate to the people – using a clean search engine.”

On Friday (March 16), Mr Septiaji shared details of these efforts with the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods on the third day of public hearings.

He agreed with Select Committee member Sun Xueling, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, that the potential spread of falsehoods in an election year could lead to chaos and affect elections.

""In elections where there are racial and religious tensions, (the propensity for) misinformation is much higher. In our elections this year, we're going to see such a trend as well,"" he said.

In April next year, Indonesians will be voting for their president. In the lead-up, regional elections will be held in June this year to select governors in 17 provinces, mayors of 39 cities and heads of 115 regencies.

While Mafindo already has 300 volunteers in 15 cities, Mr Septiaji stressed the need to involve more people on the ground as well as to work closely with journalists, the police and other parties to identify falsehoods and disseminate clarifications.

But Mr Septiaji conceded that there may be obstacles to taking down online falsehoods.

He noted that technology companies like Google hold a standard of net neutrality - meaning they may not remove content though they allow third parties to flag misinformation.

Still, in cases involving ""dangerous"" material - such as the live-streaming of suicide attempts on Facebook - it is possible to intervene to take the post down. He added such intervention could be considered, among moves to curb the spread of harmful falsehoods.

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

JAKARTA, March 30 (Reuters) - Indonesia will unveil a simplified scheme for tax holidays next week and state oil firm PT Pertamina should be among the first to benefit, government officials said.

Boosting investment is a priority for President Joko Widodo as household consumption - the main engine of growth for Southeast Asia's largest economy - has remained sluggish in recent years.

Under different programmes, Indonesia has offered tax holidays since 2011, but the approval process has been complicated, and only a few companies have obtained them.

Under the revised rules due to be signed next week by the finance minister, a company can apply for income tax relief when it requests investment permits, Suahasil Nazara, head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told reporters on Thursday.

He said the rules are also simplified so that the investment size will determine the number of years for which a company can get tax discount.

An investment of 500 billion rupiah ($36.34 million) to 1 trillion rupiah will make a company eligible for five years holiday for corporate tax, Nazara said. The maximum holiday will be 20 years, given to those investing more than 30 trillion rupiah.

Current tax holiday rules offer a 10-100 percent income tax reduction for firms in ""pioneering industries"" for a maximum 15 years, though the minister can give an additional five years.

""Pioneering industries"" are defined as those that, among other things, create added value and introduce technology. Among such industries are maritime transport, telecommunications, and processing of metals and agricultural products.

At present, a company can only apply for the tax break after obtaining an in-principle investment permit.

It was not clear whether companies in industries currently eligible for tax holidays will remain so under the new scheme.

Djoko Siswanto, the energy ministry's director general of oil and gas, Pertamina's refinery investment will likely be among the first to get the new incentive.

Nazara said Pertamina has applied for a tax holiday for a refinery it is planning to upgrade with Saudi Aramco.

20,indonesia,"When Russia’s new ambassador to Indonesia, Lyudmila Georgievna Vorobieva, addressed the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club (JFCC) this week, she had only been at her post for 10 days, barely enough time to recover from her jet lag.

But, as Vorobieva acknowledged, it was still enough time for conversations with Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials and her British counterpart about the March 4 nerve-agent poisoning of a Russian political émigré and his daughter in the southern England town of Salisbury.

Her JFCC appearance did not resemble the noisy encounter that occurred in September 1983 when 10 Soviet diplomats chose Bangkok as the only capital outside of Moscow vigorously to defend Russia’s shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 off the Kamchatka Peninsula, which it had treated as an intruding US spy plane.

But Vorobieva is clearly no shrinking violet either. While saying she appreciated the “balanced view” of Indonesian officials, she called on Britain to produce hard evidence that proved Moscow’s culpability in a case that has led to the expulsion of 150 Russian diplomats around the world and retaliatory measures by Moscow.

The blond diplomat is well practiced at defending Russian President Vladimir Putin’s alleged excesses. As ambassador to Malaysia, she made the same argument in publicly fighting off allegations that a Russian missile shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, resulting in the loss of 253 lives.

Why were Britain, the United States and the European Union “demonizing” Russia? she asked rhetorically at the JFCC lunch, before answering: “I think it’s because we have our own voice and we have our own interests we want to pursue.”

Jakarta-based Russian diplomats generally keep to themselves, but Vorobieva’s arrival may signal a more high-profile stance. Fluent in English, French, Thai and Lao, she has spent a collective two decades in Southeast Asia, starting with part of her childhood in Bangkok with her diplomatic parents.

The muscular Stalinist statuary dotted around Jakarta speaks of the close relations that existed in the 1950s between the Soviet Union and founding Indonesian president Sukarno’s government. Then, much of Indonesia’s Air Force fleet consisted of Soviet-made warplanes.

During president Suharto’s 32 years in power, those relations cooled as Indonesia emerged as an anti-communism bulwark in Southeast Asia. Indonesia was core to the 1967 creation of the then-six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), formed originally to counter the spread of communism in the region.

But in more recent years, Indonesia-Russia relations have warmed significantly, ironically because of a 15-year US arms embargo imposed on Jakarta after the killing of East Timor demonstrators in 1991 and the territory’s bloody separation from Indonesia eight years later.

While US president Barack Obama’s administration lifted the arms embargo in 2005 and the US has since delivered 24 refurbished F-16 fighters to add to nine older models, they now share the sky with 16 twin-engine Russian-made Sukhoi jets, which first entered service during the government of Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno’s daughter.

The Su-27s and Su-30s are now being joined by another 11 Su-35 air-superiority fighters in a US$1.1 billion barter deal that was concluded in February, only weeks after Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto became the third airman to command the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI).

Two of the combat-ready Su-35s have already been delivered and another three are expected to land in August, giving the air force a greater ability to patrol its vast airspaces. As with the initial deal, part of the cost will be paid through Indonesian exports of palm oil, rubber and other commodities.

Although their engines have half the life of a US-made F-16, the Su-35 is suited to archipelagic operations with a superior range and a combat radius of 1,500 kilometers, three times that of the American fighter.

Indonesia is only the second overseas customer after China for the fourth-generation warplane, warding off what the Russians have claimed was heavy US pressure to stall Indonesia’s military technical cooperation with Moscow.

Russian news reports speak to plans for shipbuilding and helicopter programs, and Russian assistance in the production of 30mm and possibly 100mm ammunition for the BMP-3F infantry fighting vehicles now in service with the Indonesian Marine Corps.

The Marines have 82 old Russian-built BTR-50 and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers in their inventory, while the navy is equipped with Yakhont anti-ship missiles and Strela and Iga surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine torpedoes.

The Indonesian Army’s Russian hardware includes a squadron of Mi-17 transport helicopters and five Mi-35 Hind gunships, which are being joined this year by eight US Boeing AH-64E attack helicopters ordered two years ago.

Vorobieva says it is wrong to talk about Russia in the context of Sino-US rivalry in the South China Sea, where various regional nations have territorial disputes.

But she was also coy about a visit made last December by two Russian long-range bombers to Biak, an island outpost boasting a 3,500-meter runway off the north coast of the Indonesian province of Papua.

Indonesia and Russia have often discussed the possibility of building a satellite launch station at Biak’s Frans Kaisiepo airport, once a refueling stop for airlines on trans-Pacific flights from the US to Jakarta.

The Tu-95 Bears flew 6,500km from Far East Russia’s Amur Oblast region and were refueled over the Pacific Ocean by Il-78 tankers, with the Russian Defense Ministry saying the flight was carried out in “strict accordance with international air law.”

Indonesian officials have said the navigation exercise was part of an agreement between the Russian and Indonesian militaries. Vorobieva sought to play down the significance of the three-day visit, insisting the mission was “routine” even though it was the first of its kind.

She also claimed the four-engine strategic bombers, which first flew in 1952 and are used these days as a cruise-missile platform, had previously flown to “other places” in the region, while declining to elaborate.

Six Russian Pacific Fleet naval ships have made port visits to Indonesia in the past two years, and the ambassador confirmed they would return this year to participate in joint military exercises.

But setting aside closer military cooperation – and Bali’s popularity as a destination for 70,000 Russian tourists last year – Vorobieva acknowledged that there is still much work to be done to strengthen ties between the two giant countries.

Two-way trade amounted to only US$2.3 billion in 2017 and Moscow’s investments in Indonesia are minimal, despite big talk of refinery, power-plant and railway projects when President Joko Widodo and his counterpart Putin met at the Asean-Russia Summit in Sochi in 2016.

Reliability and trust may still be issues. Russia promised to invest in big-ticket aluminum and nickel smelters if Indonesia agreed to hold off on a planned 2014 ban on the export of mineral ores. Jakarta kept its end of the bargain, but the Russians notably did not.

22,indonesia,"Forged in crisis, newest Asian central bank chief comes prepared

Bank Indonesia's Perry Warjiyo at a parliamentary hearing in Jakarta March 28, 2018. — Reuters picJAKARTA, March 29 — Indonesia’s new central bank governor knows a thing or two about crisis management. That’s about to come in handy.

Since joining Bank Indonesia in 1984, Perry Warjiyo has seen the fall of a dictator, the collapse of the financial sector — more than once — and the odd market tantrum. In October last year, he sensed a new calamity around the corner, warning that the tightening of US monetary policy meant trouble ahead for South-east Asia’s largest economy.

Fast forward five months and the rupiah has tanked against the dollar to be among the worst performing currencies in Asia, foreign investors are ditching Indonesian stocks and bonds, while the central bank was last month forced to tap US$4 billion (RM15.5 billion) of foreign reserves to defend the currency.

“Given his understanding of the global economy and experience in handling financial crises, he is an asset to Indonesia,” said Fauzi Ichsan, chief executive officer of Indonesia’s Deposit Insurance Corp. He is a combination of the traditional Javanese man and an international technocrat.”

As the US presses ahead with its interest-rate hike timetable, 59-year-old Warjiyo — who has served as deputy governor since 2013 — is seen as a safe pair of hands in volatile times. He’ll take the reins at Indonesia’s central bank in May as the economy struggles for traction even after eight rate cuts, and as a trade war further threatens its nascent recovery.

His candidature was endorsed by a panel of lawmakers yesterday and he will still need the approval of the parliament.

“Maintaining stability and pushing for growth are things that must not be contradicted, but must be synergised,” Warjiyo said at his confirmation hearing. “This is where I play my role and make Bank Indonesia to be pro-stability, but also pro-growth, so that we can develop the national economy and bring prosperity to the people.”

Warjiyo forecast growth of 5.2 per cent to 5.3 per cent this year, compared with 5.1 per cent expansion in 2017.

Policy mixmaster

While the economy is growing below the 7 per cent target set by President Joko Widodo, inflation eased to a 14-month low in February. That’s given the central bank room to focus on guarding the currency, which has fallen 2.7 percent since the end of January. Bank Indonesia held its benchmark interest rate for a sixth straight month last week, with its attention firmly on the rupiah instead.

Former finance minister Rizal Ramli says Warjiyo will bring a wealth of experience to the role, needed at a time when the economy is facing significant headwinds.

“Indonesia is quite vulnerable to any major change in global markets,” he said in an interview on Monday. “With the US and new Fed governor Jerome Powell determined to raise rates, that’s going to create further pressure for the rupiah.”

The village schools in Central Java where Warjiyo spent his formative years, amid rice paddy fields and under the shadow of an active volcano, are a far cry from the likes of Tokyo, Geneva and Washington where he would later further his education. Having earned his economics degree at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in 1982, Warjiyo was later awarded a PhD from Iowa State University in the US in 1991.

Bank adviser

He was already advising Indonesia’s central bank governor as the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, and as the ensuing carnage saw the downfall of the Suharto regime the following year after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Having witnessed the fallout, he sharpened his skills with a course on financial crises in emerging markets at the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1999.

Warjiyo later took up a post as an executive director with the International Monetary Fund in Washington between 2007 and 2009, just as the global financial crisis moved like a wrecking ball through economies around the world. He returned to Bank Indonesia in 2009 and was appointed for a five-year term as deputy governor in 2013.

The president, known as Jokowi, will be looking to Warjiyo to help steer the economy through the current turbulence. And with the 2019 presidential election campaign due to kick off in September, he’ll also be hoping Warjiyo can help fire up economic growth.

Warjiyo, who went to the same university as Jokowi, will likely have the president’s ear, according to Ramli.

“He is a nice guy and easy to get along with,"" he said of Warjiyo. “He will try to find a compromise, a consensus.” — Bloomberg",http://www.themalaymailonline.com/money/article/forged-in-crisis-newest-asian-central-bank-chief-comes-prepared
23,indonesia,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and green groups has pushed big companies that produce, trade or buy palm oil to tackle labour abuses on plantations and commit to ending deforestation that is contributing to climate change.

Yet the small farmers who grow close to half the fruit that yields the edible oil in major suppliers Malaysia and Indonesia have been largely left out of efforts to make the industry greener and more ethical, industry officials say.

Here are some facts about palm oil and the debate around it:

* Palm oil has been consumed as a foodstuff for as long as 5,000 years.

* The oil palm tree originates from West Africa where it grows in the wild. Palms can grow taller than 60 feet (18.3 m).

* Oil palms were introduced to Malaysia by the British in the early 1870s as an ornamental plant.

* Oil palms start bearing fruit about 30 months after being planted, and are productive for the next 20 to 30 years.

* Palm oil is used in a wide range of food and household products, from biscuits, ice-cream and chocolate spreads to soaps and cosmetics, as well as in biofuels.

* India, China, Indonesia and Europe are the main consumers of palm oil.

* Palm trees produce four to 10 times more oil than other vegetable oil crops per unit of cultivated land.

* Global palm oil production was estimated to be about 65 million tonnes in 2017.

* Indonesia and Malaysia produce about 90 percent of the world’s palm oil supplies. Other growing nations include Thailand, Ecuador, Nigeria and Ghana.

* About 40 percent, or 5.6 million hectares, of the total area of land planted with oil palm in Indonesia and Malaysia is owned by smallholders.

* Across Indonesia and Malaysia, 4.5 million people earn their living from palm oil production.

* Palm oil output in the top-two producing nations was forecast to climb to new highs this year as it recovered from a 2015 El Nino weather pattern, pushing average prices for 2018 down by 7 percent from 2017 to $676.30 a tonne, according to a Reuters poll in January.

* In some regions, the clearance of land for oil palm cultivation has caused - and continues to cause - deforestation, despite pledges by big companies to end it.

* The palm oil industry has been blamed by activists for slash-and-burn forest clearing that causes an annual haze across parts of Southeast Asia.

* The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is an industry body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms that aims to promote the use of certified sustainable palm oil products, and is backed by many major European palm oil buyers.

* Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have either already met or are on track to deliver on a commitment to use 100-percent sustainable certified palm oil by 2020.

* An estimated 60 percent of palm oil used for food in Europe in 2016 was certified sustainable palm oil.

* Europe’s lawmakers approved draft measures earlier this year to reform the EU power market and cut energy consumption to meet more ambitious climate change goals. The plan includes a ban on the use of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021.

* Italian confectionery firm Ferrero, which makes hazelnut and chocolate spread Nutella, has publicly defended palm oil after European authorities listed the oil as a cancer risk.
