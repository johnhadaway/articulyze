Eno enjoined the John Odigie-Oyegun-led national working committee (NWC) to constitute an independent panel to conduct the congresses in the state.He added that key stakeholders of the party would resist any attempts by Usani to submit any results that could convey the impression that the ward congresses actually held.

1,niger,"Amid questions over the role of the U.S. military in this part of the world, there is a renewed focus on training local law enforcement officers in the hopes that extremism can be better countered at the community level and along borders. The challenges are great in Niger, where residents of its vast, largely ungoverned spaces say they are losing confidence in authorities.

The police training in one of Africa’s most remote, impoverished countries is crucial as extremists linked to Daesh and Al Qaeda carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa’s vast Sahel region. In October, four U.S. soldiers and five Nigeriens were killed in an ambush claimed by Islamic State group-linked fighters in rural Niger.

NIAMEY, Niger—Under the watchful eyes of U.S. authorities, an elite group of local police officers in Niger’s capital slipped into a home, rescued a “hostage,” detained an “extremist” and pretended to kill another.

As extremism grows “it’s important not to lose sight of the issues at the core of their proliferation and recruitment success, notably bad and often abusive governance,” said Corinne Dufka, Human Rights Watch’s West Africa director. “The Islamist groups are cleverly exploiting local grievances to make inroads with local populations.”

That includes abusive practices by local security forces, she said, calling efforts to professionalize them key.

The U.S. ambassador to Niger, Eric P. Whitaker, said the U.S. is addressing the “factors that create an environment for extremism” by investing more than $500 million (U.S.) over the next few years into local programs for better governance, education, health, agriculture, security and more.

The State Department’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program also is addressing such concerns by training local security forces in everything from border control and investigations to human rights and justice.

After an attack killed 20 people at a luxury hotel in Mali’s capital in November 2015, the U.S. invested $15 million in training nearly 100 local police in crisis response. They also were given the necessary equipment to respond to further attacks, according to Samuel L. Pineda, director in the office of programs with the department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism.

The program has paid off, he said. Several of the trained officers responded during the March 2016 attack on the European Union military training mission’s headquarters in Bamako. And during the June 2017 attack on a resort popular with foreigners outside the capital they helped to kill attackers and rescue victims.

“We want to create transparent forces and we want the people to trust those forces,” Pineda said. “Nobody wants their local market blown up … so if they have the trust of the population, the information comes back in.”

In 2018, the Bureau of Counterterrorism will invest an estimated $106 million in sub-Saharan Africa.

About $50 million of that is dedicated to State Department counterterrorism programs in West and Central Africa, including ones in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Mauritania.

The crisis response program in Mali eventually will be replicated in Niger, where the Antiterrorism Assistance Program has dedicated roughly $10 million to training and equipment this year.

During the U.S. military’s annual Flintlock counterterrorism exercises this month in Niger, local officers put their training to the test, collaborating with Niger’s gendarmerie and military as well as security forces from other West African nations.

The officers who participated in the raid in the capital, Niamey, are part of the Special Program for Embassy Augmentation and Response, known as SPEAR, which was created after the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to train and equip host-nation police units designated as first responders to U.S. diplomatic facilities in crisis. They also can respond to other attacks.

“We train them for an eventuality,” said Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Kent Miller, who manages the Antiterrorism Assistance Program in Niger. “In the current year and last year there has been a focus on rural environments.”

The goal is to disrupt extremists at borders so they don’t make it into more populated areas, he said.

In cities, the hope is that crisis response units and SPEAR officers will respond. They are provided with arms, ammunition, equipment, facilities for practicing raids, a gun range and mentorship.

“The importance of training is that it puts the elements of knowledge for reaction in our hands, and we can then apply them in real-world situations,” said Djibril Ousmane, an assistant police commander in the capital.

The challenge, however, is that extremists also are giving money to communities to win them over, he said.

“It’s difficult to fight poverty,” Ousmane said. “With the right means, more can be done.”","U.S. includes local police in counterterror fight in Niger, across Africa",https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/04/28/us-includes-local-police-in-counterterror-fight-in-niger-across-africa.html

Prolonged conflict perpetuated by Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria has spurred massive displacement and undermined food security. To date in 2018, the insurgency has displaced more than 1.7 million people within Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states and forced an estimated 206,000 Nigerians to flee into neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger, according to the UN.

A recent Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis—a tool used in West Africa for the classification and quantification of food insecurity—projected that nearly 3 million people in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe will likely face Crisis (Phase 3) or worse levels of acute food insecurity during the June–August lean season, the period of the year when food is scarcest.","Nigeria: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - May 7, 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-food-assistance-fact-sheet-may-7-2018

Through this project, we will strengthen civil society organisations' capacity to respond professionally to humanitarian crises, and better help people affected,"" says Felix Muhigana, NORCAP Project Manager.

Close to 17 million people are affected by the humanitarian emergency across the four Lake Chad basin countries; Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. The crisis is characterised as one of the world's most severe. More than 2.3 million people are displaced, and communities are suffering from violence, food insecurity and malnutrition.

""Unchartered terrain""

Four NORCAP experts are already on their way to Niger and Chad. They are hosted by World Food Programme and UNICEF, but will work independently from their host agencies.

""We are very excited to do a completely new project. This is unchartered terrain for us, and for NORCAP"", says Slim Florian Bacha, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and deployee to UNICEF in N'Djamena, Chad.

According to Muhigana, the deployees will map and identify those civil society organisations that are most in need of capacity building and help them develop skills and expertise in areas such as financial management, organisational development and monitoring and evaluation.

""This is the kind of expertise that the organisations said they needed the most. In addition, deployees will link up with existing donors in Chad and Niger, to advocate and enable organisations to get direct access to donors and funds. With a better knowledge of how these things work, they will be able to better serve people in need, says Felix Muhigana.

""This project has a lot of potential, because we are able to set an example of how this can and should be done. At the same time, it is a huge responsibility. We will communicate closely across the region and with our Project manager, to make sure we get off to a good start"", explains Karolina Olofsson, Organisational Development Coordination Expert. She is going to work from Diffa, in Niger, with WFP.

Stepping stone for the future

NORCAP's collaboration with the Civil Society Network begun with the Lake Chad Donor Conference in Oslo, February 2017. The conference raised awareness about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin, aiming to ensure donors pledged money and commitment to scale up humanitarian interventions and alleviate human suffering.

During the conference, the Civil Society Network, an organisation with representatives from the Lake Chad Basin countries, approached NORCAP for a possible partnership. NORCAP did a scoping mission to Chad and Niger, which in turn secured funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""This project is very different from what we've done before, but it speaks to NORCAP's strategic commitments. During the project's pilot phase, we will actively explore additional partnerships to further develop local capacity in the Lake Chad basin, including with relevant donors,"" says Ulf Flink, Head of the NORCAP Unit in NORCAP.",Empowering the first responders,https://www.nrc.no/expert-deployment/2016/2018/empowering-the-first-responders2/

A Facebook post by the Tuareg militia in Mali claims to show a vehicle used by U.S. soldiers who were killed in neighboring Niger in October 2017. This photo was taken April 20, 2018. (Photo: Soumaila T. Diarra)

BAMAKO, Mali — A militia in Mali claims it found the vehicle used by four American soldiers killed in an ambush by Islamist militants in neighboring Niger last fall. The discovery indicates how fighters linked to the Islamic State likely traveled between the two countries.

As the militia of ethnic Tuareg soldiers discuss how to return the vehicle to U.S. authorities, the Islamic State is pushing deeper into this poor, West African country and raising fears of more violence.

Mali's minister of foreign affairs, Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly, said he was concerned that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, would redeploy to Africa as the U.S-led coalition quashes the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria.

""The current momentum in the Middle East can have consequences for the stability of Mali"" and the surrounding region here, Coulibaly said.

Mali already has an active chapter of al-Qaeda, which drove a car bomb into a military base near Timbuktu on April 14, killing a United Nations peacekeeper and wounding seven French soldiers.

""Three days don’t go by without hearing the news of an assassination by the terrorists,” said Hamady Touré, a commercial spice salesman. “The worst thing is that vehicles carrying civilians drive on explosive devices that the terrorists place.”

Those concerns mount despite an international response to the terrorist threat in Mali. The U.N. sent 15,000 peacekeepers to Mali five years ago. France has 4,000 troops in this former French colony. Five nearby countries — Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger — created a joint force of 5,000 troops to secure their borders against militants.

The Tuareg militia that claims it found the Americans’ four-wheel-drive Toyota in March also said it is an important defense against ISIS.

“The main target of these armed terrorists is none other than the local authorities and religious leaders,” said Fahad Almahmoud, a Tuareg militia spokesman.

The Tuareg soldiers are now allies of Mali’s government, but until three years ago they fought against the regime for an independent country.

Tiébilé Dramé, an opposition politician, said the government shouldn’t depend on militias and needs to do more. He said more terrorists appear to be moving into Mali despite the international help, so ordinary citizens see little reason to believe in their leaders.

""The fault is the current governance is bad,” Dramé said. “More than 500 schools are closed in the center of the country because of poor security.”

Mali's security situation has been precarious the past several years. In November 2015, heavily armed gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, the Mali capital, killing 20 people. A year ago, several local extremist groups announced they had banded into a bigger organization affiliated with al-Qaeda.

A U.N. report in March said the militias here have too much power. The report said the Tuaregs and another militia allied with the Malian government conducted extra-judicial executions, made illegal arrests, recruited child soldiers and had other human rights violations in northern Mali.

“It is necessary that both the government and the armed groups investigate serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law,"" said Mongi Hamdi, a U.N. special representative in Mali when the report was published. “This is in the interest of victims’ rights and for the reconciliation and establishment of a lasting peace in Mali.”

In the south, Mali's army and the Dozo — traditional armed hunters who act as an independent defense force — have been accused of similar abuses against the Fulani ethnic community, a Muslim group often loyal to extremists.

""The Malian army is making summary executions of civilians suspected of terrorism,” said Nouhoum Cissé, a member of a Fulani defense organization. When a Fulani appears in the central part of the country, ""you can be suspected of terrorism,” he said.

Malians and Fulanis lived together in harmony for centuries but are now poised to kill each other, Cissé said. He said terror attacks have also driven the indigenous Dogon people to create self-defense militias. Dogon and Fulani groups have clashed as a result.

“The question is who benefits from this situation. It does not benefit the Dogon. It does not benefit the Fulani,” Cissé said. “Those who benefit are the terrorist groups.”

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

According to the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2.3 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in Niger. The needs analysis shows the persistence of five major crises affecting the country: food insecurity (1.4 million people estimated in need), malnutrition (1.7 million people), epidemics (1,170,000 people), floods (170,000 people) and population movements due to conflict or migration (392,305 people).

The deterioration of the security situation in the districts bordering Mali caused the activation of the Intercluster contingency plan. Out of the 84,000-people estimated in the plan, over 40,000 were considered to be at risk of displacements due to threats of attacks and / or military operations. In January,the first 75 displaced families (506 people) arrived in Tiloa, Tillabery region. The protection cluster alerted on the risk of similar displacement for over 40,000 people.

In February, the Diffa region received the joint mission of the Humanitarian Coordinator, high Representative of the government, humanitarian country team members and donors. One of the keys discussion points focused on the nexus humanitarian and development.

8,niger,"Members of Congress are expected to be briefed on the full report of the investigation into the deaths of four soldiers in Niger last year. The soldiers were part of special forces in that country when they came under attack by terrorist forces.

Congressman Steve Russell, R-Oklahoma, himself a combat veteran has reviewed the report that will be made public, as well as the 6,000 pages of classified material accompany the report. Representative Russell told FOX 25 the report backs up what he found in his own investigation.





Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, and Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, and Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, died as a result of an ambush attack in the remote village of Tongo Tongo in Niger on October 4, 2017.

In February, Russell traveled to Niger and met with U.S. forces and local military leaders in the wake of the attack that killed four soldiers.

“I have read the classified report; it did not change my conclusions about the outcome,” Russell told FOX 25. The congressman said he believes the decisions made by the unit would not have changed the tragic outcome. However, the report does include some decisions Russell said that were made up the chain of command that could have been better. Though Russell still believes even improved times for support would not have changed the outcome.

“What you did not see in my investigation,” Russell said, “Was anything other than absolute sacrificial bravery.”

Critics of the administration and the military’s handling of the situation have said the mission was unprepared and a combination of bad choices and bad luck led to the deaths of the soldiers.

“I don't understand why members of Congress, and I suffered this while I was a soldier on battlefield, wondering how people in Washington could make their mouths say something so stupid sometimes when it comes to military operations,” Russell said.

Using his experience as a commander in battle, Russell said the report and his own ground investigation back up that the unit operating in Niger did act appropriately. He still believes some in Congress will not understand the realities of military operations.

“We'll point bony fingers and pound fists on tables and going how did you let this happen military?” Russell explained, “Failing to understand that sometimes a clever enemy gets a vote and sometimes you can surprise people in ambushes and sometimes people die.”

“The untold story here is they weren't all wiped out even though they were small in number,” Russell said. “They didn't give up and continued to fight.”

Russell said that was also true of the Niger soldiers who had been trained and were along on the mission.

The attack marked the first time the United States has lost military personnel in Niger. Critics of the expanded use of the nation’s military in countries around the world should not be a priority.

“I don't want to live in an America that is no longer a force for good,” Russell said in defense of U.S. operations abroad. “I mean if we are so selfish that we just sit here and say everybody else can go die and wither away...that's not a country we've ever been and I'm not sure it's one we want to become.”

Russell said critics of the military’s presence in countries like Niger fail to take into account the big picture. As terrorists lose their traditional strongholds they have been moving into Africa and threaten to destabilize nations that have long been peaceful.

“If we disengage it doesn't improve it actually gets worse,” Russell said. “In Africa what has made it more risky is frail economies. If they fail, then you've got disease, you've got famine and you've got refugee crisis; you've got human suffering on a by the millions scale.”",Report on ambush attack in Niger confirms Oklahoma Congressman's investigation,http://okcfox.com/news/connect-to-congress/report-on-ambush-attack-in-niger-confirms-oklahoma-congressmans-investigation

On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

12,niger,"The Federal Government could ignite a crisis, if its planned resumption of oil exploration in Ogoniland goes ahead without the resolution of key issues.The warning by stakeholders in the Niger Delta is coming on the heels of last weekend’s meeting between the leadership of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu. The meeting had sought to find solutions to the crisis in Ogoniland.

Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was forced to stop exploration and leave Ogoniland in 1993, following an upheaval that caused the death of several Ogoni persons.The President of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, told The Guardian that the meeting proves the Federal Government cares nothing about the tragic experiences the Ogoni people have gone through, including the murder of Ken Saro- Wiwa and other prominent Ogoni activists.

“Government has not learnt anything. What this means is that it values oil more than the Ogoni people and their lives. They are yet to clean the environment and they are talking about the resumption of oil production. I don’t think they will have an environment conducive to oil exploration in Ogoni,” said Omare.

South-South Zonal Director, Civil Liberty Organisation, Steven Obodoekwe, said since government and the oil companies have not shown commitment to cleaning up the devastated Ogoni environment, their desperation to resume oil production therefore amounts to callousness and “fresh corporate terrorism.”

The ideal thing would have been for the government to ensure the environment is completely restored before contemplating renewed exploration in the area, stressed Obodoekwe.A Shell spokesman, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that though the company’s lease for Oil Mining Leases (OML11) has been renewed, it does not cover the over 30 Ogoni oilfields.He explained that contrary to the allegation that Shell wants to return to Ogoni through the backdoor, the company which was forced out of Ogoni in 1993 following an uprising does not intend to resume oil production. Shell’s leases for OML 11 was expected to expire by June 2019.

There has been growing tension in Ogoni since the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) wrote to Shell last year that it had given preliminary approval to a RoboMichael Limited which had expressed interest in obtaining licensing rights of Ogoni oilfields. It was learnt that Shell had already given its approval to RoboMichael.

The endorsement of RoboMichael Limited by NAPIMS and Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers respectively had caused MOSOP and other groups to allege that RoboMichael was Shell’s proxy, an allegation which the oil major has denied.

Amnesty International’s Business and Human Rights Researcher, Mark Dummett, regretted failure by the government and Shell to implement recommendations by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

“Following its groundbreaking survey of 2011, UNEP clearly laid out the path by which the environment of Ogoniland could be made free of the contamination that has devastated it for so long. The government has created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) to organise the cleanup, but little has so far been achieved, and there is no transparency over its plans,” Amnesty’s Rights researcher Dummett said.

MOSOP had told Kachikwu it was not opposed to discussions on the resumption of oil production, but that the consent of the people must first be obtained.It stated “unequivocally” that the contentious issue involves three main parties – the Federal Government, the oil industry led by Shell, and the Ogoni people. “Any attempt to deal with any aspect of the issue must necessarily involve the three principal actors, as stakeholders in a joint project of finding a lasting solution to the Ogoni crisis,” it said.

MOSOP, therefore, warned it would “resist the present attempt by the Federal Government and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria to arbitrarily award the Ogoni fields in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11 without consultation with the Ogoni community.”

The President of the movement, Legborsi Pyagbara, stressed that besides the environmental damage that attended Shell’s operations, Ogoni people are distressed about their lack of participation in the value chain of the oil industry, including employment; the absence of well-defined Community Benefit Sharing Agreements (CBAs); and a sustainable development process that recognises the rights of the people to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), in accordance with global best practices.

Pyagbara described attempts in the last few years to use money to “buy support” from the people as “condemnable” and “reprehensible”. Such move, he said, is “against the spirit of transparency and accountability required in the extractive sector.”He cautioned: “Societies the world over have met this challenge through deliberate and clear actions, and the Federal Government should urgently look in this direction. For, if the Nigerian government fails to protect the Ogoni people, it certainly cannot protect itself. History is replete with the ruins of societies that were built on the sort of injustices that have pervaded Ogoniland over the years.”

The MOSOP President urged the government to set up a better framework of engagement under which the parties involved would have a level-playing field for discussions on the future of oil production in Ogoniland.

According to him, Nigeria will be judged, not by its false claims about developments in Ogoniland, but by how it actually protects the weak, the vulnerable and those whose lives have been imperiled by reckless oil exploration of multinationals.Pyagbara disclosed that the Ogoni people, at the behest of MOSOP, have set up a strategic committee representing the various interests in Ogoni, headed by Prof. Ben Naanen, an economic historian and resource governance expert. This will develop a template to harmonise existing positions and guide the people in engagements with the Federal Government and the oil industry. Once the people adopt the template, Ogoniland will be ready for engagement and consultation on oil exploration, he said.

Meanwhile, youths in the Niger Delta have been urged to create an enabling business environment to attract investors to the region.SPDC’s General Manager, External Relations and Social Investment, Mr. Igo Weli, disclosed this while delivering a public lecture organised by the Rivers State University’s Centre of Excellence in Marine Engineering and Offshore Technology.

Speaking on the theme, ‘An enabling Business Environment – Implication for Future Careers in Oil and Gas Industry’, Weli noted that unlike in past years, many companies have left the region due to its unfriendly business atmosphere.He stressed the need for proper conflict management to reverse the situation.","Again, stakeholders warn FG, oil firms on crisis in Ogoni",https://guardian.ng/news/again-stakeholders-warn-fg-oil-firms-on-crisis-in-ogoni/
13,niger,"Niamey/Nairobi/Geneva, 17 April 2018 – The rising number of people fleeing conflict and the arrival of thousands of migrants are overwhelming public health facilities in Niger, putting scores of families at risk – including tens of thousands of malnourished children.

More than 400,000 people – including some 160,000 children suffering from malnutrition – are now in need of emergency health services in Niger’s Diffa region.

“Migrants living in Niger are very vulnerable and require a lot of support in many areas,” said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Regional Director for Africa at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) “Unfortunately, they arrive in poverty-stricken areas where communities lack almost everything; increasing the risk of tensions between local people and migrants. There is a need to strike a balance between providing humanitarian support to migrants and responding to the needs of local people who host migrants within their communities.”

Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. The Human Development Index ranks it 187th out of 188 countries. Over the last five years, the Diffa region in the West African country has experienced an unprecedented and complex humanitarian crisis. Compounding this poverty, and because of it, recurrent violence has uprooted hundreds of thousands of civilians. Many people have been forced to flee multiple times and have been left destitute, with few possessions and no means to sustain their lives and those of their families.

Niger’s humanitarian challenges are made worse because the country is part of a key migratory route for thousands of Africans who continue to make the perilous journey to reach Europe in hopes of a better life. The continued influx of migrants has put pressure on health facilities, reducing access to primary health care and referrals for both displaced and host populations.

In addition to hosting thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from neighbouring countries, there are locally displaced people in the country. The situation has further deteriorated because of recent droughts, that have caused food insecurity.

“Nutritional support, as well as health, water and sanitation services are the most urgent needs. Malnutrition in the Diffa region has reached serious emergency levels”, said Ali Bandiare, President of the Red Cross Society of Niger.

IFRC is appealing for 1.6 million Swiss francs to strengthen the Niger Red Cross’s humanitarian response to save lives and reduce the suffering of tens of thousands of people. The emergency appeal will allow Red Cross staff and volunteers to provide awareness sessions, malnutrition screening and referral, community-based disease surveillance, water and sanitation, as well as maternal and neonatal health services to more than 43,000 people (over 6,100 families) in three districts of the Diffa region.

14,niger,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

This report was jointly written by researchers from the Feinstein International Center and the Centre for Humanitarian Change in Nairobi.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies
15,niger,"Austin Avuru is the Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc. He spoke to journalists on the company’s corporate governance policy, vision and recent elevation by the Nigerian bourse. STANLEY OPARA was there

With oil prices looking up thus far this year and volumes stabilised, what should investors expect from Seplat by year end?

The culture is that as an oil and gas production company, we guide for production and we don’t guide for profit. The banks and other businesses can do that. By the time we publish our first quarter financial results, we will guide for the rest of 2018 in terms of production and so on.

What are the threats you foresee as a business?

For our operations in Nigeria, the biggest challenge is the impact any crisis in the Niger Delta could have on our production and evacuation of our products.

We saw 16 months of minimal production when the Trans-Forcados pipeline was down and how it impacted on us. That is our highest risk. We are hedging against that by having multiple avenues or routes for evacuation of our products.

We are working with neighbours and other stakeholders to put the escravos pipeline in place, to complete and commission it and we still have option in Warri refinery if we are pushed to the wall.

Here, we consciously established three options of evacuating our production. In the east of the country, we are trying to develop our OML 53 from the scratch. We would develop this along with two other options of evacuation. We try to build redundancy in evacuation to hedge against that risk.

Seplat is currently listed on the Nigerian and London stock exchanges and had recently made it to the elite board of the NSE. What is the company’s motivation?

Originally, we started as a growth company. We took over asset and we consciously work the asset and more than tripled production in about four years, from 18,000 barrels per day to 60,000bpd. Prices were good then until between mid-2015 and 2017.

Two things happened to us simultaneously; prices dropped and production crashed because of crisis outside our control and Trans-Forcados that led to dip in our production performance, revenue generation, productivity and profitability. In fact, in 2016 full year, we had a loss of about N166bn.

We only worked out through 2017 to turnaround the position to profitability.

Very germane to this rebound is our corporate governance stance. It is through this same corporate governance practice upon which we operate that we were able to navigate the company from the two years of treacherous condition outside our control.

We raised $350m bond just last month and $300m revolver credit. So, our overall average cost of debt has gone down by 300 per cent from our creditors. Our balance sheet is completely restructured.

Every time I talk about governance as a matter of a culture being imperative for us to deliver long term and sustainable good performance. We really do believe in it. It is not about priding ourselves as being in Premium Board of the NSE. When we say we are proud of ourselves because of what we really believe in to deliver the long term benefit to our stakeholders, we, indeed, mean it.

How did Seplat make it to the NSE’s Premium Board?

A number of factors were responsible. Starting with liquidity, you have to have free float of shares of over 20 per cent; but for us as a company our free float is closer to 50 per cent than 20 per cent already and with a company like this free float of shares can only increase.

You either tap from the market or you do a merger or whatever you can do in the future to dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and increase the free float. So, we are consciously working on that to increase the liquidity on the stock.

For market capitalisation, other than liquidity, two critical elements are size and governance, and size is about market capitalisation. So, if we continue to do the right things and for us internally, we believe that if you consciously and as a matter of culture continue to do the right things, even without prompting, ultimately you will see the benefits and the benefits will come in value creation and this will translate to increase in the value of the company.

So, all things being equal, except for things outside our control, we expect our market capitalisation to also continuously increase and not lower than where we are now.

When Seplat applied for listing on the NSE Premium Board, its market capitalisation was just over N200bn, but on the day of our elevation to the Premium Board, our market capitalisation was N396bn, and as at the end of trading on that day of our listing it went up to N404bn, and so it doubled the minimum requirement for qualifying to be listed on the Premium Board.

Thus, the most critical is governance. We have spent seven and half years building a company we believe in. If you make the best practice of corporate governance as a culture you will ultimately see the result; that is what you are seeing.

We are only four years old on the Exchange and we are already in the Premium Board. In fact, we are seven and half years as a company in operations and eight years as a registered company.

We started as a company on August 1, 2010. We are less than eight years old and we have come this far; this is not by chance, it has been a deliberate effort by the board and management team and how to create this governance culture. So what you saw today (during listing) is an attestation of the result of what we have been doing in the past seven and half years and still counting.

What does this elite board listing mean to Seplat, its shareholders and other stakeholders?

For us, it is a very important milestone in taking a very long term view in our strategic vision. From the outset, we knew that Seplat was going to aim very high and we are very clear in our mind that corporate governance is the base. So, we continuously make sure that best practices are in core of our business.

We are very happy that having gone through that scrutiny when we did our listing on the London Stock Exchange and NSE, we were sure that corporate governance, very high level best practices scrutiny was important and that is what our recent elevation has indeed eloquently testified to.

The message obviously for all the investors is that it is a clear message that they are with the right company. The next point is that it is going to create the ability for many of our investors to see more liquidity happening in their securities. It is also going to mean that the securities they hold have value at the highest echelon or segment of the capital market.

What is the company’s production target for 2018?

We will be providing the guide for our production in 2018 as soon as our Q1 financial results are released.

Following the company’s recent bond issuance, what possible investments will the company be making?

For the bond, we have two tranches of debts – $700m from Nigerian banks and $300m from foreign banks and both debts were $1bn. By the end of 2017, we had paid off about $400m in capital repayment and not just interest.

So, both debts combined, we are down to $650m, but we also have cash in hand. Our gross debt consists of $350m of bond and $200m that we withdrew out of the $300m revolver. We also have cash in hand of about $350m. Really, our net debt is down to under $200m /$250m.

All of that translate to the fact that our balance sheet has been restructured from a very difficult situation. So two things will happen or two things can be enabled: we can invest more money in the business since in two years, between 2015 and 2017, we had not drilled anywhere.

So, we are going back to drilling and invest more on our gas business. We have cash to invest and that is one key result of this exercise of borrowing. Secondly, we will be in a good position if we see opportunity for any acquisition we will be in a good position to participate.

Where we are today is a far cry from where we were two years ago. We were first struggling to survive following the crisis in the Niger Delta. Now we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow.

How are you going to sustain this transparency culture?

Certainly, our intention is to sustain and even surpass our present performance. It takes a lot of discipline and effort to be where we are. People talk about reporting, transparency, and discipline; it looks that simple. You have to do the right things to be proud to disclose what you are doing. If you are cutting corners even before disclosure you won’t get there.

For our esteemed investors, what we said to investors when we were doing our road show for the bond is to reinstate dividend. Our intention is to reinstate dividend as a matter of policy. We suspended dividend in 2016 because of crises beyond our control, which means, any year we fail to pay dividend it will as a result of force majeure. But in a normal course of business we will normally be able to pay a certain level of dividend to our shareholders.

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.
