YAOUNDE, Cameroon, April 10, 2018/APO Group/ –On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

Nearly a decade after Boko Haram commenced its insurgency activities in North-East, the crisis has taken a regional dimension leaving millions displaced, billions worth in damages to property across the region.



Reuters reported within the week that insurgents were holding territories while also taking taxes in the Lake Chad region.



This has prompted international calls for addressing the crisis using a regional approach.



Following the visit by the UN Security Council in March 2017, Resolution 2349 on Boko Haram and Lake Chad was adopted.

The Resolution called upon Governments in the region to address the root-causes of the crisis.

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.

5,niger,"Amid questions over the role of the U.S. military in this part of the world, there is a renewed focus on training local law enforcement officers in the hopes that extremism can be better countered at the community level and along borders. The challenges are great in Niger, where residents of its vast, largely ungoverned spaces say they are losing confidence in authorities.

The police training in one of Africa’s most remote, impoverished countries is crucial as extremists linked to Daesh and Al Qaeda carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa’s vast Sahel region. In October, four U.S. soldiers and five Nigeriens were killed in an ambush claimed by Islamic State group-linked fighters in rural Niger.

NIAMEY, Niger—Under the watchful eyes of U.S. authorities, an elite group of local police officers in Niger’s capital slipped into a home, rescued a “hostage,” detained an “extremist” and pretended to kill another.

As extremism grows “it’s important not to lose sight of the issues at the core of their proliferation and recruitment success, notably bad and often abusive governance,” said Corinne Dufka, Human Rights Watch’s West Africa director. “The Islamist groups are cleverly exploiting local grievances to make inroads with local populations.”

That includes abusive practices by local security forces, she said, calling efforts to professionalize them key.

The U.S. ambassador to Niger, Eric P. Whitaker, said the U.S. is addressing the “factors that create an environment for extremism” by investing more than $500 million (U.S.) over the next few years into local programs for better governance, education, health, agriculture, security and more.

The State Department’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program also is addressing such concerns by training local security forces in everything from border control and investigations to human rights and justice.

After an attack killed 20 people at a luxury hotel in Mali’s capital in November 2015, the U.S. invested $15 million in training nearly 100 local police in crisis response. They also were given the necessary equipment to respond to further attacks, according to Samuel L. Pineda, director in the office of programs with the department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism.

The program has paid off, he said. Several of the trained officers responded during the March 2016 attack on the European Union military training mission’s headquarters in Bamako. And during the June 2017 attack on a resort popular with foreigners outside the capital they helped to kill attackers and rescue victims.

“We want to create transparent forces and we want the people to trust those forces,” Pineda said. “Nobody wants their local market blown up … so if they have the trust of the population, the information comes back in.”

In 2018, the Bureau of Counterterrorism will invest an estimated $106 million in sub-Saharan Africa.

About $50 million of that is dedicated to State Department counterterrorism programs in West and Central Africa, including ones in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Mauritania.

The crisis response program in Mali eventually will be replicated in Niger, where the Antiterrorism Assistance Program has dedicated roughly $10 million to training and equipment this year.

During the U.S. military’s annual Flintlock counterterrorism exercises this month in Niger, local officers put their training to the test, collaborating with Niger’s gendarmerie and military as well as security forces from other West African nations.

The officers who participated in the raid in the capital, Niamey, are part of the Special Program for Embassy Augmentation and Response, known as SPEAR, which was created after the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to train and equip host-nation police units designated as first responders to U.S. diplomatic facilities in crisis. They also can respond to other attacks.

“We train them for an eventuality,” said Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Kent Miller, who manages the Antiterrorism Assistance Program in Niger. “In the current year and last year there has been a focus on rural environments.”

The goal is to disrupt extremists at borders so they don’t make it into more populated areas, he said.

In cities, the hope is that crisis response units and SPEAR officers will respond. They are provided with arms, ammunition, equipment, facilities for practicing raids, a gun range and mentorship.

“The importance of training is that it puts the elements of knowledge for reaction in our hands, and we can then apply them in real-world situations,” said Djibril Ousmane, an assistant police commander in the capital.

The challenge, however, is that extremists also are giving money to communities to win them over, he said.

“It’s difficult to fight poverty,” Ousmane said. “With the right means, more can be done.”","U.S. includes local police in counterterror fight in Niger, across Africa",https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/04/28/us-includes-local-police-in-counterterror-fight-in-niger-across-africa.html

7,niger,"0 Pentagon to unveil probe into Niger ambush that killed 4

- The Pentagon on Thursday will release the final report on the Niger attack that killed four Americans last October, concluding that the Army Special Forces team did not get required command approval for the initial risky mission to go after a high-level insurgent linked to the Islamic State group.

Defense officials said they will lay out how the mission unfolded, leading to the gruesome ambush, and then explain what is being done to correct the problems brought to light by the incident. Families of the fallen troops have been briefed on the investigation, including details of their loved ones' final moments as they battled as many as 100 insurgents in a fierce firefight.

""The whole thing was a screwed-up mess,"" said Arnold Wright, father of Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright of Lyons, Georgia, who was killed in the attack. He said he's concerned that the Army may be pinning the blame on lower-ranking soldiers and not accepting responsibility high enough up the chain of command.

The briefing, he said, gave the impression ""that the captain, the team leader, that he mischaracterized the mission"" as one to reach out to local leaders rather than a mission to target the insurgent.

The Associated Press reported in early March that the team received information about the location of Doundou Chefou, who was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping an American aid worker, and acted on what they considered was a fleeting chance to get him. But the team did not disclose that mission to higher-level commanders, and instead outlined a lower-risk mission to meet with tribal leaders, U.S. officials told the AP. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation ahead of its release.

The report is expected to detail missteps in the mission's approval process and whether that contributed at all to the ambush that erupted many hours later. Its findings will put renewed focus on U.S. military activity in Africa, particularly the role of special operations forces who've been advising and working with local troops on the continent for years. Extremists linked to IS and al-Qaida carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa's vast Sahel region.

The investigation was led by U.S. Africa Command's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Roger Cloutier Jr. Officials spent months trying to unravel the complex incident, conducting dozens of interviews across the U.S., Europe and Africa.

The Pentagon will also unveil recommended changes, including greater oversight to ensure proper mission approval and risk assessment, as well as improved security measures, more heavily armored vehicles, and better weapons and training, U.S. officials said.

Killed in the attack were: Army Sgt. La David T. Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida; Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia. Four Nigerien troops were killed and two American soldiers and eight Nigerien forces were wounded.

Officials have said the investigation doesn't draw a direct link between the team's failure to get appropriate approval of the initial kill or capture mission and the attack that came much later, once commanders had approved other changes to the mission. The team was called off before they got to the location where Chefou was believed to be, because he had left. The troops, however, were later sent to collect intelligence at a location where Chefou had been, and then they stopped at the village of Tongo Tongo for supplies before heading back to their base.

""They had a mission to go to a location that was like four hours away and they went on that mission and the target was gone,"" Wright told the AP in an interview, recounting what Cloutier told him. ""They started back and they got like two hours or so from their home base and they got a change of mission to go to another location back north like four hours away to act as a blocking force for another team was coming in with helicopters to hit the target.""

Bad weather forced the helicopters to abort, Wright said, and his son's team went on to the site, where they destroyed motorcycles, ammunition and other equipment before heading to Tongo Tongo.

After leaving the village, they were ambushed about 120 miles (200 kilometers) north of Niamey, Niger's capital, by as many as 100 Islamic State-linked militants carrying small arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

Wright, an Army veteran, said he was told the troops tried to stand and fight, leaving their vehicles so they could use them for cover. But as fighting intensified and more enemy fighters came, the American-led team decided to flee, using smoke for cover.

The two U.S. trucks with machine guns went first, Wright said, leaving behind the truck his son Dustin was driving that had no mounted gun. As his son tried to get away, Wright said Staff Sgt. Black was firing from the front passenger seat and Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson was shooting from the back of the truck. Then Black got shot.

""So Dustin stops the vehicle, runs around and grabs Bryan Black by collar and pulls him behind the vehicle,"" Wright said.

As Johnson tried to help Black, Dustin Wright fired across the hood of the truck. Wright said Black died and the vehicle was disabled, so his son and Johnson fled on foot. Johnson was shot and Dustin Wright got hit after running back to help Johnson. Both died.

La David Johnson became separated from the others as he fought and ran for cover in the brush. He was gunned down, but his body wasn't found until two days later.

The battle, said Arnold Wright, lasted 40 minutes or more.

8,niger,"Niamey/Nairobi/Geneva, 17 April 2018 – The rising number of people fleeing conflict and the arrival of thousands of migrants are overwhelming public health facilities in Niger, putting scores of families at risk – including tens of thousands of malnourished children.

More than 400,000 people – including some 160,000 children suffering from malnutrition – are now in need of emergency health services in Niger’s Diffa region.

“Migrants living in Niger are very vulnerable and require a lot of support in many areas,” said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Regional Director for Africa at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) “Unfortunately, they arrive in poverty-stricken areas where communities lack almost everything; increasing the risk of tensions between local people and migrants. There is a need to strike a balance between providing humanitarian support to migrants and responding to the needs of local people who host migrants within their communities.”

Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. The Human Development Index ranks it 187th out of 188 countries. Over the last five years, the Diffa region in the West African country has experienced an unprecedented and complex humanitarian crisis. Compounding this poverty, and because of it, recurrent violence has uprooted hundreds of thousands of civilians. Many people have been forced to flee multiple times and have been left destitute, with few possessions and no means to sustain their lives and those of their families.

Niger’s humanitarian challenges are made worse because the country is part of a key migratory route for thousands of Africans who continue to make the perilous journey to reach Europe in hopes of a better life. The continued influx of migrants has put pressure on health facilities, reducing access to primary health care and referrals for both displaced and host populations.

In addition to hosting thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from neighbouring countries, there are locally displaced people in the country. The situation has further deteriorated because of recent droughts, that have caused food insecurity.

“Nutritional support, as well as health, water and sanitation services are the most urgent needs. Malnutrition in the Diffa region has reached serious emergency levels”, said Ali Bandiare, President of the Red Cross Society of Niger.

IFRC is appealing for 1.6 million Swiss francs to strengthen the Niger Red Cross’s humanitarian response to save lives and reduce the suffering of tens of thousands of people. The emergency appeal will allow Red Cross staff and volunteers to provide awareness sessions, malnutrition screening and referral, community-based disease surveillance, water and sanitation, as well as maternal and neonatal health services to more than 43,000 people (over 6,100 families) in three districts of the Diffa region.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

According to the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2.3 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in Niger. The needs analysis shows the persistence of five major crises affecting the country: food insecurity (1.4 million people estimated in need), malnutrition (1.7 million people), epidemics (1,170,000 people), floods (170,000 people) and population movements due to conflict or migration (392,305 people).

The deterioration of the security situation in the districts bordering Mali caused the activation of the Intercluster contingency plan. Out of the 84,000-people estimated in the plan, over 40,000 were considered to be at risk of displacements due to threats of attacks and / or military operations. In January,the first 75 displaced families (506 people) arrived in Tiloa, Tillabery region. The protection cluster alerted on the risk of similar displacement for over 40,000 people.

In February, the Diffa region received the joint mission of the Humanitarian Coordinator, high Representative of the government, humanitarian country team members and donors. One of the keys discussion points focused on the nexus humanitarian and development.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

13,niger,"Members of Congress are expected to be briefed on the full report of the investigation into the deaths of four soldiers in Niger last year. The soldiers were part of special forces in that country when they came under attack by terrorist forces.

Congressman Steve Russell, R-Oklahoma, himself a combat veteran has reviewed the report that will be made public, as well as the 6,000 pages of classified material accompany the report. Representative Russell told FOX 25 the report backs up what he found in his own investigation.





Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, and Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, and Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, died as a result of an ambush attack in the remote village of Tongo Tongo in Niger on October 4, 2017.

In February, Russell traveled to Niger and met with U.S. forces and local military leaders in the wake of the attack that killed four soldiers.

“I have read the classified report; it did not change my conclusions about the outcome,” Russell told FOX 25. The congressman said he believes the decisions made by the unit would not have changed the tragic outcome. However, the report does include some decisions Russell said that were made up the chain of command that could have been better. Though Russell still believes even improved times for support would not have changed the outcome.

“What you did not see in my investigation,” Russell said, “Was anything other than absolute sacrificial bravery.”

Critics of the administration and the military’s handling of the situation have said the mission was unprepared and a combination of bad choices and bad luck led to the deaths of the soldiers.

“I don't understand why members of Congress, and I suffered this while I was a soldier on battlefield, wondering how people in Washington could make their mouths say something so stupid sometimes when it comes to military operations,” Russell said.

Using his experience as a commander in battle, Russell said the report and his own ground investigation back up that the unit operating in Niger did act appropriately. He still believes some in Congress will not understand the realities of military operations.

“We'll point bony fingers and pound fists on tables and going how did you let this happen military?” Russell explained, “Failing to understand that sometimes a clever enemy gets a vote and sometimes you can surprise people in ambushes and sometimes people die.”

“The untold story here is they weren't all wiped out even though they were small in number,” Russell said. “They didn't give up and continued to fight.”

Russell said that was also true of the Niger soldiers who had been trained and were along on the mission.

The attack marked the first time the United States has lost military personnel in Niger. Critics of the expanded use of the nation’s military in countries around the world should not be a priority.

“I don't want to live in an America that is no longer a force for good,” Russell said in defense of U.S. operations abroad. “I mean if we are so selfish that we just sit here and say everybody else can go die and wither away...that's not a country we've ever been and I'm not sure it's one we want to become.”

Russell said critics of the military’s presence in countries like Niger fail to take into account the big picture. As terrorists lose their traditional strongholds they have been moving into Africa and threaten to destabilize nations that have long been peaceful.

“If we disengage it doesn't improve it actually gets worse,” Russell said. “In Africa what has made it more risky is frail economies. If they fail, then you've got disease, you've got famine and you've got refugee crisis; you've got human suffering on a by the millions scale.”",Report on ambush attack in Niger confirms Oklahoma Congressman's investigation,http://okcfox.com/news/connect-to-congress/report-on-ambush-attack-in-niger-confirms-oklahoma-congressmans-investigation
14,niger,"""According to the Grand Bargain commitments, there is a need for more direct support and funding to local and national responders. Through this project, we will strengthen civil society organisations' capacity to respond professionally to humanitarian crises, and better help people affected,"" says Felix Muhigana, NORCAP Project Manager.

Close to 17 million people are affected by the humanitarian emergency across the four Lake Chad basin countries; Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. The crisis is characterised as one of the world's most severe. More than 2.3 million people are displaced, and communities are suffering from violence, food insecurity and malnutrition.

""Unchartered terrain""

Four NORCAP experts are already on their way to Niger and Chad. They are hosted by World Food Programme and UNICEF, but will work independently from their host agencies.

""We are very excited to do a completely new project. This is unchartered terrain for us, and for NORCAP"", says Slim Florian Bacha, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and deployee to UNICEF in N'Djamena, Chad.

According to Muhigana, the deployees will map and identify those civil society organisations that are most in need of capacity building and help them develop skills and expertise in areas such as financial management, organisational development and monitoring and evaluation.

""This is the kind of expertise that the organisations said they needed the most. In addition, deployees will link up with existing donors in Chad and Niger, to advocate and enable organisations to get direct access to donors and funds. With a better knowledge of how these things work, they will be able to better serve people in need, says Felix Muhigana.

""This project has a lot of potential, because we are able to set an example of how this can and should be done. At the same time, it is a huge responsibility. We will communicate closely across the region and with our Project manager, to make sure we get off to a good start"", explains Karolina Olofsson, Organisational Development Coordination Expert. She is going to work from Diffa, in Niger, with WFP.

Stepping stone for the future

NORCAP's collaboration with the Civil Society Network begun with the Lake Chad Donor Conference in Oslo, February 2017. The conference raised awareness about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin, aiming to ensure donors pledged money and commitment to scale up humanitarian interventions and alleviate human suffering.

During the conference, the Civil Society Network, an organisation with representatives from the Lake Chad Basin countries, approached NORCAP for a possible partnership. NORCAP did a scoping mission to Chad and Niger, which in turn secured funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""This project is very different from what we've done before, but it speaks to NORCAP's strategic commitments. During the project's pilot phase, we will actively explore additional partnerships to further develop local capacity in the Lake Chad basin, including with relevant donors,"" says Ulf Flink, Head of the NORCAP Unit in NORCAP.",Empowering the first responders,https://www.nrc.no/expert-deployment/2016/2018/empowering-the-first-responders2/
15,niger,"Austin Avuru is the Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc. He spoke to journalists on the company’s corporate governance policy, vision and recent elevation by the Nigerian bourse. STANLEY OPARA was there

With oil prices looking up thus far this year and volumes stabilised, what should investors expect from Seplat by year end?

The culture is that as an oil and gas production company, we guide for production and we don’t guide for profit. The banks and other businesses can do that. By the time we publish our first quarter financial results, we will guide for the rest of 2018 in terms of production and so on.

What are the threats you foresee as a business?

For our operations in Nigeria, the biggest challenge is the impact any crisis in the Niger Delta could have on our production and evacuation of our products.

We saw 16 months of minimal production when the Trans-Forcados pipeline was down and how it impacted on us. That is our highest risk. We are hedging against that by having multiple avenues or routes for evacuation of our products.

We are working with neighbours and other stakeholders to put the escravos pipeline in place, to complete and commission it and we still have option in Warri refinery if we are pushed to the wall.

Here, we consciously established three options of evacuating our production. In the east of the country, we are trying to develop our OML 53 from the scratch. We would develop this along with two other options of evacuation. We try to build redundancy in evacuation to hedge against that risk.

Seplat is currently listed on the Nigerian and London stock exchanges and had recently made it to the elite board of the NSE. What is the company’s motivation?

Originally, we started as a growth company. We took over asset and we consciously work the asset and more than tripled production in about four years, from 18,000 barrels per day to 60,000bpd. Prices were good then until between mid-2015 and 2017.

Two things happened to us simultaneously; prices dropped and production crashed because of crisis outside our control and Trans-Forcados that led to dip in our production performance, revenue generation, productivity and profitability. In fact, in 2016 full year, we had a loss of about N166bn.

We only worked out through 2017 to turnaround the position to profitability.

Very germane to this rebound is our corporate governance stance. It is through this same corporate governance practice upon which we operate that we were able to navigate the company from the two years of treacherous condition outside our control.

We raised $350m bond just last month and $300m revolver credit. So, our overall average cost of debt has gone down by 300 per cent from our creditors. Our balance sheet is completely restructured.

Every time I talk about governance as a matter of a culture being imperative for us to deliver long term and sustainable good performance. We really do believe in it. It is not about priding ourselves as being in Premium Board of the NSE. When we say we are proud of ourselves because of what we really believe in to deliver the long term benefit to our stakeholders, we, indeed, mean it.

How did Seplat make it to the NSE’s Premium Board?

A number of factors were responsible. Starting with liquidity, you have to have free float of shares of over 20 per cent; but for us as a company our free float is closer to 50 per cent than 20 per cent already and with a company like this free float of shares can only increase.

You either tap from the market or you do a merger or whatever you can do in the future to dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and increase the free float. So, we are consciously working on that to increase the liquidity on the stock.

For market capitalisation, other than liquidity, two critical elements are size and governance, and size is about market capitalisation. So, if we continue to do the right things and for us internally, we believe that if you consciously and as a matter of culture continue to do the right things, even without prompting, ultimately you will see the benefits and the benefits will come in value creation and this will translate to increase in the value of the company.

So, all things being equal, except for things outside our control, we expect our market capitalisation to also continuously increase and not lower than where we are now.

When Seplat applied for listing on the NSE Premium Board, its market capitalisation was just over N200bn, but on the day of our elevation to the Premium Board, our market capitalisation was N396bn, and as at the end of trading on that day of our listing it went up to N404bn, and so it doubled the minimum requirement for qualifying to be listed on the Premium Board.

Thus, the most critical is governance. We have spent seven and half years building a company we believe in. If you make the best practice of corporate governance as a culture you will ultimately see the result; that is what you are seeing.

We are only four years old on the Exchange and we are already in the Premium Board. In fact, we are seven and half years as a company in operations and eight years as a registered company.

We started as a company on August 1, 2010. We are less than eight years old and we have come this far; this is not by chance, it has been a deliberate effort by the board and management team and how to create this governance culture. So what you saw today (during listing) is an attestation of the result of what we have been doing in the past seven and half years and still counting.

What does this elite board listing mean to Seplat, its shareholders and other stakeholders?

For us, it is a very important milestone in taking a very long term view in our strategic vision. From the outset, we knew that Seplat was going to aim very high and we are very clear in our mind that corporate governance is the base. So, we continuously make sure that best practices are in core of our business.

We are very happy that having gone through that scrutiny when we did our listing on the London Stock Exchange and NSE, we were sure that corporate governance, very high level best practices scrutiny was important and that is what our recent elevation has indeed eloquently testified to.

The message obviously for all the investors is that it is a clear message that they are with the right company. The next point is that it is going to create the ability for many of our investors to see more liquidity happening in their securities. It is also going to mean that the securities they hold have value at the highest echelon or segment of the capital market.

What is the company’s production target for 2018?

We will be providing the guide for our production in 2018 as soon as our Q1 financial results are released.

Following the company’s recent bond issuance, what possible investments will the company be making?

For the bond, we have two tranches of debts – $700m from Nigerian banks and $300m from foreign banks and both debts were $1bn. By the end of 2017, we had paid off about $400m in capital repayment and not just interest.

So, both debts combined, we are down to $650m, but we also have cash in hand. Our gross debt consists of $350m of bond and $200m that we withdrew out of the $300m revolver. We also have cash in hand of about $350m. Really, our net debt is down to under $200m /$250m.

All of that translate to the fact that our balance sheet has been restructured from a very difficult situation. So two things will happen or two things can be enabled: we can invest more money in the business since in two years, between 2015 and 2017, we had not drilled anywhere.

So, we are going back to drilling and invest more on our gas business. We have cash to invest and that is one key result of this exercise of borrowing. Secondly, we will be in a good position if we see opportunity for any acquisition we will be in a good position to participate.

Where we are today is a far cry from where we were two years ago. We were first struggling to survive following the crisis in the Niger Delta. Now we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow.

How are you going to sustain this transparency culture?

Certainly, our intention is to sustain and even surpass our present performance. It takes a lot of discipline and effort to be where we are. People talk about reporting, transparency, and discipline; it looks that simple. You have to do the right things to be proud to disclose what you are doing. If you are cutting corners even before disclosure you won’t get there.

For our esteemed investors, what we said to investors when we were doing our road show for the bond is to reinstate dividend. Our intention is to reinstate dividend as a matter of policy. We suspended dividend in 2016 because of crises beyond our control, which means, any year we fail to pay dividend it will as a result of force majeure. But in a normal course of business we will normally be able to pay a certain level of dividend to our shareholders.

16,niger,"Special envoy to the UN secretary general for West Africa and the Sahel Muhammad Ibn Chambas says that Boko Haram has proven to be a resilient group that will take time to totally eliminate, even despite the military successes scored against the group.

His remarks come at a time the Nigerian government and military is insisting that the war against Boko Haram is over, despite a recent spate of attacks by the extremists.

Chambas was speaking on the sidelines of a Lake Chad regional summit in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and birthplace of Boko Haram.

“What we are seeing is that Boko Haram has become part of an international terrorism network,” he said.

Governors from four countries straddling the lake – Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon – are meeting for two days to discuss regional cooperation on stabilisation, peace building and sustainable development in the area, according an AFP report.

On 1 May, at least 86 people were killed in twin suicide attacks targetting a mosque and a nearby market in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state.

Chambas said that the Islamist insurgents were likely still holding on to territory in the region.

“It is relative,” he said in response to reports that Boko Haram was holding territory in the northeast states of Yobe and Borno.

The Islamist insurgency has killed at least 20,000 people in nine years of violence that has spilled from northeast Nigeria into Niger, Chad and Cameroon, creating a dire humanitarian crisis.

The four countries formed the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to fight the Islamic extremists who criss-cross the porous borders in the remote region.

Chambas commended the MNJTF counter terrorism fight as “appreciably successful” but warned it was far from over.

“We of course ask that the MNJTF remains vigilant in its fight against Boko Haram, we cannot take it for granted and assume they have been totally defeated”.

In December 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari declared Boko Haram had been “technically defeated” after reclaiming swathes of territory back from the jihadists.",Boko Haram will take years to 'eliminate': UN envoy,http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/09/boko-haram-will-take-years-to-eliminate-un-envoy/
