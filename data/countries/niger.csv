0,niger,"The FMDQ OTC Securities and Exchange listed the first Federal Government’s N100 billion Sovereign Sukuk bond for tackling infrastructure development on its platform.

The Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms Patience Oniha, who disclosed this in Lagos, said the seven-year bond at 16.47 per cent due by 2024, was packaged on behalf of the government by DMO and the Ministry of Finance.

Oniha said the bond was issued to develop and enhance quality of life and business activities in the country.

She said: “The DMO, in pursuit of its objectives to diversify the sources of government funding and deepen the domestic capital market, successfully issued the debut N100 billion seven-year Sovereign Sukuk on September 26, 2017.’’

According to her, the proceeds of the issuance of the Sukuk would be used to construct and rehabilitate some roads across the six geopolitical zones of the country.

She said the purpose of the Sukuk was to integrate ethical investors into the domestic securities market, adding that the bond was floated to establish a benchmark for pricing of Sukuk by other domestic issuers and offer investors the opportunity to earn returns, while contributing to infrastructure development of the country.

Oniha said the proceeds were being deployed for the construction and rehabilitation of 25 key economic roads projects across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones.

“The listing of the sovereign Sukuk on FMDQ will provide investors with the much needed transparent and efficient platform for price determination and liquidity,” she said.

Oniha said that people that invested in the bond invested for the future, stressing that the bond was initiated to boost the financial inclusion programme of the government to reach out to the unbanked people.

She, however, assured all parties that the funds would be utilised judiciously.

DMO has commenced inspection of the various projects earmarked for the fund.

The Senior Vice President, Economic Development Division, FMDQ, Mr. Emmanuel Etaderhi, congratulated the issuer and co-sponsors to the issue, stating that the issuance would further deepen the domestic debt capital market.

Etaderhi said the issue would increase the range of investible debt securities in the markets, invariably contributing to the development of the nation.

According to him, the listing of the Sukuk on FMDQ will rightly position the nation to continue to maximise its potential via the Nigerian DCM. He reiterated the commitment of the OTC Exchange to continue to support the initiatives of the DMO towards the development of a highly liquid, deep and well-developed DCM in Nigeria.

On his part, the Managing Director, FBNQuest Merchant Bank, Mr. Kayode Akinkugbe, said the company was happy to be associated with the bond.

“We are pleased to have advised the FGN on its N100 billion debut Sukuk issuance.

“And despite the fairly volatile market conditions, we leveraged FBNQuest Merchant Bank’s superb distribution platform to successfully distribute about 65 per cent of the offer,’’ Akinkugbe said.

He said the issuance was the first attempt by the Federal Government to raise funds through non-interest instrument in the capital market for infrastructure development.

This is also expected to deepen the Nigerian capital markets and diversify the government funding sources.

The Associate Executive Director, Capital Markets, FMDQ, Ms Tumi Sekoni, commended the issuer for achieving the milestone.

“This is another highly laudable step by the Sovereign, through the DMO toward supporting the growth and development of the nation’s DCM.’’

She explained that the issuance would pave the way and encourage non-sovereign issuers to explore the issuance of non-interest-bearing securities, thereby adding to the depth and breadth of the domestic capital markets.

According to her, the listing of the pioneer sovereign Sukuk on FMDQ would serve as a benchmark for the pricing of subsequent Sukuk issuances.

The Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE in a combined operation with the Nigerian Air Force on April 8, launched a coordinated air strike on Boko Haram terrorists in Borno.

AVM Olatokunbo Adesanya, Nigeria Air Force (NAF) Director of Public Relations and Information, confirmed this in a statement issued on Tuesday in Abuja.

He said that the air strikes were carried out at Arege and Tumbun Rago in Borno where the Boko Haram terrorists were hiding.

“The successful attacks followed reports received sequel to an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission conducted by an aircraft belonging to Nigerien Air Force, which revealed Boko Haram terrorists activities at Arege and Tumbun Rago.

” Consequently, the ATF detailed Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet and F-7Ni aircraft to conduct air interdiction strikes on the locations, while the ISR aircraft from Niger provided necessary support and also conducted Battle Damage Assessment (BDA),” he said.

Adesanya said that the subsequent BDA revealed that during the first wave of attacks at Arege, several vehicles belonging to Boko Haram terrorists were totally destroyed, killing all the occupants in the process.

He said that the NAF fighter aircraft neutralised fleeing Boko Haram terrorists in subsequent waves of attack.

“Thereafter, NAF fighter aircraft and the ISR aircraft from Niger again combined to successfully attack Boko Haram terrorists locations at Tumbum Rago.

“The combined operations by the air forces of both countries are part of renewed efforts at clearing Boko Haram elements from their known locations in North-East Nigeria,” the spokesman said.","Nigeria,Niger air force launch air strike Boko Haram terrorist",http://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigeria-niger-air-force-launch-air-strike-boko-haram-terrorist-id8233291.html
2,niger,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents arrived in the northeastern Nigerian town of Rann on March 1. Ignoring the camp for 55,000 people displaced by the region’s conflict, they stormed the nearby military base.

Inside, the gunmen executed eight security personnel and three aid staff working for the United Nations, according to security sources and photos seen by Reuters.

It was the first publicly-acknowledged killing of aid staff by Boko Haram insurgents, but for humanitarians struggling to reach millions of people in need of aid it was a realization of a long-held fear and another setback for a crisis response that has been criticized for being too slow.

Given the precarious situation in the region bordering Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the aid workers in many areas use military escorts and stay on or by bases.

For years, some aid workers had objected to such practices, saying they undermined humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and put staff at risk.

“We are caught in a situation where humanitarian aid is part of a larger security and political agenda and that challenges the delivery of aid according to humanitarian principles,” said Hugues Robert, program manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Nigeria.

Zainab Ahmed, the Nigerian minister of state for budget and national planning who is responsible for coordinating the government relief efforts, did not respond to a request for comment about the attack on Rann.

The United Nations, which describes the situation as one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, said in February that 7.7 million people in the three most affected states depended on aid for survival.

Since Boko Haram first launched attacks in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, over 4,000 abducted and 1.6 million were still displaced in Nigeria at the end of 2017, according to the United Nations. (tmsnrt.rs/2CsEQGH)

WAR CRIME

While attacks on aid workers constitute a war crime, the perceived politicization and militarization of aid in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria has led to a growing number of attacks on humanitarian staff in war zones.

In Nigeria, even though the army launched an offensive against Boko Haram in 2015 with the help of forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, much of the northeast outside cities such as Borno state capital Maiduguri remains a no-go zone. (tmsnrt.rs/2DjT88r)

“International humanitarian law is designed to prevent incidents like the Rann attack. By militarizing humanitarian sites - yet failing to protect them - the Nigerian military is putting vulnerable civilians in harm’s way,” said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House’s Africa Programme.

“Worried that the Nigerian government could obstruct their work, international entities have turned a blind eye to the militarization of internally displaced persons’ camps and official corruption in the humanitarian space that puts civilians at even greater risk,” he said.

The Nigerian military did not respond to request for comment.

In the wake of the Rann attack, some humanitarian groups are pushing for a reassessment of relations with the military, particularly the U.N.’s, according to people familiar with the discussions this month.

“There were definitely questions being asked,” said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president at InterAction, an alliance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world.

“There was a feeling, from some NGOs that I spoke with but also some U.N. actors, that we kind of just went along with what the government was proposing,” said McIlreavy, one of the authors of a U.N. report about the crisis response.

Asked whether working in close proximity with the military put aid staff at risk, a U.N. spokeswoman said the international community in Nigeria upheld the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity.

“In the context of northeast Nigeria, military escorts are used as a last resort, in areas where security risks are very high,” she said.

SLOW RESPONSE

Aid agencies have now pulled out of Rann, leaving tens of thousands uprooted by the fighting living again in parlous conditions with little or no international humanitarian support.

Problems with the response to the crisis, including how closely humanitarians were working with the military, had been identified long before the attack.

As early as 2013, there were warnings of a food crisis in the region, from the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and others. In 2015, the United Nations and other NGOs said more than 50,000 people faced famine.

Yet, for many, the crisis response only really began in June 2016 after MSF visited Bama town and discovered 24,000 people, including 4,500 children under five, living in catastrophic conditions which the agency said were “beyond critical”.

Near the camp MSF found a field of evenly-spaced indentations in the earth, marked only by the occasional scrap of metal: 1,233 graves, 480 for children.

When MSF’s news of Bama spread, Nigeria declared a “nutrition emergency” in Borno state and U.N. agencies started to ramp up the humanitarian response.

Disputes within the United Nations and aid groups, tense relations with the government and a slow response both internationally and by Nigerian politicians over the preceding years had all helped make a desperate situation catastrophic, said aid workers, diplomats, politicians and security personnel.

“We all recognize that the international response here was in general very slow at the beginning,” said Peter Lundberg, who was head of the U.N.’s response in the northeast until December.

Many of the people involved with the crisis response interviewed by Reuters said Nigeria had been reluctant to accept food aid over concern it would harm the image of the country, the biggest economy in Africa. They also said some international groups held back from speaking out about the crisis for fear it would damage their relations with Abuja.

“To be fair to the international community, I think that there was also from the government side a reluctance to perhaps fully acknowledge not only that it was a conflict but it was actually turning into a humanitarian crisis. And unfortunately that’s not uncommon,” Lundberg told Reuters in November.

In 2016, MSF said it had been raising the alarm with U.N. agencies for two years but they had failed to respond.

A spokesman for WFP said it could only operate in a country at the request of the government and in Nigeria that didn’t happen until March 2016.

He said WFP’s response was one of its “most significant and swift expansions ever”, adding that it planned to deliver aid to 1.5 million people a month by June, from 1 million now.

‘TOXIC NARRATIVE’

Despite a massive increase in budgets and humanitarian staff working in the region over the past two years, the response was still wracked with problems holding back aid as recently as June, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters.

It described a “toxic narrative” between the Nigerian government and the humanitarian community, an “us and them” divide between the United Nations and other NGOs and a relief effort that failed to adhere to international humanitarian law.

The report also warned that the Nigerian government had failed to grasp the reality of the situation on the ground.

“Arguably the most critical factor in scaling up in a manner commensurate to the massive needs, is to orient the attention of the government of Nigeria to commit more of their own resources to humanitarian and recovery efforts in the northeast,” it said.

A U.N. spokeswoman said the assessment was “quite dated” and a task force including representatives from the United Nations, international NGOs and donor countries was expected to issue an internal report on progress this month.

Even at the start of 2018, issues described in the report still threatened to undermine the response.

In a Jan. 2 letter to the government seen by Reuters, Edward Kallon, the U.N.’s top humanitarian official in Nigeria, said tensions with the government were delaying a fund-raising appeal.

While the disagreements were resolved in time for the February launch of the 2018 humanitarian response plan, letters sent by both sides highlight a fraught relationship.

“Time is not on our side,” Kallon wrote to Ahmed.

In a Jan. 5 reply, also seen by Reuters, Ahmed said Kallon had been “extremely disrespectful ... we are concerned that this situation is becoming untenable and therefore unacceptable to us.”

The U.N. and Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment on the letters.",Killing of aid workers in Nigeria a setback for troubled crisis response,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/killing-of-aid-workers-in-nigeria-a-setback-for-troubled-crisis-response-idUSKBN1GY0LN
3,niger,"STUTTGART, Germany — U.S. special operations forces kicked off their largest exercise in Africa on Monday in Niger, a country that is at the center of a growing counterterrorism mission.

The focus of the two-week Flintlock 2018, which involves eight African and 12 Western countries, is the day-to-day threats faced by local forces on the ground, the top U.S. commander of special operations troops in Africa told reporters before the exercise.

“The scenarios will be based on real-world threats of the violent extremist organizations currently threatening our partner nations in the greater Sahel,” a belt of territory between the Sahara Desert and the Sudanian Savanna, said Maj. Gen. J. Marcus Hicks, head of Special Operations Command Africa.

The emphasis has shifted from a focus on tactical proficiency of small units to the command and control of joint forces, he said.

Niger has emerged as a hub for U.S. operations in the region. A new drone site is being developed in the central Niger city of Agadez, where a Nigerien military base will play a key role in this year’s exercises.

A joint multinational headquarters for Flintlock will be set up in Agadez, where military teams will conduct command and control over tactical units spread out in Niger, Senegal and Burkina Faso. Those countries, along with Chad, Mali and Mauritania, are part of a joint regional response force involved in regional counterterrorism.

West Africa is home to numerous extremist groups, such as Nigeria-based Boko Haram, the Islamic State and various al-Qaida-aligned organizations. ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates are descending through central Mali, threatening not only Mali but also Burkina Faso and Niger, Hicks said.

In October, four U.S. soldiers were killed in western Niger in an ambush while on patrol with Nigerien forces. The incident has brought increased scrutiny to U.S. efforts in Niger and raised questions about whether American troops are taking on unnecessary risks to counter what is still a regional threat. So far, jihadis in Western Africa have not demonstrated a capacity to strike the U.S. directly.

Niger is an isolated, land-locked country that is among the world’s poorest. The government is struggling with persistent food shortages as the population is set to double in 18 years. The concern is that fragile countries like Niger could become vulnerable to extremists groups looking for potential havens.

“Africa matters to us because it is a preventive-medicine theater versus an emergency-medicine theater,” Hicks said. “What I mean by that is that these threats, as they exist in Africa, are at a level where they can be dealt with ... at a very low cost.”

The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, has warned that failure to effectively address the ongoing dispute between cattle herders and local farming communities might lead to more bloodshed this year.

The struggle for access and control of lands over which roaming herdsmen graze their cattle has led to conflict with local farmers all over the country, resulting in the death of hundreds just this year alone with herders credited with a majority of the attacks.

While speaking to State House correspondents after the National Food Security Council meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Monday, April 9, 2018, Chief Ogbeh said the Federal Government needs to implement effective policies to put an end to the conflicts.

According to him, the Federal Government has to work out grazing alternatives for herders to dissuade them from trespassing into farmlands and causing friction with local communities.

He said the cattle industry is profitable to the country's gross domestic product and should not be neglected as it has been for decades.

He said, ""We have to move the cattle to the good old grazing reserves and we just have to create environment for them; clusters of ranches where they have water, grass and security against rustlers.

""For nearly 40 years, we didn't do much about cattle, we also forgot that cattle contribute six per cent to GDP. The cheapest way of rearing cattle is by roaming around with them as you see now.

""If you go into a ranch it is not cheap and government cannot subsidise cattle rearing like they do in Europe, where they subsidise every cow. We cannot afford that.

""So, the thing is to create those ranches and the herdsmen are prepared to pay tax to support the programme. If we don't do it, next year will be worse than this year, I assure you.""

Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, who is also in the council, said there is already a recommendation made to President Muhammadu Buhari to ratify the establishment of Agro-rangers, a specialized group of security agents, to combat the crisis.

He said, ""You have to train a specialized group of security outfit to handle those issues, it is not to concentrate on conventional security. So, there is a recommendation before Mr. President for the employment and training of Agro-rangers.

""What we are still appealing to Mr. President is to hasten the process so that it can help solve some of the problems that we have in various states on the conflicts between farmers and herdsmen.""

FG's cattle colony initiative

As a measure to put an end to the crisis, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have been trying to implement an initiative that involves rearing cattle in colonies that are controlled by the Federal Government.

According to Chief Ogbeh, cattle colonies are a combination of several ranches where 20 to 30 ranchers can share the same colony.

The ministry has implored state governments to sign up for the initiative because it addresses the needs of cattle herders by providing resources to care for their cattle while avoiding unnecessary conflicts over economic resources between them and farmers.

Despite the controversy that the initiative has gathered, 15 states have expressed interest in taking part. The list of states includes: Adamawa, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Borno, Jigawa, Yobe, Niger, Kogi and Kwara.

Pascal Brice is the director-general of the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons.

PARIS — At a Paris summit in August last year, E.U. representatives and the governments of France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Niger, Chad and the U.N.-backed government of Libya agreed to a new plan to address the tragedies endured by migrants who travel through Libya and across the Mediterranean. Part of the agreement was to send “protection missions” to Africa, with the goal of resettling African refugees in Europe after evaluating them in the countries of transit in the Sahel. The French government announced it would resettle 3,000 people in France by the end of 2019.

To that end, the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) has been vetting asylum seekers who are already featured on U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) lists on African soil so that they don’t have to make the difficult journey to Europe.

OFPRA officers who have been deployed in Italian ports since 2015 are familiar with the catalogue of horrors people endure on the desperate voyage across the Mediterranean, as are those at the OFPRA head office in Paris who interview survivors every day. In many cases, the journey through Libya causes the survivors as much distress as the dangers of the Mediterranean.

In close collaboration with UNHCR, OFPRA teams traveled to Niger twice and to Chad once since October of last year. In total, they were able to interview nearly 400 people, who have since started arriving in France. Among these are the first 50 people to be evacuated from Libya by UNHCR: men, women and children from Eritrea, Darfur and several other African countries who have been subjected to rape, torture and kidnapping.

These missions are inspired not only by the conventional resettlement programs run by UNHCR and its partners such as the United States and Canada for many years but in addition by the missions to resettle Syrian refugees. OFPRA officials have also travelled to Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey since 2014 and continue to do so regularly in order to interview the most vulnerable Syrian asylum seekers — notably sick children and single women — in preparation for their arrival in France. Thousands of individuals have been interviewed by OFPRA in these countries, and many have since arrived in France. The French government intends to welcome 7,000 more Syrian refugees by 2019.

Further measures must be taken, including working to settle conflicts, putting an end to persecution in the countries of origin, working with transit countries, tackling the networks of smugglers and developing more legal means of access (like resettlement programs), all while fully observing the right to asylum on European soil. This is what Europe’s history, values and laws require us to do.

The OFPRA missions are an important way to help the victims of persecution and conflict. They make it possible to provide assistance to transit states while preventing refugees, especially the most vulnerable, from undertaking a terrible and dangerous voyage. Rather than an outsourcing of the right to asylum beyond European borders, missions such as those led by OFPRA complement the necessary full observance of this right in Europe.

“Non-refoulement” — which provides that no one expel or return a refugee against his or her will, in any manner whatsoever, to a territory where he or she fears threats to life or freedom — must be enforced and applied to asylum seekers on European soil, where their application for asylum should be fully examined. Europeans must move forward to fully protect asylum seekers on their soil in a more harmonized, effective manner that is consistent with the law.

In a speech at the Sorbonne last September, French President Emmanuel Macron paved the way for a European Asylum Agency that would bring together the best aspects of each national agency — whether the territorialization of the German arrangements, the close integration of the Dutch system or the independence of OFPRA, which ensures that individual decisions are based exclusively on the criteria of asylum laws.

Today, the success of OFPRA’s rescue missions is due to the hard work done together with the UNHCR. It now depends on the latter’s capacity to intervene under the right conditions in Libya and also on the commitment of E.U. member states and members of the international community to take in their share of the resettlement of refugees, particularly by offering support to the Niger authorities in caring for Libyan survivors.

The jarring and distressing images of slave markets in Libya exposed by CNN are still raw in the public’s eye. The international community must take responsibility for getting as many of these refugees as possible out of this terrible situation and ensure greater compliance with the right to asylum.

Many migrants and refugees who brave the journey to Libya end up in detention. (Keystone)

As Switzerland receives a first group of vulnerable refugees from Libyan detention centres, we take a look at the international response to Libya's migrant crisis.

At the end of last year, CNN reports of detained Africans being sold in Libyan slave markets sent shock waves around the world. It also prompted the European Union and International Organization for Migration (IOM) to step up evacuating migrants from Libya, “because,” says IOM media officer for West and Central Africa Florence Kim, “the EU and African Union decided that we could not leave 20,000 people in detention centres in Libya.”

Also in December, Switzerland announced that it has agreed to take up to 80 vulnerable refugees as part of an emergency plan by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to evacuate thousands of people from detention centres in Libya. Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga described this as an “urgent humanitarian measure”, saying it was justified because of the catastrophic situation in Libya.

A first group of refugees arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday, according to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM).

The group consists mainly of women classified as ""vulnerable"" along with women with children and unaccompanied minors. They were first evacuated to Niger before being flown to Switzerland, a SEM spokeswoman told swissinfo.ch

Some other European countries have also agreed to take refugees as part of this operation. UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel told swissinfo.ch that over 1,300 people have been evacuated so far, of whom 312 have gone to Italy, a few to Romania and the rest to Niger for resettlement processing.

Torture and abuse

In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have braved the journey across Africa to Libya, some intending to stay, but many hoping to reach Europe. “Nearly half a million have made the crossing in the last three years; over 10,000 have died in the attempt,” says an Amnesty International report published in December last year. “A further half a million, maybe more, are currently stranded in Libya.”

Of those stuck in Libya, it was estimated that at the end of last year 20,000 refugees and migrants were being held in detention centres run by the DCIM, a division of the Libyan Interior Ministry set up to tackle migration flows into Libya. Thousands more were being held in unofficial detention centres run by militias and criminal gangs, according to the Amnesty report. In both cases, it said, “people are unlawfully detained in inhuman conditions and subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual violence.” Amnesty accused European governments of complicity in this situation.

The IOM says that since the joint operation was scaled up at the end of last year, 17,000 people have left the detention centres in Libya, of whom 11,000 have returned home on a voluntary basis. There remain only around 3,500 people in official detention centres. No doubt there are more people in places of captivity held by militias, but access is a problem, according to Florence Kim of the IOM.

Refugees and migrants

What counts in the Libyan detention centres is whether you are deemed to be an economic migrant or a refugee. Screening of refugees is done by the UNHCR, while voluntary repatriation of migrants is handled by the IOM.

Asked about the criteria for classification as a refugee, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean Situation Vincent Cochetel says that they include “victims of torture, people with medical problems, single women, unaccompanied children and people with disabilities”. “But,” he adds, “I have to say that today in Libya almost everyone is vulnerable, so vulnerability alone is not the criteria. We have to look at whether those people are refugees or migrants. Refugees should not be forced to go home, because they are going to be exposed to persecution or risk.”

Asked how the IOM can be sure its repatriation scheme is really voluntary, Kim said the organisation makes sure that people “know they have a choice, that there is no psychological pressure on them, but at the same time we also know that it’s one of the only life-saving options that they have”.

She says some 80% of people returned home were detained in Libya. The majority of those who go back are from West African countries such as Nigeria, The Gambia, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Their profile depends on the country. “If you take Ivory Coast, 70% to 80% are male aged 18-30, mostly literate,” Kim told swissinfo.ch. “And then from Nigeria you have a lot more women than from other countries of origin, and among those women maybe 80-90% are victims of trafficking.” There are also many unaccompanied minors.

An innovative aspect of the voluntary repatriation programme is reintegration support, whereby the IOM works not only with the individual but also with the community of origin. “You are a returnee. We don’t leave you alone with your reintegration project, we try to put you with other people,” says Kim. “Let’s say we are going to help you build a poultry farm, you are maybe going to be managing that with other returnees. We also try to include potential migrants.” She says this is also designed to avoid tension within the home community.

Coming to Switzerland

Asked about the arrival of the first group of refugees in Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) would say only that they are mostly vulnerable single women who have been evacuated from Libya to Niger. The statement did not give any numbers.

A SEM spokesperson nevertheless told swissinfo.ch that the federal government has been negotiating with the cantons to place the refugees. According to Swiss practice, the refugees will stay in the care of federal authorities for only a few days, before being sent to the cantons for resettlement, according to agreed quotas.

Switzerland is expected to take more refugees currently in temporary centres in Niger, where a mission from SEM has been to conduct its own screening. And the UNHCR is still looking for more host countries for refugees. “We are asking Switzerland and also other European countries and countries outside Europe to take more because we really need to make sure that we evacuate as many people as possible from Niger,” Cochetel told swissinfo.ch.

7,niger,"Agadez – On March 15, more than 800 people from local communities, authorities, civil society and security forces participated in a crisis simulation exercise in Agadez, organized by IOM, the UN Migration Agency.

Using a real-life scenario, the simulation exercise tested local and regional authorities’ abilities to respond to a mass migration movement into Niger precipitated by a crisis at the border. Based on the results of the exercise, a regional crisis contingency plan will be drafted in conjunction with authorities in Agadez.

Agadez is located in northern Niger, a region regularly affected by migration flows both in and out of the country. Over the last few decades, the movement of goods and persons has increased considerably in Niger, requiring improved structures for immigration and border management (IBM) to more effectively manage cross-border movements. As a result, the state has been confronted with the challenge of better facilitating these legitimate movements while maintaining secure borders.

IOM’s IBM unit has been active in Niger since 2015 and is implementing projects aiming to reinforce border management in the country and the Sahel region. Since then, more than 15,000 people have been reached through awareness-raising activities aimed at improving the dialogue between communities and authorities.

Through the creation of prevention committees along Niger’s borders, and the inclusion of local populations in simulation exercises and awareness campaigns, IOM includes border communities as full actors in border management.

Within this context, the simulation exercise sought to enhance community involvement in crisis management. Communities from the surrounding area played the roles of both displaced populations and welcoming community. The exercise incorporated a strong community engagement component to foster communication between local communities and authorities. As communities are the first to directly encounter signs of a crisis, communication with local authorities is crucial both in ensuring a quick and effective crisis response, as well as in preventing future crises.

At the end of the exercise, IOM distributed over 400 hygiene kits to participating community members, and will deliver six tents to be used in crisis management to the Agadez Governorate.

The simulation was part of the project Engaging Communities in Border Management in Niger – Phase II, funded by the US Department of State. This was the third exercise of its kind organized by IOM in Niger, which had held two exercises in the Zinder region in 2017. The simulation was planned in close partnership with the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Humanitarian Action and Natural Disaster Management and the Ministry of Health of Niger.

In February 2018, humanitarian partners and the Government of Nigeria officially launched the Humanitarian Response Plan, based on priorities and vulnerabilities identified in the Humanitarian Needs Overview. A total of 60 organisations have committed to implementing 173 projects aimed at providing in life-saving assistance to 6.1 million women, children and men in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. The total funding requirements for 2018 stand at US$1.05 billion. This year the response will also focus on durable solutions, early recovery, livelihoods and basic services rehabilitation, across all sectors, to support a multi-year vision that goes beyond saving lives today.

Now in its ninth year, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world: 1.7 million persons remain internally displaced, human rights violations continue to be reported daily, and the food security situation remains extremely concerning as conflict continues to limit the amount of land under cultivation and 3.7 million persons are expected to face critical levels of food insecurity during the upcoming lean season (June through September). The Food Security and Nutrition needs are expected to be revised in March with the publication of the new Cadre Harmonisé analysis.

Large-scale population movements, triggered largely by insecurity, continue with 12,500 new arrivals in February alone, especially in Gwoza, Mobbar, Bama, Nganzai, Kukawa, Magumeri among others. Additional IDP influxes were also recorded from neighbouring countries, including Cameroon and Niger, into IDP camps and return areas in Ngala and Mobbar. Since late October 2017, over 60,000 vulnerable persons have been on the move for various reasons including insecurity, improved security in certain areas and poor living conditions. While assessments are still ongoing in these hotspot areas, rapid assessments and gap analyses have been developed and initial findings show that thousands, including host communities, are in dire need of food, water, shelter, blankets and clothes, and medical care. A multi-sectoral response has been possible through the rapid response mechanism and humanitarian organisations have scaled up their advocacy and resource mobilisation activities in order to meet the needs of the affected people. Additional displacements are expected for as long as hostilities will continue as newly arrived persons report that many more families remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian workers.

A suspected cholera epidemic broke out in Kukawa LGA, Borno State, in the towns of Baga and Doro. Since 13 February, close to 500 acute watery diarrhoea cases, suspected to actually be cholera cases, have been reported by the Borno State Ministry of Health.

A timely and coordinated response has been put in place and the outbreak should be under control in the coming weeks.

Humanitarian access continues to present major challenges, especially in Borno State. It is estimated that some 926,000 persons remain in areas that are hard to reach for international humanitarian organisations. Through civil-military coordination and community engagement, aid workers are working to expand the humanitarian space in north-east Nigeria. In addition, to improve local coordination and last-mile assistance, and increase the presence of humanitarians where vulnerable populations are living, to date, five ‘deep field’ humanitarian hubs (Maiduguri, Ngala, Dikwa, Bama and Gwoza) offering secure accommodation and Internet connectivity have been made operational. Another three (Monguno, Damasak and Banki) are expected to be fully operational in the coming weeks and another one, in Rann, is also planned, bringing the total to nine.

Although funds received in 2018 are extremely low for most sectors as of 28 February 2018, with only 2.4 per cent ($25.6 million) of the requirements met, most partners are able to continue to provide life-saving assistance thanks to about $196 million carryover funding from 2017. However, for the response to be sustainable and to avoid interruption in life-saving services, it is crucial that additional funding be received across all the sectors.","North-East Nigeria: Humanitarian Situation Update, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/north-east-nigeria-humanitarian-situation-update-february-2018

Alumonah said yesterday that the contracting firm, Julius Berger Nig. Plc. had also accomplished about 85 piles of 914 millimeter in diameter in different axis.

“The contract was split into phases. Phases 1 to phase 3 have been successfully accomplished and we are now on early works in phase 4. Part of this early works phase 4 forms part of the main contract.

“So far, the 1.2 kilometer sand filling of the road at the Asaba end has reached the height of 2.2 meters out of the expected five meters.

“At the Onitsha end, we have done a lot of sand filling of embankments to a reasonable stage. We have done a lot of culverts as well.

“In all, we have achieved around 44.6 per cent of phase of early work stage 4,” Alumonah said.

He said the contract for the early work stage four was awarded in October 2016 while work commenced in November 2017.

According to him, an advance payment of N2.166 billion was made to the contractor out of the contract sum of N14.466 billion for the early work phase four.

Alumonah said the early work stage four project had a life span of nine months starting from November 2017 to July 2018, noting that there would not be any interruption between stage four and the main contract.

He said the second Niger Bridge was no longer a political issue as President Muhammadu Buhari had demonstrated commitment to realizing the completion of the project.

“The bridge is a link road to all parts of the country not just the South East. It is not a bridge only for the southern part of the country. It is for all Nigerians,” he said.

The controller noted that the continuous maintenance of the existing Niger bridge built in 1965 was a demonstration of the federal government’s commitment.

He said the stress on the existing bridge compelled the federal government to build a second Niger bridge.

He said the issue of compensation of the affected people had been handled by the federal government to a reasonable level and had paved way for work at kilometers 23 to 31.

Alumonah assured Nigerians that the main bridge would not take long to be actualised after the early stage four is completed by July.",Second Niger Bridge At 44% Completion Stage – Official,https://leadership.ng/2018/04/10/second-niger-bridge-at-44-completion-stage-official/

YAOUNDE, Cameroon, April 10, 2018/APO Group/ –On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

April 3, 2018 (KHARTOUM) - Sudan and three other countries Chad, Libya and Niger, Tuesday agreed to ""coordinate the actions"" of their armed forces to fight against the transnational ""crime"" in the region, say two statements issued in Niamey and Khartoum.

The four countries ""agree on the establishment of a cooperation mechanism for border security and the fight against transnational organized crime"", says a statement issued in Niamey after the meeting.

The statement says ""the southern area of Libya became a hotbed of ""serious persistent threats for the four countries"". This zone ""serves as a base for"" terrorist organizations"","" traffickers of all kinds and armed groups hostile to neighbouring countries"" adding they aggravating the Libyan crisis by engaging in mercenaries activities.

In a statement released in Khartoum, the foreign ministry said it was agreed to hold a meeting at the expert level in Ndjamena on 3 May to study a draft protocol on security cooperation between the four countries, stressing it would be signed in Khartoum at a date yet to be determined.

The fragile security situation in the sub-Saharan region, amplified by the Libyan crisis, push to believe that the region would be the sanctuary of jihadist groups as they still have some pockets in northern Mali despite a Franco-African military operation in January 2013.

A similar meeting was held in Niamey on 16 March 2018, including Germany, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Spain, Guinea, France, Italy, Libya, Mali, of Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad, as well as the EU, UN, African Union to discuss the fight against the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking.

However, Niamey meeting deals in addition to the human trafficking deals with the presence of jihadist and rebel groups in Libya. Several United Nations reports on Libya and Sudan point to the need to end the presence of Chadian and Sudanese groups involved in the Libyan crisis.

The Sudanese delegation was headed by the army chief of staff Kamal Abdel Marouf and included foreign ministry undersecretary Abdel Ghani al-Nai’m and Jalal al-Din al-Tayeb deputy director of the National Intelligence And Security Services.

More than 10 million people would require aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger as a result of the security challenges in the countries, the UN said on Thursday.

Its Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ursula Mueller, who stated this at the end of her visit to Chad, called for urgent support for the countries, especially Chad.

Mueller said the humanitarian emergency across the Lake Chad basin was among the most severe in the world.

She said: “Persistent insecurity and Boko Haram operations mean that more than 10 million people in four countries – Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria – will need aid assistance this year just to survive.”

She called for urgent funding to support 4.4 million people in Chad, including refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons, as well as the communities hosting them.

Mueller underscored the need for durable solutions to the crisis in the Lake Chad region, as noted by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

OCHA said the closure of Chad’s border with Nigeria from the beginning of the crisis in the region in 2015, together with the continued implementation of emergency measures, have also had an impact on local populations who already face poor regional development.

“The activities of the extremist group Boko Haram, as well as violence in Sudan and the Central African Republic, have affected 500,000 people there, including 137,000 people the UN has deemed particularly vulnerable.

“During my visit to displacement sites, I saw the difficult living conditions and lack of means displaced communities face.

“It is unacceptable that these men, women and children who have lost everything, their home, belonging, livelihood and very often family members, continue to live in fear and uncertainty.”

Mueller was on a 10-day Chad mission to the Central African Republic (CAR) and Cameroon, where she saw first-hand the devastating humanitarian consequences of ongoing violence.

The UN official said she was moved by the solidarity of host communities who are sharing the little they have with those forced to run for their lives.

“It is essential to strengthen the livelihoods of these communities who are the first lifeline for those fleeing violence and insecurity,” she stated.

According to her, the crisis is taking place against a wider backdrop of recurrent food shortages and entrenched poverty across Chad, where nearly four million people require emergency food assistance and more than 200,000 children under five are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition.

However, funding for humanitarian operations there has not kept pace with increased needs, she regretted.

Mueller urged countries to step up their support to Chad, which requires $544 million in humanitarian funding in 2018, which so far, was less than four per cent funded.","Over 10 million in need of humanitarian aid in Nigeria, Cameroon, others – UN – tv360",http://tv360nigeria.com/2018/03/01/over-10-million-in-need-of-humanitarian-aid-in-nigeria-cameroon-others-un/

The Coalition on Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Nigeria has released a complete review of incidents of farmers/herders crisis in Nigeria, lauding the neutral conduct of the Nigerian Army as patriotic and professional.

It however cautioned that situations where political office holders fail to take appropriate actions to maintain peace in their domain only to start inviting the military and at the same throwing tantrums at such institution is not only callous, wicked and senseless but should be stopped with immediate effect to enable genuine stakeholders work together for the peace and unity of the country.

The Coalition at a joint parley between online newspapers and social media influencers held in Abuja on Monday, said it had tracked violence related to herdsmen/farmers clashes across Nigeria and is of the opinion that the crisis was left to escalate because Governors ot Benue and Taraba States have decided to play politics with human lives using armed militias and warlords to escalate the crisis unabated.

The gathering also noted some politicians found wanting in their obligations to their citizens have seen the situation as a cash cow to further exploit the people rather than take steps to mitigate the crisis in order to derive both political and financial benefits.

According to the human rights group, this much was derived after a careful analysis of the situation using surveys, questionnaires and interviews with critical stakeholders, as well as victims.

Barrister Maxwell Gowon, leader of the coalition in the report said it was observed that the dynamics of this crisis are poorly understood by a wider spectrum of stakeholders, which has impacted support for initiatives aimed at solving the problem.

His words, “The Coalition therefore embarked on a review of the clashes with a view to making interventions that will spur rapid resolution of the crisis so that life can again return to normal for the millions of people that have been negatively affected.

“In the course of this review, the Coalition’s researchers visited some selected affected communities in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, Kogi and Nasarawa states. These states were selected using heat maps developed from interactively plotting reported incidents against locations on the map. The selected states, with the exception of Nasarawa, were chosen because they recorded the highest number and most intense level of violence in the 18 months that were assessed.

“Researchers also polled officers of the military and security agencies that have been deployed in the crisis areas. Questionnaires were distributed; interviews were conducted, as well as surveys.

From its findings, the group said the outcome of the review revealed that since its deployment to address the crisis, the military has made commendable efforts at restoring order as it has arrested and neutralized some of the criminal elements unleashing mayhem on affected communities.

The report says, “This is being carried out without any sentiment by the Nigerian military and in a few instances the government forces were not spared by criminal elements. For example, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Tukur Buratai at an address on the deployment of troops to crisis areas said “We have deployed officers across Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states where to ensure peace and stability for the development and betterment of our country.”

On the allegation that troops were conniving with criminal elements and the presidency has refused to act was investigated, the coalition said its finding revealed that only criminal elements and their agents in power who nurse the ambition of using the military for personal duties and were rebuffed nurse such conspiracy theories in their reasoning.

“This is not only worrisome but must be discarded to avoid returning to the military to its old nature where some highly placed citizens could press the trigger from the comfort of their homes.

“The deployment of the military to these troubled zones has helped to restore normalcy to most of the affected communities even though the question of armed militias is yet to be addressed with the needed political will and courage from actors within this locality.

Our investigations also noted that most of these militias had been armed by some highly placed individuals and efforts by the Nigerian Army to mop up these arms from them have not received the needed cooperation.

“The crisis between herdsmen and Farmers in some instances is instigated by persons without stakes on either side of the divide between herders and farmers. Unrelated hostilities between warring communities are also passed off as attacks by armed herdsmen. There was an instance in Benue State at Omusu where a clear case of conflict between Omusus and Okana communities in Okpokwu Local Government Area was reported as “armed herdsmen attack” even when it has nothing to do with an existing conflict between Omusu community and herdsmen.

“There are active attempts to mislead Nigerians, the Federal Government and the international community into believing that “killer” herdsmen are out to wipe out other ethnic groups when in some cases ethnic warlords are instigating militias to carry out attacks on their perceived enemies and make same look like the work of armed herdsmen. These actors in their desperate outings have gone further to link the Nigerian military with such heinous actions. However, our investigations have confirmed otherwise and it’s imperative for Nigerians and the world to take note. “

The group further commended the Army for extending the exercise in some states however added that such extension should be granted in more states until ethnic warlords and criminal elements decide to embrace peaceful approaches towards resolving the crisis.

The Coalition also warned that some actors have taken undue advantage of the situation to further their ethnic interest above the national interest which citizens should pursue, urging such persons to retrace their steps if not be ready to face the appropriate international instruments.",Human rights coalition releases report on herdsmen/farmers crises in Nigeria,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/human-rights-coalition-releases-report-on-herdsmen-farmers-crises-in-nigeria/

End-of-Mission press releases include statements of IMF staff teams that convey preliminary findings after a visit to a country. The views expressed in this statement are those of the IMF staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF’s Executive Board. Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that, subject to management approval, will be presented to the IMF's Executive Board for discussion and decision.

Staff-level agreement was reached with the authorities on economic and financial policies that could support completion of the second program review

Economic activity expanded by 4.9 percent in 2017, with growth of 5.2 percent expected for 2018.

Performance in implementing the government’s program supported by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) remains satisfactory.

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff team led by Christoph A. Klingen visited Niamey from March 28 to April 10, 2018 to conduct discussions on the second review of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. [1] Niger’s program was approved by the IMF Board on January 23, 2017 (see Press Release no 17/18).

At the end of the visit, Mr. Klingen issued the following statement:

“The Nigerien authorities and the IMF team have reached a staff-level agreement for the completion of the second review of the ECF-supported program. IMF Executive Board consideration is tentatively scheduled for June 2018.

“Niger’s overall macroeconomic performance remains strong and reforms, together with support from technical and financial partners, open a window of opportunity for the years ahead. Despite security challenges, unfavorable uranium prices, and a less-favorable-than-expected crop year, real GDP grew by 4.9 percent in 2017 , helped by a rebound in oil production and strong activity in the construction and telecommunication sectors. Real GDP is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in 2018, driven mainly by energy and service sectors, and construction activity related to preparations for the 2019 African Union Summit. It should rise further over the medium run, as reform efforts and the absorption of foreign assistance pay off. Inflation came to a moderate 2.4 percent in 2017, notwithstanding an uptick in the last quarter. During 2018, it is expected to recede rapidly from the current transitory levels to its well-contained historical norm, in part thanks to the sale of cereals at moderate price under the government support plan for vulnerable people.

“All quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2017 under the government’s economic and financial program have been observed. The overall fiscal deficit declined significantly, while spending on poverty reduction was protected. Targets for net domestic financing and the reduction of domestic payment arrears were met by a large margin. However, revenues fell well short of expectations, reflecting in part the reduction in telecommunications taxes, delayed sales of telecommunications licenses, and adverse economic circumstances outside the control of government. The strong revenue performance in the first quarter of 2018 signals a turn-around though, with the envisaged revenue for the full year well within reach.

“For the remainder of 2018, the basic fiscal balance is set to improve to 4 percent of GDP, firmly putting Niger on the path to reaching the WAEMU convergence criterion for the overall fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2021, while providing space to absorb the scaling up of external financial support pledged for the PDES 2017-21. Achieving these objectives is predicated on the continuation of the encouraging revenue performance in early 2018, backed by a strong push to systematically strengthen tax and customs administration, guided by performance plans, fighting petroleum smuggling, and collecting tax arrears. Other fiscal structural reforms will also be advanced, including the strengthening of debt management, fully harnessing program budgeting, digitalizing fiscal payments, and implementing the treasury single account.

“The authorities and the team also discussed policies to develop a strong private sector and address fast population growth. They agreed that progress on both fronts is essential for a sustained improvement of living standards and poverty reduction. Commendable strides have been made to improve the business environment and leaning against population growth. Deepening the financial sector and improving access to finance are key items for the reform agenda going forward.

“The team met with President Issoufou Mahamadou and Prime Minister Brigi Rafini. It also met with Minister of Finance Massoudou Hassoumi, the President of the Court of Accounts, Ministers in charge of Planning, Agriculture and Petroleum, the Minister Delegate for the Budget, the National Director of the BCEAO, as well as other senior government officials. Staff also met with representatives of civil society, the private sector, and the donor community.

“The team would like to thank the authorities for their hospitality and for the constructive discussions.”

16,niger,"After nine years of conflict in north-east Nigeria, 4.5 million people in the Lake Chad Basin need immediate food support and are dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. They remain cut off from their traditional livelihoods in an area where agriculture, fishing, livestock rearing, and regional trade were dynamic prior to the crisis. The number of food-insecure people across the region is expected to increase to 5.8 million by August 2018.1 The situation will keep deteriorating for the foreseeable future unless there is a concerted effort, driven by the governments of the conflictaffected countries, to lift communities out of a protracted crisis and support them to resume their lives and livelihoods. This cannot wait. A short-term humanitarian response, focused solely on keeping people alive, is not enough.

More than 2.2 million people remain displaced across Niger, Chad, Cameroon and north-east Nigeria as a result of the conflict. At the height of the conflict in 2014–15, non-state armed groups controlled about 20,000 square miles of land within north-east Nigeria alone (20% of Nigeria), where close to 1.8 million people lived.2 Military strategies to cut the armed groups off from their economic resources and declared ‘state of emergencies’ have had disastrous impacts on civilians’ access to livelihoods. Despite the government regaining control of areas in recent years, almost one million people are still living in out-of-reach areas and many communities remain displaced – or experience onward displacement – with little or no hope of returning to their homes due to threats from non-state armed actors and ongoing military operations in their villages of origin.

In Nigeria, one in five internally displaced persons (IDPs) have stated their intention to integrate locally in the current area of their displacement; and many others, while expressing the desire to leave, have asserted that the security situation is not yet conducive for going home.3 A significant return movement is not expected among Niger and Chad’s displaced communities in the coming year.

Ongoing insecurity, compounded by the lack of access to livelihoods, continues to expose displaced communities to protection threats such as killing, abduction, and sexual abuse, forcing them to resort to dangerous activities and negative coping mechanisms to survive. For women and girls, some of these negative coping mechanisms include early marriages (a direct consequence of lack of resources) or survival sex. Men and boys are also targeted and faced with abduction and killing as they go for firewood collection or to farm in insecure areas.

The food situation, far from improving, is expected to deteriorate from mid-2018, when climate-related stresses across the Sahel region are likely to compound the situation. According to a humanitarian needs forecast for the region, 62% of the Chadian population in the Lake region is expected to be food-insecure during the 2018 lean season: a 52% increase compared with 2017.4 In Nigeria, 3.7 million people could become food insecure if appropriate assistance is not delivered (compared with 2.6 million in January 2018). According to the 2018 Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan,5 5.7 million people are in urgent need of early recovery and livelihood assistance in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. However, the early recovery and livelihood sector was only 7.7% funded in 2017.6

While many humanitarian and development actors consider that conditions for early recovery are met in certain locations (the Lake region of Chad, most of Adamawa and Yobe state in Nigeria, the western part of Diffa region in Niger), the relative improvement in the security situation over the past two years has not translated into an improved access to livelihoods in most areas. Thanks to generous funding – 70% of the 2017 humanitarian response plan was funded in Nigeria – and a massive humanitarian scale-up, famine was averted in the north-east of Nigeria. But a similar level of humanitarian assistance will be hard to maintain in 2018, and even if it can, this will not provide a long-term solution to the lack of access to food and livelihoods in this protracted crisis.

The continuing lack of safe livelihoods risks contributing to ongoing cycles of violence, fuelling grievances and further undermining the stretched coping capacities of impoverished communities. Massive investment in livelihoods opportunities is needed now, combining short- and long-term approaches, to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Action must be taken immediately: vulnerable women, men and children cannot wait until they are safe to go home for a more durable solution. A strong political vision is required from the governments of conflict-affected countries, which should take the lead in coordinating humanitarian and development interventions. Moreover, investment in livelihoods should be seen as an opportunity to empower women and youth and to reduce gender inequality, in order to promote long-term peace in the region.","Supporting livelihoods in the Lake Chad Basin: Ways forward for conflict-affected communities in Nigeria, Niger, and Chad",https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/supporting-livelihoods-lake-chad-basin-ways-forward-conflict-affected-communities-0

According to the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2.3 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in Niger, an increase of 21% (400,000 people) compared to 2017. The needs analysis shows the persistence of five major crises affecting the country: food insecurity (1.4 million people estimated in need), malnutrition (1.7 million people), epidemics (1,170,000 people), floods (170,000 people) and population movements due to conflict or migration (392,305 people).

The deterioration of the security situation in the districts bordering Mali has caused the activation of the Intercluster contingency plan. Out of the 84,000-people estimated in the contingency plan, over 36,000 are already considered to be at risk of displacements in the coming weeks due to threats of attacks and / or military operations. The activation of a Civilo-Military Coordination for the districts bordering Mali, was validated by the Humanitarian Country Team.","UNICEF Niger Humanitarian Situation Report, 31 January 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/unicef-niger-humanitarian-situation-report-31-january-2018

Despite being the centre of Nigeria's oil production, the Niger Delta region has been anything but peacefully thriving.

The country sits on top of one of the largest oil reserves in the world, but years of struggle for control of the oil in the Niger Delta has made it a restive region as the Federal Government continues to wage a costly war against dissenting militants and oil thieves.

Both sides are trying to exercise some form of control over the gains from the resource and the crisis, despite its consequences over the years, doesn't appear like it'll end anytime soon.

Tensions most notably kicked off in the early 1990s when a number of local minority ethnic groups started feeling exploited by the foreign oil corporations who were largely responsible for oil production in the region in partnership with the Federal Government.

Local ethnic populations felt sidelined because the gains of oil production, which the country's economy grew to be dependent on, was not being felt by the citizens in those areas, and the country as a whole. The years of oil spills, environmental destruction, and corruption didn't ease the tensions.

With the particular aim of acquiring control of regional petroleum resources, the region saw an upsurge in militant groups who engaged in oil bunkering which involved stealing oil from pipelines.

In 2013, Nigeria was the second-most-pirated nation in Africa as militants had resorted to hijacking ships, kidnapping sailors, and sometimes killing oil workers. A number of foreign employees of oil companies were abducted and held hostage for ransom.

Militant activity dried up around 2009 when then-president, late Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, signed an amnesty deal to pardon all militants in the Niger Delta region in exchange for their demobilisation and disarmament.

The situation took another turn when President Muhammadu Buhari reached the decision to phase out the Presidential Amnesty Programme after he was elected in 2015.

The limited success of the amnesty programme, criticised for being a half-measure, and the government's roll-back on it has meant the region continues to suffer.

The rise and rise of illegal oil refineries

During a recent trip to the creeks of the Niger Delta, VICE correspondent, Gianni Toboni, reported on the ongoing conflict for control between militants and the government.

According to her report, illegal oil refineries are buried deep in the creeks of the Niger Delta where they are notoriously difficult to access. Locals who engage in the practice of illegally refining crude oil are protected by paramilitary groups who secure the operations from the intrusions of the instruments of the state.

While exploring an illegal refinery, Toboni described it as looking 'post-apocalyptic' with an entire town block burnt to the ground and covered in oil and rot.

The process of refining the oil starts with pumping the crude through hoses into what is called the crude oven where the process happens. From the oven, it goes through another pipe into the cooler where they use water to cool the product, and then through another hose into the reservoir where the final product goes before pumping it into kegs which are used to export into town.

According to the guide at the scene, the process usually happens at night to avoid the authorities sniffing around.

The oven, where the crude oil is first stored, is set on fire as waste is poured into the fire to heat it and achieve the best possible results.

The guide said, ""When the temperature increases, the lightest of all the products is fuel, gasoline; so that one comes out first. Then after that, kerosene follows.""

Government's pushback

In the video report by VICE, operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) carried out a raid on a warehouse where illegally refined products were processed for sale.

As is protocol, they destroyed the drums of what was described as adulterated products and released it into the local river.

The Rivers State Commandant of the NSCDC, Mohammed Haruna, disclosed that they come in contact with warehouses used to sell illegal products quite often, with that particular warehouse being their second time.

He said, ""We destroy whatever we see there. We cannot set them it on fire, we cannot do anything because this is a residential area.""

Despite the difficulty in accessing the creeks where the illegal refineries primarily operate, Toboni reported that the NSCDC also carry out routine operations to put them out of business.

This routinely involves setting the equipment used in the process on fire and abandoning them hoping they can never be put to use anymore.

One of such facilities is raided in the video as operatives set fire to the equipment by shooting at them and hoping this ignites a fire based on the combustible elements in the environment.

The environmental costs of war

The crippling environmental damage that oil production has caused in the Niger Delta has been an issue long before local groups started to scramble for control, and it has definitely not helped that they have joined in.

When militant groups who operate the illegal refineries have to dump wastes that are gotten from their operations, they are left with little option than to dump them directly into the abundant waterways, a practice that has led to widespread pollution.

Also, the burning of the crude oven typical releases huge plumes of smoke into the air so devastating that it has led to an ongoing air pollution crisis in Port Harcourt in the form of soot, a black powdery substance consisting largely of amorphous carbon.

The actions of security agencies have made this even worse as they do the same damage as the oil thieves.

Despite admitting that releasing confiscated product into the waterways is dangerous, the NSCDC commandant said he's left with no other options.

He said, ""It is more dangerous when you take it out of this place. If you don't destroy it, it will get into the society and it goes to the local market. They will put them in the vehicle. It's not good for society, so it is destroyed here.""

When operatives also raid a camp and set the equipment on fire, it basically has the same effect as when the militants cook the product and pollute the environment.

The effect on the local communities is catastrophic as it has led to contaminating the main source of fishing, agriculture and drinking water.

In the VICE report, local fishermen complained of getting a burning sensation in the body after eating fish caught from the contaminated river. Fishing nets also regularly come back out of the river covered in oil.

In 2011, a landmark United Nations report revealed widespread contamination of the Niger Delta by Shell and other oil companies.

The report read, ""At 22 of the 33 investigated sites along Shell Petroleum Development Company pipeline rights of way, soil contamination exceeded the limits set by the Nigerian national legislation.""

Despite the environmental devastation that has resulted from oil production in the Niger Delta, little has been done to rectify it despite several promises from oil companies and the Federal Government.

Is there an end in sight?

For the people involved in the trade of refining oil illegally, it is a way of life.

According to Toboni's guide, ""This is how our people survive. What you see here is a means of survival. We're fighting to eat.""

One of the people working in the refineries in the creeks said, ""To say the truth, I don't have any other hand work. I survive with this little work I am doing illegally.""

Another said, ""The oil is there. A lot of people are taking it away. So the guys, the people start experimenting how they get their resources under their own feet. So, I said 'Join them.' Me, I'm selling it.""

Yar'Adua's amnesty program derailed because it was riddled with controversies such as accusations that politicians were making money off it by bringing in people who were not former militants to benefit from the program at the detriment of real militants who needed rehabilitation and reparation.

The amnesty was never going to completely solve the situation anyway as the region has always witnessed the rise of one powerful militant group replacing another on the wane.

In 2017, militant activity reduced Nigeria's oil output to its lowest level in over two decades.

This was mostly due to the operations of the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) who began their campaign in 2016 and carried out relentless attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta region so much that it started to cripple operations.

Between January and November 2016, the group took credit for at least 45 attacks that led to the shutdown of countless oil terminals and forced major oil companies like Shell, Agip and Chevron to cease operations and withdraw their staff.

Even though the group currently has a ceasefire deal with the Federal Government that has lasted over a year now, it has repeatedly threatened to walk back on it and resume its destructive bombings .

A member of the NDA that spoke to Toboni said, ""We are sick and tired of this shit. I feed you, you get fat, you make money, you live large and you keep me in the poverty stage? It's not possible.

""This trouble is not all about me, it's all about the Niger Delta people. We have kids coming up. The future, we are not looking at the present, we are looking at the future.

""We are out there to stop the operation. We blow up the pipelines. We are not out there to kill humans - just the pipelines.""

The NDA's major demand has always been to ensure people of the region benefit from the rewards of the product of their lands.

Under the country's derivation principle, oil-producing states receive 13% of the oil revenue, an allocation that has been deemed too little to rid the Niger Delta region of massive infrastructure decay, widespread poverty and environmental degradation.

Locals keep demanding that the federal government create more jobs and development from the gains it is making off the Niger Delta region and failure to do that means resorting to violence to force the government's hand as it has been determined to be an effective way to command attention.

In a bid to end crude oil-related criminalities in the Niger Delta region, the Federal Government announced in 2017 that it was exploring options to legalise the operations of illegal oil refineries in the region.

""Our approach to that is that we must engage them (militants) by establishing modular refineries so that they can participate in legal refineries,"" Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, said.

It remains to be seen if this is the one move that finally puts an end to the battle for oil resources between militants and the government, but it could be a start.",How FG continues to fight Niger Delta militants over control of oil,http://www.pulse.ng/news/local/how-fg-fights-militants-over-control-of-oil-in-niger-delta-id8224671.html

Niger is a land-locked and food-deficit Sahel country.

With a demographic growth of 4 percent, it is one of the highest in the world. Food and nutrition insecurity in Niger remains above WHO serious threshold. This situation stems from poverty, environmental degradation and cyclical shocks. This negatively affects livelihoods as the economy is strongly reliant on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture (80 percent of the predominantly rural population are in a situation of extreme poverty), and access to markets is limited. In addition, persisting regional volatility and security problems reinforce the national fragility.

The Government has put resilience building and social protection at the core of its development agenda, highlighting the importance of a multisectoral integrated approach (for example the national Nigeriens nourish Nigeriens (3N). Food and nutrition insecurity remains one of the major development challenges. Work is ongoing to ensure alignment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. WFP’s intervention is placed within this framework, especially the SDG 2 “Zero Hunger”.

WFP has been in Niger since 1968.

20,niger,"STEPPING UP TO THE ESCALATING NEEDS

Acute rainfall deficits last season in several regions of the Sahel, and worsening insecurity have escalated humanitarian needs.

Drought has prematurely thrust pastoralist communities into the lean season, with herders migrating earlier than usual. Growing insecurity in Mali and armed attacks in border regions with Burkina Faso and Niger have uprooted hundreds of families in recent months, adding to the devastation by the long-running conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Swaths of pastoral and agro-pastoral regions are suffering severe pasture and water deficits. Around 2.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are at risk of serious livelihood crisis in 2018.

Mauritania, and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal and Mali are the worst affected in the Sahel.

Armed attacks, banditry and intercommunity conflict have increased in Mali’s central regions. In areas unaffected by conflict, chronic vulnerabilities persist. In the Lake Chad Basin, humanitarian needs will remain high in 2018 and beyond. In areas worst hit by violence, almost 500,000 children are severely acutely malnourished and 5.8 million people are struggling with high levels of food insecurity.

In 2018, 24 million people will need humanitarian assistance in the Sahel. Some 32 million people are at risk of, or struggling with food insecurity – among them 10.8 million severely food insecure – and 4.7 million children are malnourished. Over 5 million refugees, internally displaced people and returnees are grappling with the consequences of forced displacement.

Sahel countries count among the world’s most at risk of crises and disasters. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts and floods and land degradation threaten the livelihoods of highly vulnerable communities. Food insecurity and malnutrition are often high and widespread, with seasonal peaks pushing millions into crisis. In the last decade, a spike in armed conflict and violence has worsened chronic needs, uprooted entire communities and disrupted livelihoods.

To address the most urgent needs across the region, humanitarians will need US$2.7 billion in 2018. In five countries – Cameroon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria – aid organisations and Governments have developed response plans to provide life-saving assistance and help communities rebuild livelihoods. In Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal, humanitarian work plans address acute peaks, while preparing the full integration of relief response in longer-term strategies that address the structural causes of vulnerability.

Humanitarian action across the region is progressively adopting the New Way of Working. Response strategies this year are further strengthening collaboration with Governments and development actors to provide urgent relief assistance and tackle the causes of recurrent emergencies. The Sahel humanitarian response is aligned with the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) priorities, which recognise the importance of the humanitariandevelopment and security-peace nexus and enshrines a proactive crisis prevention-oriented approach. The UNISS support plan seeks to address common humanitarian/security concerns in the Sahel, particularly the Lake Chad Basin areas, northern Mali and the Liptako-Gourma region.

Only concerted and sustained efforts by all actors can bring peace, security, and development, improve human rights, uplift Sahel’s most vulnerable inhabitants from recurrent crises, and create stable conditions for communities and families to prosper.

CONFLICT, FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION

PROTRACTED AND EMERGING CONFLICT

Conflict remains one of the main drivers of humanitarian emergencies in the Sahel. Increased hostilities could heighten humanitarian needs in the region, where 24 million require assistance this year.

The deteriorating insecurity has in recent months opened a new front. Regions in Burkina Faso and Niger bordering Mali have come under a rising spate of armed attacks that have devastated communities and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. In 2017, around 90 incidents of insecurity were recorded in Burkina Faso, forcing 141 schools to shut and affecting thousands of children. Villages in Niger’s western Tillabéri and Tahoua regions have also suffered multiple attacks that have uprooted residents. Burkina Faso and Niger respectively host 23,000 and 56,000 Malian refugees.

Mali and the Lake Chad Basin remain the region’s prominent conflict hotspots. In Mali, insecurity is spreading from the northern to the central regions. Clashes between armed groups, banditry and intercommunal violence recurrently cause displacements. Some 5.1 million people – more than 27 per cent of the country’s population – live in the areas affected by insecurity. Currently 59,000 people are displaced within the country, and almost one in five Malians is food insecure. While humanitarian assistance has enabled hundreds of thousands of people to survive, the situation remains critical. In 2018, aid groups will assist around 1.6 million people, 200,000 more than the previous year.

Across the conflict-hit Lake Chad Basin, around 2.2 million people have been displaced. Millions of people are grappling with hunger, poor living conditions in displacement sites and other adversity unleashed by the nine-year-long conflict. Humanitarian action has saved many lives, but millions of people still require relief assistance to survive and rebuild their livelihoods.

As humanitarians strive to assist Sahel’s vulnerable populations, Governments are making efforts to tackle extremist violence. The establishment of the G5 Sahel Joint Force hopes to address a key factor of regional instability. However, military operations could complicate humanitarian access, underscoring the need for dialogue and coordination between humanitarian and military actors.

FOOD INSECURITY, DROUGHT AND PASTORAL CRISIS

Following poor rains in 2017, Mauritania and parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal are witnessing severe pasture and water shortages. In these areas, the lean season has begun early and will last longer. Many pastoralist communities, who make up 30 per cent of Sahel’s population, begun migrating earlier than usual and will face a tough lean season as their resources dwindle. The early transhumance is exacerbating vulnerability. Meat and milk production has declined, livelihoods taken a hit and food prices are increasing. Terms of trade between cereals and livestock is unfavourable for herders. For instance, in Mali, Mauritania and Niger it dropped by 15 - 50 per cent compared to December 2016. In areas where pastoralists have moved into, the additional herds are exerting pressure on limited water and pasture and the likelihood of intercommunity tensions increased.

Across the region, food insecurity will remain high owing to the effects of poor rainfall, transhumance restrictions, high staple food prices and increasing displacement by conflict. For children, worsening food security will create additional hurdles such as learning difficulties or school retention, as parents are unable to afford fees and need their children to stay at home to work.

HIGH MALNUTRITION RATES

Malnutrition also remains prevalent in the region and is expected to deteriorate if early and sustained actions are not taken. Poor access to healthcare, water, sanitation, education and other basic services has left millions of children suffering from acute malnutrition. Some 4.7 million children are likely to face acute malnutrition. Global and severe acute malnutrition rates have surpassed the emergency threshold in parts of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. The drought that has also caused crisis among Sahel’s pastoralist communities is likely to increase the already high malnutrition rates. Education can play a key role in malnutrition prevention programmes by assisting children in school and their young parents with nutrition education, malnutrition screening services and prevention packages for the household.

MOBILISING FOR ACCELERATED RESPONSE

Humanitarian needs remain high in the Sahel, home to some of the world’s most protracted and severe crises. The impact of climate change, armed conflict and insecurity, underdevelopment and poverty subject millions of people to severe hardship. Around one in five people requiring humanitarian assistance in the world resides in the Sahel, and 16 per cent of the region’s 150 million inhabitants needs help.

The number of people uprooted, mainly by conflict, has nearly tripled in the past four years, rising from 1.8 million in 2014 to more than 5 million this year. Humanitarian response budget has hovered around $2 billion over the same period. In 2018, Sahel’s budget accounts for 12 per cent of the $22.5 billion global humanitarian financial requirement.

Progressively adopting the New Way of Working, humanitarian, Governments and development actors in the region have developed strategies to respond to the humanitarian emergency and address the causes of Sahel’s recurrent crises. Donor support has been critical in saving lives. 2018 is expected to be a very difficult year not only for pastoralist communities but also for thousands of communities who rely on markets for access to food in the Sahel. Accelerated efforts by all actors are crucial in reducing human suffering and restoring livelihoods.",Sahel 2018: Overview of Humanitarian Needs and Requirements,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/sahel-2018-overview-humanitarian-needs-and-requirements

On March 11, thousands of protesters descended on Niamey, the capital of Niger. Civil society leaders organized the march to denounce a new finance law they deemed “antisocial” for imposing taxes that they feared would raise living costs for citizens, while subsidizing the country’s utilities companies. Since October, opponents and supporters of the law have taken to the streets.

The official purpose of the law was to increase the taxation rate in order to satisfy criteria for membership in the West African Economic Monetary Union.

But this was just the latest sign of unrest in Niger, where protests have spiked in frequency over the past several years, as the chart below shows.

Why are Niger’s citizens protesting?

La vie chère — the high cost of living — became a recurrent theme of demonstrations after a 19 percent tax on primary commodities was introduced in 2005. According to surveys one of us (Mueller) conducted of Niamey residents in 2011, pocketbook concerns were the most salient grievances in uprisings that precipitated a 2010 coup against President Mamadou Tandja. This finding runs counter to international media portrayals of the 2010 events as a democratic revolution.



Source: Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED, https://www.acleddata.com/. Graph shows the number of protests and riots in Niger between 1997 and 2017.)

In the past, social movements have advanced civil liberties in Niger and elsewhere in Africa. Protesting is an alternative source of political accountability in autocracies and weak democracies — where votes do not seem to matter at times.

But protests also stir anxiety and reprisal. In a March 10 declaration, Niger’s religious associations, some of them state-backed, called for a “return to serenity.” They claimed that “marching for or against the 2018 finance law goes against the national interest” and constitutes “antisocial politics.”

[ Women’s rights groups in Niger push forward on gender equality ]

Nigerien authorities have grown bolder, imprisoning activists, journalists and opposition leaders for allegedly inciting rebellion. At least 10 people have died at the hands of President Mahamadou Issoufou’s security forces since Issoufou was elected in 2011.

Some protests prove more effective than others

What determines whether protests will lead the state to reform or to repress? Economic crises, for example, often are associated with higher odds that leaders will make political concessions to meet protesters’ demands. Looking to the future, climate change will have devastating effects on Niger’s farmers and pastoralists — and this suggests there will be larger economic protests and more pressure on incumbents to help alleviate these impacts.

Issoufou, however, enjoys a privileged position. In recent years, Niger has emerged as a strategic ally in counterterrorism missions and efforts to stave irregular migration to the European Union. He won a second term in 2016 through elections that U.S. and European officials declared free and fair despite numerous irregularities and an opposition boycott.

It is unlikely that Western donors will hold Issoufou’s administration accountable for violating human rights and the rule of law while he provides an operating base for foreign military personnel fighting violent extremism and human trafficking in the Sahel. Our private conversations with various Western diplomats confirm this assumption.

[ When did Congress authorize fighting in Niger? That’s an excellent question. ]

But continued and uncritical donor funding means Niger’s government has little incentive to engage constructively with the opponents of the finance law — those at the forefront of the current protests. Research by Emily Beaulieu on electoral protests, for instance, shows that a lack of international attention dampens the democratizing potential of protests in the developing world.

The continuing uproar surrounding Niger’s 2018 finance law sets the stage for contentious national elections in 2021. Issoufou has promised to step down when his term ends in 2021 in accordance with the country’s 2010 constitution.

Many regard Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum as Issoufou’s preferred successor. Others doubt the president’s vow to comply with term limits and worry that a constitutional crisis is on the horizon. Lately, word on the street is that Issoufou is positioning his son to succeed him. At this early stage, though, reliable predications are impossible.

The organization said the companies were ""taking weeks to respond to reports of spills and publishing misleading information about the cause of and severity of the spills, which may result in communities not receiving compensation.""

The findings were part of a research project released on Friday, which enlisted the help of thousands of supporters and activists to collect data about oil spills in the Niger Delta.

Once a blessing, now a curse

Oil spills in the Niger Delta region have brought misery to locals for many years. The valuable resource which was supposed to be a blessing for their communities has now become a curse.

James Awani, an indigenous resident of Ogoniland — a region which was impacted by a reported 2,976 oil spills between 1976 and 1991 — told DW how the spills have affected his livelihood:

""You go to our farm [and see that] oil has destroyed many things. We cannot farm again, so we are very hungry. We want the federal government to come and do something for us.""

Bodo Community River in Ogoniland has been devastated by oil spills

Tammy Williams also lives in the oil region. She accuses international oil companies of not being considerate of the indigenous population and causing massive pollution in the area.

""The oil companies in the Niger Delta have been so very unfair to the Niger Delta with regards to the oil spills and not performing their duties to the communities,"" she told DW, ""It is terrible.""

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Fishing without fish The Nigerian village of Bodo used to subsist on fishing. But following oil leaks from Shell pipelines in the Niger Delta in 2008 and 2009, the nets have remained empty. People who want to make a living from fishing are forced to go out on the open sea. That means longer working hours and higher costs.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Living with the water Bodo is located in the Ogoniland region of the Niger Delta, in southeastern Nigeria. Like Bodo, most arms of the Niger are contaminated with oil. This poses a particular problem for the people there since they have always lived on and with the water. Even today, many villages can only be reached by boat.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Oil streaks everywhere The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) released a report in 2011 about the oil leaks in Bodo and other parts of Ogoniland - recommending that the government and oil companies provide one billion dollars for the clean-up. So far though, the oil streaks that shimmer on the water still haven't been addressed.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria 'No one seems to care' Saint Emmah Pii, Chief of Bodo, is angry. ""We're all going to die miserably. We drink contaminated water. We breathe in poisonous fumes. It's all because of the oil."" But outside of Bodo, no one seems to care. ""Until now, neither the government in Abuja, nor the multinational corporations have shown any interest in our problems,"" the head of the village complains.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Black Gold is King Since the beginning of oil production in 1958, Nigeria has risen up to become the world's eighth biggest oil exporter. That makes the country extremely dependent on 'black gold,' which accounts for 90 percent of export profits. That's why people have tolerated pipelines like this one in the Rivers State.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria In the shadow of the gas flame Flames like this one can flare up at any time anywhere in the Niger Delta - be that in the next village over or a few hundred meters away. Burning off gas as part of oil extraction was officially prohibited in 1984, but even 29 years later, no one checks whether Nigerians abide by the law.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Let the people decide The oil companies do not appreciate being accused of ignoring the people in the region. Shell, for its part, advertises its ""Global Memorandum of Understanding"" program - in which communities receive funds and can decide themselves how they want to spend them. The Obio Cottage Women's Clinic in Port Harcourt was rebuilt this way. When asked, every single patient praised Shell's good work.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria No support in Bodo But Bodo hasn't seen any support at all, Kentebe Ebiaridor, of the Environmental Rights Action (ERA) organization, criticizes. The river bank soaked in oil (shown here) is glaring proof of that. ""The men and women here feel abandoned,"" he says.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Cheap gas from the government Many Nigerians see the only share of their country's oil wealth to be the low price they pay for government-subsidized gas. At the end of 2011, one liter cost 65 naira (32 euro cents). However, in early 2012, the government discontinued part of the subsidy. After weeks of protest, the price settled at 97 naira (50 euro cents).

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Dreaming of a small store Franziska Zabbey doesn't profit from the low gas price. She subsists from farming and only rarely leaves Bodo. Her work hardly pays enough for her to survive. "" If Shell compensated us for the oil damage, I could open a small store,"" she hopes. There aren't many other options in Bodo.

Living with the oily waters in Ogoniland, Nigeria Once a fisherman, always a fisherman Even though it's hard to survive on fishing, the fishing boats are maintained. No one knows when they will be able to go out on the water again. The UNEP presumes it will take 25 to 30 years for the waters of Ogoniland to be oil-free. Author: Katrin Gänsler / cb



Findings not a surprise

Aniko Briggs, an environmental activist in the Niger Delta region, says Amnesty's findings are not surprising.

""This is not strange,"" she told DW. ""My organization also collects data: we physically go into the areas of spills. We have documentation going back almost 20 years of different spills across the Niger Delta River state Bayelsa and Delta State. From this we can show very clearly that it does not just take weeks but sometimes months for the oil company to respond to reports of spills. If you look at the fact that the pipes were laid almost 60 years ago — those pipes are still underground — they were laid at a time when the technology we have today was not in existence where you can very quickly detect a spill.""

Previous research by Amnesty had revealed information given in oil spill reports provided by Shell and Eni was often inaccurate. In once instance, Shell allegedly massively underestimated the amount of oil spilt in the small fishing town of Bodo between 2008 and 2009. However with Amnesty's assistance, the Bodo community eventually took legal action, forcing Shell to admit the real amount and pay 55 million pounds (62.3 million euros, $76.5 million) in compensation.

Amnesty to present detailed report

Amnesty now says it plans to present a detailed report of its findings to the Nigerian government, asking it to significantly strengthen its regulation of the oil industry.

A Shell spokesman challenged Amnesty's allegations, calling them ""false, without merit and fail to recognize the complex environment in which the company operates.""

She said the purpose of the Sukuk was to integrate ethical investors into the domestic securities market, adding that the bond was floated to establish a benchmark for pricing of Sukuk by other domestic issuers and offer investors the opportunity to earn returns, while contributing to infrastructure development of the country.

Oniha said the proceeds were being deployed for the construction and rehabilitation of 25 key economic roads projects across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones.

“The listing of the sovereign Sukuk on FMDQ will provide investors with the much needed transparent and efficient platform for price determination and liquidity,” she said.

Oniha said that people that invested in the bond invested for the future, stressing that the bond was initiated to boost the financial inclusion programme of the government to reach out to the unbanked people.

She, however, assured all parties that the funds would be utilised judiciously.

DMO has commenced inspection of the various projects earmarked for the fund.

The Senior Vice President, Economic Development Division, FMDQ, Mr. Emmanuel Etaderhi, congratulated the issuer and co-sponsors to the issue, stating that the issuance would further deepen the domestic debt capital market.

Etaderhi said the issue would increase the range of investible debt securities in the markets, invariably contributing to the development of the nation.

According to him, the listing of the Sukuk on FMDQ will rightly position the nation to continue to maximise its potential via the Nigerian DCM. He reiterated the commitment of the OTC Exchange to continue to support the initiatives of the DMO towards the development of a highly liquid, deep and well-developed DCM in Nigeria.

On his part, the Managing Director, FBNQuest Merchant Bank, Mr. Kayode Akinkugbe, said the company was happy to be associated with the bond.

“We are pleased to have advised the FGN on its N100 billion debut Sukuk issuance.

“And despite the fairly volatile market conditions, we leveraged FBNQuest Merchant Bank’s superb distribution platform to successfully distribute about 65 per cent of the offer,’’ Akinkugbe said.

He said the issuance was the first attempt by the Federal Government to raise funds through non-interest instrument in the capital market for infrastructure development.

This is also expected to deepen the Nigerian capital markets and diversify the government funding sources.

The Associate Executive Director, Capital Markets, FMDQ, Ms Tumi Sekoni, commended the issuer for achieving the milestone.

“This is another highly laudable step by the Sovereign, through the DMO toward supporting the growth and development of the nation’s DCM.’’

She explained that the issuance would pave the way and encourage non-sovereign issuers to explore the issuance of non-interest-bearing securities, thereby adding to the depth and breadth of the domestic capital markets.

According to her, the listing of the pioneer sovereign Sukuk on FMDQ would serve as a benchmark for the pricing of subsequent Sukuk issuances.

24,niger,"Mr Innocent Alumonah, Federal Controller of Works in Anambra says the project work at the Second Niger Bridge linking Asaba in Delta and Onitsha in Anambra is already 44.6 per cent completed.

Alumonah told newsmen on Monday that the contracting firm, Julius Berger Nig. Plc. had also accomplished about 85 piles of 914 millimeter in diameter in different axis.

“The contract was split into phases. Phases 1 to phase 3 have been successfully accomplished and we are now on early works in phase 4. Part of this early works phase 4 forms part of the main contract.

“So far, the 1.2 kilometer sand filling of the road at the Asaba end has reached the height of 2.2 meters out of the expected five meters.

“At the Onitsha end, we have done a lot of sand filling of embankments to a reasonable stage. We have done a lot of culverts as well.

“In all, we have achieved around 44.6 per cent of phase of early work stage 4,” Alumonah said.

He said the contract for the early work stage four was awarded in October 2016 while work commenced in November 2017.

According to him, an advance payment of N2.166 billion was made to the contractor out of the contract sum of N14.466 billion for the early work phase four.

Alumonah said the early work stage four project had a life span of nine months starting from November 2017 to July 2018, noting that there would not be any interruption between stage four and the main contract.

He said the second Niger Bridge was no longer a political issue as President Muhammadu Buhari had demonstrated commitment to realizing the completion of the project.

“The bridge is a link road to all parts of the country not just the South East. It is not a bridge only for the southern part of the country. It is for all Nigerians,” he said.

The controller noted that the continuous maintenance of the existing Niger Bridge built in 1965 was a demonstration of the Federal Government’s commitment.

He said the stress on the existing bridge compelled the Federal Government to build a second Niger Bridge.

He said the issue of compensation of the affected people had been handled by the Federal Government to a reasonable level and had paved way for work at kilometers 23 to 31.

Alumonah assured Nigerians that the main bridge would not take long to be actualised after the early stage four was completed by July.

1,020 Refugees evacuated from Libya to Niger as part of the ETM from November 2017 – March 2018

1,520 Persons profiled by UNHCR in Agadez seeking asylum

8,017 Persons internally displaced in the Tillaberi region

Operational Context

The month of March illustrates the continuity of the increased complexity in the operational context, and the shift from 3 to 5 key situations. The key situations include:

1. The Mali situation: began in 2012 with the outbreak of conflict in northern Mail. The regions of Tillaberi and Tahoua bordering Mali and hosting the majority of the refugees are increasingly affected by insecurity and terrorism. A State of Emergency was declared last year, and extended for a further 6 months in February 2018. There are currently 57, 067 Malian refugees in Niger, as well as over 8,000 IDPs in the region of Tillaberi. UNHCR aims to support the socio-economic integration of these refugees and the closure of the camps by the end of 2019.

2. The Nigeria situation: began in 2013, with the arrival of the first Nigerian refugees across the border. The situation deteriorated with the first attacks in Niger territory in 2015. There are over 250,000 displaced persons in the region (108,470 refugees, 129,015 IDPs and 14,820 returnees – Govt. of Niger, Oct 2017). The majority live in spontaneous sites or with the local population, while UNHCR manages one camp, with 12,194 people.

3. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): In the Diffa region, the situation is extremely mixed. Efforts are underway to complete biometric registration of all displaced persons, including IDPs, who are often faced with similar protection risks as refugees. However, the IDP situation in Niger has become more complex with increasing insecurity in the region of Tillaberi. In 2018, attacks and insecurity in that area have resulted in the internal displacement of at least 8,017 people for the first time.

4. Mixed Migration: Niger is a major crossroads of migratory movements northwards towards Libya,

Algeria and the Mediterranean. These migratory flows constitute mixed migration, including economic migrants and persons in need of international protection. In Agadez, UNHCR works to identify asylum seekers within the migratory flows and works with the government, as well as IOM and NGOs to provide these persons with information and assistance. 1,520 persons, mostly Sudanese, are currently profiled by UNHCR in Agadez, awaiting registration with the government.

5. Emergency Evacuation Transit Mechanism (ETM): This programme aims to provide life-saving assistance and long-term solutions to the most vulnerable refugees trapped in detention in Libya, through evacuation to Niger, which has temporarily extended its asylum space. The aim is to seek durable solutions, including resettlement for these refugees, who are mainly Eritrean, Somalian,

Ethiopian, Sudanese and South Sudanese. To date, 1,020 people have been evacuated from Libya to Niger. 37 of these refugees have already been resettled to France while an additional 67 are awaiting resettlement to both France and Switzerland in the coming weeks. 2 refugees received humanitarian visas from Switzerland, while 2 unaccompanied children have been reunited with their mother in Sweden, through family reunification. At least 2 more resettlement missions from third countries are expected in the month of April.

Security Situation

The security situation in the regions of Tahoua and Tillaberi in particular has continued to deteriorate.

March once again saw serious clashes between extremist groups south of Menaka in Mali. On the 27th of March, Kodjagabeli forest situated 70kms from Makalondi was occupied by terrorists. It was followed by violent clashes between Burkina Faso defence forces and terrorists. The dispersal of elements of terrorist groups in the north-eastern part of Mali impacts on the areas of Niger bordering Mali, with new areas being affected by terrorism and an increase in criminal attacks. Military operations continue in the North of Tillaberi causing access limitations to some areas located close to the Malian border.

Huge internal displacements have occurred (9-18 of March), affecting 7,477 persons in Inates commune alone. The total estimated number of IDPs in the Tillaberi region has increased in one month from 1,540 to 8,017 and is still ongoing.

In the past weeks, the Diffa region saw targeted kidnappings and killings of civilians, most likely perpetrated by Boko Haram (BH). Criminal activities to access primary resources (food, water, medications, and equipment) are reported and also remain likely to continue in the Diffa region.

Additionally, BH conducted 2 new offensives in Toumour on March 17th and N'Guel Kolo on March 24th, in which 5 civilians lost their lives. These incidents reflect the precarious security situation in the region.","Niger: Country Operation Update, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-country-operation-update-march-2018
