0,niger,"Members of Congress are expected to be briefed on the full report of the investigation into the deaths of four soldiers in Niger last year. The soldiers were part of special forces in that country when they came under attack by terrorist forces.

Congressman Steve Russell, R-Oklahoma, himself a combat veteran has reviewed the report that will be made public, as well as the 6,000 pages of classified material accompany the report. Representative Russell told FOX 25 the report backs up what he found in his own investigation.





Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, and Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, and Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, died as a result of an ambush attack in the remote village of Tongo Tongo in Niger on October 4, 2017.

In February, Russell traveled to Niger and met with U.S. forces and local military leaders in the wake of the attack that killed four soldiers.

“I have read the classified report; it did not change my conclusions about the outcome,” Russell told FOX 25. The congressman said he believes the decisions made by the unit would not have changed the tragic outcome. However, the report does include some decisions Russell said that were made up the chain of command that could have been better. Though Russell still believes even improved times for support would not have changed the outcome.

“What you did not see in my investigation,” Russell said, “Was anything other than absolute sacrificial bravery.”

Critics of the administration and the military’s handling of the situation have said the mission was unprepared and a combination of bad choices and bad luck led to the deaths of the soldiers.

“I don't understand why members of Congress, and I suffered this while I was a soldier on battlefield, wondering how people in Washington could make their mouths say something so stupid sometimes when it comes to military operations,” Russell said.

Using his experience as a commander in battle, Russell said the report and his own ground investigation back up that the unit operating in Niger did act appropriately. He still believes some in Congress will not understand the realities of military operations.

“We'll point bony fingers and pound fists on tables and going how did you let this happen military?” Russell explained, “Failing to understand that sometimes a clever enemy gets a vote and sometimes you can surprise people in ambushes and sometimes people die.”

“The untold story here is they weren't all wiped out even though they were small in number,” Russell said. “They didn't give up and continued to fight.”

Russell said that was also true of the Niger soldiers who had been trained and were along on the mission.

The attack marked the first time the United States has lost military personnel in Niger. Critics of the expanded use of the nation’s military in countries around the world should not be a priority.

“I don't want to live in an America that is no longer a force for good,” Russell said in defense of U.S. operations abroad. “I mean if we are so selfish that we just sit here and say everybody else can go die and wither away...that's not a country we've ever been and I'm not sure it's one we want to become.”

Russell said critics of the military’s presence in countries like Niger fail to take into account the big picture. As terrorists lose their traditional strongholds they have been moving into Africa and threaten to destabilize nations that have long been peaceful.

“If we disengage it doesn't improve it actually gets worse,” Russell said. “In Africa what has made it more risky is frail economies. If they fail, then you've got disease, you've got famine and you've got refugee crisis; you've got human suffering on a by the millions scale.”",Report on ambush attack in Niger confirms Oklahoma Congressman's investigation,http://okcfox.com/news/connect-to-congress/report-on-ambush-attack-in-niger-confirms-oklahoma-congressmans-investigation
1,niger,"Amid questions over the role of the U.S. military in this part of the world, there is a renewed focus on training local law enforcement officers in the hopes that extremism can be better countered at the community level and along borders. The challenges are great in Niger, where residents of its vast, largely ungoverned spaces say they are losing confidence in authorities.

The police training in one of Africa’s most remote, impoverished countries is crucial as extremists linked to Daesh and Al Qaeda carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa’s vast Sahel region. In October, four U.S. soldiers and five Nigeriens were killed in an ambush claimed by Islamic State group-linked fighters in rural Niger.

NIAMEY, Niger—Under the watchful eyes of U.S. authorities, an elite group of local police officers in Niger’s capital slipped into a home, rescued a “hostage,” detained an “extremist” and pretended to kill another.

As extremism grows “it’s important not to lose sight of the issues at the core of their proliferation and recruitment success, notably bad and often abusive governance,” said Corinne Dufka, Human Rights Watch’s West Africa director. “The Islamist groups are cleverly exploiting local grievances to make inroads with local populations.”

That includes abusive practices by local security forces, she said, calling efforts to professionalize them key.

The U.S. ambassador to Niger, Eric P. Whitaker, said the U.S. is addressing the “factors that create an environment for extremism” by investing more than $500 million (U.S.) over the next few years into local programs for better governance, education, health, agriculture, security and more.

The State Department’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program also is addressing such concerns by training local security forces in everything from border control and investigations to human rights and justice.

After an attack killed 20 people at a luxury hotel in Mali’s capital in November 2015, the U.S. invested $15 million in training nearly 100 local police in crisis response. They also were given the necessary equipment to respond to further attacks, according to Samuel L. Pineda, director in the office of programs with the department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism.

The program has paid off, he said. Several of the trained officers responded during the March 2016 attack on the European Union military training mission’s headquarters in Bamako. And during the June 2017 attack on a resort popular with foreigners outside the capital they helped to kill attackers and rescue victims.

“We want to create transparent forces and we want the people to trust those forces,” Pineda said. “Nobody wants their local market blown up … so if they have the trust of the population, the information comes back in.”

In 2018, the Bureau of Counterterrorism will invest an estimated $106 million in sub-Saharan Africa.

About $50 million of that is dedicated to State Department counterterrorism programs in West and Central Africa, including ones in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Mauritania.

The crisis response program in Mali eventually will be replicated in Niger, where the Antiterrorism Assistance Program has dedicated roughly $10 million to training and equipment this year.

During the U.S. military’s annual Flintlock counterterrorism exercises this month in Niger, local officers put their training to the test, collaborating with Niger’s gendarmerie and military as well as security forces from other West African nations.

The officers who participated in the raid in the capital, Niamey, are part of the Special Program for Embassy Augmentation and Response, known as SPEAR, which was created after the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to train and equip host-nation police units designated as first responders to U.S. diplomatic facilities in crisis. They also can respond to other attacks.

“We train them for an eventuality,” said Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Kent Miller, who manages the Antiterrorism Assistance Program in Niger. “In the current year and last year there has been a focus on rural environments.”

The goal is to disrupt extremists at borders so they don’t make it into more populated areas, he said.

In cities, the hope is that crisis response units and SPEAR officers will respond. They are provided with arms, ammunition, equipment, facilities for practicing raids, a gun range and mentorship.

“The importance of training is that it puts the elements of knowledge for reaction in our hands, and we can then apply them in real-world situations,” said Djibril Ousmane, an assistant police commander in the capital.

The challenge, however, is that extremists also are giving money to communities to win them over, he said.

“It’s difficult to fight poverty,” Ousmane said. “With the right means, more can be done.”","U.S. includes local police in counterterror fight in Niger, across Africa",https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/04/28/us-includes-local-police-in-counterterror-fight-in-niger-across-africa.html
2,niger,"""According to the Grand Bargain commitments, there is a need for more direct support and funding to local and national responders. Through this project, we will strengthen civil society organisations' capacity to respond professionally to humanitarian crises, and better help people affected,"" says Felix Muhigana, NORCAP Project Manager.

Close to 17 million people are affected by the humanitarian emergency across the four Lake Chad basin countries; Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. The crisis is characterised as one of the world's most severe. More than 2.3 million people are displaced, and communities are suffering from violence, food insecurity and malnutrition.

""Unchartered terrain""

Four NORCAP experts are already on their way to Niger and Chad. They are hosted by World Food Programme and UNICEF, but will work independently from their host agencies.

""We are very excited to do a completely new project. This is unchartered terrain for us, and for NORCAP"", says Slim Florian Bacha, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and deployee to UNICEF in N'Djamena, Chad.

According to Muhigana, the deployees will map and identify those civil society organisations that are most in need of capacity building and help them develop skills and expertise in areas such as financial management, organisational development and monitoring and evaluation.

""This is the kind of expertise that the organisations said they needed the most. In addition, deployees will link up with existing donors in Chad and Niger, to advocate and enable organisations to get direct access to donors and funds. With a better knowledge of how these things work, they will be able to better serve people in need, says Felix Muhigana.

""This project has a lot of potential, because we are able to set an example of how this can and should be done. At the same time, it is a huge responsibility. We will communicate closely across the region and with our Project manager, to make sure we get off to a good start"", explains Karolina Olofsson, Organisational Development Coordination Expert. She is going to work from Diffa, in Niger, with WFP.

Stepping stone for the future

NORCAP's collaboration with the Civil Society Network begun with the Lake Chad Donor Conference in Oslo, February 2017. The conference raised awareness about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin, aiming to ensure donors pledged money and commitment to scale up humanitarian interventions and alleviate human suffering.

During the conference, the Civil Society Network, an organisation with representatives from the Lake Chad Basin countries, approached NORCAP for a possible partnership. NORCAP did a scoping mission to Chad and Niger, which in turn secured funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""This project is very different from what we've done before, but it speaks to NORCAP's strategic commitments. During the project's pilot phase, we will actively explore additional partnerships to further develop local capacity in the Lake Chad basin, including with relevant donors,"" says Ulf Flink, Head of the NORCAP Unit in NORCAP.",Empowering the first responders,https://www.nrc.no/expert-deployment/2016/2018/empowering-the-first-responders2/
3,niger,"In Cape Town, the residents brace for “Day Zero” in late August, when the taps could run dry. Further north, in the Sahel, drought has prematurely thrust migrating communities into the crosshairs of soldiers from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, adding to the conflict around the Lake Chad Basin.

Looking out her window at the snow-covered ground following another nor’easter, climate scientist Lisa Goddard ponders weather’s effect on other global crises: the drought leading to the Syrian civil war, torrential rain causing floods in India and Pakistan, the recent hurricanes that wrecked the Caribbean — outcomes she might have predicted. But unlike a TV meteorologist, Goddard, director of Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), doesn’t attempt to forecast the weather on any specific day. Rather, she looks months ahead, offering longer-term predictions — a bit like The Old Farmer’s Almanac but with “climatology and actual statistics of variability behind it,” she says.

“We study phenomena that may cause a region’s climate to differ from previous years,” Goddard continues. “A key factor is the temperature of the oceans … and since ocean currents change slowly, we can anticipate their effects on the atmosphere.”

As the director of IRI, which assists developing countries to prepare for and manage the impacts of climate change, Goddard, 51, has traveled from Colombia to Zambia — and many countries in between — helping to build national forecasting systems from scratch and working with aid agencies, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to anticipate the next weather emergency. Until just recently, however, neither Goddard nor academics in general have been seated at the tables of the United Nations, the World Bank or any other multilateral organization advising on policy and programs for society at large.

Goddard is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.”

That will soon change. In April 2017, President Lee Bollinger announced Columbia World Projects (CWP) — perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in his nearly 16-year tenure — to connect the capacities of the Ivory Tower to organizations with the power to translate research into programs that benefit the global community. “The extraordinary developments in recent decades of greater interconnectedness … have created or accelerated highly complex problems and have given rise to political movements favoring a reversal or change of course,” Bollinger said in a statement announcing CWP. “The multilateral institutions created in the period following the Second World War are straining under new realities. … All of this calls out for universities to become more involved.”

Nicholas Lemann, former dean of Columbia’s journalism school, has been tasked with directing CWP, and Goddard will lead its inaugural project focused on climate threats to food production and nutrition in six countries (Ethiopia, Senegal, Colombia, Guatemala, Bangladesh and Vietnam). In addition to improving food security, her goals include expanding economic livelihoods and supporting environmental stability. Goddard also wants to expand an enterprise created and implemented at the IRI — index insurance, which issues payouts to farmers in years when the weather causes categorical loss.

Surprisingly, climate change did not drive Goddard’s interest in weather. It started instead with a love of physics. Born in California to a teacher and a government official, Goddard received her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in atmospheric and oceanic sciences from Princeton University. While at Princeton, she developed a curiosity about the cyclical El Niño climate pattern, which brought her to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the El Niño guru himself: Mark Cane, who helped build the first computer model to successfully predict the 1985 El Niño months in advance. Cane went on to found the IRI with a mission to help millions of people by better preparing for the effects of droughts and changing ocean temperatures.

“I have known Lisa since she was a student, and as the IRI director, she has worked a miracle, taking an organization that was demoralized and facing a serious threat to its existence, and bringing it to extraordinary vibrancy,” says Cane, referring to IRI’s loss of funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which threatened to shutter the institute a few years back.

“I believe the IRI is increasingly recognized worldwide as the expert institution for application of climate science to societies in the developing world. This was what the IRI was intended to be, but it took Lisa to make it a reality,” Cane adds.

For her part, Goddard, who has two sons and lives north of Manhattan near the Hudson River, says that she is less concerned about melting icecaps and “sky is falling” predictions than developing a “global framework for climate services.” Still, she has her critics. Judith Curry, a former professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, says that IRI’s seasonal forecasting methods are several levels below state of the art.

“Their approach relies heavily on forecasts of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña, which has no particular skill beyond a few months,” Curry says. “Even if they were able to accurately predict [the El Niño effect], this shows very little skill in predicting the intensity of the Asian and African monsoon rains. Simply put, they are not using the best models, and their interpretation of the drivers of climate dynamics is overly simplistic.”

Goddard says that even the best models have errors and biases. “This is something that is not handled in any sophisticated way for real-time prediction at any other center in the world,” she explains. “The biggest sin in the prediction world … is using the output of a model, straight off the shelf, and without consideration of those who are using the information.” People of all backgrounds with a little training can make use of the information the IRI provides, Goddard insists, not just climate scientists.

“Once, in a meeting in Kenya,” Goddard recalls, “a colleague of mine communicated the concept of probability, which is not a word in their local language, to aid workers by using a paper airplane, which he flew repeatedly, marking all the spots where it landed on the floor to represent the range of possible climate outcomes.

“The locals got it, and their communities have since embraced our forecasts.”",Severe Weather Ahead: She's Predicting the Next Climate Crisis,https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/severe-weather-ahead-shes-predicting-the-next-climate-crisis/85664

ABIDJAN,

Around 1,500 economic migrants have been taken from Algeria to Niger in recent days by the UN's migration agency, its Niamey chief said on Thursday.

Giuseppe Loprete from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) told AFP around ""600 Cameroonians, two large groups of Malians and Guineans"" as well as nationals from other African countries were taken to Agadez, northern Niger's main city.

The economic migrants were either stranded in the middle of the desert at Assamaka — in Niger next to the Algeria border — after being turned back at the frontier or were deported forcibly after entering the country.

They are now being cared for in Agadez by IOM who have provided tents, food and care, according to Loprete.

Around 3,000 migrants are currently housed at the Agadez centre, although its capacity is just 1,000.

The town governor has made land available for the overspill.

On behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced over $27 million in funding to humanitarian partners to support people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.

Canada is providing assistance to address the critical needs of the more than 20 million people who are affected by drought, food shortages and ongoing conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.

In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance as a result of conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. In Cameroon in particular, more than half a million people are displaced because of conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and Central African Republic, adding pressure to already scarce resources and limited basic services in host communities. Canada’s contribution will provide vulnerable communities with food, acute malnutrition treatment, clean water, health care, protection services, including psychosocial support, and support for livelihoods.

Parliamentary Secretary DeCourcey made the announcement during his trip to Africa, which included a visit to Cameroon.

“Populations in the Lake Chad Basin are facing a dire humanitarian situation as conditions continue to deteriorate because of conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. Canada is proud to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and ensure those requiring emergency assistance are reached. This support will save lives and help to alleviate the suffering of people living in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.”

Matt DeCourcey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs

Quick facts

In 2018, 3.3 million people will need life-saving assistance in Cameroon to meet their basic needs. This represents an increase of approximately 14% since 2017.

The funding announced today is in addition to the nearly $20 million in humanitarian assistance already announced in 2018. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s total contribution this year for Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria to over $47 million.

In February 2018, Minister Bibeau visited Maiduguri and Bama, in northeast Nigeria, where she met with members of communities affected by the Lake Chad Basin crisis, including survivors of gender-based violence, children and new mothers, as well as representatives of key humanitarian organizations.

6,niger,"Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc Austin Avuru has said the Niger Delta crises is one of the major challenges facing oil production in the country.

Avuru noted that, “in Nigeria, the biggest challenge is the impact any crisis in the Niger Delta could have on our production and evacuation of our products.

“We saw 16 months of minimal production when the Trans-Forcados pipeline was down and how it impacted on us. That is our highest risk. We are hedging against that by having multiple avenues or routes for evacuation of our products.”

He told Punch that, “We are working with neighbours and other stakeholders to put the escravos pipeline in place, to complete and commission it and we still have option in Warri refinery if we are pushed to the wall.

“Here, we consciously established three options of evacuating our production. In the east of the country, we are trying to develop our OML 53 from the scratch.

“We would develop this along with two other options of evacuation. We try to build redundancy in evacuation to hedge against that risk.”",Niger Delta Crisis Major Challenge In Oil Production – SEPLAT,https://www.concisenews.global/2018/04/30/niger-delta-crises-major-challenge-in-oil-production-seplat/
7,niger,"Austin Avuru is the Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc. He spoke to journalists on the company’s corporate governance policy, vision and recent elevation by the Nigerian bourse. STANLEY OPARA was there

With oil prices looking up thus far this year and volumes stabilised, what should investors expect from Seplat by year end?

The culture is that as an oil and gas production company, we guide for production and we don’t guide for profit. The banks and other businesses can do that. By the time we publish our first quarter financial results, we will guide for the rest of 2018 in terms of production and so on.

What are the threats you foresee as a business?

For our operations in Nigeria, the biggest challenge is the impact any crisis in the Niger Delta could have on our production and evacuation of our products.

We saw 16 months of minimal production when the Trans-Forcados pipeline was down and how it impacted on us. That is our highest risk. We are hedging against that by having multiple avenues or routes for evacuation of our products.

We are working with neighbours and other stakeholders to put the escravos pipeline in place, to complete and commission it and we still have option in Warri refinery if we are pushed to the wall.

Here, we consciously established three options of evacuating our production. In the east of the country, we are trying to develop our OML 53 from the scratch. We would develop this along with two other options of evacuation. We try to build redundancy in evacuation to hedge against that risk.

Seplat is currently listed on the Nigerian and London stock exchanges and had recently made it to the elite board of the NSE. What is the company’s motivation?

Originally, we started as a growth company. We took over asset and we consciously work the asset and more than tripled production in about four years, from 18,000 barrels per day to 60,000bpd. Prices were good then until between mid-2015 and 2017.

Two things happened to us simultaneously; prices dropped and production crashed because of crisis outside our control and Trans-Forcados that led to dip in our production performance, revenue generation, productivity and profitability. In fact, in 2016 full year, we had a loss of about N166bn.

We only worked out through 2017 to turnaround the position to profitability.

Very germane to this rebound is our corporate governance stance. It is through this same corporate governance practice upon which we operate that we were able to navigate the company from the two years of treacherous condition outside our control.

We raised $350m bond just last month and $300m revolver credit. So, our overall average cost of debt has gone down by 300 per cent from our creditors. Our balance sheet is completely restructured.

Every time I talk about governance as a matter of a culture being imperative for us to deliver long term and sustainable good performance. We really do believe in it. It is not about priding ourselves as being in Premium Board of the NSE. When we say we are proud of ourselves because of what we really believe in to deliver the long term benefit to our stakeholders, we, indeed, mean it.

How did Seplat make it to the NSE’s Premium Board?

A number of factors were responsible. Starting with liquidity, you have to have free float of shares of over 20 per cent; but for us as a company our free float is closer to 50 per cent than 20 per cent already and with a company like this free float of shares can only increase.

You either tap from the market or you do a merger or whatever you can do in the future to dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and increase the free float. So, we are consciously working on that to increase the liquidity on the stock.

For market capitalisation, other than liquidity, two critical elements are size and governance, and size is about market capitalisation. So, if we continue to do the right things and for us internally, we believe that if you consciously and as a matter of culture continue to do the right things, even without prompting, ultimately you will see the benefits and the benefits will come in value creation and this will translate to increase in the value of the company.

So, all things being equal, except for things outside our control, we expect our market capitalisation to also continuously increase and not lower than where we are now.

When Seplat applied for listing on the NSE Premium Board, its market capitalisation was just over N200bn, but on the day of our elevation to the Premium Board, our market capitalisation was N396bn, and as at the end of trading on that day of our listing it went up to N404bn, and so it doubled the minimum requirement for qualifying to be listed on the Premium Board.

Thus, the most critical is governance. We have spent seven and half years building a company we believe in. If you make the best practice of corporate governance as a culture you will ultimately see the result; that is what you are seeing.

We are only four years old on the Exchange and we are already in the Premium Board. In fact, we are seven and half years as a company in operations and eight years as a registered company.

We started as a company on August 1, 2010. We are less than eight years old and we have come this far; this is not by chance, it has been a deliberate effort by the board and management team and how to create this governance culture. So what you saw today (during listing) is an attestation of the result of what we have been doing in the past seven and half years and still counting.

What does this elite board listing mean to Seplat, its shareholders and other stakeholders?

For us, it is a very important milestone in taking a very long term view in our strategic vision. From the outset, we knew that Seplat was going to aim very high and we are very clear in our mind that corporate governance is the base. So, we continuously make sure that best practices are in core of our business.

We are very happy that having gone through that scrutiny when we did our listing on the London Stock Exchange and NSE, we were sure that corporate governance, very high level best practices scrutiny was important and that is what our recent elevation has indeed eloquently testified to.

The message obviously for all the investors is that it is a clear message that they are with the right company. The next point is that it is going to create the ability for many of our investors to see more liquidity happening in their securities. It is also going to mean that the securities they hold have value at the highest echelon or segment of the capital market.

What is the company’s production target for 2018?

We will be providing the guide for our production in 2018 as soon as our Q1 financial results are released.

Following the company’s recent bond issuance, what possible investments will the company be making?

For the bond, we have two tranches of debts – $700m from Nigerian banks and $300m from foreign banks and both debts were $1bn. By the end of 2017, we had paid off about $400m in capital repayment and not just interest.

So, both debts combined, we are down to $650m, but we also have cash in hand. Our gross debt consists of $350m of bond and $200m that we withdrew out of the $300m revolver. We also have cash in hand of about $350m. Really, our net debt is down to under $200m /$250m.

All of that translate to the fact that our balance sheet has been restructured from a very difficult situation. So two things will happen or two things can be enabled: we can invest more money in the business since in two years, between 2015 and 2017, we had not drilled anywhere.

So, we are going back to drilling and invest more on our gas business. We have cash to invest and that is one key result of this exercise of borrowing. Secondly, we will be in a good position if we see opportunity for any acquisition we will be in a good position to participate.

Where we are today is a far cry from where we were two years ago. We were first struggling to survive following the crisis in the Niger Delta. Now we have a strong balance sheet and cash flow.

How are you going to sustain this transparency culture?

Certainly, our intention is to sustain and even surpass our present performance. It takes a lot of discipline and effort to be where we are. People talk about reporting, transparency, and discipline; it looks that simple. You have to do the right things to be proud to disclose what you are doing. If you are cutting corners even before disclosure you won’t get there.

For our esteemed investors, what we said to investors when we were doing our road show for the bond is to reinstate dividend. Our intention is to reinstate dividend as a matter of policy. We suspended dividend in 2016 because of crises beyond our control, which means, any year we fail to pay dividend it will as a result of force majeure. But in a normal course of business we will normally be able to pay a certain level of dividend to our shareholders.

8,niger,"The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) has said that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration cannot fold its hands and watch the Niger Bridge, which was built in the 1950s, to collapse.



Fashola stated this while inspecting ongoing repairs and maintenance works on the Niger Bridge, adding that the Federal Government was mindful of the fact that the bridge remains the vital East-West link which has enhanced both socio-political and economic activities in the country, and as such, should not be allowed to collapse.

The minister, who was represented by the Director, Highways, (Bridges and Design), Engineer Adetokunbo Sogbesan disclosed that government has rekindled its efforts to fill the foundation of the existing Niger Bridge facing serious erosion challenges and to replace the vandalized bolts, nuts and rails.



He noted that the second Niger Bridge which is 1.59 km in length comprises of four sections namely: the Asaba Road, the Toll Plaza, the bridge and the Onitsha Road section.



Describing the bridge, Fashola pointed out that it will have two underpasses classified as secondary bridges planned at Amakom village in Delta State and Atani in Anambra State with an interchange at Obosi Junction of the Onitsha-Owerri Road.

9,niger,"Governors from Lake Chad Basin will meet in Maiduguri, North-East Nigeria to discuss regional approach to addressing the Boko Haram Crisis.



Nearly a decade after Boko Haram commenced its insurgency activities in North-East, the crisis has taken a regional dimension leaving millions displaced, billions worth in damages to property across the region.



Reuters reported within the week that insurgents were holding territories while also taking taxes in the Lake Chad region.



This has prompted international calls for addressing the crisis using a regional approach.



Following the visit by the UN Security Council in March 2017, Resolution 2349 on Boko Haram and Lake Chad was adopted.

The Resolution called upon Governments in the region to address the root-causes of the crisis.

10,niger,"The 6,000 page Pentagon report on the ambush in which ODA 3212 was caught near Tongo Tongo, Niger, in October of 2017 is now complete; according to the Wall Street Journal, family members have been briefed and now Congressional leaders will be briefed prior to a sanitized version of the report being released to the public. The report indicates exactly what was expected based on SOFREP’s initial reporting of the ambush the day after it occurred: that U.S. military leaders were preparing to place the entire burden of the ambush on non-commissioned officers and junior officers, while the generals and colonels deferred responsibility. The Pentagon’s plan to throw the ODA under the bus and blame risk assessments was underway before the remains of Sgt. La David Johnson had even been recovered.

According to a New York Times story published in March, Secretary Mattis and General Dunford knew that something was amiss with the Niger report early on. The article states:

The two officials said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, are troubled that low-level officers are being blamed for the botched mission instead of senior commanders who should be aware when American troops are undertaking a high-risk raid.”

At that point, both men must have been aware of what the Pentagon was trying to do by deferring responsibility and placing the entire burden for the ambush on lower ranking soldiers. What corrective measures were taken as the report was being compiled, if any, remains unknown.

What we do know about the Niger report thus far demonstrates just how completely out of touch the Pentagon is with what soldiers on the ground actually experience. The report blames the ambush partly on a culture of risk taking, a culture that is deliberately cultivated in Special Operations soldiers as the Pentagon itself orders Special Forces ODAs to undertake dangerous missions. If the Pentagon’s first priority is mitigating risk, then they should stop sending soldiers into war zones.

Another oblivious comment from the senior officers who penned the report indicates that an officer copy and pasted information from a previously authorized concept of the operation (CONOP) document into the CONOP which was submitted for the October 4th mission in which ODA 3212 was ambushed. Why this surprises anyone defies explanation at this point. Such activities have been happening for years. At this moment, soldiers are no doubt conducting combat operations in which information in their CONOP was cut and pasted from somewhere else. In fact, junior officers are essentially forced to do this due to the amount of mandatory paperwork and bureaucracy that is forced upon them.

After a mission, junior officers have to compile what is known as an Operations Summary (OPSUM) which describes what happened on the mission and includes a storyboard — a collage of pictures taken by the soldiers on the mission to prove to senior officers that they actually did what they said they did, which in and of itself implies to the men that their leadership does not trust them. OPSUMs have to be submitted almost immediately after the team returns to base, sometimes within minutes of arriving back at a Forward Operating Base, tired and exhausted. In this scenario, higher headquarters is literally telling junior officers to lie to them by demanding such quick turn arounds on OPSUM report submissions. The Special Forces Captain is forced to fudge the paperwork because he is being asked to do something that can’t realistically be done and everyone knows it.

The same goes for CONOPs which often have to be compiled quickly and require levels upon levels of approval. Senior leaders actually demand far more information from the ODA than they themselves can ever process. An embarrassing demonstration of this occurred years ago when an ODA member submitted a CONOP in which the enemy was described as “Sand Niggers.” It’s one thing that racial epithets were used on the report, and it was unprofessional and not in line with Army values. However, the deeper lesson was that no one actually reads these reports. This one went all the way up to Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa, Florida before anyone caught the racial slur. Another example occurred early on in the war against ISIS when Delta operators submitted a CONOP for them to go outside the wire with their Iraqi counter-parts when this was not an authorized part of their mission. That CONOP went all the way up to the White House before it was caught and the operators were told to stand down.

The phenomena of soldiers on the ground being overloaded with onerous, mandatory training has largely come to light due to the impactful work of Dr. Leonard Wong at the Army War College. His study found that soldiers have more mandatory training than they have training days in the calendar year, leaving soldiers overburdened and unable to coach, teach and mentor junior soldiers on their actual job. Thankfully, Secretary Mattis and Secretary of the Army Mark Esper have begun the process of reducing mandatory training. However, the bureaucracy thrust upon the sergeants and junior officers in combat remains.

Another indication of how out of touch the Pentagon is with their own troops is exampled by their own press releases in the hours and days after the ambush. At first, the mission ODA 3212 was conducting was described as a recon mission, then a training mission, and finally they conceded that it was a capture/kill high value target raid. It seems inevitable that they would be out of touch — the headquarters for Africa Command (AFRICOM) isn’t even in Africa, it is in Germany. For senior military officers, the lesson here will be to institute a deeper level of micromanagement, contrary to the de-centralized manner in which Special Forces is designed to operate. The potential political risk of an unconventional warfare campaign does not level out in the minds of senior officers and politicians. None of them wants another Benghazi on their hands.

CONOPs, OPSUMs and storyboards have been little more than finger drills for well over a decade, and that this comes as a surprise to the Pentagon in their Niger report indicates how completely out of touch they are with the men who work where the rubber meets the road. As planned from the beginning, ODA 3212 and Captain Perozeni will now have to be sacrificed at the alter of Pentagon politics; the man on the ground will be blamed for everything that went wrong so that the colonels and generals can remain on their career tracks unscathed.

11,niger,"Niamey/Nairobi/Geneva, 17 April 2018 – The rising number of people fleeing conflict and the arrival of thousands of migrants are overwhelming public health facilities in Niger, putting scores of families at risk – including tens of thousands of malnourished children.

More than 400,000 people – including some 160,000 children suffering from malnutrition – are now in need of emergency health services in Niger’s Diffa region.

“Migrants living in Niger are very vulnerable and require a lot of support in many areas,” said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Regional Director for Africa at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) “Unfortunately, they arrive in poverty-stricken areas where communities lack almost everything; increasing the risk of tensions between local people and migrants. There is a need to strike a balance between providing humanitarian support to migrants and responding to the needs of local people who host migrants within their communities.”

Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. The Human Development Index ranks it 187th out of 188 countries. Over the last five years, the Diffa region in the West African country has experienced an unprecedented and complex humanitarian crisis. Compounding this poverty, and because of it, recurrent violence has uprooted hundreds of thousands of civilians. Many people have been forced to flee multiple times and have been left destitute, with few possessions and no means to sustain their lives and those of their families.

Niger’s humanitarian challenges are made worse because the country is part of a key migratory route for thousands of Africans who continue to make the perilous journey to reach Europe in hopes of a better life. The continued influx of migrants has put pressure on health facilities, reducing access to primary health care and referrals for both displaced and host populations.

In addition to hosting thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from neighbouring countries, there are locally displaced people in the country. The situation has further deteriorated because of recent droughts, that have caused food insecurity.

“Nutritional support, as well as health, water and sanitation services are the most urgent needs. Malnutrition in the Diffa region has reached serious emergency levels”, said Ali Bandiare, President of the Red Cross Society of Niger.

IFRC is appealing for 1.6 million Swiss francs to strengthen the Niger Red Cross’s humanitarian response to save lives and reduce the suffering of tens of thousands of people. The emergency appeal will allow Red Cross staff and volunteers to provide awareness sessions, malnutrition screening and referral, community-based disease surveillance, water and sanitation, as well as maternal and neonatal health services to more than 43,000 people (over 6,100 families) in three districts of the Diffa region.

Eight years after, facts have emerged on how the Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, nominated the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.

The letter titled: ‘Nomination for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize: Re: Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, President, Federal Republic of Nigeria’ and dated January 6, 2009, was addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Oslo, Norway.

Ekweremadu predicated Yar’Adua’s nomination on the late president’s inclination for peace and justice for all, noting that although Yar’Adua had the option of full military operation in the Niger Delta, he chose the dialogue and amnesty option in resolving the militancy challenge in the region.

He wrote in part: “President Yar’Adua is a man with natural inclination for peace and justice. He has demonstrated an uncommon ability for achieving peace in his capacities as the President of Nigeria and the Chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

“Situations in the Niger Delta region had already assumed monumentally grave proportions bordering on insurgency at the time the President assumed leadership of Nigeria on May 29, 2007.

“The youths of the region had mobilised into the creeks and taken up arms in their tens of thousands under different fronts to wrest the control of their resources from the Federal Government of Nigeria, kidnapping oil workers, and sabotaging foreign oil interests with direct impact on oil productions and revenues.

“Although the president had the usual option of total military engagement to dislodge the militants, with attendant humanitarian consequences in the Niger Delta, he chose the peaceful options of dialogue and unconditional amnesty to all the militants.

“This has been nationally and globally acclaimed as an uncommon masterstroke and a huge success. Over 30,000 militants embraced the olive branch, denounced violence, and turned in their weapons. They are currently quartered in rehabilitation camps where they are also undergoing vocational trainings.

“Furthermore, the president has undertaken robust policy initiatives to deliver physical and human capital development in the region. He has practically committed billions of naira towards this in addition to the mandate of the existing Niger Delta Development Commission and a distinct Ministry of Niger Delta, which he created to directly oversee and speed up development in the Niger Delta area. This has resulted in calm, safety of lives and property in the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea.”

When contacted, the Special Adviser on Media to the Deputy President of Senate, Mr. Uche Anichukwu, who confirmed the authenticity of the letter, however, revealed that the former president did not know about it before his death.

However, a copy of the acknowledgement letter from Nobel Prize Committee was eventually transmitted to his widow, Hajiya Turai Yar’Adua.

“Even though the prize was ultimately clinched by Liu Xiaobo, Ekweremadu was nevertheless happy that the former president’s name had gone down in history as a man naturally inclined to peace and justice and indeed a father to all,” he said.

It said Federal Government’s continued failure not to compel Niger Delta militants to return to the creeks over its alleged refusal to appropriate resources for the full implementation of the Act establishing the university.

National President of the group, Austin Ozobo, in a statement, yesterday, said: “As critical stakeholders, we make bold to say that the Federal Government is pushing the Niger Delta region and its agitators back to the creeks, as starving the university of fund is provocative and capable of fanning the embers of discord.”

“We believe that FUPRE is starved financially because the university is positioned and located in the Niger Delta. This is a threat to the existing peace in the region.

“The Nigeria government should learn a lesson of how nepotism and injustice against the Niger Delta region could crumble the country’s economy and put it under unimaginable recession.”

It condemned the act and warned against the non-financial implementation of the FUPRE Act in the 2018 budget and deprivation of the institution of excess crude oil fund derived from increase in the oil benchmark.

It argued that FUPRE was established by the Federal Government to promote local human capacity training, development and research to advance the oil sector but it was grappling with underfunding and infrastructural deficit due to the failed ethnic agenda and plan to relocate the university to the North.

“In a bid to starve FUPRE of funds, the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) and National College of Petroleum, Kaduna, were established in the north and granted N15 billion and N10.4 billion respectively by the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) even at takeoff stage, but FUPRE that has graduated students and running for 11 years received no funding from PTDF,” the group added.

To show Federal Government’s bias towards the Niger Delta region and neglect of FUPRE, N45 Billion was captured in the 2018 budget for the North East Development Commission (NEDC), this is shocking because the NECD Act was accented a week after that of FUPRE Act but FUPRE Act got nothing in the 2018 budget.

Also, the House of Representatives in a motion: Implementation of Laws Enacted by the Eighth Assembly on December 21, 2017, mandated the House Committee on Appropriations to ensure adequate budgetary provisions be made in the 2018 Appropriation Bill for smooth takeoff of the university.

“Still the lawmakers and Federal Government shared over N152 Billion from increase in the oil benchmark without consideration for FUPRE Act, while all attempts made by stakeholders to the Federal Government and the National Assembly seem to have fallen on deaf ears.

“We thus, feel disturbed as this is a deliberate and outright neglect of the university and we are optimistic that the Federal Government has abandoned its responsibility for a Northern agenda.

“As Niger Delta and IPDI stakeholders, we demand that funds be made available for FUPRE from the excess funds realised with the increase of the oil prices as it rose from $45 per barrel to the current benchmark, yielding an excess of about N152 billion.

“However, the N152 billion has been disbursed for projects the government feel were more important than FUPRE, which was positioned in the Niger Delta area from where the funds were derived,” the statement added.

14,niger,"Washington (CNN) Congressional committees are planning to hold public hearings to question military officials after receiving an executive summary of the Pentagon's report into the October 2017 attack that killed four US soldiers during an operation in Niger.

Several sources familiar with the findings of the report say it raises fundamental questions about whether the mission was undertaken with proper authorization and preparation. It is expected to include recommendations and referrals to other parts of the military, including the Army. The Army could then conduct further investigations leading to potential reprimands over how the mission was carried out, according to defense officials.

Congressional sources have told CNN that the attack underscores concerns that US troops are operating in remote areas of Africa without sufficient air capability to evacuate dead and wounded troops, and insufficient overhead reconnaissance.

The executive summary, which runs at over 200 pages, represents just a fraction of the complete report which is approximately 6,000 pages in length and includes interviews with key personnel involved in the mission, the decision-making leading up to it and the immediate actions in the aftermath.

As of Tuesday, at least one of the four families of the soldiers killed had received a full briefing on the report. The Pentagon was hoping to finish family briefings as quickly as possible, then brief Congress, and after that, brief the media.

15,niger,"WASHINGTON -- Troubling new details are coming to light concerning last October's ambush in Niger, where four American soldiers were killed by Islamic militants. Capt. Michael Perozeni, commander of the ill-fated patrol, objected to a change in mission that sent his team looking for a wanted terrorist.

The team had been in Niger for barely a month. They had not done the traditional in-person turnover with the unit they were replacing and had not had sufficient training with the Nigerien soldiers they were operating with, according to a family member briefed on a seven month investigation into the ambush. The family member said Perozeni was ordered to proceed by Col. Bradley Moses, the commander of special forces in Niger.

A second family member, the father of Sgt. Bryan Black, told National Public Radio he doesn't blame anyone for the decisions that were made.

""I would not personally characterize them as mistakes,"" Black said. ""They were just decisions based on what they knew, and I believe that those decisions were sound decisions.""

The patrol had visited a village to meet with local elders and were returning to their base when they were directed to search the last known location of a local leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Moses considered it low-risk because a surveillance aircraft that had been watching the site for six hours had detected no activity.

Perozeni's team searched the site, destroyed the equipment they found and set out to return to base. By then, the surveillance aircraft had run low on fuel, leaving the team without anyone watching over them when they were ambushed by a force estimated to be three times their size.

In addition to the four Americans who were killed, two were wounded. One of them was Perozeni.","Pentagon probe finds soldiers in Niger ambush weren't prepared for mission, family member says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-probe-finds-soldiers-in-niger-ambush-werent-prepared-for-mission-family-member-says/
16,niger,"About Niger

Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa that is named after the Niger River. Nigeria and Benin border it to the south, Mali and Burkina Faso to the west, Libya and Algeria to the north, and Chad to the east. Its total area is 1,270,000 sq. km and 80 percent of Niger is covered by the Sahara. Its population of more than 17,4 million people are mostly Muslim and live in the south and west. Niamey is the capital city.

Desertification and drought threaten the non-desert locations. Subsistence agriculture is a major part of the economy outside export areas in the fertile south and uranium ore. Poor education, poverty, the landlocked desert terrain, poor infrastructure, and environmental degradation handicap the country.

The country has diversity that comes from the histories of its ethnic groups. Niger has been on the edges of several large states. There have been five constitutions and three periods of military rule since independence. Most people live in rural areas and do not have access to education.

History

Five thousand years ago, the area that is now Niger was fertile grasslands, Paintings of wildlife, domesticated animals, and chariots date to at least 10,000 BCE.

Early Historical Period

In the 15th century, the Songhai Empire expanded into Niger and reached to Agadez before collapsing in 1591. A series of Songhai states then formed, with the Dendi Kingdom the most powerful. Tuareg nomads moved south in the 13th century in large federations and displaced existing residents. These Tuaregs ruled northern Niger.

Fula pastoralists migrated into the Liptako area in the 18th century. Smaller kingdoms, like the Zarma, fought the Fulani Empire of Sokoto. The expansion of the Kanem Empire and Bornu Empire to the area around Lake Chad moved Kanuri and Toubou rulers and their states as far west as the Kaouar and Zinder Oases by the 17th century.

Europeans arrived in the area to explore in the 19th century to search for the Niger River’s source. The French began to attempt to pacify dissident groups prior to 1900 but they were not subdued until 1922 when the area became a French colony.

The French conferred citizenship to the territory’s inhabitants and governed it from Dakar, Senegal. The French constitution in 1946 allowed for limited political participation for local assemblies.

Early Independence

The Overseas Reform Act in 1956 reorganized the territories. This also provided for more self-government. Niger became an autonomous stated after the Fifth French Republic was established in 1958. Niger gained full independence on August 3, 1960.

Single Party and Military Rule (1961-1991)

Niger was run by a single party regime under President Hamani Diori for its first fourteen years. Drought and corruption accusations in 1974 resulted in a coup. Seyni Kountche and a small group ruled until he died in 1987.

Ali Saibou, his Chief of Staff, succeeded him. Saibou freed political prisoners, liberalized laws, and forged a new constitution. By the end of 1990, Saibou agreed to allow a multi-party democratic system.

A national peace conference convened in 1991 and new political parties formed. This started the road to free elections and a new constitution. A plan for a transitional government resulted from Prof. Andre Salifou’s leadership.

Third Republic

A transitional government began in 1991 to govern until the Third Republic was installed in 1993. The economy faltered under the transitional government, but the elections that were held were considered free and fair. Independent newspapers also started.

The election resulted in a rival president and prime minister. The resulting governmental paralysis gave Col. Ibrahim Bare Mainassara an opportunity to overthrow the Third Republic in 1996.

Military Rule and the Fourth Republic

A military authority ran the government for a six month period of transition. Bare gathered a group of specialists to draft a new constitution, which was announced as the Fourth Republic in 1996. During elections held that year, Bare replaced the electoral commission. The new commission found Bare the winner and his party won a majority of the parliament’s seats.

Due to the coup and the flawed elections, economic assistance did not come to Niger. Bare then ignored the embargo against Libya and sought its assistance to fund economic aid. Civil liberties were also violated by Bare’s government.

The government did sign peace agreements with Tuareg and Toubou groups that had been fighting the government since 1990.

Fifth Republic Since 1999

Bare was killed during a coup in 1999 led by Maj. Daouda Malam Wanke. Wanke oversaw the drafting of new constitution with a French style semi-presidential system.

The constitution was approved in 1999 in elections generally viewed as free and fair. Presidential and legislative elections were held that year and Mamadou Tandja won the presidency. He led a coalition of the National Movement for a Developing Society (MNSD) and the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS).

A military junta took over the country in 2010 in response to Tandja’s attempt to extend his presidential term. The Supreme Council for the restoration of Democracy led the junta.

Politics

The 1999 constitution restored the semi-presidential system. The unicameral National Assembly was expended. In order to gain a seat, a party must attain at least 5 percent of the vote.

The first successful local elections took place in 2004. Decentralization laws were passed in 2002. Niger now has 8 regions and 36 districts. The executive appoints each regional governor.

Seven political parties were part of the legislature elected in 2004. President Tandja was re-elected in 2004 and re-appointed Hama Amadou as his Prime Minister. The parliament elected Mahamane Ousmane as its head. There was military unrest in 2002, but the government was able to restore order.

A vote of no confidence forced Hama Amadou out as prime minister in 2007. He was replaced by Seyni Oumarou.

Tuaregs rebelled for a second time in 2007 in northern Niger due to economic problems and failure to achieve political progress.

In 2009, Tandja dissolved parliament after the constitutional court rejected his plan to have a referendum to allow him a third term. This sparked a clash between Tandja and his opponents.

In April 2011, incumbent president Mahamadou Issoufou took office.

Geography

Niger is a West African nation on the border between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan regions. The country’s area is 1,267,000 sq. km. Niger’s size is comparable to Angola and the U.S. state of Texas.

The country borders seven others and the longest border is with Nigeria. It also borders Chad, Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Libya.

The country’s highest point is Mont Idoukal-n-Taghes at 2,022 meters.

Climate

Niger has a hot and dry subtropical climate. Much of the country is desert with sand dunes. Flat to rolling savannas are in the south.

Regions, Departments, and Communes

There are seven regions and one capital district. These regions are divided into 36 departments which are then broken down into communes.

Foreign Relations

Niger’s foreign policy is moderate and it is friendly with the West, the Islamic world, and non-aligned countries. It has a close relationship with France and its West African neighbors.

Niger is a charter member of the African Union and the Wes African Monetary Union. It belongs to other regional groups such as the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.

The International Court of Justice solved a border dispute with Benin in Niger’s favors in 2005.

Military

The defense budget is 1.6% of GDP percent of government expenditures. The French give the most military assistance but Algeria, China, Morocco, and Libya have also contributed. The U.S. has provided assistance to the military in the form of transportation, logistics, and training.

In 2010, the military staged another coup that ousted President Tandja Mamadou.

Transportation

With cities separated by large natural features, transportation is crucial to the nations. During the colonial period, transportation was not developed in that no railway was developed and most roads outside the capital are unpaved.

Roads

For long distance travel, roads are the main form of transport. Of the 10,100 km of roads, only 798 km were paved in 1996. The first paved highway was built for uranium transportation and is part of the Trans-Sahara Highway system.

Air Transportation

The Diori Hamani International Airport at Niamey is the main airport. Other airports are in Agadez and near Zinder.

Economy

Niger does have one of the largest uranium deposits in the world, but subsistence crops and livestock are major parts of the economy. The high population growth, droughts, and drop in uranium demand have hurt the economy.

Niger’s currency, the CFA franc, is shared with seven other members of the Wes African Monetary Union. These countries also share a common central bank. Niger belongs to the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).

Agriculture

Internal markets, subsistence farming, and exporting raw commodities form the basis of Niger’s agricultural economy. Most residents involved in crop production are in the nation’s south center and south west areas.

Rainfall is unpredictable and when it is not adequate, the country cannot feed its population and it relies on food aid. Droughts can last for years, such as the one from the 1960s through the 1980s.

Exports

The largest export is uranium, followed by livestock. These statistics fail to account for herds that informally cross into Nigeria. There are also deposits of coal, iron, phosphates, limestone, and gypsum in Niger. Gold mining has also recently started.

Growth Rates

The 1994 CFA franc devaluation contributed to 3.5 percent economic growth in the mid-1990s. The current GDP growth rate is 6.2 percent.

Economic Restructuring and Debt

In 2000, the new government came to power with serious economic problems. That year, the country qualified for debt relief from the IMF.

This government sought changes to the economy to move toward IMF’s privatization model. This included privatizing telecommunications and water distribution. Price protections on petroleum products were removed.

There is also a plan to reduce poverty and corruption. The attempt to privatize the power company failed in 2001 and 2003. The telephone operation was renationalized in 2009.

Foreign Aid

France, the IMF, the EU, the World Bank, and U.N. agencies are important donors to Niger. Others are the U.S., Germany, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia.

2010 Famine

A famine in 2010 struck the Sahel after crops failed to develop in the heat. Record breaking temperatures were seen in the region and 350,000 faced starvation. Illness, starvation and nutrition were killing and sickening many people. The new junta appealed for overseas aid.

Demographics

Half of the people are part of the Hausa group, which is also the major group in Nigeria and the Zarma-Songhai. Both groups are sedentary farmers.

The remaining Nigeriens are the Fulani, Tuareg, Kanuri, Arabs, and Toubou, who make up 20 percent of the population. Livestock producers and agriculturalists have begun to fight over natural resources in recent years.

Health

Niger has a high infant mortality rate that is similar to other regional countries. The infant mortality rate is 86.27 deaths for every 1,000 live births. Despite this, the country has the world’s highest fertility rate at 6.89 births per woman. Half the population is under 15 years old.

Education

There is six years of compulsory education. Attendance rates are low, particularly for girls. Girls rarely attend school for more than a few years. Children are often required to work rather than attend school and children in nomadic communities do not have access to education.

Culture and Religion

Niger’s culture is varied. The area that became Niger under French rule came from four distinct cultural areas.

Each community brought their own traditions to the country. Despite governmental effort, it has been difficult to create a national identity.

The Niamey and Zarma dominated the government until the 1990s. Other areas looked to other countries for direction due to their shared cultures.

Religion

In the 10th century, Islam spread from North Africa and now more than 90 percent of the population is Muslim. There are small communities of Christians and Animists.

Most Muslims are Sunni and Sufi. Only about 5 percent are Shi’a. Niger has a tradition of being a secular state and has good interfaith relations.

A small percentage of those in Niger practice indigenous beliefs. In some areas, animist festivals are practiced.

In the late 1990s, a diverse media developed. Before this time, there were only state run media outlets. Now, there are many outlets, some owned by the government and some private. Since televisions are beyond the buying power of the poor, radio is the most important outlet. There are broadcasts in French and English.

While freedom exists at the national level, journalists often received pressure from local authorities.",Here’s What You Need to Know About Niger,https://www.africa.com/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-niger/

18,niger,"Since the mid-2000s, an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the three northeastern states of Nigeria has spread to the greater Lake Chad basin. The Boko Haram conflict turned into a major security problem that led to widespread displacement and a major humanitarian catastrophe. UNOCHA estimates that more than 20,0000 people have been killed, 1.6 million are internally displaces, and 200,000 are living as refugees in neighboring countries.

Nigeria uses the Cadre Harmonisé to identify and classify the severity of food security situations. This report examines this system to better understand the technical and political constraints to analyzing famines and extreme emergencies.

This report was jointly written by researchers from the Feinstein International Center and the Centre for Humanitarian Change in Nairobi.

1. Brief introduction to Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 190 million residents. It is diverse in language, ethnicity, and religion. Though English is the official national language, Hausa and Fulani are spoken widely in the northeast; Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages are spoken elsewhere. The country is almost evenly split between Islam (50 percent) and Christianity (40 percent). The north is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian, though this common disaggregation obscures complex ethnic, linguistic, and class unions and divisions throughout the country (Ogunlesi, 2015). The population is young: 42.5 percent of residents are under the age of 15 and 19.61 percent are aged 15–24 years.

Of these youth, approximately 7.7 percent are unemployed; the total unemployment rate is 13.9 percent.

With 5.07 children born per woman, Nigeria has the thirteenth highest fertility rate in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes approximately 35 percent of the country’s GDP, and petroleum accounts for 90 percent of exports (OPEC, 2017). The GDP per capita in 2016 was $5,900, though recent growth rates show a decline of 1.5 percent due to decreased oil prices. Some 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2010 (OPEC, 2017).

The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). States are grouped into six zones and each state is subdivided into three senatorial zones and further into local government areas (LGAs), which are further subdivided into districts, wards, and villages. The zone of northeast Nigeria consists of six states: Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe (see map in Section 6). The latter three are nestled into the far northeast corner of the country. Yobe (capital: Damaturu) borders Niger to the north. Adamawa (capital: Yola) borders Cameroon to the east. Borno (capital: Maiduguri) borders Niger to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the southeast.

The original Borno Empire stretched across several current countries. Borno was a trade hub and the center of Islamic knowledge in Nigeria. Northern Nigeria has long been one of the most neglected, marginalized areas in the country. This was at least partially a result of the colonization process, but issues were not addressed after independence.

Historically, the northeast and the northwest had the lowest social welfare indicators and high levels of inequality—both internally and vis-à-vis the rest of the country. These factors, among others, gave rise to the Boko Haram insurgency",Constraints and Complexities of Information and Analysis in Humanitarian Emergencies: Evidence from Nigeria,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/constraints-and-complexities-information-and-analysis-humanitarian-emergencies

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

According to the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2.3 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018 in Niger. The needs analysis shows the persistence of five major crises affecting the country: food insecurity (1.4 million people estimated in need), malnutrition (1.7 million people), epidemics (1,170,000 people), floods (170,000 people) and population movements due to conflict or migration (392,305 people).

The deterioration of the security situation in the districts bordering Mali caused the activation of the Intercluster contingency plan. Out of the 84,000-people estimated in the plan, over 40,000 were considered to be at risk of displacements due to threats of attacks and / or military operations. In January,the first 75 displaced families (506 people) arrived in Tiloa, Tillabery region. The protection cluster alerted on the risk of similar displacement for over 40,000 people.

In February, the Diffa region received the joint mission of the Humanitarian Coordinator, high Representative of the government, humanitarian country team members and donors. One of the keys discussion points focused on the nexus humanitarian and development.

The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) was launched by the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary- General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator during the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region on 24 February 2017. The NHF is a Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) that is managed4 by a Humanitarian Financing Unit (HFU) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) based in Maiduguri, on behalf of the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Nigeria. It has a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, prioritized and principled humanitarian response in Nigeria. The overall objectives guiding this and future NHF allocations, include:

• Support principled, prioritized life-saving assistance.

• Strengthen coordination and leadership through the function of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the sector coordination system, promoting synergies and multi-sectoral responses.

• Expand assistance to hard-to-reach areas through frontline responders and enabling activities.

• Leverage the Nigerian private sector in support of humanitarian response.

1st RESERVE ALLOCATION 2018

On 31 January 2018, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, supported by the NHF Advisory Board, requested the urgent launch of a NHF Reserve Allocation by following the ‘emergency response window’ modality in order to address prioritized humanitarian needs of highly vulnerable populations in Pulka, the Monguno Axis (totaling US$ 10,000,000.00) and to ensure the continuation of humanitarian air services for frontline responders and critically vital humanitarian projects in north-east Nigeria (totaling US$ 2,000,000.00). This reserve allocation is aiming to address prioritized humanitarian needs in prioritized geographic locations where projects carried out by already present humanitarian organizations would need to be either discontinued, or cannot be scaled up to address significantly increased humanitarian needs due to lack of monetary support. The NHF is allocating a maximum total amount of US$ 12,000,000.00 to be allocated through a noncompetitive

process, subject to technical/financial review of all proposals by the NHF and the respective sector in order to ensure quality and compliance, prior to final endorsement of grant agreements by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria.

This allocation is supporting the most critical elements of the humanitarian operation envisaged by the 2018 HRP, is closely aligned to 2018 HRP strategic objectives and therefore responds to life-saving humanitarian needs in Nigeria. This allocation will contribute to the achievement of the following HRP objective:

Strategic Objective 1: Provide life-saving emergency assistance to the most vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas ensuring that assistance is timely and appropriate and meets relevant technical standards.

…Appeal panels meet tomorrow

By our reporters

THE crises ravaging the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, deepened at the weekend as the nationwide ward congresses ended on a mixed note.

The party’s governorship primary in Ekiti State ended in chaos after thugs destroyed election materials and delegates loyal to some aspirants for the ticket of the party ahead of the July election in the state disagreed.

Some notable APC leaders, such as the embattled National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, boycotted the ward congresses in Edo; so also were Speaker Yakubu Dogara in Bauchi and Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso in Kano, whose loyalists held parallel congresses.

While the ward congresses were peaceful in a couple of states such as Edo, Bayelsa, Taraba, Kwara, and Katsina, among others, it was not so in Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, and Delta where violence and aparthy marred the exercise.

In Delta, one of the party’s ward chairmanship aspirants, Mr. Jeremiah Oghoveta, in Ward 10, Otu-Jeremi, Ughelli South Local Government Area, was stabbed to death during the violence that trailed the congress.

In Akwa Ibom, no fewer than 10 persons, including the Etim Ekpo Local Government Chairman of the APC, Mr. Iniobong Akan, were beaten up by aggrieved youths.

The youths allegedly blocked the gates of the state secretariat, along Atiku Abubakar Avenue, where the exercise held, preventing party members from entering the premises. However, the congress proceeded after the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Senate Matters and leader of the APC in Akwa Ibom State, Senator Ita Enang, met with the aggrieved members.

In Rivers, APC chieftains, continued to accuse one another of sponsoring the youths who invaded the state secretariat of the party in Port Harcourt on eve of the Ward Congress.

While feuding Rivers APC Leader and Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, and 2019 governorship aspirant, Senator Magnus Abe, accused each other of masterminding the violence, another chieftain of the party, Duke Alamboye Kirchner, indicated that the incident was instigated by non-APC forces.

There were parallel congresses in Imo State where the Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere, and Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, escaped attacks from thugs at the APC secretariat following the confusion and angst that hallmarked the parallel congresses in the state.

President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo took part in the congresses. While Osinbajo attended the exercise in Agungi in Eti-Osa LGA of Lagos State, where he was received by party leaders, Buhari participated in the congress in his Sarkin Yara A Ward, Daura in Katsina State, where he urged elected ward executives to discharge their responsibilities with fear of God and in accordance with the party’s constitution.

Be diligent, decent, decorous, Buhari urges ward excos

Buhari, who spoke after participating in the APC Ward Congress in his constituency, said throughout his political career, he had been a loyal party member who respected the rules and the regulations, assuring that his administration was determined to uphold the provisions of the constitution and the rule of law.

Stressing the need to play politics with decency and decorum, he said: “I call on you to fear God in whatever you do as we would transit to the next world and account for our deeds before our creator.”

Chairmanship candidate killed

Jeremiah Jacob Ogboveta, the APC chairmanship candidate in Jeremi Ward 3/10, Ughelli South Local Government Area, Delta State, was stabbed in the violence that broke out during the exercise in the area.

Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka said: “At about12:30pm, one Jeremiah Jacob was stabbed to death by a member of the APC (names withheld) who is currently on the run.

“Though there are no details for now, we know that the suspect immediately fled after the incident and efforts are currently on to apprehend him.”

Meanwhile, Board of Trustees, BoT, member of the APC, Chief Frank Kokori, said the congress went smoothly in his Ovu Ward 5, Ethiope East local government area.

Parallel congresses in Imo

Parallel congresses were held in various wards of the 27 local council areas of Imo State.

In Azuzii Ward 2, Owerri Municipal, while loyalists of Governor Rochas Okorocha held their congress in Emmanuel College premises, officials of the party moved theirs to Umuodu village.

Some APC members, suspected to be Okorocha loyalists, clustered at the state Police Headquarters, chanting war songs and clamouring for the cancellation of the ward congresses in the 305 wards of Imo.

Speaking to Sunday Vanguard in a telephone interview, the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Chief Nwabueze Oguchienti, said that the parallel congresses were not unexpected.

“The party saw as it coming. We are aware that those loyal to the governor are responsible for the parallel congress. I must tell you that those who engaged in the shameful act are not party loyalists”, Oguchienti said.

The state Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere, escaped attack from thugs at the state secretariat as Okorocha’s son-in-law, Mr Uche Nwosu, said that there was a swap of congress committee that was supposed to conduct the exercise.

Among those who escaped the attack were Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, a former Secretary to the State Government, Mr Jude Ejiogu and others.

Sunday Vanguard was told that Madumere and others were at the APC state Secretariat as part of the preparation for the party’s congress.

But with the intervention of the security agencies, a peaceful atmosphere was restored.

It was claimed that the congress committee that was supposed to conduct congress in the state were moved to Anambra State.

Nwosu, who briefly spoke at the state Police Command, said: We are trying to sort out some issues. There was a swap. The people that were supposed to conduct the congress in Imo were moved to Anambra and Anambra people moved to Imo. And we want them to properly hand over.”

Odigie-Oyegun absent as Edo hold peaceful congresses

The congresses were peaceful across the 192 wards of Edo after the state harmonized the list of aspirants to avoid a rancorous exercise.

However, there was tension in Egor Local Government Area as it was alleged that the council chairperson, Eghe Ogbemudia, held a parallel congress after the leaders of the council including former Deputy Governor of the state, Lucky Imasuen, and the leader of the party in the council, Crosby Eribo, had agreed on the list of ward executives.

Party members adopted the consensus method through affirmation and the exercise started at about 10am to elect the ward chairmen, secretaries, treasurer and other party executives at that level across the state.

At Ikpoba Okha, home town of the Secretary to Edo state Government, Osarodion Ogie, and the member representing Ikpoba Okhai/ Egor Federal Constituency, Mr Johnson Agbonayinma, the leaders described the exercise as ¨very peaceful and orderly and we hope those we have elected will ensure the progress of the party at that level”. They added: “We are very optimistic as we head towards 2019¨.

Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu said: ¨Edo is a role model and we are very organized and peaceful. Our eyes are all on the ball and it is that spirit that is pushing all of us. We did it under peaceful atmosphere, it is a family meeting to choose one of us. We came out in that spirit of a family and had a family meeting and it worked out as a family under the able leadership of Mr Governor and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.

And that is why we want Comrade to go and replicate what we have in Edo state to other parts of the country as national chairman of the APC. We have leaders in the person of Governor Obaseki and Comrade Oshiomhole and that is the secret of the peaceful congresses we are having.”

Odigie-Oyegun’s absence

In Ward 2 Oredo, the Local Government Area of the National Chairman of the APC, Odigie-Oyegun, the APC boss was conspicuously absent in the exercise which was conducted by the Minister of State, Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, and monitored by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.

Hon. Patrick Obahiagbon, Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on National Assembly Matters and former Chief of Staff to the immediate past governor of the state, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who participated in the process at Ward 3 (Oredo council), said “We have long finished; the exercise went on peacefully and we adopted the consensus option, except in some areas where the process was contentious and they adopted full contest.”

Chairman of the party in the state, Anselm Ojezua, described the exercise as peaceful and ¨ very democratic.

Amaechi, Abe, others trade blames over secretariat invasion

Speaking on the invasion of the party secretariat in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, on Friday evening, Amaechi said: “What a governorship aspirant wants to do is that there should not be any congress. He took over the party secretariat with his loyalists till about 3pm that the police had to force themselves in for people to purchase forms for tomorrow’s congress”

The Transport Minister, apparently referring to Senator Magnus Abe, the only aspirant to have declared his governorship ambition under Rivers APC, added: “If that aspirant is popular, why not tell his supporters to go and purchase that form and go and contest the congress? I am grateful that people bought forms and I hope his supporters also bought forms, because tomorrow, ward congresses will hold.

“They say police were there when the offices of the APC were destroyed. It is not true there were policemen sent anywhere, rather it was the police that were invited by the party for protection of the party secretariat and to disperse the people brought to disrupt the purchase of forms”.

Responding on the allegation, Abe said: “It is Amaechi that is afraid of election. That is why he is causing problems. I did not mobilise thugs to Rivers State secretariat of APC. The people at APC’s secretariat were Amaechi’s miscreants. I am a man of integrity”.

The senator called on President Buhari and other leaders of APC to ensure free, fair and credible congresses in the party.

Parallel congress in Kano

Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and his supporters held parallel ward congresses across Kano State.

Media aide to the senator, Hajiya Binta Spikin, told Sunday Vanguard that the group had purchased forms in line with the directives of the national leadership of the party and subsequently conducted it’s ward congress.

The development followed a similar congress conducted by the mainstream All Progressives Congress (APC) across the 484 wards of the 44 local government area of the state that led to the emergence of 1188 delegates.

Acting Chairman of APC in Kano, Engr. Bashir Yahaya Karaye, told journalists at the party secretariat that the exercise monitored by national officer was free and fair .

No imposition of candidates in Katsina – C’ttee Chair

Chairman, Ward Congress Committee in Katsina State and the Deputy National Treasurer of the APC, Mohammed Tanko Zakari, said no candidate was imposed in the state adding that all candidates in the 361 wards across the 34 local government areas were given a level-playing ground and in areas “where there are no contest, we had the permission of the national headquarters to conduct our congress via consensus”.

Peaceful conduct in Bayelsa

A former governor of Bayelsa State and leader of the APC in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, commended party faithful for their peaceful conduct during the ward congresses in the state.

Sylva, who stated this during a brief interaction with newsmen in Yenagoa, said the party in the state has disappointed many who had hoped that the congresses would be marred by violence.

Taraba’s peaceful – Alhassan

Stakeholders of the APC in Taraba State hailed the conduct of the congresses.

The Minister of Women and Social Development, Senator Aisha Alhassan, said the distribution of election materials to various wards was timely well conducted and in accordance with the guidelines of the party.

Loyalists of Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun who were elected in 2014, were unanimously returned unopposed as elected chairmen in the 236 wards of the state.

All Progressives Congress (APC) ward congresses held in the 236 wards across Ogun State .

Sunday Vanguard learned that Governor Ibikunle Amosun had directed that where there is consensus among party leaders about candidates seeking election into party executive offices, the affected candidates should be returned in a unanimous decision instead of resorting to time -consuming voting process.

The Ward Congress Committee Chairman, Alhaji Bashir Sheriff, who coordinated the exercise expressed satisfaction with the outcome.

Controversy in Kaduna

The ward congresses were mirred in controversy in Kaduns as the absence of party officials and unilateral conduct of ward elections by non party officials held sway.

Sunday Vanguard’s checks indicated that election did not take place in I2 wards in Igabi. The wards are Kwarau, Turunku, igabi, Fanshanu, Gwaraji, Zango Aya, Afaka, Kirawa, Birnin Yero, Rigassa, Sabon Birnin.

Some supporters of Senators Shehu Sani and Othman Hunkuyi alleged that party officials were quarantined in government house to do the bidding of government officials.

But the Senior Special Assistant to governor Nasir El-rufai on Media a d Publicuty, Mr. Samuel Aruwan dismissed the allegation, saying that, “Government Gouse is government house, not polling unit” insisting ward congresses were held in designated centres adding that “I just voted at my ward.”

It was gathered that Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi led APC group held a parallel election, declaring all their candidates unopposed in Malali, Ungwan Rimi, Chikun, Sabo, and Narayi, among other wards in the state.

The crisis started during the preparation for the conduct of the party’s ward congress.

While the crisis lasted, dangerous weapons like bottles were freely used as supporters of the Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi and the Minister of Communication, Mr Adebayo Shittu clashed.

There has been cold war between the governor and the minister over who controls the party.

It took prompt intervention of heavily armed security agencies to prevent the crisis from escalating.

Shortly after, dangerous weapons were flying in the air and sporadic gunshots rent the atmosphere.

After sometime, the committee later succeeded in bringing all the factions together and after consultation with them, it was resolved that the ward congress be postponed to today.

Congresses hitch-free, Appeal Panels Report in states Monday – APC

Speaking on the exercise, he said: “Generally, everything went on fine. We did not have a situation or any report from any part of the country that there was a problem. Where any of our guidelines have been infringed on, the aggrieved candidate would send a petition to the appeal committee in that state, because we cannot be everywhere.

The committees will report in the states on Monday. It is the appeal committees that would now sit on the petitions and submit their findings or recommendations to the National Working Committee NWC”, he said.","APC crises fester: One killed; Oyegun, Dogara, Kwankwaso boycott ward congresses",https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/apc-crises-fester-one-killed-oyegun-dogara-kwankwaso-boycott-ward-congresses/

The past years have been an exceptional journey for UNICEF in Niger. The country has made progress in advancing children’s and women’s rights.

The child mortality rate significantly decreased over the past decade from 328 to 95 per 1,000 live birth between 1990 and 2015 thanks to comprehensive health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions engaged by the Government and its partners.

UNICEF and its partners have led intensive advocacy efforts in the country, leading to substantial developments in legislations, policies, strategies and national programming. UNICEF took a leading role in organizing a roundtable on girls’ education in 2017, resulting in a list of 10 Commitments signed consensually by the Government, Cooperating Partners, Civil Society and traditional, religious and community leaders, a first for Niger. This led to the adoption by the government of a decree in December 2017 for the protection of the girl-child in school to guarantee access and retention until age 16.

The government also demonstrated its engagement to tackle child marriage through a pledge to end this harmful practice and develop an action plan, made by the President of Niger during the high-level meeting of the African Union campaign.

In child survival, the Government developed in 2017 its health sector development plan and adopted key policies in the Water, Hygiene and Sanitation sector, setting a clear vision for the development of those sectors for the coming years.

Niger continues however to face simultaneous emergencies that are stretching the capacities of the government and humanitarian partners to respond adequately. Children in Niger face malnutrition, recurrent disease epidemics and outbreaks, cyclical floods, drought and displacement. The situation is exacerbated by instability in neighboring countries, resulting in an influx of thousands of refugees, returnees and migrants, all needing access to basic social services for survival. The issue of migration has taken a new dimension with the evacuation of refugees and migrants from Libya to transit countries, including Niger.

The UNICEF Niger programme has made progress in leaps and bounds in many areas. It has not been without its challenges. But our vision has remained steadfast—to ensure that no child is left behind in Niger, and that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children are given the best opportunity for a healthy life, to fulfil their potential and to remain protected against harm.

The current programme comes to its end in 2018. It offers the opportunity to align the new 2019-2021 Country Programme Document with the newly approved 2017-2021 national development plan, UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and the Sustainable Development Goals. We look to the future with optimism and with the willingness to work harder and more effectively for Niger’s children.

23,niger,"NIAMEY, Niger -- Under the watchful eyes of U.S. authorities, an elite group of local police officers in Niger's capital slipped into a home, rescued a ""hostage,"" detained an ""extremist"" and pretended to kill another.

The police training in one of Africa's most remote, impoverished countries is crucial as extremists linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida carry out increasingly bold attacks in West Africa's vast Sahel region. In October, four U.S. soldiers and five Nigeriens were killed in an ambush claimed by Islamic State group-linked fighters in rural Niger.

Amid questions over the role of the U.S. military in this part of the world, there is a renewed focus on training local law enforcement officers, in the hopes that extremism can be better countered at the community level and along borders. The challenges are great in Niger, where residents of its vast, largely ungoverned spaces say they are losing confidence in authorities.

As extremism grows ""it's important not to lose sight of the issues at the core of their proliferation and recruitment success, notably bad and often abusive governance,"" said Corinne Dufka, Human Rights Watch's West Africa director. ""The Islamist groups are cleverly exploiting local grievances to make inroads with local populations.""

That includes abusive practices by local security forces, she said, calling efforts to professionalize them key.

The U.S. ambassador to Niger, Eric P. Whitaker, said the U.S. is addressing the ""factors that create an environment for extremism"" by investing more than $500 million over the next few years into local programs for better governance, education, health, agriculture, security and more.

The State Department's Anti-terrorism Assistance Program also is addressing such concerns by training local security forces in everything from border control and investigations to human rights and justice.

After an attack killed 20 people at a luxury hotel in Mali's capital in November 2015, the U.S. invested $15 million in training nearly 100 local police in crisis response. They also were given the necessary equipment to respond to further attacks, according to Samuel L. Pineda, director in the office of programs with the department's Bureau of Counterterrorism.

The program has paid off, he said. Several of the trained officers responded during the March 2016 attack on the European Union military training mission's headquarters in Bamako. And during the June 2017 attack on a resort popular with foreigners outside the capital they helped to kill attackers and rescue victims.

""We want to create transparent forces and we want the people to trust those forces,"" Pineda said. ""Nobody wants their local market blown up ... so if they have the trust of the population, the information comes back in.""

In 2018, the Bureau of Counterterrorism will invest an estimated $106 million in sub-Saharan Africa.

About $50 million of that is dedicated to State Department counterterrorism programs in West and Central Africa, including ones in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria and Mauritania.

The crisis response program in Mali eventually will be replicated in Niger, where the Antiterrorism Assistance Program has dedicated roughly $10 million to training and equipment this year.

During the U.S. military's annual Flintlock counterterrorism exercises this month in Niger local officers put their training to the test, collaborating with Niger's gendarmerie and military as well as security forces from other West African nations.

The officers who participated in the raid in the capital, Niamey, are part of the Special Program for Embassy Augmentation and Response, known as SPEAR, which was created after the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya to train and equip host nation police units designated as first responders to U.S. diplomatic facilities in crisis. They also can respond to other attacks.

""We train them for an eventuality,"" said Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Kent Miller, who manages the Anti-terrorism Assistance Program in Niger. ""In the current year and last year there has been a focus on rural environments.""

The goal is to disrupt extremists at borders so they don't make it into more populated areas, he said.

In cities, the hope is that crisis response units and SPEAR officers will respond. They are provided with arms, ammunition, equipment, facilities for practicing raids, a gun range and mentorship.

""The importance of training is that it puts the elements of knowledge for reaction in our hands, and we can then apply them in real-world situations,"" said Djibril Ousmane, an assistant police commander in the capital.

The challenge, however, is that extremists also are giving money to communities to win them over, he said.

""It's difficult to fight poverty,"" Ousmane said. ""With the right means, more can be done.""

U.S. Special Operations forces take part in the first day of Flintlock 2017 training in Niger.
