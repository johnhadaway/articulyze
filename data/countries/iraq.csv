Baghdad- Hamza Mustafa

The Federal Supreme Court of Iraq announced Monday it has begun deliberations on a possible lawsuit to challenge the Kurdistan Region’s independent oil exports abroad, initiated by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) without referring to Baghdad.



The lawsuit was filed by the federal government’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi against KRG’s Minister of Natural Resources Ashti Hawrami, according to Ayas al-Samuk, spokesperson for the court.



“The lawsuit’s parties attended the session in which the prosecution asked that a ruling that stipulates halting oil exports directly from the Kurdistan Region to outside of Iraq be made, and the funds from the sales in the past be retrieved since oil is the property of all of the Iraqi people,” Samuk said on Monday.



Judge Medhat al-Mahmoud decided to include Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, Iraq’s Finance Minister, and KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani as “third party individuals… because the lawsuit has constitutional, political, and financial dimensions,” Samuk stated.



Oil has long been a contentious issue between Erbil and Baghdad, and the federal government cut the KRG’s budget when Erbil expressed an intention to export oil independently.



The court said that parties mentioned in the lawsuit had also participated in a hearing, where the Iraqi Oil Ministry asked for the export of oil by the KRG to cease, and for amounts sold in the past to be repaid to the Iraqi federal government.



“To provide sufficient time for all parties to present their case, we have deferred the appeal to 6/5/2018,” the court explained.",Federal Supreme Court of Iraq Postpones Ruling in Baghdad-Erbil Oil Case,https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1233041/federal-supreme-court-iraq-postpones-ruling-baghdad-erbil-oil-case
1,iraq,"Highlights

• In February, Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) partners delivered immediate, life-saving emergency supplies to 14,655 individuals on the move, including 8,575 children, across five governorates. UNICEF and partners also delivered Multi-Sector Emergency Packages (MSEP) to 8,782 individuals in need in retaken areas, including 4,782 children, in Ka’im district, western Anbar, ensuring provision of essential items.

• UNICEF ensured continued water trucking to 14 neighbourhoods in West Mosul, ensuring safe water for 54,150 individuals (115,213 children). In coordination with the Directorate of Water (DoW) Ninewa and other partners, UNICEF continued to fix the water network, intending to eventually eliminate water trucking.

• Since the start of 2018, UNICEF partners provided psychosocial services (PSS) to 19,262 newly-registered IDP children (9,299 girls), specialized child protection services reached 2,424 IDP children (1,170 girls).

• In February, the UN launched a two-year Recovery and Resilience Programme (RRP) at the International Conference for Reconstruction of Iraq. The RRP complements the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), and builds on existing efforts to ensure tangible improvements at the start of the reconstruction process. UNICEF’s complementary 2018 Recovery and Resilience for Children (RRC) appeal asks for US$58.9 million to support the early recovery needs of children in Iraq.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

With the end of military offensives against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, security in many areas of the country is improving, although pockets of insecurity remain. A total of 3.5 million people have returned home, mainly to areas in Anbar, Ninewa, and Salah al-Din, but more than 2.3 million remain displaced, including over 1 million children. Since the start of the year, more than 200,000 new returnees have been recorded, as efforts to clear explosive hazards and restore basic services continue. However, the return process remains complex due to lack of information, poor conditions in camps, and restrictions on freedom of movement combined with significant levels of infrastructure damage in towns and villages. Return movements are potentially unsustainable, with reports that between mid-January and the end of February, 23,208 displaced people were recorded as arrivals to camps in Ninewa governorate. Most of these are ‘secondary displacements’, where families had left camps to return to places of origin, only to then later decide to return to camps.

Primary reasons given for return to camps are financial or economic, or because homes have been destroyed or damaged and remain unfit for habitation. These ‘reverse movements’ have caused planning and resource prioritisation challenges for partners, both for service delivery and as part of the camp consolidation process. Humanitarian partners expect that those who cannot or choose not to return to places of origin will remain in IDP camps where they will need continued education, health, water, sanitation, and child protection services until at least the middle of 2018.

Discussions continue between the Government of Iraq (GoI) and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and the two sides appeared closer to reaching agreement on outstanding issues. However, in February, airports in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) remained limited to domestic flights only, road access between the KRI and neighbouring federal governorates such as Kirkuk and Ninewa was restricted, and KRG public sector employee salaries continued to be un- or partially-paid.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018

Heavy rain and flooding in camps

After experiencing a much drier winter compared to previous years, heavy rain and flooding during the second half of February affected approximately 33 camps and sites and more than 200,000 displaced people, primarily in northern and central governorates.

In Anbar governorate alone, this had an impact on 2,870 residents in 14 camps and 2,040 people were also affected in two camps in Salah al-Din governorate. Up to 300 millimeters of rain fell in some camp locations, damaging tents, spoiling food supplies and ruining many household items. In some instances, people left the camp to live with relatives while the water was subsiding. In most cases, affected families moved in with relatives inside the camp who had not been affected by the rain, which subsequently led to overcrowding in some camps. Clusters and partners were on the ground to assess the humanitarian needs of affected families. This resulted in the provision of quick assistance, particularly food, blankets, household items, tents, and winterization kits, by local communities, government authorities and humanitarian partners. Donors and authorities were closely involved in response activities and showed great flexibility to enable such a rapid response. Major drainage work was also undertaken to remove stagnant water and clean drinking water was trucked to affected camps. The likelihood of any disease outbreak was low as a result of the prompt drainage repair.","Iraq: Humanitarian Bulletin, February 2018 | Issued on 13 March [EN/AR/KU]",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-bulletin-february-2018-issued-13-march-enarku

Brooke Army Medical Center Public Affairs



JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its warriors and their families.



Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured the Warrior and Family Support Center as part of a visit to San Antonio. As she walked through the center, which offers coordinated services to military families recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center, she expressed her admiration for the recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.



“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.



“I see such great courage here helping injured Soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”



Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62-year-old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at the age of 13.



In 2014, tragedy struck. “ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” she said. “They killed children, older people, women.”



On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.



Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with ID cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shi’a how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to the ISIS. “Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shi’a,” her bio said.



For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the IWOC award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.



“It was difficult,” she said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”



Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.



When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.



“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”



For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept. “When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage.”



“We are all created by God,” she said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",A portrait of courage: Iraqi humanitarian visits warrior care center,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/272334/portrait-courage-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-warrior-care-center
4,iraq,"Sinjar, in northeast Iraq, made headlines for the 2014 massacre, enslavement, and displacement of its Yazidi people by militants from the so-called Islamic State. Thousands have since returned to the shattered town, but they are struggling with a lack of basic services, especially medical care.

Patients queue in a dingy corridor in what is left of Sinjar General Hospital to see 27-year-old Hussein Rashu, who was until recently its sole doctor. Hundreds of Yazidis seek treatment here every week, many suffering from complaints induced by ongoing shortages of food, clean drinking water, electricity and heating, and from living in makeshift accommodations.

“I see everyone – men, women, and children – and deal with all [sorts of] cases because there’s no one else,” explained Doctor Rashu, who qualified in 2014 and can offer only the most basic diagnoses and prescriptions.

This part of the hospital, which once boasted 100 beds and several departments, is one of only two wards that survived IS control of Sinjar, which began in August 2014, when tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to seek refuge in the nearby mountains.

After massacring more than 1,500 Yazidis and kidnapping another 1,500 women and children as part of a campaign the UN has called genocide, the militants then unleashed destruction on Sinjar. Airstrikes and on-the-ground combat damaged much of what remained of the town, as Yazidi and Kurdish forces fought to regain control of it.

Sinjar and its surrounding villages are the historic refuge of the Yazidis, a long-persecuted Iraqi minority that was singled out by IS for especially cruel treatment. Since liberation in November 2015, more than 4,000 Yazidi families have come back, an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 people in all. They have returned to a homeland in need of extensive reconstruction.

Mayor Ferhad Hiamd says that while returnees need housing, food, and clothing, medical care is the most pressing necessity. “We need urgent help here in Sinjar,” he told IRIN. “We need everything, but the healthcare situation is particularly critical.”

But according to local officials, health workers, and the inhabitants themselves, scant aid has been provided by either the Iraqi government or the Kurdistan Regional Government (which claimed the area as part of its territory until Iraqi forces took control last October). They also accuse UN agencies and major international non-governmental organisations of largely overlooking the town and the scale of its needs.

As one frustrated hospital volunteer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “While the foreign NGO employees are sitting comfortably in the Green Zone in Baghdad or luxury hotels in Erbil, our people are dying here in Sinjar.”

Shortages

The desperate need for medical care is exacerbated by the poor living conditions in Sinjar: most returnees live in informal camps, damaged buildings, or rural areas far from the hospital and the one other healthcare centre, which has no doctor and even less to offer patients.

The lack of medical care, as well as shortages of just about everything, makes the prospects of further returns to Sinjar more distant.

Most of the area’s estimated 250,000 Yazidis remain in refugee camps scattered around Iraqi Kurdistan, Syria, and Turkey. Others have sought asylum in Europe. Sinjar’s Arab and Kurdish populations have also not come home.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi told IRIN the government was keen for all members of the Yazidi community to return to Sinjar but that the area had been badly damaged and needed extensive support and rebuilding.

“We have been talking to the international community and they show interest in Sinjar, but actual support is very slow,” he said.

Over this long, harsh winter, so many people sought treatment at the hospital that Doctor Rashu and pharmacist Mourad Khro Mourad lived on site, often working throughout the night.

Mourad said chronic diseases routinely go untreated for lack of medication. NGOs and the health department of Nineveh, the province in which Sinjar sits, do provide some medications, but not enough, he said.

The two work with only six beds, one toilet used by around 150 people a day, and almost no equipment. Doctor Rashu said he eventually needs to refer most patients to better-equipped hospitals in Dohuk or Mosul, some 170 kilometres and 130 kilometres away by road, respectively.

But many patients cannot afford to make the trip, he added, and others are too scared to go to Mosul, a former IS stronghold where many Yazidis had been enslaved.

Transfers

The most urgent cases require swift transfers to other facilities, but Sinjar has no functional ambulances.

Hospital staff say two new ambulances were promised in December by the Nineveh health department – which did not respond to IRIN’s request for comment – but these have still not been delivered.

“While the foreign NGO employees are sitting comfortably in the Green Zone in Baghdad or luxury hotels in Erbil, our people are dying here in Sinjar.”

This means every emergency case is complicated, and often needs to involve the armed forces controlling Sinjar. These include the Iraqi army, Yazidi units, and a coalition of mostly Shia militias forces known as the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Units).

In early March, three babies suffering from suspected pneumonia needed to be urgently transferred while hooked up to oxygen. Hospital staff had to ask Hashd al-Shaabi forces to take the babies – aged three, five, and six months – to Mosul by military ambulance.

The forces agreed, but the ambulances were not equipped to give the babies oxygen en route. Concerned the babies would not survive the two-and-a-half hour journey to Mosul, they had to first make a detour to a field hospital to get them hooked up.

Days later, hospital staff again called on the Hashd al-Shaabi, requesting that two trauma patients with severe head injuries be transferred.

Doctor Rashu admits it’s not ideal to mix civilian medical care with military operations, and notes that some Yazidis are too afraid to get into the ambulances.

“It’s not the right way to do things, but we literally have no other choice when faced with patients in a life or death situation,” he said. “I am a doctor, and it is my duty to do whatever I can to try and save patients’ lives.”

While these transfers are dangerously complex and can be difficult to arrange, saving lives in Sinjar itself remains nearly impossible.

Hospital staff say at least 11 people have died in the last six months because of lack of medication, ambulances, medical equipment, and resources.

“Sinjar is being completely ignored,” Doctor Rashu said, and mayor Hiamd agreed, adding: “We urge the government and NGOs to recognise the desperate situation here and urgently prioritise helping the people of Sinjar.”

New fees

Until a few weeks ago, Sinjar General Hospital received 270-300 patients daily, even with its limited resources.

Those numbers have since halved, officials say, after the Iraqi government introduced new charges for hospital visits and prescriptions at public hospitals.

Although the fees – 2,000 Iraqi dinars ($1.70) for a consultation and 1,000 ($.85) for a prescription – are modest, many people in Sinjar can barely afford food.

Doctor Rashu said that while he understands the new system is countrywide, he can’t see “why the Iraqi government activated it here in Sinjar, where people are very, very poor.”

Mourad, the pharmacist, has already seen the impact of the new costs. He recalled a recent case of a mother and three children, all suffering from influenza. She had only 3,000 Iraqi dinars, so paid for her sickest child to be seen while she and the other two children went without examination or medicine.

Where is the help?

Hospital staff were critical of international NGOs and aid agencies, who they said had done little to help Sinjar, apart from make visits, carry out assessments, and make promises that rarely materialised into practical help.

“We ask them, please, get in your cars and come to Sinjar yourselves to see the reality of our situation,” said the hospital volunteer who asked to remain anonymous. “But, if you do come, please don’t make promises you cannot keep.”

René Nijenhuis, deputy head in Iraq of OCHA, the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, said the UN has 19 humanitarian partners currently providing assistance in Sinjar (including some in the health field), of which seven are international NGOs. The UN Development Programme has 38 projects in Sinjar, including four in the healthcare field, said a spokesman, Sam Kimball, who added that the rehabilitation of two primary healthcare facilities in the Sinjar region has been completed, while other projects remain “under implementation”.

But apart from a polio and measles vaccination programme funded by UNICEF, local medical staff say they have only seen a handful of NGOs operating on the ground in Sinjar. They include: MedAir, which runs a mobile clinic one morning a week to offer basic primary healthcare; the Dutch NGO Dorcas Aid International; and the British NGO Road to Peace.

In the last few weeks, Road to Peace has set up a basic paediatric unit in part of the Sinjar hospital formerly used as an IS base, according to the organisation’s director, Sally Becker. Demand to see the international paediatric specialists who stay for weeks at a time has been overwhelming, she says.

“Apart from MedAir and Dorcas, the only NGOs we’ve seen at the hospital are MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières],” said Becker. “In the meantime though, the people of Sinjar are desperate.”

MSF confirmed it was currently conducting an assessment in Sinjar “to gather information about the healthcare needs of children and adults living in the area, and how MSF can potentially respond.”

It isn’t always easy to access Sinjar, as NGOs need authorisation from Baghdad to visit or work in the area. One Western NGO told IRIN that getting approvals could be challenging and that, with several different military and civilian groups in control of the region, rules could arbitrarily change.

But the Norwegian Refugee Council, which conducted an assessment in December last year and is waiting for prospective donors to respond on funding requests for Sinjar-specific programmes, said that NGOs with authorisation from Iraq’s federal forces were able to access Sinjar.

In the meantime, those who have returned to Sinjar carry on as best they can.

Amshee, 50, was cleaning mats outside what she called a “borrowed” empty house her family had just moved in to. “We need everything here, really everything,” she said. “We have no food, no clean water, no money, no work, not even any spare clothes.”

Multiple officials from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), including governors of the four provinces in the region, met on Tuesday with UN agencies and humanitarian organizations in Erbil regarding the current situation of the Syrian refugees and IDPs now in the Kurdistan Region.

Following the meeting, KRG Department of Foreign Relations (DFR) head Falah Mustafa held a press conference with Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the representative for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

Mustafa highlighted the need for more humanitarian aid for refugees and IDPs in the Kurdistan Region, stating that their presence has put a great strain on the KRG's resources and economy.

6,iraq,"Fifteen years ago this week, on April 9, 2003, television networks across the globe cut to a live scene unfolding in Baghdad’s Firdos Square. A motley hybrid of what appeared to be ordinary Iraqis and uniformed U.S. troops — who had begun to occupy Baghdad — pulled down a massive statue of Saddam Hussein. It was a brilliant, semi-staged propaganda exercise meant to reinforce the neoconservative promise that ordinary Iraqis would be exuberant over the fall of the regime and welcome the U.S. troops as liberators. It was with this image firmly tattooed on the public consciousness of the war that George W. Bush stepped off a fighter plane onboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003, ridiculously dressed in a flight suit, and told the world that the American mission was accomplished. There was a massive banner with that message created just for that moment. In reality, this particular war was just beginning and it continues on to this day.

It is important to examine what happened in this war and how it happened: the lies, the crimes, the mass killings, the destruction — all of it. George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and the neoconservatives should all hold a special place in the hall of shame for mass killers for what they did to Iraq. But they did it with the support of many in Congress, including some of the most prominent and elite Democrats, including the 2016 nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.

To understand Iraq’s current reality, we must confront not just 15 years of U.S. policy, but a history that spans the administrations of 11 U.S. presidents. It’s a 55-year history that is filled with constant interventions and bombings, economic sanctions and covert CIA activity, and regime change. And in this history — a history you never hear discussed on cable news — the main victims are, as they’ve always been: ordinary Iraqis.

This is a classic case study in U.S. imperial crimes that began in 1958 when the British-installed monarchy was overthrown by a popular Iraqi army general who set about to nationalize oil, normalize relations with the Soviet Union, and implement sweeping agrarian and social reforms.

7,iraq,"Iraqi security forces have killed a key Islamic State militant group (ISIS) figure associated with the global jihadi organization's elusive leader, according to local and regional reports.

Iraq's Al-Sumeria television network cited intelligence sources who said ISIS official Abu Walid al-Checheni was tracked and killed in an operation in the province of Kirkuk. Checheni was accused of actively plotting attacks against military and civilian targets, while Iraq attempted to wipe out the last of ISIS and prepare for next month's elections.

""The security forces were able to kill the right arm of the terrorist Baghdadi, called Abu Walid al-Checheni...following precise intelligence on his location in a desert area on the outskirts of the city of Kirkuk where he planned terrorist attacks targeting civilians and security forces inside the city,"" security sources told Al-Sumeria.

Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters

The report, which also appeared in Iranian and Syrian media, said that the operation to target Checheni led to the discovery of important documents that revealed the identities of other important ISIS figures. Al Araby Al Jadeed, a U.K.-based newspaper with ties to Qatar, cited Iraqi officials who said the operation could lead to clues as to where Baghdadi himself was hiding out.

Prior to becoming one of the world's most wanted men, Baghdadi was a Sunni Muslim preacher known as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarrai. After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and subsequent Fall of Baghdad, Baghdadi reportedly became involved in a growing insurgency of ultraconservative Sunni Muslim groups. The ranks of these groups grew as the new U.S.-led, mostly Shiite Muslim government purged Sunni Muslims and Baathist officials associated with the government of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Baghdadi was arrested in 2004 and was held in Camp Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two facilities criticized for the way in which detainees were treated. He joined the Islamic State of Iraq, a merger of jihadi organizations that included Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and took over after the death of its leader in 2010.

Baghdadi changed the name to ISIS in 2013 after spreading his ultraconservative Sunni Islamist insurgency into neighboring Syria, where the West, Gulf Arab states and Turkey backed an uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The ISIS leader made his only public appearance in an infamous global call-to-arms from Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2014, the year his group claimed about half of Iraq and Syria.

As ISIS lost nearly all of its territory in recent years, various reports of Baghdadi's fate and whereabouts have surfaced. Russia claimed the jihadi leader was likely killed in an airstrike in the countryside of the group's de facto capital of Raqqa last May, but no evidence supported the claim. The last supposed proof that Baghdadi was alive emerged last September when ISIS released a voice recording.

He did not appear when the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces took Raqqa city last October, nor when the Russia-backed Syrian military and its allies took the final ISIS city of Deir Ezzor and final ISIS town of Al-Bukamal late last year. U.S. and Iraqi officials have suggested he was hiding in the final pockets of ISIS territory between Iraq and Syria and may be injured.","Iraq Kills ISIS Leader Baghdadi's Right-Hand Man in Latest Blow to Islamic State, Reports Say",http://www.newsweek.com/iraq-kills-isis-leader-right-hand-man-latest-blow-15-years-us-victory-reports-878251
8,iraq,"National Security Adviser John Bolton was supposed to lead a White House meeting of the president’s national security team on Monday afternoon, but a surprise visitor showed up and took the reins instead: Vice President Mike Pence.

The vice president doesn’t often attend the White House’s Principals Committee meetings, which are typically led by the national security adviser, but Pence guided Monday’s discussion as President Donald Trump’s senior aides debated how to respond to a gruesome chemical weapons attack in Syria, according to four senior administration officials.

Story Continued Below

Pence’s attendance wasn’t listed on his public schedule. While some meeting attendees viewed his appearance as an attempt to upstage Bolton on his first day as national security adviser, others saw it as an effort on the vice president’s part to offer as a steadying hand as Trump confronts a thorny national security dilemma with a foreign policy team in flux and amid the distraction of multiple investigations.

A White House official said the vice president attended the meeting in the president’s place, though the president’s attendance would have turned the gathering into a meeting of his National Security Council – a formal distinction previous administrations have adhered to closely. The same official said that Pence has chaired Principals Committee meetings before.

Trump, who has promised that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will pay a “big price” for the latest attack, is balancing his public threats to punish Assad with the possibility that air strikes against Syria could kill Russian soldiers there and create a dangerous crisis with Moscow.

Trump’s national security team is rehashing a debate based on the parameters set forth by the president a year ago when he ordered airstrikes after a chemical weapons attack last April, and administration officials said the president feels strongly that the use of chemicals weapons is a type of barbarism the U.S. cannot tolerate. But foreign policy analysts say the administration has yet to find a way to fundamentally shift the dynamics.

“When he ordered that strike, he in essence bought on to the Obama red line,” said Eric Edelman, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration, referring to the previous administration’s threat – empty, as it turned out -- that the use of chemical weapons would spur the U.S. to action. “So now he’s bought on to that red line, he’s gotta enforce it,” Edelman said of Trump.

The president is facing the crisis surrounded by some new faces, like Bolton — and without many old ones, including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, who announced his resignation on Sunday.

The White House said Tuesday that Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert, who has been with the president from the beginning, plans to leave the White House in the coming weeks. And incoming secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a trusted Trump adviser, is preparing for his confirmation hearings on Thursday.

The president was briefed on the options put forward by his advisers in Monday's principal's committee meeting, according to a senior administration official. The president has also consulted with French President Emmanuel Macron and, on Tuesday, with British Prime Minister Theresa May.

On Tuesday morning, the White House abruptly announced that Trump would no longer be taking a planned trip to South America this weekend, opting instead to stay in Washington to oversee the Syria situation. Pence will travel to Lima, Peru, instead.

The Syria crisis coincides with the escalation of myriad investigations surrounding Trump’s closest associates, diverting Trump’s attention and sapping his emotion. The FBI raided the office and hotel room of Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Monday, setting off fears inside the White House that the president may move to fire senior Justice Department officials or special counsel Bob Mueller.

The president addressed the raid on Monday night before a meeting with senior military leaders, calling it “an attack on our country.”

“It’s an attack on what we all stand for,” he said. “And here we are talking about Syria and we’re talking about a lot of serious things.”

Trump's critics say his threats may force the U.S. to ill-considered action.

“Trump has boxed himself in. Having chosen a limited strike last year in an attempt to establish deterrence against chemical weapons use, he faces pressure to engage in a larger strike now that deterrence has failed,” said Colin Kahl, who served as national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis has pushed the president and other White House aides — sometimes, to the point of frustration and anger — to look past what military officials call the “spray and pray” option to consider what the U.S. is trying to achieve in Syria and whether it has a plan to achieve those aims. A Pentagon spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

James Jeffrey, who worked closely with Mattis as ambassador to Iraq during Mattis’s tenure as CENTCOM commander, suggested two reasons why the defense secretary might be reticent to go ahead with strikes.

“Mattis will not want a strike if it doesn’t combine with an overall strategy toward Syria, which this administration does not have,” Jeffrey said.

Edelman, the former Bush administration official, said that last year's Syria strike “wasn’t embedded into an overall strategy on Syria,” which is problematic since it hasn’t deterred Assad from using chemical weapons. “So now the question is how do you establish deterrence? It has to be more painful than the last strike.”

Jeffrey said Mattis may also be trying to reserve military resources and attention for a potential conflict with North Korea – one that aggressive action in Syria might give the North Koreans an opening to precipitate. “As long as a North Korean ICBM capability is on the table, Mattis will not want to be diverted in the Middle East into something that could escalate into a broader regional conflict with Iran,” Jeffrey said.

Others, including some of the president’s informal advisers, are pushing for a much more forceful military response than the limited strike on a Syrian airfield last year aimed at deterring further use of poison gas.

“That has failed,” said retired Army Gen. Jack Keane. “Deterrence is no longer feasible. You have to stop the use of chemical weapons. The only way to make that happen is to destroy the delivery systems or the chemicals themselves – or both.”

That includes the aircraft and helicopters the Syrian army has used to launch the chemical attacks, he said.

“I think [Assad] has about six operational airfields,” Keane added. “It is not as big as it sounds.”

But he acknowledged the presence of Russian technicians at those airfields and is calling on the Trump administration, “if they haven’t already, to tell the Russians all those bases are vulnerable to be struck” and that Moscow should remove its personnel.

He does not believe that Russia wants a bigger fight with United States. Yet there would be other risks to a more aggressive U.S. military response because it would likely require American war planes – not just cruise missiles fired from ships at sea like last time. “We would have to penetrate Syrian air defenses to do it.”

But Keane said he believes there is a strong reluctance among the Pentagon leadership, including Mattis, to take such aggressive action, for fearing of the conflict spinning out of control.

“They have a minimalist view,” he told POLITICO. “We have to have the spine to stand up for civilization and against the use of chemical weapons to kill men, women and children. We have the means to stop it and stop it we should.”

9,iraq,"After years of misrule and repression, the people of Iraqi Kurdistan have had enough. In March 2018, protesters began taking to the streets to demand deep reforms from a government they can no longer tolerate. Led by teachers, university lecturers, doctors and the like, and including large numbers of women, these peaceful demonstrations soon spread across the region.

They began when the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) drastically cut public sector salaries in the name of reform – but there are deeper issues at work in Iraqi Kurdistan. 15 years after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, the region is plagued by unresolved internal political struggles that have arisen from what protesters call the KRG’s undemocratic, unconstitutional and illegal actions.

Iraqi Kurdish politics reached a critical point in September 2017, when the Kurdish region held a long-awaited independence referendum. The KRG and the then-president of the Kurdistan region, Masoud Barzani, used the referendum to dispel a mood of dissatisfaction and indignation by stirring up a hopeful Kurdish nationalism and dreams of nationhood, something in which all Kurds are invested. But the hopes they raised have since been dashed: despite an overwhelming vote for independence from Baghdad, Iraqi Kurdistan seems no closer to full statehood than before.

As the referendum’s promise faded, attention turned back to the failures of the Kurdish ruling elite. The KRG is dominated by two nepotistic ruling parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The two have been siphoning off oil revenue since the inception of the KRG. Their corrupt misrule has financially crippled Iraqi Kurdistan; they govern the region undemocratically, and in defiance of the values of the 2005 Constitution of Iraq. Both parties control their own security forces, and both have abused them for political ends.

Dirty politics

To take one example, in 2015, the KDP used its personal security forces to obstruct its rivals from government buildings. Parliament Speaker Yousif Mohammed, a member of the main rival opposition party Gorran, was prevented from entering Iraqi Kurdistan’s capital city, Erbil; other Gorran ministers were blocked from entering government buildings. The incident saw the region’s parliament closed for nearly two years.

A few years later, the KRG is still incompetent and stubborn. It introduced its new austerity measures despite the fact that civil service salaries had not been paid in full since July 2015. The KRG had hitherto blamed Iraq’s central government for the ongoing wage crisis, accusing Baghdad of withholding the Kurdish region’s required 17% budget allocation.

For its part, the Iraqi government accused the KRG of corruption, stating that its oil revenues should be sufficient to cover civil servant salaries. Baghdad even offered to pay the outstanding civil salaries in return for taking control of the oil revenues in the region. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, called on the KRG to release data on its finances, pointing out that his government shares its figures with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

The latest protests are part of a bottom-up movement for change since 2011 – one that’s met with not just government intransigence, but violent repression.

Iron fists

While Iraq’s 2005 constitution protects freedom of speech, the reality of everyday life in Kurdistan falls far short. Those who dissent, whether in print or in the street, are targeted and often killed.

Journalists who criticise the KRG have been attacked and in some cases killed in the Kurdistan region. Amnesty International called for investigations into the deaths of journalists by the KRG in 2011, and 2013. In 2015 it also requested that in addition to investigating deaths of journalists, armed political party militias should also be investigated. This was also the case in 2016 and 2017.

The UN Human Rights office of the High Commission recorded unfair imprisonments and killings of journalists in their year-end reports of 2011, 2012, 2013 (featuring the big case of the death of Kawa Garmyani, who was gunned down in front of his mother for his anti-corruption journalism) and 2014.

Over the years, KRG security forces have violently attacked and killed many protesters demanding an end to corruption. In 2011 alone, ten people died in protests that lasted 62 days. Among them was 15-year-old Rezhwan Ali, who was shot in the head when security services fired live rounds into the protesting crowds. On February 17 2012, around 200 peaceful demonstrators and protesters were approached by civilian-clothed security services who violently attacked them with batons, while KDP security forces watched without intervening. In 2015 and 2017, the security service opened fire on protesters again.

But memories of these incidents haven’t quelled the protests; instead, they have fuelled them. With two failed ruling parties, violent repression of dissent, no democracy or justice, and a redundant constitution, it’s no wonder the Kurdish region’s residents are up in arms. To try and defuse the crisis, the opposition leaders of Gorran have called for free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections. The corrupt and ruthless KRG is hardly amenable – but if the crisis isn’t immediately addressed, then a full-scale revolution could be on the cards.",Why Iraqi Kurdistan could be on the brink of revolution,http://theconversation.com/why-iraqi-kurdistan-could-be-on-the-brink-of-revolution-94190
10,iraq,"If it wasn’t for the horrors of war, maybe Ryan Hollebon wouldn’t be facing life in prison.

Or maybe, his attorneys argued, he wouldn’t have been in an Anne Arundel County courtroom Tuesday, explaining how he stabbed his girlfriend twice before blacking out “like a television changing channels … with the snow.”

Or how he was jolted back to a gruesome reality by the sound of his dog barking, a banging on the door of the Crofton home he shared with his 28-year-old girlfriend, Jhalandia Butler.

The Iraq war veteran suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and opioid addiction. But prosecutors asked Circuit Court judge Allison Asti to keep the focus on the brutality of Butler’s death in March 2017 and past charges of domestic violence. Hollebon, 40, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in January.

“This relationship was wrought with domestic violence,” Assistant State’s Attorney James Tuomey said. “There’s nothing the state can say to recommend a strong enough sentence.”

Ryan Hollebon, 39, was sentenced to life without parole after pleading guilty to murdering Jhalandia Butler, 28. Ryan Hollebon, 39, was sentenced to life without parole after pleading guilty to murdering Jhalandia Butler, 28. SEE MORE VIDEOS

Ultimately, Asti said that regardless of the circumstances, Butler’s death was “horrible,” adding “I’ve never seen anything like that.”

“These events occurred when his 14-year-old son was upstairs.”

In giving Hollebon a life sentence, Asti recommended that Hollebon receive treated at the Patuxent Institution, a maximum security mental health hospital in Jessup.

Hollebon’s circumstances were key to the narrative he outlined with the help of his defense attorney, Andrew Cochran. Cochran said Hollebon was “damaged because of his service to his country.”

“I was meant to be an angel, not a demon,” Hollebon says. “I’m not supposed to be a murderer. I love helping people…”

For the first time since his arrest, Hollebon attempted to contextualize who he is and what happened on March 5, 2017.

He painted himself as a deeply flawed individual who cares most about his children. Someone who, on one hand, still carries the guilt of shooting a child armed with an AK-47 while stationed in Mosul, Iraq.

On the other, he called himself a loving and compassionate father who fought for years to establish a stable lifestyle and win custody of his children from his ex-wife. He added that he quit his job while raising his daughter in Florida when she was diagnosed with the swine flu, leaving her in a wheelchair for about a year.

Elizabeth Hollebon spoke on her father’s behalf, saying: “he has always been my best friend.”

“He stepped up and became both a father and a mother to me,” she added.

But also in the Annapolis courtroom were Butler’s friends and family; stirring and trying to hold back their anger to the point where it caught the attention of sheriff’s deputies in the courtroom.

When Butler’s family heard about the details of the killing — where Butler suffered more than 50 stab wounds — they sobbed and consoled each other.

When they heard Hollebon painted as a sympathetic figure and heard him call Butler “my Jolie-bean,” fists clenched and Butler’s mother, Christina Wolford, shot her head up.

Wolford described her daughter as someone with “a big heart and a great big smile” who “would do anything to help others.”

She said Hollebon has “broken my heart and spirit” and struggled to read her prepared statement through tears in front of the courtroom.

“I can’t put it into words how hard it is to lose my child,” she said.

Butler and Hollebon met at the Martinsburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Virginia while they were both being treated for PTSD.

After they were kicked out of the program for dating, Hollebon said the relationship immediately went back toward a toxic place, largely fueled by the two’s addiction to opioids.

Tuomey played the 911 call from Butler in December 2016, where she tells dispatchers that Hollebon had choked her and punched her in the stomach “as I was trying to leave.”

“The more I struggled, the harder he squeezed,” Butler can be heard saying in the call.

Hollebon said they picked up drugs when he was released from jail while awaiting the assault charges stemming from a December incident.

He said it was Butler, who asked for him to be released during a bail review hearing in the December incident, who drove him to buy the drugs.

In his final words, Hollebon made a call for those suffering from depression, addiction or mental health conditions to seek help.

He told them to “reach out for help, believe in yourself and remember you are loved.”

He said that Butler survived for a brief period after the attack and staggered out of the house where she embraced Hollebon before she died.

“She showed me mercy and grace,” Hollebon said.

He added that maybe his story could “maybe still save some lives in her memory.”

Comparisons of today’s crisis in Syria with our decision to invade Iraq, or to precipitously pull out our troops, are fatally flawed and functionally irrelevant.

President Bush invaded Iraq and forcibly removed its government, with the peak of our deployment exceeding 160,000 troops four years later. Then, in 2011, President Obama, citing his administration’s failure to obtain a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government, withdrew our forces in an ideologically-driven decision that helped set the conditions for the rise of the Islamic State.

This is because the geostrategic conditions in 2003 and 2011 are fundamentally different from those that pertain to Syria today.

Many of my conservative friends are concerned that President Trump is about to launch a new “neoconservative” crusade in Syria mirroring Bush’s in Iraq. That, I can assure you will never happen, for two simple reasons. First, Syria in 2018 is not Iraq in 2003. Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had few true friends after Sept. 11, 2001, and was hated as much by the Shia of Iran as by the Sunnis in terror groups such as Al Qaeda. He was alone.

Conversely, Syria’s Bashar Assad is a dictator who is friends with other dictatorial regimes and the client of geopolitical actors who want him to stay in power. This includes Iran, Russia and even China. For this reason alone, any invasion and scenario of regime-change in Damascus is off the table until these states lose interest in propping up Assad. At the moment Vladimir Putin, Beijing and the mullahs of Tehran have given no indication that they will desert him.

The second reason has less to do with current geopolitics and much more to do with the current commander-in-chief’s belief system and innate strategic sense. Having worked in his White House and observed his iconoclastic influence on the policymaking machine he inherited, I can attest to the fact that President Trump has no neoconservative reflexes when it comes to the utility and purpose of America’s armed forces. And I mean none.

In fact, this was apparent to me the very first day we met in the summer of 2015, long before he became president, when he asked me to assist in his preparations for the national security debate for GOP candidates that fall. During our first discussion in Trump Tower, it became instantly clear that for Donald Trump, invading other nations and occupying them is fundamentally un-American, born as our nation was in the rejection of imperialism and colonialism.

As his social media posts in the last 24 hours demonstrate, the president is aware and prepared to call out Assad and his supporters for their evil character. But that still does not mean he is George Bush or that this is 2003 and we have to prepare for another naive neocon misadventure. So what is the morally correct response President Trump should give which is, at the same time, strategically sound and true to an “America First” agenda which wants to have our troops more often at home than abroad?

Donald Trump is a patriotic American and a pragmatist at one and the same time. Right now he is incensed by what we have all seen happen in Syria and he has the intelligence at his disposal to know that Assad and his forces are the perpetrators. He will act. But not in any fashion that the beltway “elite” — who have failed us for more than 20 years — expect.

Part of his response will be overt, declarative and utterly convincing for all the world to see.

In 2014, Russia broke an international taboo that had been in place since the allies rolled into Berlin in 1945, namely that nations must never use force to annex the territory of their neighbors.

12,iraq,"On April 10 2003, the first looters broke into the National Museum of Iraq. Staff had vacated two days earlier, ahead of the advance of US forces on Baghdad. The museum was effectively ransacked for the next 36 hours until employees returned.

Jamal Saidi

While the staff - showing enormous bravery and foresight - had removed and safely stored 8,366 artefacts before the looting, some 15,000 objects were taken during that 36 hours. While 7,000 items have been recovered, more than 8,000 remain unaccounted for, including artefacts thousands of years old from some of the earliest sites in the Middle East.

The looting is regarded as one of the worst acts of cultural vandalism in modern times, but much more of Iraq’s rich cultural history has been destroyed, damaged or stolen in the years since. Indeed the illegal trade in looted antiquities is growing.

Oriental Institute Lost Treasures from Iraq database

One of the museum objects that remains lost is a black stone weight shaped like a duck made around 2070 BC and excavated from the ancient city of Ur. Another is a fluted gold and lapis bowl from a royal cemetery in the same city.

The museum’s collection of cylinder seals (used to print images, usually into clay) was hit especially hard as they were easy to conceal and transport and had a ready market overseas. Of the 5144 taken, just over half have been returned. The museum reopened in 2014, somewhat a shadow of its former self.

Oriental Institute Lost Treasures from Iraq database

Some high value items looted from the museum were so recognisable that they could not possibly appear on the open market, suggesting they were taken with buyers already lined up. In contrast to this was the opportunistic looting undertaken by locals: in some galleries copies were stolen but genuine pieces ignored.

Global outrage at the looting did lead to immediate action. One of the most successful programs was an amnesty granted by authorities that saw almost 2,000 items returned by January 2004, and a further thousand items seized by Iraqi and US investigators.

Initial returns were largely local. One early success was the famous Lady of Warka, dated to around 3100 BC; she was recovered by investigators at a nearby farm following a tip off.

Others have come home following international investigations (a large number of objects seem to have travelled through London and New York in the aftermath), such as a statue of Assyrian king Argon II seized in New York in 2008 and returned to the museum in 2015.

Likewise the heaviest item stolen, a headless statue of the Sumerian king Entemena of Lagash was recovered in New York in 2006 with the help of an art dealer. Interpol and the University of Chicago have fastidiously maintained databases for objects looted from museum.

Demand increasing

While destruction and looting of cultural heritage has been a by-product of war for thousands of years, the scale of the looting of the Iraq Museum was staggering. Particularly frustrating were the neglected warnings that such an incident could happen, and the immediate response from the Bush administration that “stuff happens”.

The museum looting should have been a clarion call for the need for better protection of antiquities in conflict zones, both from combatants and local populations. Sadly, this has not been the case. There has been subsequent destruction of archaeological sites and museums in Syria and Libya, ISIS selling antiquities to finance weapons, and increases in thefts from both private and public collections and from archaeological sites.

Part of the problem with halting the illegal global trade of stolen antiquities is the scale of the market. In late 2017, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal presented the sobering assessment that over 100,000 antiquities are offered for sale online daily, of which up to 80% are likely to be faked or looted.

MohammadHuzam/Wikimedia commons

The industry is estimated by Neil Brodie of the University of Oxford to have a turnover of US$10 million a day. Today’s antiquities black market is using social media platforms and messenger apps to reach buyers in a way that would have been inconceivable to looters in 2003. There has been a surge in antiquities originating in Syria available online since the outbreak of the civil war.

In order to halt looting, it is essential that private collectors and institutions only purchase antiquities with a legal provenance to dry up the demand.

Ironically, centuries after many of the remains of these ancient cultural entities were looted by European colonial forces in order to fill grand national museums, we are seeing a 21st century version of cultural colonialism. Private collectors are enabling an entire economy of illegal activities.

The loss of these sites and artefacts is disastrous for humanity. The Baghdad looting has shown that in times of conflict, not even a museum can necessarily provide a sanctuary, without meaningful policies of protection. Sadly, it appears we have not learnt the lessons of April 2003.","Fifteen years after looting, thousands of artefacts are still missing from Iraq’s national museum",http://theconversation.com/fifteen-years-after-looting-thousands-of-artefacts-are-still-missing-from-iraqs-national-museum-93949

“We said we would go into Sinjar. Now operations have begun there. The fight is internal and external,” Erdogan told a crowd in the Black Sea province of Trabzon, without elaborating on what operations he was referring to.

Iraq’s Joint Operations Command denied that any foreign forces had crossed the border into Iraq.

“The operations command confirmed that the situation in Nineveh, Sinjar and the border areas was under the control of Iraqi security forces and there is no reason for troops to cross the Iraqi border into those areas,” it said in a statement.

Sources in Sinjar said there was no unusual military activity in the area on Sunday.

The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. President Tayyip Erdogan said last week they were creating a new base in Sinjar, and that Turkish forces would attack if necessary.

Sources in northern Iraq said on Friday the PKK would withdraw from Sinjar, where it gained a foothold in 2014 after coming to the aid of the Yazidi minority community, who were under attack by Islamic State militants.

The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has for decades been based in Iraq’s Qandil mountain range, near the border with Iran.

Turkish troops and their rebel allies swept into northwest Syria’s Afrin town this month, the culmination of an eight-week campaign to drive Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from the region. Turkey sees the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed PKK.

Erdogan has vowed to extend the military operation along the Syrian border and on Sunday said the Turkish-led forces would take control of the town of Tel Rifaat.

Many civilians and YPG have gathered in and around Tel Rifaat after Turkey seized control of Afrin. It is a Kurdish-controlled enclave, cut off from a larger expanse of Kurdish territory in the northeast of Syria.

The United Nations said last week that around 75,000 people had been displaced to Tel Rifaat and surrounding areas from Afrin, and more were expected to come.",Turkey's Erdogan says operations begin in Iraq's Sinjar region,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-turkey/turkeys-erdogan-says-operations-begin-in-iraqs-sinjar-region-idUSKBN1H10QX
14,iraq,"Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq. He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’

Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq.

In a 20-minute slot on the Today programme, the former Labour leader said that although military intervention was difficult, not intervening also had consequences – as Syria proved.

He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’.

Mr Blair said Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’

He also said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed.

He said: ‘They [Assad’s troops] are winning but they are winning because their outside backers are prepared to intervene and to commit and, frankly, we have not been able to.’

Mr Blair, who was the Middle East peace envoy until 2015, said that this was because of the ‘difficulties of intervention’.

He said: ‘I know that it’s extremely difficult but the problem is non-intervention is also a policy with consequences. Iraq shows you that intervening is extremely difficult but non-intervention – as we see from Syria – is also extremely difficult.

‘The problem in the Middle East is that you do have actors that are prepared to intervene and if you look at the commitment that Russia and Iran have made in Syria it is enormous.’

He added: ‘I’m simply saying that where you intervene, as we’ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s extremely difficult but where you don’t intervene, as we’ve seen in Syria, it’s also difficult.

Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’ He said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed

‘It is important to realise that if we allow it to go unchecked and unanswered then obviously the Assad regime and backers will be emboldened to act.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Blair was using Syria to justify his failed intervention in Iraq.

Referring to the Blair government’s alleged attempts to ‘spin’ intelligence reports to overstate the case for war in Iraq, he said: ‘I think he is attempting to rewrite history and thinks the British people don’t remember the dodgy dossier that got us into the situation in the first place.

‘It is a bit much for him trying to get us into another war justified by his illegal intervention in the Iraq War.

‘He was the Middle East peace envoy for a long time and that wasn’t successful because during that time [the region] was the most volatile that it has ever been.’",Tony Blair is accused of using the crisis in Syria to justify the invasion of Iraq,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5601475/Tony-Blair-accused-using-crisis-Syria-justify-invasion-Iraq.html

Humanitarian assistance has been hampered due to the presence of explosive hazards and people have been forced to abandon their homes due to unexploded ordnance. Water treatment plants and hospitals are also not being utilised as they are littered with explosive hazards. Explosive hazard management responses enable humanitarian actors and those living in conflict-affected areas to receive the urgent assistance that they so desperately need.

UNMAS teams have been facilitating humanitarian and stabilization activities in Mosul for over one year, starting in East Mosul in November 2016 and moving into West Mosul (Old City) in November 2017. During this period, UNMAS has supported over 100 United Nations missions into liberated areas to provide advice on the potential explosive hazard threat. To complement the work already carried out by the Iraqi Security Forces, UNMAS has removed about 45,000 explosive hazards including 748 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) since January 2017. In addition to this, UNMAS, in cooperation with its partner Danish Demining Group, provides risk education to families that are returning to liberated areas to make them aware of the risks posed by explosive hazards and ensure safe returns.

The Government of Denmark, has supported UNMAS for the past three years and has already provided ninety million (90,000,000) Danish Kroner (USD 11.7 million) towards these critical activities. The continued support from the Government of Denmark allows UNMAS to deliver further explosive hazard risk awareness and risk education; to conduct survey and clearance of explosive hazards and to actively coordinate a sustainable explosive hazard response in collaboration with the Government of Iraq, regional authorities, the international and humanitarian community and mine action organizations.

The Danish Ambassador to Iraq, Mr. Gert Meinecke, said “The Government of Denmark highly appreciates the work of UNMAS Iraq, and remains committed to assisting the Government of Iraq in its efforts to address the unprecedented contamination of explosive hazards left behind by Da’esh”.

“Through the continued support and close partnership with UNMAS, the Government of Denmark is greatly assisting to strengthen the response to the threat of unexploded ordnance and IEDs” stated Mr. Pehr Lodhammar, UNMAS Senior Programme Manager “thereby enhancing community safety and facilitating the return of displaced people to their homes.” Contact Pehr Lodhammar, UNMAS Iraq Programme, Senior Programme Manager: lodhammar@un.orglodhammar@un.org",Assisting stabilization and early recovery in liberated areas by mitigating explosive threats [EN/AR],https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/assisting-stabilization-and-early-recovery-liberated-areas-mitigating-explosive-threats

A new front has opened in the destruction of archaeological heritage in the Middle East. Across northern Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State (IS) group devastated antiquities during its reign of terror starting in 2014, pulverizing classical statues such as those of Palmyra in Syria and bulldozing a 3000-year-old ziggurat at Iraq’s Nimrud. The IS group has now been routed by Iraqi and Syrian forces, curbing the destruction but giving archaeologists a firsthand look at an aftermath that is grimmer than many had expected. Meanwhile, the assault on antiquity has extended to Yemen, 2000 kilometers to the south, another archaeological treasure house riven by conflict.

“Our immortal history has been wasted by wars,” lamented Mohanad Ahmad al-Sayani, chair of Yemen’s General Organization of Antiquities and Museums in Sana’a.

In Yemen, the cultural losses have gone largely unnoticed by the wider world but are keenly felt by archaeologists. Although the country has been far less studied than Mesopotamia, it played a critical role in the rise of empires and economies in the region starting around 1000 B.C.E., researchers said at a meeting here last week of the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East.

By 1200 B.C.E., the kingdom of Saba in what is now central Yemen controlled the export of frankincense, derived from a tree that grew only along the country’s southern coast. The prized resin was burned for a millennium and a half in temples from Persia to Rome. The vast wealth of Saba—home to the biblical Queen of Sheba—funded impressive temples, cities, and engineering marvels. Among them was the Marib Dam, built on Wadi Adhanah in the eighth century B.C.E. to help expand agriculture in this arid region; some claim it is the world’s oldest dam.

Today, Yemen is racked by civil war and Islamic extremists who, in a campaign against heresy, have destroyed ancient mosques in the port city of Aden, and a multidomed shrine in the Hadhramaut region.

Yemen’s cultural heritage damaged in war Bombs dropped by a Saudi-led coalition have damaged the ancient Marib Dam, a museum in Dhamar, and medieval castles in Aden and Sana’a.

Bombs dropped by the Saudi-led coalition have wreaked the most damage, Al-Sayani said. The Marib Dam, in an unpopulated area far from the capital, was struck in 2015, leaving a deep gash in the well-preserved northern sluice gate. The regional museum of Dhamar in the southwest, which contained thousands of artifacts from the Himyarite Kingdom, was completely destroyed. The Himyarites conquered Saba in 280 C.E., took over the frankincense monopoly, and became key players in the expanding Indian Ocean trade between the Roman Empire and India until Ethiopian forces overthrew them in 525 C.E.

Al-Sayani showed images from a dozen flattened or severely damaged sites, including medieval castles such Aden’s Sira Fortress, and the centuries-old al-Qassimi neighborhood in Sana’a. More than 60 sites have been destroyed or severely damaged since the conflict began in 2015, Al-Sayani said, chiefly from Saudi bombings. Although some were strategic targets, he charged that the Saudi attacks were a conscious campaign to wreck Yemen’s heritage and demoralize its citizens. “After 3 years of assessing the damage, I believe the bombing is being done with a purpose, since many of these sites are not suitable or useful for military use,” he says.

The destruction seems deliberate, agrees archaeologist Sarah Japp of Berlin’s German Archaeological Institute. “The Saudis were given information on important cultural heritage sites, including exact coordinates,” by UNESCO, said Japp, who was based in Sana’a before the war. UNESCO intended to protect the sites, but she fears that the data may instead have been used for targeting. “There is no reason to say all of these [bombings] are just accidents.” The Saudi embassy in Berlin and officials in Riyadh did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Meanwhile, 2000 kilometers to the north in Syria and Iraq, the damage wrought by years of IS group control is only now coming into focus. “It is nothing short of a catastrophe,” said Michel al-Maqdissi, former head of excavations in Syria’s antiquities department in Damascus, who now works at the Louvre in Paris and maintains contacts in Syria.

Some of the worst reports come from Mari, a 60-hectare site on the banks of the Euphrates River that 4000 years ago was one of the world’s largest cities. Just north of Sumer and the Akkadian Empire, Mari served as a key trading center for Mesopotamian goods and Anatolian metals and stone, and once boasted the best preserved early palace in the Middle East.

But no longer. Archaeologist Pascal Butterlin of Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, who worked at Mari for years and has gathered information from Syrian sources, displayed an image of the palace from the ground that shows near total destruction of Mari’s central area. The site’s ancient statues were removed to museums long ago, so the reasons behind the destruction remain murky, although the IS group’s desire to profit from antiquities is well-known. A nearby large mound called Tell Medkouk was bulldozed completely to unearth objects for looting. From satellite data on the center of Mari, Butterlin estimates that looters dug some 1500 pits, many of them more than 5 meters deep and 6 meters wide. The vehicle tracks “make it look like they had traffic jams there,” he said. He suspects that thousands of looted cuneiform tablets, small figurines, and bronze objects won’t show up on the art market for years, as sellers wait for international outrage to cool.

The situation is even worse at Dura-Europos, which until recently was a remarkably well-preserved city upstream of Mari. From the first century B.C.E., this city lay on the frontier of the Roman and Persian empires, which took turns controlling it, and once held both one of the world’s oldest Jewish synagogues and oldest Christian churches. “The scale of the disaster there is profound,” said Chekmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist now at the University of Strasbourg in France. “There are innumerable pits—some 9500—and the necropolis is gone.”

Across the border in Iraq, the old city of Mosul once boasted a host of Islamic and Christian monuments, many destroyed or damaged during the IS group’s 3 years of control. But the worst devastation came last summer, when more than 30,000 bombs and missiles hit historic buildings during the battle for the city, said Karel Nováček of the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Czech Republic. “The old city was annihilated,” he said at the meeting. He charges that the destruction continues, as Iraqi construction crews clear the wreckage without trying to preserve what’s left or tally the damage.

“The heritage management is nonexistent,” he said. “We need careful removal of the rubble, but that is not happening.” His team is assembling what data they can from old reports and photographs that could provide some basis for reconstructing historic sites. He plans to lead an on-the-ground assessment in June, in hopes of providing Iraqis a chance to mend what they can of their battered cultural heritage.","War savages ancient sites in Yemen and Iraq, destroying archaeological record",http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/war-savages-ancient-sites-yemen-and-iraq-destroying-archaeological-record

ANKARA - Anadolu Agency

Seven outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militants were “neutralized” during air operations over the last two days in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, the Turkish army said on April 10.

The Turkish authorities often use the word “neutralized” in statements to imply that the militants in question either surrendered or were killed or captured.

Turkish jets hit PKK targets in the southeastern Turkish province of Şırnak as well as in the Zap and Hakurk regions of northern Iraq, the Turkish General Staff said.

Four shelters used by PKK militants were destroyed.

19,iraq,"Iraq today has a unique of opportunity to chart a new path away from 15 years of chaos and upheaval.

Following the defeat of ISIS, the security situation is better than it has been for many years. Politically, there are glimpses of a move from identity to issue-based politics in various cross-sect electoral alliances. For instance, Islamists associated with Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr have joined forces with secularists linked to the Iraqi Communist Party. Many Iraqis now see corruption as just as bad as terrorism, and the gap between elite and citizen has become more important than the gap between Sunni, Shia, and Kurd.

But despite these hopeful signs, the political class and Iraq’s state institutions remain stale; over 90 per cent of the political parties and electoral entities running in these elections are the same. Rather than supporting the strengthening of institutions and the political culture through methods like new political parties or independent commissions to regulate electoral bylaws, Iraq’s foreign allies, from Washington to London to Brussels, appear more concerned with upholding the status quo, once again focusing on personalities from the old elite.

The short-term logic is that in ‘extraordinary circumstances’, preferred political personalities can later fix the institutions. But this is a crucial mistake, which has failed in Iraq in the past and risks squandering today’s opportunity for reform.

This mistake is reinforced by the tendency to push for elections as the main process of state-building and democratization. Although the decision to hold elections on time is constitutionally mandated, in Iraq international partners pushed for them too hastily and jeopardized the chance to build new institutions such as political parties and civil society monitors.

In a place like Mosul, where residents are just coming out of a traumatic three-year spell under ISIS, rushing into elections favours an old elite who can easily organize. New and emerging leaders, including teachers, engineers, social workers and civil society activists, have been unable to develop political platforms and institutions or mobilization strategies. As a result, for the next four years, the same leaders who abetted political dysfunction before ISIS took over the city are likely to govern again.

In the lead-up to the upcoming elections, many analysts are still insisting that Western countries should interfere in the government formation process that follows to help ensure a moderate coalition of a mix of Shia, Kurdish and Sunni elites. Yet this is the same failed strategy Western countries took in 2006 and 2010, when they supported former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, who they believed would then build the Iraqi state.

During two key government formation processes, analysts argued that Maliki was a break from sectarianism. US diplomats often praised the ‘the more nationalist Maliki’. In 2006, US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad endorsed Maliki as prime minister by claiming, ‘Maliki has deep concerns about expanding Iranian influence in Iraq.’

Then, in 2010, US Ambassador Christopher Hill argued, ‘in an Iraqi body politic that is attempting, albeit haltingly, to move toward a nationalist focus and away from the sectarian politics that shaped the 2005 election, the [opposition] INA is seen as strongly sectarian and more religious than Maliki's SLA.’ Ultimately, when Maliki formed the government in 2010, the White House applauded ‘a clear rejection of the efforts by extremists to spur sectarian division.’

Yet Maliki’s stint as premier ended in failure when ISIS captured one-third of Iraq in the summer of 2014. His over-centralization of power and perceived sectarian-based, Iran-allied policies failed to build strong independent institutions. And many Iraqis remember Washington’s role in supporting the former prime minister.

Fundamentally, the flawed process of supporting individuals first and institutions later rarely translates to effective state-building. Beyond the consequences of simply getting it wrong as they did with Maliki, choosing personalities assigns top-down legitimacy to the same leadership.

For Iraq’s allies, this process has often seemed the easier option, as many have typically been late to understand bottom-up dynamics and the complexities of new and emerging leaders in society. Moreover, supporting individuals rather than building institutions reinforces the status-quo of elites who can more easily mobilize.

As much as it may be an uphill climb, however, the short 15-year history of the new Iraq has taught that foreign interference in government formation does not build strong institutions but rather solidifies the old, dysfunctional elite. Rather than directly interfering and choosing preferred leaders, Iraq’s international partners need to better understand long-term political trends and help to facilitate the building of independent institutions to create a level playing field and hold the elite accountable.","Iraq’s Western Allies Need to Support Institutions, Not Individuals",https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/iraq-s-western-allies-need-support-institutions-not-individuals
20,iraq,"By Elaine Sanchez Brooke Army Medical Center

An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its wounded and injured warriors and their families.

Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured Brooke Army Medical Center’s Warrior and Family Support Center.

The Warrior and Family Support Center provides coordinated services to patients, next of kin and extended family members.

As Umm Qusay walked through the center, she expressed her admiration for its recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.

“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.

‘I See Great Courage Here’

“I see such great courage here helping injured soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”

Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62 year old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at age 13.

In 2014, great tragedy struck her family, at the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorists.

“ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” Umm Qusay said. “They killed children, older people, women.”

On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.

Taking Action to Rescue Others

Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with identification cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shiites how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to ISIS operatives.

“Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shiite,” according to her biography.

For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.

“It was difficult,” Umm Qusay said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”

Caring for Wounded Iraqi Service Members

Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.

When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.

“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”

For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept.

“When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage,” she said.

“We are all created by God,” Umm Qusay said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1489254/famed-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-army-medical-center/

23 of May will mark the second anniversary of the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action that aims at lifting barriers persons with disabilities are facing in accessing relief, protection and recovery support and ensuring their participation in the development, planning and implementation of humanitarian programmes. Whilst more than 180 States, UN agencies, organisations operating in humanitarian settings and organisations of persons with disabilities have endorsed the charter, much still needs to be done to ensure the humanitarian response in Iraq is inclusive of persons with disabilities.

This brief presents and addresses some of the challenges that prevent internally displaced persons with disabilities and other vulnerable population groups (elderly, injured persons, pregnant women, etc.) in camp settings from accessing humanitarian services in Iraq and impede on the development of an inclusive humanitarian response. Concrete examples drawn from Handicap International’s experience working in Iraq with persons with disabilities and vulnerable population groups further illustrate those challenges. The recommendations to the humanitarian community provided in this brief aim at improving the protection of persons with disabilities and their inclusion in the humanitarian response.

22,iraq,"BAGHDAD — Turkish troops in northern Iraq have begun building military bases to confront the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), according to an April 3 report by Al-Hurra TV that included video footage of construction. This comes after Turkish troops reportedly advanced about 6 miles into Iraqi territory last month in order to fight the PKK in the northern regions of Iraq.

On March 29, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talked about eliminating the PKK fighters in the Iraqi city of Sinjar during a conference held by the Justice and Development Party in Ankara, despite the Turkish government’s earlier pledge to respect Iraqi sovereignty.

Erdogan also announced that Turkey “is gearing up to start cleansing Ain al-Arab [which the Kurds call Kobani], Tell Abyad, Ras al-Ain and Hasakah in Syria from terrorist elements and getting ready to enter Sinjar at any moment.”

Meanwhile, a high-level Iraqi delegation visited the Turkish capital to hold talks on the fight with the PKK, according to Jabbar al-Yawar the secretary-general of the peshmerga forces.

“The Iraqi delegation is trying to reach diplomatic solutions with the Turkish side to spare the region the scourge of military battles. The Sinjar crisis is the prerogative of the Baghdad-based central government that has sent the 15th Brigade there, fearing any interference on the part of the Turkish forces. We believe that the PKK problem must be dealt with comprehensively through Iraqi-Turkish coordination,” Yawar told Al-Monitor.

Yawar acknowledged the presence of PKK forces in the Qandil Mountains of the Kurdistan Region and some areas of Ninevah and Syrian Kurdistan.

“The peshmerga will not intervene in this crisis related to Iraqi sovereignty, especially after it withdrew from Sinjar following its liberation from the Islamic State,” he said.

Yawar ruled out any period of relative calm on the Iraqi-Syrian border before the end of the civil war in Syria. “Sinjar represents a triangle on the border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey. It is only normal for many armed factions to move in this area, taking advantage of the mountainous hinterlands,” he said.

Iraq’s concerns about Turkish threats are not limited to officials in the Kurdistan Region only. Turkmen member of parliament Jassem Mohammed Jaafar, a leader in the ruling Dawa Party in Iraq, said, “The Turkish threats are aimed at exerting pressure on the Iraqi side to speed up the process of exerting its control over Sinjar and to pressure Erbil to cut off support and contact with the PKK.”

Jaafar told Al-Monitor, “The Turkish forces have a lot to lose if they carry out a military operation in Mount Sinjar, giving the area’s rugged nature, located at hundreds of kilometers from the Turkish border. The Turkish forces will have to face the Iraqi security forces deployed there.”

He added, “Yet the Iraqi government is working on containing the crisis, and we believe the statements of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim about respecting Iraq's sovereignty [are genuine].""

Speaking at a press conference April 3, a member of parliament for Sinjar, Vian Dakhil, referenced a statement signed by a group of Iraqi lawmakers condemning Erdogan's threats to enter Sinjar. “We condemn and denounce the statements of the Turkish president threatening a military intervention in Sinjar. This violates all international laws and diplomatic norms,"" she noted.

Dakhil called on the Iraqi government to take all “necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq and the security of its borders and its citizens.” She urged the government not “to coordinate with the Turkish side, away from the legislative authority in relations to the sovereignty and security of Iraq and to work on expelling PKK elements so as to avoid Sinjar becoming an international battlefield for neighboring countries. [The government] has to discredit all justifications by neighboring countries seeking to interfere in Iraq's domestic affairs.”

Dakhil also said that Iraqi parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri had repeatedly rejected to include the Sinjar crisis on the parliament’s agenda, citing only government measures, referring to his bias toward Ankara.

Nevertheless, the situation in Sinjar appears to be different from what the Kurds are witnessing in Afrin and the rest of the Kurdish areas in Syria. This disparity is mainly due to the American presence in Iraq, Washington’s good relations with Baghdad and the large amount of trade between Iraq and Turkey. Ankara, however, is playing at brinkmanship in a bid to get rid of the PKK, especially since it has already started military operations on the ground in Syria.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said March 27 that the presence of the PKK in Iraq’s Sinjar is a threat to Turkey, and the United States is ""intending to see [the PKK] pull out of the Sinjar area.”

According to the US State Department, Tina Kaidanow, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, visited Turkey and Iraq March 28-April 3.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a press statement that the United States “understands the Turkish concerns about the PKK presence in the Kurdistan region and Iraq.”

Nauert stressed that any Turkish military operation in Sinjar must be with the approval of Iraq and in coordination with the Iraqi government.

As things stand now, there are two scenarios for Sinjar’s crisis. The first is the least likely: Turkey would launch a military operation in the Iraqi territories that might reach the Kurdish areas, namely Dahuk. However, this would affect bilateral relations in light of Baghdad’s rejection of the scenario and its likely economic repercussions. Ankara could instead opt for the second scenario: letting the Iraqi government eliminate the PKK. This means airstrikes and land operations in the Kurdistan Region, which is a big concern for the Iraqi Kurdish parties.","How will Sinjar crisis end as tensions mount between Baghdad, Ankara?",https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/sinjar-iraq-kurdistan-turkey-pkk.html

Last year Iraqi warplanes carried out at least one strike on Islamic State targets inside Syria, in coordination with the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition and with the approval of the Syrian government.

“Daesh are present in eastern Syria, at the Iraqi border. I will take all necessary measures if they threaten the security Iraq,” Abadi told a news conference in Baghdad. He said he had communicated this position to U.S President Donald Trump on the telephone on Sunday.

He said he had asked the country’s military command “to lay out all possible plans, as I am keen to protect Iraqi citizens” from cross-border attacks.

An expert close to the Baghdad government told Reuters last week that Iraq may carry out special forces operations against Islamic State militants in Syria.

While troops could be dropped into Syria, the plan did not at this stage involve sending ground forces over the border, Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises several governments on Islamic State, including Iraq’s, told Reuters.

Iraq has good relations with Iran and Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s main backers in the seven-year Syrian civil war, while it also has strong support from the U.S.-led coalition.

Abadi declared victory over Islamic State within Iraq in December, although the militants have continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across the country.

U.S.-backed Iraqi forces dislodged the militants from Mosul, their de facto capital in the north of the country, putting an end to the cross-border “caliphate” they declared in 2014.

Thousands of displaced Yazidis in the Sinjar mountains in Northern Iraq are still suffering and afraid, almost four years after Islamic State attacked Yazidi villages.

""The situation of the Yazidis in Iraq is of great concern. It is an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe with still close to 400,000 internally displaced scattered throughout the provinces of northern Iraq,"" Lisa Miara, founder of Springs of Hope Foundation, told VOA.

Miara said three-and-a-half years after the Yazidi genocide, some villages are still unreachable and no major effort has been made to enable thousands of Yazidis to restore their lives and businesses.

Yazidis, an ethno-religious minority group of about 550,000 people, mostly reside in northern Iraq, in an area also populated by Kurds and Arabs.

In August 2014, the Islamic State attacked the Yazidi-populated Sinjar mountain, killing thousands of men and taking thousands of women and girls as sex slaves. Yazidis consider the attack one of 74 genocides in their history.

The massacre against Yazidis was one of the reasons the U.S.-led military operation, under the authority of President Barack Obama, targeted Islamic State in Iraq in August 2014, the first offensive action by the U.S. in Iraq since it withdrew ground troops in 2011.

""Targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death,"" Obama said at the time.

Humanitarian aid

Given the large-scale humanitarian demand among displaced Yazidis, a number of local and global organizations are pleading to remain focused on the plight of the Yazidis.

Saad Babir, communication manager at Yazda Organization, told VOA that basic needs such as electricity, water and education are lacking. In addition, more than 70 percent of houses have been destroyed, and many religious temples targeted by IS are in rubble.

Thousands of Yazidi women kidnapped by IS are still missing. After the defeat of IS in Iraq and Syria, Yazidis feel they have been marginalized and efforts to find the girls — missing since 2014 — have receded.

""More than 3,000 women, men and children are still missing. Once IS was gone, no more attention is paid for the victims, no post-IS rehabilitation for the victims, and not just for Yazidis but everyone affected by ISIS,"" said Babir, using an acronym for the group.

Reconciliation

Babir said the atrocities committed by IS have created mistrust in the region between minorities and their communities in general.

USAID and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) are working jointly on the recovery of minority groups.

""One thing we are doing is working to help restore some of the cultural diversity that has been a hallmark in Iraq,"" USAID's Mark Green, the United States' top foreign aid official, said at United States Institute of Peace last week.
