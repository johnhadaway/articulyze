0,iraq,"BAGHDAD — Turkish troops in northern Iraq have begun building military bases to confront the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), according to an April 3 report by Al-Hurra TV that included video footage of construction. This comes after Turkish troops reportedly advanced about 6 miles into Iraqi territory last month in order to fight the PKK in the northern regions of Iraq.

On March 29, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talked about eliminating the PKK fighters in the Iraqi city of Sinjar during a conference held by the Justice and Development Party in Ankara, despite the Turkish government’s earlier pledge to respect Iraqi sovereignty.

Erdogan also announced that Turkey “is gearing up to start cleansing Ain al-Arab [which the Kurds call Kobani], Tell Abyad, Ras al-Ain and Hasakah in Syria from terrorist elements and getting ready to enter Sinjar at any moment.”

Meanwhile, a high-level Iraqi delegation visited the Turkish capital to hold talks on the fight with the PKK, according to Jabbar al-Yawar the secretary-general of the peshmerga forces.

“The Iraqi delegation is trying to reach diplomatic solutions with the Turkish side to spare the region the scourge of military battles. The Sinjar crisis is the prerogative of the Baghdad-based central government that has sent the 15th Brigade there, fearing any interference on the part of the Turkish forces. We believe that the PKK problem must be dealt with comprehensively through Iraqi-Turkish coordination,” Yawar told Al-Monitor.

Yawar acknowledged the presence of PKK forces in the Qandil Mountains of the Kurdistan Region and some areas of Ninevah and Syrian Kurdistan.

“The peshmerga will not intervene in this crisis related to Iraqi sovereignty, especially after it withdrew from Sinjar following its liberation from the Islamic State,” he said.

Yawar ruled out any period of relative calm on the Iraqi-Syrian border before the end of the civil war in Syria. “Sinjar represents a triangle on the border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey. It is only normal for many armed factions to move in this area, taking advantage of the mountainous hinterlands,” he said.

Iraq’s concerns about Turkish threats are not limited to officials in the Kurdistan Region only. Turkmen member of parliament Jassem Mohammed Jaafar, a leader in the ruling Dawa Party in Iraq, said, “The Turkish threats are aimed at exerting pressure on the Iraqi side to speed up the process of exerting its control over Sinjar and to pressure Erbil to cut off support and contact with the PKK.”

Jaafar told Al-Monitor, “The Turkish forces have a lot to lose if they carry out a military operation in Mount Sinjar, giving the area’s rugged nature, located at hundreds of kilometers from the Turkish border. The Turkish forces will have to face the Iraqi security forces deployed there.”

He added, “Yet the Iraqi government is working on containing the crisis, and we believe the statements of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim about respecting Iraq's sovereignty [are genuine].""

Speaking at a press conference April 3, a member of parliament for Sinjar, Vian Dakhil, referenced a statement signed by a group of Iraqi lawmakers condemning Erdogan's threats to enter Sinjar. “We condemn and denounce the statements of the Turkish president threatening a military intervention in Sinjar. This violates all international laws and diplomatic norms,"" she noted.

Dakhil called on the Iraqi government to take all “necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq and the security of its borders and its citizens.” She urged the government not “to coordinate with the Turkish side, away from the legislative authority in relations to the sovereignty and security of Iraq and to work on expelling PKK elements so as to avoid Sinjar becoming an international battlefield for neighboring countries. [The government] has to discredit all justifications by neighboring countries seeking to interfere in Iraq's domestic affairs.”

Dakhil also said that Iraqi parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri had repeatedly rejected to include the Sinjar crisis on the parliament’s agenda, citing only government measures, referring to his bias toward Ankara.

Nevertheless, the situation in Sinjar appears to be different from what the Kurds are witnessing in Afrin and the rest of the Kurdish areas in Syria. This disparity is mainly due to the American presence in Iraq, Washington’s good relations with Baghdad and the large amount of trade between Iraq and Turkey. Ankara, however, is playing at brinkmanship in a bid to get rid of the PKK, especially since it has already started military operations on the ground in Syria.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said March 27 that the presence of the PKK in Iraq’s Sinjar is a threat to Turkey, and the United States is ""intending to see [the PKK] pull out of the Sinjar area.”

According to the US State Department, Tina Kaidanow, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, visited Turkey and Iraq March 28-April 3.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a press statement that the United States “understands the Turkish concerns about the PKK presence in the Kurdistan region and Iraq.”

Nauert stressed that any Turkish military operation in Sinjar must be with the approval of Iraq and in coordination with the Iraqi government.

As things stand now, there are two scenarios for Sinjar’s crisis. The first is the least likely: Turkey would launch a military operation in the Iraqi territories that might reach the Kurdish areas, namely Dahuk. However, this would affect bilateral relations in light of Baghdad’s rejection of the scenario and its likely economic repercussions. Ankara could instead opt for the second scenario: letting the Iraqi government eliminate the PKK. This means airstrikes and land operations in the Kurdistan Region, which is a big concern for the Iraqi Kurdish parties.","How will Sinjar crisis end as tensions mount between Baghdad, Ankara?",https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/sinjar-iraq-kurdistan-turkey-pkk.html

2,iraq,"Financial woes and the ongoing rivalry between Baghdad, Erbil have eroded faith in party politics in Iraq's Kurdish region





ERBIL, Iraq

In the run-up to May 12 parliamentary polls, would-be voters in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region appear apathetic -- due largely to an ongoing economic crisis and a lack of faith in their political leaders.

In Iraq’s last general election in 2014, political parties based in the Kurdish region clinched a total of 62 seats in the country’s national assembly.

Forty-four candidates from Kurdish parties were elected in the provinces of Erbil, Sulaymaniyah and Dohuk, while another 18 were elected in territories disputed between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), including Kirkuk, Mosul and Diyala.

Previously, Kurdish parties had enjoyed considerable influence in disputed areas, where standards of living had been relatively higher than in other parts of Iraq.

The situation, however, has taken a turn for the worse in recent years due to chronic economic problems, the emergence of the Daesh terrorist group and mounting tensions between the Erbil-based KRG and Baghdad.

First, Erbil suffered from budget cuts imposed by the central government. It sustained another major blow in 2013 with the emerge of Daesh, which overran much of northern and western Iraq the following year.

Already reeling from chronic financial problems and the new terrorist threat, the Kurdish region suffered another setback last year when the KRG conducted an unconstitutional referendum on regional independence.

Following the illegitimate poll, federal forces moved into disputed parts of Iraq -- including Kirkuk, Mosul and Diyala -- while Peshmerga forces loyal to the KRG withdrew from these areas.

Many people in the Kurdish region blame the referendum debacle on the region’s two main political parties: the Erbil-based Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Sulaymaniyah-based Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).

Voter apathy

Anadolu Agency spoke to several would-be voters in the Kurdish region, most of whom voiced distrust in their politicians and put little stock in the upcoming polls.

Surkey Selim, the owner of a bookshop in Erbil, said most of the region’s people had lost faith in the regional government.

The KDP and PUK, he said, “incessantly attack one another rather than doing anything positive”.

Salah Abubakar, who manages a restaurant in Erbil, said that the region’s political parties lacked credibility.

“This is because the main Kurdish parties have failed to fulfill the promises they made to the people,” he said.

“They couldn't even protect the gains we made,” Abubakar asserted in reference to the recent loss of disputed areas.

“Kurdish political parties -- both on the left and the right -- have forfeited the people’s trust,” he added.

Shukru Mohamed, a painter who fled to the Kurdish region four years ago after Daesh overran Iraq’s western Anbar province, said there was little enthusiasm in Erbil -- unlike in other parts of Iraq -- for the upcoming polls.

He said the “savage” competition observed in Baghdad and Anbar was hardly in evidence in the Kurdish region.

“The crisis over [disputed] Kirkuk and the salary cuts [recently imposed by Baghdad on the Kurdish region’s public-sector employees] have led to a loss of trust among Kurds, both in the central government and Kurdish political parties,” Mohamed said.

Aydin Maruf, an Erbil-based lawmaker for the Iraq Turkmen Front, for his part, cited several reasons for the lack of electoral enthusiasm in the region.

“The economic crisis is a significant factor, as local people are having a hard time making ends meet,” he said.

“Another factor is the lack of trust in the [region’s] ruling parties, while the ongoing Daesh threat -- and the bitter dispute between Erbil and Baghdad -- have also served to dishearten the electorate,” Maruf added.

Yet another factor, the lawmaker said, is the fact that many people in the region care more about elections for the Kurdish parliament in Erbil, which are scheduled to be held in September.





Disputed areas

Murad Hakim Mohamed, a sociologist at the political science department at Erbil's Salahaddin University, said the loss of Kurdish influence in the disputed areas would likely have a negative impact on election results.

“Kurdish parties in Kirkuk, for example, can be expected to lose votes,” he said.

“Following the recent clashes [over disputed areas], Kurdish political influence in the region was severely diminished,” he explained.

“What’s more, many Kurds were displaced from their homes [in disputed areas],” Mohamed said. “Those who remained have lost faith in the political parties.”

Noting that Kurds previously had 18 elected MPs from the disputed areas, Mohamed predicted that this number would fall dramatically in the upcoming polls.

Of Iraq’s 24 million registered voters, 3.7 million are in the Kurdish region.

According to Iraq’s electoral districting, Erbil will elect 16 MPs, Sulaymaniyah 18 and Dohuk 12. As for the disputed parts of the country, Mosul will elect 34 MPs, Diyala 14, Kirkuk 13 and Saladin 12.

Baghdad (Iraqinews.com) – An Iraqi fisherman was arrested Sunday in Dhi Qar governorate as he was found implicated in killing two schoolgirls via his locally-made landmines, a security source was quoted as saying.

“A force from the Counter-Terrorism Service raided the fisherman’s house in al-Nasiriyah district in Dhi Qar and took him to a detention center as he will face charges of manufacturing landmines that killed two schoolgirls and injured another earlier in the day,” the source told Alghad Press.

“The three students were on their way to school when the landmine exploded.”

The suspect is believed to be “manufacturing the landmines to use them in his business,” and not for terrorist attacks, the source noted. “He was referred to the authorities concerned to be interrogated,” added the source.

Following decades of fierce conflicts between Iraqi government forces and armed groups, Iraq is still heavily contaminated with landmines and other unexploded materials. The UN says nearly five million people have been displaced since Islamic State militants took over large areas of Iraq in 2014 to proclaim a self-styled “Islamic Caliphate”.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted in over 5 million internally displaced persons across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

5,iraq,"Erbil; Iraq. 11 April 2018 – On 10 April, the Kurdistan Regional Government together with the United Nations and its partners held a high-level joint conference on the priority needs in the Kurdistan Region.



Over one million internally displaced people and refugees have sought safety in Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah governorates since January 2014. With the end of large-scale military offensives in late 2017, many families have been returning home and are trying to rebuild their lives. Close to 30 per cent of displaced Iraqis and nearly all of the 250,000 Syrian refugees in the country are living in the Kurdistan Region. This year, humanitarian partners estimate that approximately 736,000 people living in the Kurdistan Region, nearly half of them children, will require some form of humanitarian assistance.



In 2018, the humanitarian community, comprised of United Nations agencies, national and international NGOs and other partners, is requesting US$569 million through the Humanitarian Response Plan to respond to the needs of 3.4 million of the most vulnerable people in Iraq. In order to deliver humanitarian assistance to 600,000 of the most vulnerable people in the Kurdistan Region, the humanitarian community in Iraq is seeking US$156 million in financial support to implement activities outlined in the response plan.



“With the help of its international partners, the Kurdistan Regional Government has been able to provide critical humanitarian assistance, safety and security to over 1.5 million internally displaced Iraqis and 250,000 Syrian refugees” said Mr. Karim Sinjari, Minister of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government, while emphasising that “with continued support and collaboration of the international community, we can and are committed to do even more for the 1.1 million displaced people and 248,000 refugees still hosted in our region until safe, voluntary and dignified return is made possible.”



Additionally, Mr. Sinjari stated that “displacement is protracted and return might take years. An important step is therefore to recognize that the displaced people, refugees and the newly displaced as well as the host communities will continue to need assistance in 2018 and beyond.”



“The humanitarian crisis in Iraq has entered a new phase with the end of large-scale military operations. Nevertheless, protection continues to be the overriding humanitarian priority in Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region; thousands of people have been already or are newly displaced and families have started returning to their homes,” said Mr Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the acting Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.



“Given the scale of the existing humanitarian needs, the United Nations and its partners in the Kurdistan Region remain committed to providing essential services and assistance packages to the vulnerable population, in particular those traumatised by the violence. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to have strong international support for this year’s response plan,” added Mr Balakrishnan.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the Joint Crisis Coordination Centre have provided a conducive environment for the work of the United Nations agencies and international NGOs towards meeting the humanitarian needs of Iraqis. However, local resources remain stretched.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the humanitarian community will continue to coordinate assistance and respond to the needs and challenges faced by displaced people and returnees across the region.

6,iraq,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday.

The air strikes marked a “a very dangerous development”, the ministry said in statement.

“Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,” it said.

The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.

Iraq’s position is in line with those of Russia and Iran, the main backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war which has raged in his country since 2011.

The United States, France and Britain have accused Assad of attacking the Douma suburb of Damascus with chemical agents on April 7. They say the air strikes on Saturday had been aimed at deterring his further use of chemical weapons.

Shi’ite-led Iraq has kept good relations with Assad’s government and Iran, while also receiving massive military and financial support from the United States, Britain and France.

A U.S-led military coalition provided key air and ground support to the Iraqi government forces last year to recapture Mosul and other cities seized by Islamic State in 2014.

The strike targeted a position used by the commanders of the group, south of the town of Deshaisha, the statement said. “The position was completely destroyed,” it said.

The Iraqi air force has already carried out several air strikes against IS in Syria since last year, with the approval of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.

Abadi last month said he would “take all necessary measures if they threaten the security of Iraq,” referring to the militants who just three years ago overran a third of Iraq.

The prime minister declared final victory over the ultra hardline group in December but it still poses a threat from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq.

Last month Cape Town was saved from reaching 'Day Zero' when a dramatic 60 per cent reduction in consumption warded off disaster.

But according to a report by the Resource Watch organisation, Morocco, India, Iraq and Spain are facing a similar crisis after water levels have fallen dramatically, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.

Morocco:

The Al Massira dam in Morocco provides water for big cities as well as the country's vital agricultural sector

Resource Watch says the surface area of Al Massira dam, the second-largest reservoir in Morocco, has shrunk by more than 60 percent over the last three years.

The last time Al Massira was at this level was between 2005 and 2008, when more than 700,000 Moroccans were affected by drought and grain production fell by 50 percent.

In common with its north African neighbours, Morocco suffers from recurring droughts and in 2016 was hit by the worst drought in three decades.

As well as the agricultural sector, Al Massira supplies water to many cities, including Casablanca.

India:

In India, the falling water levels of two crucial reservoirs have led to fierce argument about how to allocate water.

The Narmada River flows from east to west through the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, then through the state of Gujarat before emptying into the Arabian Sea.

Poor rains in 2017 have led to a clash how much water should be released from the Indira Sagar reservoir to the downstream Sardar Sarovar reservoir in Gujarat.

The Sardar Sarovar reservoir provides drinking water for 30 million people, almost half of Gujarat’s total population, and the irrigation for more than a million farmers.

Poor rainfall has led to a fierce argument about how much water to release from the Indira Sagar dam (pictured)

But releasing more water from the Indira Sagar dam would have further reduced the its reservoir’s supply during the critical summer period.

‘India is a highly water-stressed country and has suffered through many debilitating droughts in recent years,’ say Resource Watch.

‘These dry spells have devastated farmers, even driving some to commit suicide.'

Iraq:

The reservoir of the Iraq’s Mosul Dam has shrunk 60 percent in surface area from the late 1990s to present day.

According to Resource Watch, there are several reasons behind this including poor water resource management by the Iraqi government and intense regional droughts.

Water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir have fallen by 60 per cent, with a Turkish hydroelectric project to blamed by many

But Turkey’s Southeast Anatolia Project and its 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants across the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are cited by many as a key driver behind the reduced river flow into Iraq.

Spain:

Spain, along with its neighbour Portugal, is fighting a drought that is drying up rivers, ruining crops and sparking wildfires.

The surface area of the Buendia dam reservoir shrunk by 60 percent over the last five years, says Resource Watch,

Levels that low were last seen in 2006, when the country was going through its worst drought in 60 years.

Experts warn that droughts will likely become more frequent and severe in this region, and water stress is projected to increase in many parts of Spain by 2040.","Morocco, India, Iraq, Spain could be next for Day Zero water crisis",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5626133/Could-Morocco-India-Iraq-Spain-face-Day-Zero-water-crisis.html
9,iraq,"Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center

An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its wounded and injured warriors and their families.

Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured Brooke Army Medical Center’s Warrior and Family Support Center.

The Warrior and Family Support Center provides coordinated services to patients, next of kin and extended family members.

As Umm Qusay walked through the center, she expressed her admiration for its recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.

“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.

‘I See Great Courage Here’

“I see such great courage here helping injured soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”

Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62 year old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at age 13.

In 2014, great tragedy struck her family, at the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorists.

“ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” Umm Qusay said. “They killed children, older people, women.”

On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.

Taking Action to Rescue Others

Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with identification cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shiites how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to ISIS operatives.

“Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shiite,” according to her biography.

For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.

“It was difficult,” Umm Qusay said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”

Caring for Wounded Iraqi Service Members

Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.

When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.

“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”

For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept.

“When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage,” she said.

“We are all created by God,” Umm Qusay said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1489254/famed-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-army-medical-center/

Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq.

In a 20-minute slot on the Today programme, the former Labour leader said that although military intervention was difficult, not intervening also had consequences – as Syria proved.

He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’.

Mr Blair said Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’

He also said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed.

He said: ‘They [Assad’s troops] are winning but they are winning because their outside backers are prepared to intervene and to commit and, frankly, we have not been able to.’

Mr Blair, who was the Middle East peace envoy until 2015, said that this was because of the ‘difficulties of intervention’.

He said: ‘I know that it’s extremely difficult but the problem is non-intervention is also a policy with consequences. Iraq shows you that intervening is extremely difficult but non-intervention – as we see from Syria – is also extremely difficult.

‘The problem in the Middle East is that you do have actors that are prepared to intervene and if you look at the commitment that Russia and Iran have made in Syria it is enormous.’

He added: ‘I’m simply saying that where you intervene, as we’ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s extremely difficult but where you don’t intervene, as we’ve seen in Syria, it’s also difficult.

Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’ He said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed

‘It is important to realise that if we allow it to go unchecked and unanswered then obviously the Assad regime and backers will be emboldened to act.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Blair was using Syria to justify his failed intervention in Iraq.

Referring to the Blair government’s alleged attempts to ‘spin’ intelligence reports to overstate the case for war in Iraq, he said: ‘I think he is attempting to rewrite history and thinks the British people don’t remember the dodgy dossier that got us into the situation in the first place.

‘It is a bit much for him trying to get us into another war justified by his illegal intervention in the Iraq War.

‘He was the Middle East peace envoy for a long time and that wasn’t successful because during that time [the region] was the most volatile that it has ever been.’",Tony Blair accused of using crisis in Syria to Iraq war,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5601475/Tony-Blair-accused-using-crisis-Syria-justify-invasion-Iraq.html

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The overall trend continues to be increased rates of internally displaced populations (IDP) returning to places of origin. Between January and March 2018 IDP numbers have decreased by around 342,500 people, from 2.6 million to 2.27 million, while the returnee population has increased by around 352,700 people, from 3.22 million to 3.57 million. Despite this, complex patterns of movement have still occurred between IDP camps and places of return. Across the country, more than 630,000 IDPs remain in camps and nearly 265,000 in critical shelter arrangements such as informal settlements or unfinished buildings. Between January and March, 5,597 newly-arrived IDP families (approximately 33,500 individuals, including around 15,700 children) were recorded entering IDP sites in Ninewa. The main reasons given by these families for their arrival to camps were firstly, financial or economic – for example, families had no access to livelihood opportunities, no money to pay rent or purchase food – and secondly, destroyed or damaged houses. In addition, military operations undertaken by the Government of Turkey in northern Iraq, including the Sinjar area, halted the return trend for the mainly Yezidi population in that area, who either left homes in the area or remained in neighbouring districts. While humanitarian partners estimate return of an additional two million people by the end of 2018, patterns in the first quarter indicate a continued need for shelter in camps, with potential for more people to choose to return to camps in cases where jobs are not available in their places of origin, or where the progress of local reconstruction is insufficient. These factors indicate that continued investment will be required in coming months to ensure adequate basic services and facilities to populations in camps, as well as continued integration across humanitarian and recovery planning and response.

In March the Government of Iraq (GoI) lifted the embargo on international flights to KRI airports after the two sides reached an agreement to restore federal authority in all international entry points in the Region, including land crossings and airports. This was followed by removal of the ban on telephone calls to/from KRI landlines and phased initiation of delivery of salaries to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) public sector employees. Non- or partial-payment of civil servant salaries, including government health, education, and social services staff over the past two years has impacted availability of public services for children. Relations between the two sides had been at their lowest in the preceding six months following the KRG’s September 2017 independence referendum.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018

Maggie Martin is a former Army sergeant who served three tours in Kuwait and Iraq and is now co-director of About Face: Veterans Against the War. In light of Donald Trump’s escalation in Syria and the nomination of Mike Pompeo to Secretary of State, In These Times spoke to Martin about her work.

How did you end up opposing the war?

It started with my first deployment to Kuwait in 2002 and just seeing the racism of my fellow soldiers, the way they were talking about the Bedouins who were living in the desert. During the Iraq invasion, I was charged with guarding local Iraqi citizens doing odd jobs for us. We talked all day, and I got to know them and felt closer to them than the people I was serving with. It wasn’t until later I learned there had been antiwar movement while I was part of the invasion.

Why should we oppose continued U.S. involvement in the Middle East?

Evidence is clear that U.S. military intervention doesn’t help the populations where it occurs, and I think the hypocrisy is pretty clear in the way the Trump administration wants to ban refugees from these countries yet uses humanitarian need as an excuse to use military force.

What are your hopes for a mass movement?

We can’t count on the Democratic Party, so we’re going to have to find a way to shake up the current power structure. Our organization is building beyond the traditional antiwar movement of the 1960s. Those folks are important, but we’re really trying to connect across movements and talk about how militarism is impacting all of us. All of the direct impacts abroad, what we’re seeing with the militarization of our police and our schools, on the borders. We’re part of the Poor People’s Campaign, the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, we’re involved in The Majority, a coalition anchored in Black Lives Matter and the Movement for Black Lives. I think joining with those folks is the way to make militarism an issue that’s on the public agenda.",Why This Iraq War Vet Is Speaking Out Against Trump’s Reckless Foreign Policy,http://inthesetimes.com/article/21116/iraq-war-veteran-speak-out-donald-trump-foreign-policy
14,iraq,"The most influential organisation representing British Jews could soon have its first leader from a Mizrahi – or Arab – background.

Edwin Shuker, one of four candidates campaigning to be the next president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was born in Baghdad before fleeing persecution and arriving in Britain as a refugee.

Shuker, whose first language is Arabic, says the board, which has played a crucial role in recent controversies about antisemitism in Britain, must be more diverse and inclusive, and is in urgent need of a change of culture to pay more attention to grassroots concerns within the community. “I want to be a voice for the community, and the authority of that voice comes from carrying all parts of the community, their concerns and aspirations, with you,” he told the Observer.

Shuker was born into a dwindling Jewish community in Iraq in 1955. Amid rising tensions in 1971 he escaped with his parents, grandmother and two sisters through the Kurdish mountains into Iran before coming to the UK as a United Nations refugee. He later lived in Israel for six years.

He said his bond with the Middle East was “total and continuing”: “My identity is as a Jew from Arabia, and an Arabic and Hebrew speaker.”

Acknowledging that his background could be a challenge in next Sunday’s election, he said: “It would be a huge cultural step for British Jewry to accept an oriental with a foreign accent to be their president. But I hope we are mature enough for that.”

Shuker praised the actions of Jonathan Arkush, the BoD’s current president, who has joined forces with the Jewish Leadership Council to forcefully tackle Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the Labour party.

“When Jews stand together, we are a powerful force, and that has been demonstrated in recent weeks. But I don’t want our brilliant, creative, vibrant community to be defined by antisemitism or by our enemies.”

There were issues of great importance at grassroots level in the community, such as the inclusion of women and the challenges of an ageing community, he said.

“We need to use the example of the antisemitism campaign to demonstrate how much clearer our voice is when we leave our differences behind. There are people who feel their voice is not heard and their presence is irrelevant. I want to change that culture.”

The BoD leadership was “top down, and I want to make it bottom up,” he said. “We need to listen and unite, and not only when the community is facing an outside danger, but also on issues that are just as important to the welfare of British Jews but aren’t getting as much attention.”

The current campaign against antisemitism in the Labour party was of critical importance, “but I don’t think it can be sustained with such intensity in the long term. We need to look beyond the next headline to other methods of combating antisemitism, such as education in schools.

“We need to build alliances with as wide a range of British society as possible – political parties, Christian, Muslim and other faith communities – against every form of racism. Let’s use this crisis as an opportunity to root out any attack on religion, gender and so on.”

He said criticism of the actions of the Israeli government was legitimate, but that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement “crosses a red line” into antisemitism because it sought to delegitimise the state of Israel itself.

There were individuals within the UK Jewish community who took issue with Israeli government policies and actions, he said. But it was the job of the BoD president to represent the whole community, and it would be inappropriate for the leadership to publicly criticise Israel. There are four candidates in the BoD election.",Iraq-born refugee could become first Arabic speaker to head Britain’s Jews,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/05/iraqi-refugee-edwin-shuker-british-jews-first-leader-arab-origin

The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at former US President George W Bush is running for parliament.

Muntader al-Zaidi is standing in next week's elections as a candidate for a list founded by the influential Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr.

Mr Zaidi said he wanted to fight the corruption that plagues Iraq.

His protest during a visit by Mr Bush to Baghdad in 2008 made him a hero for many Iraqis. But he was convicted of assaulting a foreign leader.

He served nine months of a 12-month prison sentence. After his release, he alleged that he had been tortured by Iraqi officials and guards, and that he needed treatment for broken teeth, bone fractures and other injuries.

Mr Zaidi was working for al-Baghdadiya TV when he attended a news conference between President Bush and then Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

As the two leaders spoke, he stood up and threw both his shoes at Mr Bush to show his anger at what he considered the injustice of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the violence that followed it.

He shouted: ""This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog. This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Arabs protested against the detention of Mr Zaidi after the shoe-throwing incident

Mr Bush managed to dodge the shoes and in an interview afterwards he insisted he did not harbour any ill feeling. ""It was amusing - I've seen a lot of weird things during my presidency, and this may rank up there as one of the weirdest,"" he said.

After his release from prison, Mr Zaidi quit journalism and moved to Europe, where he set up a humanitarian organisation to help Iraqi war victims.

Mr Zaidi vowed that if he was elected to the Iraqi parliament on 12 May he would ""sweep away the thieves and corrupt people, prosecute those who steal Iraqi money, and stop public money being wasted"".

He is a candidate on the Saeroun (Marching Towards Reform) list, which is an alliance between Moqtada Sadr's Istiqama (Integrity) party and six mostly secular groups, including the Iraqi communist party.

The list is one of 88 contesting the polls and is seen as a challenger to the Victory and Reform list of Shia Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi; State of Law, led by Mr Maliki, who is also Shia; al-Fatah (Conquest), which comprises the political wings of militias in the Shia-led paramilitary Popular Mobilisation force; and Iraqi Solidarity, founded by Sunni Vice-President Osama al-Nujaifi.

Some 24 million people are eligible to vote in the polls. The 328 seats in parliament will be allocated according to a proportional representation system, although 46 seats are reserved for Kurds and at least a quarter of the seats for women.

These are the first elections to be held since the Iraqi government declared victory over the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) last December.",Muntader al-Zaidi: Iraq shoe-thrower standing for parliament,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43977972

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Iraq remained extremely volatile throughout 2017 as the Government’s military operations shifted and political and inter-group tensions rose. National and international efforts to help people who were affected by recurrent conflicts constituted one of the largest and most complex humanitarian operations in the world.

Since 2014, almost 6 million people have been displaced by virtually non-stop conflicts across the country’s 18 governorates. In 2017 alone, 1.7 million civilians fled their homes due to a series of intense military offensives against ISIL in Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk and Anbar governorates, as well as hostilities in the disputed territories following the September referendum led by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Across the country, an estimated 11 million people required some form of humanitarian aid in 2017.

Successive, concurrent displacement cycles call for agile and flexible humanitarian assistance

Although the crisis affected the whole of Iraqi society, internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps, returnees and resident communities who were unable to access social protection services, and survivors of abuse and violence were particularly vulnerable and required critical life-saving and protection assistance.

As frontlines of military operations shifted, triggering new surges in displacement while returns continued to stabilized areas, the priority needs of these groups diversified. Displaced people required rapid and concerted response support while returnees faced dire conditions in their places of origin with grave risks of explosive hazards and a lack of basic services. Protection remained a priority throughout the year with social, ethnic and political tensions, particularly in disputed areas, putting millions at risk. Underlying all humanitarian response efforts, social cohesion and reconciliation assistance are needed to enable safe and dignified returns and co-existence after years of conflict.

2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP)

The 2017 HRP aimed to reach 6.2 million highly vulnerable people affected by the crisis in Iraq with emergency assistance and protection support sequenced across first-line, second-line and full cluster responses. Humanitarian partners committed to four Strategic Objectives: 1) reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq; 2) facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe and dignified returns; 3) help people brutalized by violence cope and recover from trauma; and 4) give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity.

The HRP received generous donor contributions of $907 million, which covered 92 per cent of the total funding requirements. The funding supported 158 humanitarian partners – including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, and RC/RC organizations – who together reached 8 million people with life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, surpassing the original target. The progress of the HRP was tracked by clusters and compiled by OCHA into monthly Humanitarian Dashboards and a dynamic online HRP monitoring dashboard.

Security and access constraints

Operating amid unpredictable security situations involving multiple security forces and other armed groups, humanitarian partners in Iraq faced frequent security threats and access constraints throughout 2017. Through civil-military-coordination and access negotiation efforts, humanitarians liaised with Iraqi security forces to ensure that protection of civilians was prioritized in military operations. Standardized procedures were established to facilitate needs assessments and deliver direct assistance across numerous checkpoints in a safe, timely and predictable manner to the extent possible.",Iraq Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Jordan is willing and fully prepared to contribute to Iraq’s reconstruction process, Prime Minister Hani Mulki told visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Jaafari on Sunday.

At their meeting, the premier said that Jordan “in light of its proximity to Iraq and vast experiences in various fields can carry out the necessary consultations with Iraqis and other Arab stakeholders to contribute effectively in the rebuilding process”, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.

Mulki said that after its victory over terrorists, a fight that Jordan has “staunchly supported”, Iraq has regained its regional role and is back on its feet to boost its economy.

Jaafari, who was accompanied by an official delegation, thanked Jordan for backing his country while at war with terror groups and facilitating the life of Iraqis living in the Kingdom, including allowing these expats to cast their votes in Iraq’s parliamentary elections that will take place later this month.

He said Jordanian businesses are welcome to invest in Iraq when security and stability are fully restored to the war-torn country.

Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed Mulki’s remarks at a separate meeting with his Iraqi counterpart.

He said Jordan would put all its capabilities at the disposal of its eastern neighbour as it launches the reconstruction process.

He stressed that Jordan realises the importance of Iraq restoring its role as a “cornerstone” of the region’s stability and in serving the common causes of the Arab and Muslim nations.

He congratulated Jaafari on his country’s victory against the Daesh terror group, stressing that it was a victory of all humanity over the “darkness and delusion” of the terrorists that was achieved by the sacrifices of Iraqis.

The two ministers stressed the keenness of Jordan and Iraq to take all possible measures to boost cooperation in all fields, Petra said.

They highlighted the progress made to implement agreements signed previously to enhance trade exchange and investments, highlighting the reopening of Turaibil border crossing after a three-year closure blamed on the security situation.

The two diplomats also looked into developments in a number of regional issues including the Palestinian cause, the Syrian crisis and the war against terrorism.

On the Palestinian issue, Safadi and Jaafari agreed that the two-state solution is the only way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and is key to security and stability in the Middle East.

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian crisis with a political solution.

Jaafari expressed Iraq’s appreciation for the Jordanian support in fighting terrorism and welcomed Jordan’s prospective role in reconstructing his country, which has been estimated at $200 billion.

The two officials later held a press conference in which they reiterated the two countries’’ willingness to enhance their ties at all levels.

Safadi told reporters that it is a “matter of time” before the two countries restore the level of cooperation they used to have in the past.
