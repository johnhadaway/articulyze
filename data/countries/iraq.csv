War monuments are vexing. The forever war that began on 9/11 has caused enough bloodshed to inspire an entirely new generation of memorials. Some have already been built or authorized, even though the fighting is not close to ending. We don’t need more war monuments, however. We need counter-monuments. The dead we need to memorialize are not our dead.

This comes to mind on a strange war anniversary, 15 years to the day after the statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled by Marines in Baghdad. On that day, one monument was destroyed and another was created. The new monument was a product of iconoclasm, the act of destroying the old one. Broadcast live across the world, the toppling of the statue in Firdos Square was anointed in the American media and by the American government as a virtual monument to the liberation of Iraq and the success of the invasion.

I was at Firdos Square that day because, as my war luck would have it, I had been following the battalion of Marines that tore down the statue. Cut off from cable news at the time, I was startled when I later learned the toppling was considered a major event. Just two days earlier, I had watched these same Marines conduct a military operation that was more representative of what the invasion consisted of and what the future would bring: the harming of civilians. The picture below shows what I was thinking of as the statue came down – a blue van in which three Iraqi civilians had been machine-gunned to death by these same Marines, who feared the van was carrying soldiers or suicide bombers.

For the most part, we make monuments to our soldiers, and the good things we want them to represent, not to what foreign civilians suffer as a consequence of their actions. Consider the great American war memorials, the statues of generals and GIs that are everywhere. Also consider the ongoing controversies over Confederate statues (a subset of the whole), which show how much war memorials can mean, and how wrong and damaging they can be. Our war memorials tend to celebrate in bronze and iron the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women who fight our wars. The most controversial and certainly the best American war monument, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, does not show any individuals but lists, on a black wall, the names of more than 58,000 soldiers who died there. It is somber yet counts only U.S. deaths.

It doesn’t take anything away from soldiers’ work — as a war correspondent in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Somalia, and elsewhere, I have seen lots of soldiers live, fight, and die — to note that in today’s wars, the greatest suffering and the greatest injustices are visited upon civilians, who are also responsible for some of the most amazing heroism. In the past century, the pendulum has swung from soldiers being the main casualties (think of the slaughter of trench warfare in World War I) to large proportions of civilians perishing in Korea, Vietnam, El Salvador, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, to name a few.

The statue toppling in Baghdad is a cautionary tale about our monumental focus on just the noble things we believe our soldiers have done.

The toppling riveted a global audience and had particular resonance in the United States, where pretty much every newspaper featured a front-page picture of the scene the next day. Lots of them showed the moment in which a Marine placed an American flag on the face of the Saddam statue. Donald Rumsfeld, the U.S. defense secretary at the time, said a few minutes after the statue came down, “The scenes of free Iraqis celebrating in the streets, riding American tanks, tearing down the statues of Saddam Hussein in the center of Baghdad, are breathtaking. Watching them, one cannot help but think of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Iron Curtain.”

We know how this story played out. President George W. Bush donned a flight suit, landed on an aircraft carrier in a Navy jet, and made his famous “Mission Accomplished” speech, telling the world that “in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.” Everyone saw the statue come down, Saddam was in hiding (he would soon be found and hanged), Ahmed Chalabi was going to help create a new government — what else was needed? But the liberation of Iraq was a mirage. The invasion turned into an occupation, which triggered an uprising against American control, which included a civil war among Iraq’s Sunni and Shia, which led to a takeover of a swathe of the country by the Islamic State – and who knows what’s next. At least several hundred thousand Iraqis have died in the ongoing tragedy, though the figure could be far higher, and millions have been forced from their homes. About 4,500 American soldiers have died in Iraq.

You didn’t have to wait a few months or a few years to know the falsity of the anti-monument created in Firdos Square on April 9, 2003. It was abundantly clear, in the square, that the toppling was a sideshow. Just a handful of Iraqis were there, and the broadcast images of the small crowd didn’t show that about a quarter to a half of them were journalists. I later wrote an investigative story about the toppling for the New Yorker and ProPublica, and noted that much of the TV-friendly activity that day was caused and shaped by the media – beginning with the sledgehammering of the statue at the outset of the spectacle:

At key moments throughout the toppling, the level of Iraqi enthusiasm appeared to ebb and flow according to the number and interest of photographers who had gathered. For instance, when [the] sledgehammer made its first appearance, photographers clustered around as one Iraqi after another took a few shots at the base. Not long afterward, many photographers and cameramen drifted off; they had got their pictures. The sledgehammering of the statue soon ceased, too.

The Iraqis tried to pull down the statue with a rope, but that didn’t work; the statue was too heavy. The Marine commander on the scene, Col. Bryan McCoy, gave the order for his unit’s tank-recovery vehicle to finish the job (it had a powerful crane and a thick wire to take care of matters). I had gotten to know McCoy during the invasion, and later I interviewed him about the toppling. He mentioned the “buzzkill” of not doing anything. “Put your virtual-reality goggles on,” he said. “What would that moment have been if we hadn’t? It would have been some b-reel of Iraqis banging away at this thing and eventually losing interest and going home. There was a momentum, there was a feeling, this atmosphere of liberation. … That was the attitude — keep the momentum going.”

What was particularly crazy about this mutant monument: Its significance was determined to a great extent by producers and editors who were thousands of miles away watching their televisions. I didn’t take notes while the statue was going down – it was a small thing in a city coming apart. Gary Knight, a photographer for Newsweek who was also in the square (and who shot the photograph below), didn’t bother to take pictures of the statue until talking on his satellite phone with his editor, who was watching the scene on his TV in America and ordered Knight to start shooting.

The editors and producers who made a monument out of the actions of the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Marine Regiment – McCoy’s battalion – did not choose the wrong battalion, just the wrong moment in the battalion’s eventful invasion.

Two days earlier, the battalion had mistakenly gunned down about a dozen civilians as they drove down a highway that was one of the few escape routes out of Baghdad, which was being bombed by U.S. forces. These Marines, who had just crossed the Diyala Canal into the capital’s outskirts, were advancing up that road and shot every car that came toward them. I wrote about these deaths for the New York Times Magazine in 2003, and I’ve just written a long thread about it on Twitter, describing how I walked along the kill box afterward and counted six vehicles that had been destroyed. The corpses were still inside. The blue van, a Kia, had more than 20 bullet holes in its windshield (see the photo above). Two bodies were slumped in the front seats. In the back, a woman in a black chador had fallen to the floor, dead. There were no weapons, no ammunition — these people were just trying to escape U.S. bombs.

As I watched the statue come down, I was also thinking of an old man whose corpse was face-up along the road near the Diyala Canal, next to his walking cane. He lay not far from the blue van, with its tires shot out and its windows shattered by bullets, its interior stained with blood and smelling of death, with flies feasting on already-rotting flesh. That van was the monument the invasion deserved, the visual that should have been broadcast across the world, and that the secretary of defense should have felt obliged to speak about.

I know, it is a ridiculous proposition. The problem with my idea is that we don’t care very much about foreigners who die in our wars, just our own soldierly kin (as is the case for most countries). The 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero belongs in a separate category, because it does focus on the deaths of civilians, but only those killed on American soil. (Our memorials to the Holocaust are in yet another category, honoring the exterminated victims of Nazi Germany.) Viet Thanh Nguyen, in “Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War,” a book that is a necessary corrective to our way of thinking about our wars, quotes photojournalist Philip Jones Griffiths as observing that the Vietnam War memorial would have to be nine miles long if it were to include the names of the millions of Vietnamese who died in that conflict. As it stands, counting only U.S. casualties, the wall is about 150 yards long.

We should do better, though the odds are that with President Donald Trump signing a bill authorizing the creation of a Global War on Terrorism Memorial, we will not rise to the occasion. It likely wouldn’t be popular, but the monument the war on terror deserves is the bullet-riddled blue van. Put it on a pedestal on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. If we start building monuments that focus our attention on the pitiless killing of civilians in our wars, maybe we would have fewer wars to fight and less reason to build these monuments.","A Radical Lesson from the Invasion of Iraq: Our War Monuments Should Honor the Sacrifice of Civilians, Not Soldiers",https://theintercept.com/2018/04/09/a-radical-lesson-from-the-invasion-of-iraq-our-war-monuments-should-honor-the-sacrifice-of-civilians-not-soldiers/
1,iraq,"Thousands of displaced Yazidis in the Sinjar mountains in Northern Iraq are still suffering and afraid, almost four years after Islamic State attacked Yazidi villages.

""The situation of the Yazidis in Iraq is of great concern. It is an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe with still close to 400,000 internally displaced scattered throughout the provinces of northern Iraq,"" Lisa Miara, founder of Springs of Hope Foundation, told VOA.

Miara said three-and-a-half years after the Yazidi genocide, some villages are still unreachable and no major effort has been made to enable thousands of Yazidis to restore their lives and businesses.

Yazidis, an ethno-religious minority group of about 550,000 people, mostly reside in northern Iraq, in an area also populated by Kurds and Arabs.

In August 2014, the Islamic State attacked the Yazidi-populated Sinjar mountain, killing thousands of men and taking thousands of women and girls as sex slaves. Yazidis consider the attack one of 74 genocides in their history.

The massacre against Yazidis was one of the reasons the U.S.-led military operation, under the authority of President Barack Obama, targeted Islamic State in Iraq in August 2014, the first offensive action by the U.S. in Iraq since it withdrew ground troops in 2011.

""Targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death,"" Obama said at the time.

Humanitarian aid

Given the large-scale humanitarian demand among displaced Yazidis, a number of local and global organizations are pleading to remain focused on the plight of the Yazidis.

Saad Babir, communication manager at Yazda Organization, told VOA that basic needs such as electricity, water and education are lacking. In addition, more than 70 percent of houses have been destroyed, and many religious temples targeted by IS are in rubble.

Thousands of Yazidi women kidnapped by IS are still missing. After the defeat of IS in Iraq and Syria, Yazidis feel they have been marginalized and efforts to find the girls — missing since 2014 — have receded.

""More than 3,000 women, men and children are still missing. Once IS was gone, no more attention is paid for the victims, no post-IS rehabilitation for the victims, and not just for Yazidis but everyone affected by ISIS,"" said Babir, using an acronym for the group.

Reconciliation

Babir said the atrocities committed by IS have created mistrust in the region between minorities and their communities in general.

USAID and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) are working jointly on the recovery of minority groups.

""One thing we are doing is working to help restore some of the cultural diversity that has been a hallmark in Iraq,"" USAID's Mark Green, the United States' top foreign aid official, said at United States Institute of Peace last week.

""In northern Iraq, we have been helping Yazidis and Christian minorities to be able to return home, to feel secure enough to be able to re-establish their communities,"" Green said.",Yazidis Still Suffering Years After IS Genocide,https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidis-suffering-years-after-islamic-state-genocide/4339854.html

Brooke Army Medical Center Public Affairs



JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its warriors and their families.



Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured the Warrior and Family Support Center as part of a visit to San Antonio. As she walked through the center, which offers coordinated services to military families recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center, she expressed her admiration for the recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.



“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.



“I see such great courage here helping injured Soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”



Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62-year-old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at the age of 13.



In 2014, tragedy struck. “ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” she said. “They killed children, older people, women.”



On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.



Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with ID cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shi’a how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to the ISIS. “Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shi’a,” her bio said.



For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the IWOC award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.



“It was difficult,” she said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”



Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.



When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.



“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”



For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept. “When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage.”



“We are all created by God,” she said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",A portrait of courage: Iraqi humanitarian visits warrior care center,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/272334/portrait-courage-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-warrior-care-center

4,iraq,"ERBIL (Kurdistan 24) – The Federal Supreme Court of Iraq on Monday announced they are beginning deliberations on a possible lawsuit to challenge the Kurdistan Region’s independent oil exports abroad, initiated by the Kurdish government of the semi-autonomous region in 2014.

In its statement, the court mentioned it had decided to “include the Iraqi Prime Minister [Haider al-Abadi], Iraqi Finance Minister [Salman Jumaili], Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region [Nechirvan Barzani], in addition to their functions, as third persons in the lawsuit due to constitutional, political, and financial aspects.”

The statement adds that the Supreme Court held a session on Monday, chaired by Judge Medhat al-Mahmoud. The lawsuit, initiated by the Iraqi Oil Minister, Jabbar al-Luaibi, against the Kurdistan Region’s Natural Resources Minister, Ashti Hawrami, was reviewed.

The court added that parties mentioned in the lawsuit had also participated in a hearing, where the Iraqi Oil Ministry asked for the export of oil by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to cease, and for amounts sold in the past to be repaid to the Iraqi federal government.

“To provide sufficient time for all parties to present their case, we have deferred the appeal to 6/5/2018,” the court explained.

The KRG began to independently export its oil to international markets through Turkey’s Ceyhan port in 2014 after the Federal Government of Iraq cut the national budget share of the Kurdistan Region at the start of the same year.

The export of oil sparked tensions between Erbil and Baghdad. Oil revenue distribution has been one of the most pressing issues between the two governments.

The Kurdish semi-autonomous region currently exports 328,000 barrels per day of oil to Turkey, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources’ report, released earlier this month.

5,iraq,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - From his 13th-floor balcony in central Baghdad, Salam Atta Sabri likes to reminisce about his city’s storied past – the years before Saddam Hussein and the U.S.-led invasion which forever changed it.

FILE PHOTO: A U.S. soldier watches as a statue of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein falls in central Baghdad, Iraq April 9, 2003. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File Photo

On an overcast afternoon in spring, the 55-year-old artist pointed to stalwarts of Baghdad’s historic center such as the 13th century palace of the Abbasid caliphs, and the city’s ambling, literary heart around Mutanabbi Street.

Over coffee, he leafed through recent ink drawings of the city. “I remember walking those very streets when I was a boy… before everything changed.”

Raised in Baghdad by a renowned artist father, Sabri left Iraq in the 1990s, when crippling economic sanctions made life unbearable, he said.

“Even when I lived in Los Angeles or Amman, my dream to return to Baghdad was always with me,” he said. “In my dream, there would be a new reality on the ground, a new freedom… that’s why I chose to return.”

But when Sabri came back in 2005 - two years after the U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam and left a fractured country – Baghdad was a city under siege.

One of the ripple effects of the 2003 invasion was sectarian warfare, which irreparably changed Baghdad and its historically pluralistic society.

Kidnappings, killings and forced displacements of civilians by Sunni insurgents and Shi’ite militias were commonplace. Religious minorities were threatened enough to leave en masse, either for the north or overseas.

“But through it all she has always remained Baghdad mon amour, Baghdad my love,” Sabri said.

CONCRETE SLABS

Sabri’s reverence for Baghdad and its past as a center for art and learning, is echoed by many, both young and old – those who remember a pre-2003 Iraq and those who don’t.

But the city is now a shell of what it once was. Security checkpoints obstruct once open streets and its famed hybrid architecture which married traditional brick homes with the modernist buildings by Le Corbusier and Rifat Chadirji, has been subsumed by concrete blast walls.

Power outages are commonplace and heavy-duty generators spew dark fumes, adding to some of the worst pollution in a smog-heavy region. Raw untreated sewage is still dumped into the Tigris and there are few accessible riverbanks and open spaces for children to play.

CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC

This decade-long decline in quality of life has given rise to nostalgia for pre-1980 Iraq – the year the country was plunged into its first of several wars.

But this is a dangerous airbrushing of Iraq’s authoritarian past, said Hadi al Najjar, the president of the Society of Iraqi Photographers.

“Before 2003, we couldn’t have an open conversation in a cafe in Baghdad without worrying about someone informing on us, or us informing on each other…. At least now, we no longer need to censor ourselves.”

And while those like Sabri seek solace in memories, other Baghdad residents are looking forward with growing hope.

They say the situation in the capital has improved recently as the rate of security incidents has slowed and a strict curfew was lifted in 2015, allowing restaurants to flourish in well to-do districts like Mansour.

“Since 2003, we’ve just been trying to survive,” said Mustafa Younes, a 27-year-old pharmacy worker, who said he’d lost two brothers during bombings in Baghdad in the last decade.

“But now, for the first time, we are starting to think about the future.”","As Baghdad life improves, some still seek refuge in its past",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-anniversary/as-baghdad-life-improves-some-still-seek-refuge-in-its-past-idUSKBN1HG0YP

Mosul (IraqiNews.com) Iraq security forces found a new mass grave of tens of employees massacred by Islamic State militants, a security source was quoted saying on Monday.

BasNews quoted Cap. Adnan Marwan, from Nineveh province police, saying that security forces found the mass grave near al-Sham gate, an entrance to the western region of Mosul.

He said the remains were of more than 40 people, mostly security personnel and former clerks at the country’s elections commission. They were handed to forensic experts to identify them and their relatives.

As Iraqi troops recaptured areas held by Islamic State militants since 2014, they have regularly run into mass graves of civilians and security agents executed by militants for fleeing the group’s havens or collaborating with security forces.

Iraq’s war against the Islamic State displaced millions of civilians both inside and outside the country, and left thousands dead, according to government and United Nations figures.

Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State last December, ending a three-year war to bring down the group’s self-styled “caliphate” declared from Nineveh’s Mosul in 2014. Security continues to comb recaptured areas for remnant cells as a number of attacks against civilians and security grew fears of their resurgence.

UNICEF and partners also delivered Multi-Sector Emergency Packages (MSEP) to 8,782 individuals in need in retaken areas, including 4,782 children, in Ka’im district, western Anbar, ensuring provision of essential items.

• UNICEF ensured continued water trucking to 14 neighbourhoods in West Mosul, ensuring safe water for 54,150 individuals (115,213 children). In coordination with the Directorate of Water (DoW) Ninewa and other partners, UNICEF continued to fix the water network, intending to eventually eliminate water trucking.

• Since the start of 2018, UNICEF partners provided psychosocial services (PSS) to 19,262 newly-registered IDP children (9,299 girls), specialized child protection services reached 2,424 IDP children (1,170 girls).

• In February, the UN launched a two-year Recovery and Resilience Programme (RRP) at the International Conference for Reconstruction of Iraq. The RRP complements the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), and builds on existing efforts to ensure tangible improvements at the start of the reconstruction process. UNICEF’s complementary 2018 Recovery and Resilience for Children (RRC) appeal asks for US$58.9 million to support the early recovery needs of children in Iraq.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

With the end of military offensives against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, security in many areas of the country is improving, although pockets of insecurity remain. A total of 3.5 million people have returned home, mainly to areas in Anbar, Ninewa, and Salah al-Din, but more than 2.3 million remain displaced, including over 1 million children. Since the start of the year, more than 200,000 new returnees have been recorded, as efforts to clear explosive hazards and restore basic services continue. However, the return process remains complex due to lack of information, poor conditions in camps, and restrictions on freedom of movement combined with significant levels of infrastructure damage in towns and villages. Return movements are potentially unsustainable, with reports that between mid-January and the end of February, 23,208 displaced people were recorded as arrivals to camps in Ninewa governorate. Most of these are ‘secondary displacements’, where families had left camps to return to places of origin, only to then later decide to return to camps.

Primary reasons given for return to camps are financial or economic, or because homes have been destroyed or damaged and remain unfit for habitation. These ‘reverse movements’ have caused planning and resource prioritisation challenges for partners, both for service delivery and as part of the camp consolidation process. Humanitarian partners expect that those who cannot or choose not to return to places of origin will remain in IDP camps where they will need continued education, health, water, sanitation, and child protection services until at least the middle of 2018.

Discussions continue between the Government of Iraq (GoI) and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and the two sides appeared closer to reaching agreement on outstanding issues. However, in February, airports in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) remained limited to domestic flights only, road access between the KRI and neighbouring federal governorates such as Kirkuk and Ninewa was restricted, and KRG public sector employee salaries continued to be un- or partially-paid.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, February 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-february-2018
8,iraq,"BAGHDAD — Turkish troops in northern Iraq have begun building military bases to confront the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), according to an April 3 report by Al-Hurra TV that included video footage of construction. This comes after Turkish troops reportedly advanced about 6 miles into Iraqi territory last month in order to fight the PKK in the northern regions of Iraq.

On March 29, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talked about eliminating the PKK fighters in the Iraqi city of Sinjar during a conference held by the Justice and Development Party in Ankara, despite the Turkish government’s earlier pledge to respect Iraqi sovereignty.

Erdogan also announced that Turkey “is gearing up to start cleansing Ain al-Arab [which the Kurds call Kobani], Tell Abyad, Ras al-Ain and Hasakah in Syria from terrorist elements and getting ready to enter Sinjar at any moment.”

Meanwhile, a high-level Iraqi delegation visited the Turkish capital to hold talks on the fight with the PKK, according to Jabbar al-Yawar the secretary-general of the peshmerga forces.

“The Iraqi delegation is trying to reach diplomatic solutions with the Turkish side to spare the region the scourge of military battles. The Sinjar crisis is the prerogative of the Baghdad-based central government that has sent the 15th Brigade there, fearing any interference on the part of the Turkish forces. We believe that the PKK problem must be dealt with comprehensively through Iraqi-Turkish coordination,” Yawar told Al-Monitor.

Yawar acknowledged the presence of PKK forces in the Qandil Mountains of the Kurdistan Region and some areas of Ninevah and Syrian Kurdistan.

“The peshmerga will not intervene in this crisis related to Iraqi sovereignty, especially after it withdrew from Sinjar following its liberation from the Islamic State,” he said.

Yawar ruled out any period of relative calm on the Iraqi-Syrian border before the end of the civil war in Syria. “Sinjar represents a triangle on the border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey. It is only normal for many armed factions to move in this area, taking advantage of the mountainous hinterlands,” he said.

Iraq’s concerns about Turkish threats are not limited to officials in the Kurdistan Region only. Turkmen member of parliament Jassem Mohammed Jaafar, a leader in the ruling Dawa Party in Iraq, said, “The Turkish threats are aimed at exerting pressure on the Iraqi side to speed up the process of exerting its control over Sinjar and to pressure Erbil to cut off support and contact with the PKK.”

Jaafar told Al-Monitor, “The Turkish forces have a lot to lose if they carry out a military operation in Mount Sinjar, giving the area’s rugged nature, located at hundreds of kilometers from the Turkish border. The Turkish forces will have to face the Iraqi security forces deployed there.”

He added, “Yet the Iraqi government is working on containing the crisis, and we believe the statements of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim about respecting Iraq's sovereignty [are genuine].""

Speaking at a press conference April 3, a member of parliament for Sinjar, Vian Dakhil, referenced a statement signed by a group of Iraqi lawmakers condemning Erdogan's threats to enter Sinjar. “We condemn and denounce the statements of the Turkish president threatening a military intervention in Sinjar. This violates all international laws and diplomatic norms,"" she noted.

Dakhil called on the Iraqi government to take all “necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq and the security of its borders and its citizens.” She urged the government not “to coordinate with the Turkish side, away from the legislative authority in relations to the sovereignty and security of Iraq and to work on expelling PKK elements so as to avoid Sinjar becoming an international battlefield for neighboring countries. [The government] has to discredit all justifications by neighboring countries seeking to interfere in Iraq's domestic affairs.”

Dakhil also said that Iraqi parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri had repeatedly rejected to include the Sinjar crisis on the parliament’s agenda, citing only government measures, referring to his bias toward Ankara.

Nevertheless, the situation in Sinjar appears to be different from what the Kurds are witnessing in Afrin and the rest of the Kurdish areas in Syria. This disparity is mainly due to the American presence in Iraq, Washington’s good relations with Baghdad and the large amount of trade between Iraq and Turkey. Ankara, however, is playing at brinkmanship in a bid to get rid of the PKK, especially since it has already started military operations on the ground in Syria.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said March 27 that the presence of the PKK in Iraq’s Sinjar is a threat to Turkey, and the United States is ""intending to see [the PKK] pull out of the Sinjar area.”

According to the US State Department, Tina Kaidanow, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, visited Turkey and Iraq March 28-April 3.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a press statement that the United States “understands the Turkish concerns about the PKK presence in the Kurdistan region and Iraq.”

Nauert stressed that any Turkish military operation in Sinjar must be with the approval of Iraq and in coordination with the Iraqi government.

As things stand now, there are two scenarios for Sinjar’s crisis. The first is the least likely: Turkey would launch a military operation in the Iraqi territories that might reach the Kurdish areas, namely Dahuk. However, this would affect bilateral relations in light of Baghdad’s rejection of the scenario and its likely economic repercussions. Ankara could instead opt for the second scenario: letting the Iraqi government eliminate the PKK. This means airstrikes and land operations in the Kurdistan Region, which is a big concern for the Iraqi Kurdish parties.","How will Sinjar crisis end as tensions mount between Baghdad, Ankara?",https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/sinjar-iraq-kurdistan-turkey-pkk.html
9,iraq,"A new traveling exhibit that opened Monday April 9 at University Medical Center provides a glimpse of what life is like in refugee camps around the world from the perspective of the people who live there and volunteers with Doctors Without Borders.

Using virtual reality documentaries, photographs, and testimonies from aid workers and patients, the exhibit called Forced from Home, explores the lives of some of the millions of people who have been displaced from their homes either due to armed conflict, political violence, natural or man-made disasters. In 2016 the U. N's refugee agency reported that the number of displaced people reached 65.3 million or one out of 113 people on the planet--the highest number since post-World War II.

The exhibit is self-contained in a mobile trailer and staffed with Doctors Without Borders volunteers from New Orleans, including Dr. Peter Reynaud a local physician and faculty member at the Tulane School of Medicine. Reynaud has completed seven assignments with the humanitarian aid organization over the past 15 years.

He was most recently in the Central African Republic and has also worked with Syrian refugees in northern Iraq as well as earthquake victims in Bangladesh.

""Every place has its own unique challenges but in all we are addressing the basic needs, access to clean water, nutrition, shelter and mental health care,"" Reynaud said pointing to a wall of photographs taken at camps from around the world.

The exhibit includes a virtual reality tour where visitors are able to see aspects of life in four different settlements across the world. In one a young mother from Honduras explains how she had to leave her home country and escape to Mexico after her husband was murdered by local gangs. The organization estimates that 190,000 people are estimated to be displaced in Honduras from violence in 2016, another 504 people were treated by the organization for sexual violence that year.

Another video shows Syrian children singing in their living space in the Domiz Refugee camp in northern Iraq. They are among an estimated 26,500 refugees living in the camp, having fled Syria after civil war broke out in 2011.

Forced from Home is a free exhibit and open to the public from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 9, 10 at the University Medical Center. It will move to Tulane University, McAlister Auditorium on April 11, 12 and be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It will then move to the Peace Quad at Loyola University on April 13 and open from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.",See the global refugee crisis through the eyes of medical aid workers and refugees,http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2018/04/see_the_global_refugee_crisis.html

And he is most definitely not Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama deserves far more credit for his own 'raid on Entebbe' Trump clashes with military in Syria pullout push By sending National Guard to border, Trump follows Bush, Obama MORE. Comparisons of today’s crisis in Syria with our decision to invade Iraq, or to precipitously pull out our troops, are fatally flawed and functionally irrelevant.

President Bush invaded Iraq and forcibly removed its government, with the peak of our deployment exceeding 160,000 troops four years later. Then, in 2011, President Obama, citing his administration’s failure to obtain a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government, withdrew our forces in an ideologically-driven decision that helped set the conditions for the rise of the Islamic State.

Neither of these historic facts apply to the challenge faced by President Trump Donald John Trump Airstrikes hit Syria air base: Syrian state media Trump, Macron agree on 'strong, joint response' to alleged Syria chemical attack Trump congratulates Patrick Reed on Masters win MORE, especially after the chemical attack in Douma this weekend, nor do they help us to map the consequences of taking the wrong strategic decision. This is because the geostrategic conditions in 2003 and 2011 are fundamentally different from those that pertain to Syria today.

Many of my conservative friends are concerned that President Trump is about to launch a new “neoconservative” crusade in Syria mirroring Bush’s in Iraq. That, I can assure you will never happen, for two simple reasons. First, Syria in 2018 is not Iraq in 2003. Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had few true friends after Sept. 11, 2001, and was hated as much by the Shia of Iran as by the Sunnis in terror groups such as Al Qaeda. He was alone.

Conversely, Syria’s Bashar Assad is a dictator who is friends with other dictatorial regimes and the client of geopolitical actors who want him to stay in power. This includes Iran, Russia and even China. For this reason alone, any invasion and scenario of regime-change in Damascus is off the table until these states lose interest in propping up Assad. At the moment Vladimir Putin, Beijing and the mullahs of Tehran have given no indication that they will desert him.

The second reason has less to do with current geopolitics and much more to do with the current commander-in-chief’s belief system and innate strategic sense. Having worked in his White House and observed his iconoclastic influence on the policymaking machine he inherited, I can attest to the fact that President Trump has no neoconservative reflexes when it comes to the utility and purpose of America’s armed forces. And I mean none.

In fact, this was apparent to me the very first day we met in the summer of 2015, long before he became president, when he asked me to assist in his preparations for the national security debate for GOP candidates that fall. During our first discussion in Trump Tower, it became instantly clear that for Donald Trump, invading other nations and occupying them is fundamentally un-American, born as our nation was in the rejection of imperialism and colonialism.

As his social media posts in the last 24 hours demonstrate, the president is aware and prepared to call out Assad and his supporters for their evil character. But that still does not mean he is George Bush or that this is 2003 and we have to prepare for another naive neocon misadventure. So what is the morally correct response President Trump should give which is, at the same time, strategically sound and true to an “America First” agenda which wants to have our troops more often at home than abroad?

Donald Trump is a patriotic American and a pragmatist at one and the same time. Right now he is incensed by what we have all seen happen in Syria and he has the intelligence at his disposal to know that Assad and his forces are the perpetrators. He will act. But not in any fashion that the beltway “elite” — who have failed us for more than 20 years — expect.

With Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisTrump aide on border security: ‘We’ve got a leaking boat’ Graham: National Guard troops not enough to secure U.S.-Mexico border White House meeting with emir of Qatar holds potential for deal, or two MORE at the Pentagon, Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump national security spokesman to depart White House Senate braces for showdown over Trump’s nominees North Korea ready to discuss denuclearization with US: report MORE still at the helm at the CIA, and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton starting work today as the new national security adviser, he has a team which can think beyond the false dichotomy of large-scale interventionism and unrealistic isolationism which has so pathetically defined the national security debate in Washington for too long.

The president will take action very soon. But like the preternaturally instinctual actor that he is, he will not telegraph his actions in advance, nor should he. Part of his response will be overt, declarative and utterly convincing for all the world to see. The rest of his response will be covert, unconventional and leave both Assad and his masters guessing as to what happens next. Those measures will target the dictator, his elite circle and his international friends in ways that may not involve tens of thousands of troops, but they will hurt. As they should.

In 2014, Russia broke an international taboo that had been in place since the allies rolled into Berlin in 1945, namely that nations must never use force to annex the territory of their neighbors. The Obama administration failed to respond in a fashion commensurate to the enormity of the Kremlin’s breach. Assad, and by association his sponsors, have shown the world that they believe chemical weapons may be used against unarmed civilians.

Heavy rain and flooding in camps

After experiencing a much drier winter compared to previous years, heavy rain and flooding during the second half of February affected approximately 33 camps and sites and more than 200,000 displaced people, primarily in northern and central governorates.

In Anbar governorate alone, this had an impact on 2,870 residents in 14 camps and 2,040 people were also affected in two camps in Salah al-Din governorate. Up to 300 millimeters of rain fell in some camp locations, damaging tents, spoiling food supplies and ruining many household items. In some instances, people left the camp to live with relatives while the water was subsiding. In most cases, affected families moved in with relatives inside the camp who had not been affected by the rain, which subsequently led to overcrowding in some camps. Clusters and partners were on the ground to assess the humanitarian needs of affected families. This resulted in the provision of quick assistance, particularly food, blankets, household items, tents, and winterization kits, by local communities, government authorities and humanitarian partners. Donors and authorities were closely involved in response activities and showed great flexibility to enable such a rapid response. Major drainage work was also undertaken to remove stagnant water and clean drinking water was trucked to affected camps. The likelihood of any disease outbreak was low as a result of the prompt drainage repair.","Iraq: Humanitarian Bulletin, February 2018 | Issued on 13 March [EN/AR/KU]",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-bulletin-february-2018-issued-13-march-enarku

Disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.” (Preamble of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities).

""Persons with disabilities include those who have long­term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others"" (Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities).

23 of May will mark the second anniversary of the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action that aims at lifting barriers persons with disabilities are facing in accessing relief, protection and recovery support and ensuring their participation in the development, planning and implementation of humanitarian programmes. Whilst more than 180 States, UN agencies, organisations operating in humanitarian settings and organisations of persons with disabilities have endorsed the charter, much still needs to be done to ensure the humanitarian response in Iraq is inclusive of persons with disabilities.

This brief presents and addresses some of the challenges that prevent internally displaced persons with disabilities and other vulnerable population groups (elderly, injured persons, pregnant women, etc.) in camp settings from accessing humanitarian services in Iraq and impede on the development of an inclusive humanitarian response. Concrete examples drawn from Handicap International’s experience working in Iraq with persons with disabilities and vulnerable population groups further illustrate those challenges. The recommendations to the humanitarian community provided in this brief aim at improving the protection of persons with disabilities and their inclusion in the humanitarian response.

14,iraq,"On April 10 2003, the first looters broke into the National Museum of Iraq. Staff had vacated two days earlier, ahead of the advance of US forces on Baghdad. The museum was effectively ransacked for the next 36 hours until employees returned.

Jamal Saidi

While the staff - showing enormous bravery and foresight - had removed and safely stored 8,366 artefacts before the looting, some 15,000 objects were taken during that 36 hours. While 7,000 items have been recovered, more than 8,000 remain unaccounted for, including artefacts thousands of years old from some of the earliest sites in the Middle East.

The looting is regarded as one of the worst acts of cultural vandalism in modern times, but much more of Iraq’s rich cultural history has been destroyed, damaged or stolen in the years since. Indeed the illegal trade in looted antiquities is growing.

Oriental Institute Lost Treasures from Iraq database

One of the museum objects that remains lost is a black stone weight shaped like a duck made around 2070 BC and excavated from the ancient city of Ur. Another is a fluted gold and lapis bowl from a royal cemetery in the same city.

The museum’s collection of cylinder seals (used to print images, usually into clay) was hit especially hard as they were easy to conceal and transport and had a ready market overseas. Of the 5144 taken, just over half have been returned. The museum reopened in 2014, somewhat a shadow of its former self.

Oriental Institute Lost Treasures from Iraq database

Some high value items looted from the museum were so recognisable that they could not possibly appear on the open market, suggesting they were taken with buyers already lined up. In contrast to this was the opportunistic looting undertaken by locals: in some galleries copies were stolen but genuine pieces ignored.

Global outrage at the looting did lead to immediate action. One of the most successful programs was an amnesty granted by authorities that saw almost 2,000 items returned by January 2004, and a further thousand items seized by Iraqi and US investigators.

Initial returns were largely local. One early success was the famous Lady of Warka, dated to around 3100 BC; she was recovered by investigators at a nearby farm following a tip off.

Others have come home following international investigations (a large number of objects seem to have travelled through London and New York in the aftermath), such as a statue of Assyrian king Argon II seized in New York in 2008 and returned to the museum in 2015.

Likewise the heaviest item stolen, a headless statue of the Sumerian king Entemena of Lagash was recovered in New York in 2006 with the help of an art dealer. Interpol and the University of Chicago have fastidiously maintained databases for objects looted from museum.

Demand increasing

While destruction and looting of cultural heritage has been a by-product of war for thousands of years, the scale of the looting of the Iraq Museum was staggering. Particularly frustrating were the neglected warnings that such an incident could happen, and the immediate response from the Bush administration that “stuff happens”.

The museum looting should have been a clarion call for the need for better protection of antiquities in conflict zones, both from combatants and local populations. Sadly, this has not been the case. There has been subsequent destruction of archaeological sites and museums in Syria and Libya, ISIS selling antiquities to finance weapons, and increases in thefts from both private and public collections and from archaeological sites.

Part of the problem with halting the illegal global trade of stolen antiquities is the scale of the market. In late 2017, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal presented the sobering assessment that over 100,000 antiquities are offered for sale online daily, of which up to 80% are likely to be faked or looted.

The industry is estimated by Neil Brodie of the University of Oxford to have a turnover of US$10 million a day. Today’s antiquities black market is using social media platforms and messenger apps to reach buyers in a way that would have been inconceivable to looters in 2003. There has been a surge in antiquities originating in Syria available online since the outbreak of the civil war.

In order to halt looting, it is essential that private collectors and institutions only purchase antiquities with a legal provenance to dry up the demand.

Ironically, centuries after many of the remains of these ancient cultural entities were looted by European colonial forces in order to fill grand national museums, we are seeing a 21st century version of cultural colonialism. Private collectors are enabling an entire economy of illegal activities.

The loss of these sites and artefacts is disastrous for humanity. The Baghdad looting has shown that in times of conflict, not even a museum can necessarily provide a sanctuary, without meaningful policies of protection. Sadly, it appears we have not learnt the lessons of April 2003.","Fifteen years after looting, thousands of artefacts are still missing from Iraq’s national museum",http://theconversation.com/fifteen-years-after-looting-thousands-of-artefacts-are-still-missing-from-iraqs-national-museum-93949

Local Iraqi TV reported that an Islamic State chief named Abu Walid al-Checheni, known to be a key ally of Baghdadi, was killed in a special operation

Iraqi military sources from the western Iraqi province, located 250km north of Baghdad, revealed to The New Arab's sister site al-Araby al-Jadeed that a prominent IS chief ""of foreign origin"" had been killed during a military ambush south of Wadi Hamreen in the early hours of Monday morning.Latest reports issued by the Iraqi military say that two thirds of IS' leaders from the so-called ""first generation"" of fighters have been killed over ther past three years by coalition airstrikes and ground-level battles waged by Iraqi forces.These campaigns have thrown IS into a leadership crisis as weak and inexperienced members are forced into key roles.The Iraqi military official in Baghdad told al-Araby al-Jadeed that Iraqi forces carried out an ambush attack targeting some buildings on the outskirts of the village of Sabeel, south of the Horan valley at dawn on Monday, during which the high-ranking IS member along with three companions, were killed. The official added that the slain militant was of non-Arab origin.The attack follows violent clashes that broke out when the militant refused to surrender and opened fire on Iraqi troops. The group was subsequently dealt with ""according to the appropriate rules of engagement"", the source said.Iraqi forces tracked down the IS leader by monitoring his mobile phone calls, the source added.He added details of the militant's identity would be announced soon, stressing the American forces provided air support during the operation but did not intervene as there was no need for them to do so.At the same time, local Iraqi TV reported an Iraqi security official said an Islamic State chief named Abu Walid al-Checheni was killed in a special operation, in which records containing important information were also seized. Checheni is known to be a key ally of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.""The deceased fighter was responsible for planning and carrying out terrorist attacks in Kirkuk, which therefore signals the end to terrorist sleeper cells in the Kirkuk region which he funds and directs,"" the security official was quoted as saying.It is thought that Monday's operation could lead to the tracking down of Baghdadi.

“We said we would go into Sinjar. Now operations have begun there. The fight is internal and external,” Erdogan told a crowd in the Black Sea province of Trabzon, without elaborating on what operations he was referring to.

Iraq’s Joint Operations Command denied that any foreign forces had crossed the border into Iraq.

“The operations command confirmed that the situation in Nineveh, Sinjar and the border areas was under the control of Iraqi security forces and there is no reason for troops to cross the Iraqi border into those areas,” it said in a statement.

Sources in Sinjar said there was no unusual military activity in the area on Sunday.

The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. President Tayyip Erdogan said last week they were creating a new base in Sinjar, and that Turkish forces would attack if necessary.

Sources in northern Iraq said on Friday the PKK would withdraw from Sinjar, where it gained a foothold in 2014 after coming to the aid of the Yazidi minority community, who were under attack by Islamic State militants.

The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has for decades been based in Iraq’s Qandil mountain range, near the border with Iran.

Turkish troops and their rebel allies swept into northwest Syria’s Afrin town this month, the culmination of an eight-week campaign to drive Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from the region. Turkey sees the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed PKK.

Erdogan has vowed to extend the military operation along the Syrian border and on Sunday said the Turkish-led forces would take control of the town of Tel Rifaat.

Many civilians and YPG have gathered in and around Tel Rifaat after Turkey seized control of Afrin. It is a Kurdish-controlled enclave, cut off from a larger expanse of Kurdish territory in the northeast of Syria.

Anbar (Iraqinews.com) – Six Iraqi soldiers were wounded Sunday after a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew himself up in Hit district, 70 km west of Ramadi, Anbar.

“The troops were combing a party headquarters that was hit by a bomb explosion Saturday, when the suicide bomber targeted them,” a security source told IKH News.

According to the source, the soldiers were transferred to Hit General Hospital for treatment.

Earlier in the day, a suicide bomber blew himself up at al-Hal (solution) party in Hit.

According to security reports, Saturday’s attack has left five people killed and seven others injured so far, including a parliamentary hopeful.

Violence in the country has surged further with the emergence of Islamic State extremist militants who proclaimed an “Islamic Caliphate” in Iraq and Syria in 2014.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted in over 3 million internally displaced persons across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Iraq declared the collapse of Islamic State’s territorial influence in Iraq last November with the recapture of Rawa, a city on Anbar’s western borders with Syria, which was the group’s last bastion in Iraq.

The feted Al-Zawraa club will face off against Lebanon's Al-Ahed in an Asian Football Confederation match in the holy Shiite city of Karbala, 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Baghdad.

No matter the final score, the scheduled showdown is already being hailed as a win for war-torn Iraq, which just months ago declared victory over the Islamic State group.

The country was prohibited from hosting international games since the early 1990s until FIFA ruled in March to bring it back into the full international fold.

""Up until now we have been deprived the chance of seeing our team's international exploits,"" said Majid, a supporter of Al-Zawraa approaching his fifties.

""Now we'll get to relive the atmosphere of the big matches.""

After first allowing the return of friendly games last year, global footballing authorities finally agreed to let foreign teams come for competitive games after agreeing security conditions were fine.

The return of international competitions has been seen as major progress by Iraqis and their government, as the country looks to attract investment and change its image after years of violence.

But still only three stadiums in Iraq have been given the greenlight to host the ties.

They are the 30,000-seater in Karbala, the country's most modern arena in the southern city of Basra and the main stadium in Arbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.

For Baghdad team Al-Zawraa that means the game will still not exactly be a home match -- as their regular stadium in the capital is not on the list.

An 'honour'

That has not dampened the spirits of the team or its supporters - who feel they will be representing the whole of Iraq.

""We have been waiting for this kind of match for a long time,"" Abdel Rahman Rashid, manager of Al-Zawraa, told AFP.

""It's an honour,"" he said.

For the players the trip to the game on Tuesday will be far less arduous than the ones they got used to as they previously had to play their competitive international fixtures in neutral countries.

All that travelling ""costs clubs a lot and had a negative impact on players"", coach Rashid said.

For the club's diehard fans the two-hour journey from the capital Baghdad to watch the match seems like nothing.

Veteran supporter Aqil al-Mendalaoui has already bought a ticket.

For him, going to the game is a ""national service"" that goes beyond just cheering on his beloved team.

This year, approximately 8.7 million people, nearly half of them children, will require some form of humanitarian assistance while as many as two million displaced Iraqis are expected to return.",Iraq - ETC Situation Report #50 (Reporting Period: 19/02/2018 to 27/03/2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-etc-situation-report-50-reporting-period-19022018-27032018
21,iraq,"BAGHDAD, April 9 (Reuters) - Iraq’s top court will begin hearings in May on the legality of oil exports from Kurdistan, which are at the centre of a row between the semi-autonomous region and Baghdad.

The oil dispute is the main hurdle to normalising relations between the central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of northern Iraq which conducted an October referendum on independence despite Baghdad’s opposition.

The Supreme Federal Court said in a statement on Monday it has asked to hear the opinions of officials including the central government’s prime minister, oil minister and finance minister, in addition to the KRG’s prime minister, on May 6.

Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi had asked the court to issue a ruling that bans independent oil exports from the KRG, which started in 2014, through a pipeline across Turkey.

The KRG says the Iraqi Constitution recognises the legality of its existence and contains no article specifically forbidding it from developing oil resources on its territory.

International energy firms including Exxon Mobil, DNO, Dana Gas, Rosneft and Genel are among companies with agreements with the KRG to operate in the Kurdistan region.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, right, greets John Bolton, President Trump’s choice to be national security adviser, as he arrives at the Pentagon on March 29. (Reuters)

John Bolton takes over as national security adviser today in the midst of a new national security crisis: another chemical attack in Syria. President Trump responded with strongly worded tweets blaming both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warning there would be a “big price to pay.”

Bolton is known for his hawkish views and general belief that the United States should use military power preemptively. Trump’s views on conflicts like that in Syria have been inconsistent, even contradictory. As recently as last week, the president was apparently disagreeing with his own Pentagon when he said the United States should get out of Syria immediately. Yet one of his tweets during the weekend implied that stronger U.S. action might have stopped Assad.

But that’s only the latest crisis. Bolton and the Trump administration will also be confronting the looming diplomatic encounter with North Korea and ongoing challenges like the war in Afghanistan and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. As they do so, keep this basic point in mind: In many of these regional conflicts, the United States has a limited amount of leverage or is at the mercy of forces beyond its control.

That doesn’t mean the United States has no power, or that individuals like Bolton and Trump don’t matter; my book about how presidents shape military interventions argues that they do. But international relations scholars know well that international forces and other countries’ interests and domestic politics can be powerful constraints on what the United States can do to shape events, particularly in regional conflicts. That’s important to remember in the constant ebb and flow of news.

Several recent TMC posts examine those constraints in different parts of the world. Let’s take a look.

China will have a big say in what happens next with North Korea

After Trump’s announcement that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, China and North Korea had a surprise of their own to unleash: Kim made a secretive visit to Beijing. Here at TMC, Rush Doshi explored three takeaways from the meeting. Doshi concludes, “Beijing has strong incentives to push for full involvement in the forthcoming talks. Diplomacy over North Korean denuclearization remains fluid and volatile, but one thing remains clear: Xi Jinping won’t be content to stay on the sidelines.”

China itself has a complex and volatile relationship with North Korea. But whatever Bolton’s and ultimately Trump’s plans for North Korea, they must account for China’s increasingly active role.

Regional conflicts have their own internal dynamics that resist U.S. intervention

Recently, there has been renewed talk of a peace settlement in Afghanistan, where much to Trump’s apparent chagrin, U.S. forces remain on the ground. But how likely is a peace deal?

As Asfandyar Mir lays out clearly in his recent Monkey Cage post, internal dynamics and domestic politics within Afghanistan could derail peace at any step: during negotiations, defining exactly what a deal would look like, dealing with spoilers, putting a deal into force and, finally, possibly spilling back into civil war. The United States has little power to change most of these factors. Indeed, as Greg Jaffe recently wrote at The Post, top military officials now talk about “winning” in conflicts like Afghanistan not in terms of outright victory, but in keeping a permanent presence, an “infinite war.”

Many of Mir’s points about Afghanistan probably also apply to Syria, where realistic military options are hard to identify. Last year, after another alleged chemical attack, the United States struck Syria with a cruise missile. Marc Lynch wrote here that the strike alone wouldn’t shift the overall strategic stalemate in Syria. There is little reason to imagine things are much different this time.

Bolton’s hawkish views come from the era of unchallenged U.S. power after the Cold War — which is coming to an end

Bolton is best known for serving in the George W. Bush administration, when U.S. military power was largely unchallenged. As Joshua Shifrinson argued here at the Monkey Cage, “In an age of overwhelming U.S. military dominance, there is no other country to push back when the United States gets aggressive. As a result, militant and assertive views have more scope to shape policy.” Bolton’s hawkish views are partly a symptom of post-Cold War U.S. world dominance.

Shifrinson concludes that other countries like China may be challenging U.S. economic power, but that the United States still has a clear military advantage. That might make military force look more attractive to many in the White House, “because that is where the United States outcompetes the rest of the world.” Thus, “with U.S. power dominant but waning, Bolton’s elevation reminds us there are few limits to — and some momentum behind — a militaristic U.S. foreign policy.”

Alliances and diplomacy remain important for addressing regional conflicts

Trump and Bolton both appear to disdain alliances and many forms of diplomacy. But the ongoing challenges facing the United States show how important these tools can be.

For example, Stephan Haggard explained here how sanctions have actually worked to bring the confrontation with North Korea to this point. Multilateral coordination, always difficult with sanctions, turned out to be crucial. As Haggard notes, “The concerns now rest with a U.S. administration prone to grand gestures but with a foreign policy bench depleted to some extent by turnover. The United States faces the challenge of coordinating at the multilateral level and with China to maintain the sanctions pressure that will lead to talks.”

Although David Bosco recently argued here that Bolton has an underappreciated record of multilateralism, neither Bolton nor Trump is known for the kind of repeated, patient diplomacy Haggard suggests will be crucial for successful North Korea talks. Indeed, as Mira Rapp-Hooper has pointed out in several pieces here, Trump’s threats against North Korea have more often harmed U.S. alliances than changed the dynamics with Kim.

Taken together, these arguments have a sobering message for the president and his new national security adviser. Trump and Bolton will certainly put their own stamp on U.S. policy over the next few months. But they’ll have to contend with a host of complicated forces beyond their control, and will have less power to shape other regions’ conflicts than they may wish. The United States has had to relearn this lesson many times — often painfully, especially in the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.","Bolton starts today, with a Syria crisis on the agenda.

23,iraq,"Iraqi security forces have killed a key Islamic State militant group (ISIS) figure associated with the global jihadi organization's elusive leader, according to local and regional reports.

Iraq's Al-Sumeria television network cited intelligence sources who said ISIS official Abu Walid al-Checheni was tracked and killed in an operation in the province of Kirkuk. Checheni was accused of actively plotting attacks against military and civilian targets, while Iraq attempted to wipe out the last of ISIS and prepare for next month's elections.

""The security forces were able to kill the right arm of the terrorist Baghdadi, called Abu Walid al-Checheni...following precise intelligence on his location in a desert area on the outskirts of the city of Kirkuk where he planned terrorist attacks targeting civilians and security forces inside the city,"" security sources told Al-Sumeria.

Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters

The report, which also appeared in Iranian and Syrian media, said that the operation to target Checheni led to the discovery of important documents that revealed the identities of other important ISIS figures. Al Araby Al Jadeed, a U.K.-based newspaper with ties to Qatar, cited Iraqi officials who said the operation could lead to clues as to where Baghdadi himself was hiding out.

Prior to becoming one of the world's most wanted men, Baghdadi was a Sunni Muslim preacher known as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarrai. After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and subsequent Fall of Baghdad, Baghdadi reportedly became involved in a growing insurgency of ultraconservative Sunni Muslim groups. The ranks of these groups grew as the new U.S.-led, mostly Shiite Muslim government purged Sunni Muslims and Baathist officials associated with the government of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Baghdadi was arrested in 2004 and was held in Camp Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two facilities criticized for the way in which detainees were treated. He joined the Islamic State of Iraq, a merger of jihadi organizations that included Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and took over after the death of its leader in 2010.

Baghdadi changed the name to ISIS in 2013 after spreading his ultraconservative Sunni Islamist insurgency into neighboring Syria, where the West, Gulf Arab states and Turkey backed an uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The ISIS leader made his only public appearance in an infamous global call-to-arms from Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2014, the year his group claimed about half of Iraq and Syria.

As ISIS lost nearly all of its territory in recent years, various reports of Baghdadi's fate and whereabouts have surfaced. Russia claimed the jihadi leader was likely killed in an airstrike in the countryside of the group's de facto capital of Raqqa last May, but no evidence supported the claim. The last supposed proof that Baghdadi was alive emerged last September when ISIS released a voice recording.

He did not appear when the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces took Raqqa city last October, nor when the Russia-backed Syrian military and its allies took the final ISIS city of Deir Ezzor and final ISIS town of Al-Bukamal late last year. U.S. and Iraqi officials have suggested he was hiding in the final pockets of ISIS territory between Iraq and Syria and may be injured.","Iraq Kills ISIS Leader Baghdadi's Right-Hand Man in Latest Blow to Islamic State, Reports Say",http://www.newsweek.com/iraq-kills-isis-leader-right-hand-man-latest-blow-15-years-us-victory-reports-878251
24,iraq,"Sinjar, in northeast Iraq, made headlines for the 2014 massacre, enslavement, and displacement of its Yazidi people by militants from the so-called Islamic State. Thousands have since returned to the shattered town, but they are struggling with a lack of basic services, especially medical care.

Patients queue in a dingy corridor in what is left of Sinjar General Hospital to see 27-year-old Hussein Rashu, who was until recently its sole doctor. Hundreds of Yazidis seek treatment here every week, many suffering from complaints induced by ongoing shortages of food, clean drinking water, electricity and heating, and from living in makeshift accommodations.

“I see everyone – men, women, and children – and deal with all [sorts of] cases because there’s no one else,” explained Doctor Rashu, who qualified in 2014 and can offer only the most basic diagnoses and prescriptions.

This part of the hospital, which once boasted 100 beds and several departments, is one of only two wards that survived IS control of Sinjar, which began in August 2014, when tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to seek refuge in the nearby mountains.

After massacring more than 1,500 Yazidis and kidnapping another 1,500 women and children as part of a campaign the UN has called genocide, the militants then unleashed destruction on Sinjar. Airstrikes and on-the-ground combat damaged much of what remained of the town, as Yazidi and Kurdish forces fought to regain control of it.

Sinjar and its surrounding villages are the historic refuge of the Yazidis, a long-persecuted Iraqi minority that was singled out by IS for especially cruel treatment. Since liberation in November 2015, more than 4,000 Yazidi families have come back, an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 people in all. They have returned to a homeland in need of extensive reconstruction.

Mayor Ferhad Hiamd says that while returnees need housing, food, and clothing, medical care is the most pressing necessity. “We need urgent help here in Sinjar,” he told IRIN. “We need everything, but the healthcare situation is particularly critical.”

But according to local officials, health workers, and the inhabitants themselves, scant aid has been provided by either the Iraqi government or the Kurdistan Regional Government (which claimed the area as part of its territory until Iraqi forces took control last October). They also accuse UN agencies and major international non-governmental organisations of largely overlooking the town and the scale of its needs.

As one frustrated hospital volunteer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “While the foreign NGO employees are sitting comfortably in the Green Zone in Baghdad or luxury hotels in Erbil, our people are dying here in Sinjar.”

Shortages

The desperate need for medical care is exacerbated by the poor living conditions in Sinjar: most returnees live in informal camps, damaged buildings, or rural areas far from the hospital and the one other healthcare centre, which has no doctor and even less to offer patients.

The lack of medical care, as well as shortages of just about everything, makes the prospects of further returns to Sinjar more distant.

Most of the area’s estimated 250,000 Yazidis remain in refugee camps scattered around Iraqi Kurdistan, Syria, and Turkey. Others have sought asylum in Europe. Sinjar’s Arab and Kurdish populations have also not come home.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi told IRIN the government was keen for all members of the Yazidi community to return to Sinjar but that the area had been badly damaged and needed extensive support and rebuilding.

“We have been talking to the international community and they show interest in Sinjar, but actual support is very slow,” he said.

Over this long, harsh winter, so many people sought treatment at the hospital that Doctor Rashu and pharmacist Mourad Khro Mourad lived on site, often working throughout the night.

Mourad said chronic diseases routinely go untreated for lack of medication. NGOs and the health department of Nineveh, the province in which Sinjar sits, do provide some medications, but not enough, he said.

The two work with only six beds, one toilet used by around 150 people a day, and almost no equipment. Doctor Rashu said he eventually needs to refer most patients to better-equipped hospitals in Dohuk or Mosul, some 170 kilometres and 130 kilometres away by road, respectively.

But many patients cannot afford to make the trip, he added, and others are too scared to go to Mosul, a former IS stronghold where many Yazidis had been enslaved.

Transfers

The most urgent cases require swift transfers to other facilities, but Sinjar has no functional ambulances.

Hospital staff say two new ambulances were promised in December by the Nineveh health department – which did not respond to IRIN’s request for comment – but these have still not been delivered.

“While the foreign NGO employees are sitting comfortably in the Green Zone in Baghdad or luxury hotels in Erbil, our people are dying here in Sinjar.”

This means every emergency case is complicated, and often needs to involve the armed forces controlling Sinjar. These include the Iraqi army, Yazidi units, and a coalition of mostly Shia militias forces known as the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Units).

In early March, three babies suffering from suspected pneumonia needed to be urgently transferred while hooked up to oxygen. Hospital staff had to ask Hashd al-Shaabi forces to take the babies – aged three, five, and six months – to Mosul by military ambulance.

The forces agreed, but the ambulances were not equipped to give the babies oxygen en route. Concerned the babies would not survive the two-and-a-half hour journey to Mosul, they had to first make a detour to a field hospital to get them hooked up.

Days later, hospital staff again called on the Hashd al-Shaabi, requesting that two trauma patients with severe head injuries be transferred.

Doctor Rashu admits it’s not ideal to mix civilian medical care with military operations, and notes that some Yazidis are too afraid to get into the ambulances.

“It’s not the right way to do things, but we literally have no other choice when faced with patients in a life or death situation,” he said. “I am a doctor, and it is my duty to do whatever I can to try and save patients’ lives.”

While these transfers are dangerously complex and can be difficult to arrange, saving lives in Sinjar itself remains nearly impossible.

Hospital staff say at least 11 people have died in the last six months because of lack of medication, ambulances, medical equipment, and resources.

“Sinjar is being completely ignored,” Doctor Rashu said, and mayor Hiamd agreed, adding: “We urge the government and NGOs to recognise the desperate situation here and urgently prioritise helping the people of Sinjar.”

New fees

Until a few weeks ago, Sinjar General Hospital received 270-300 patients daily, even with its limited resources.

Those numbers have since halved, officials say, after the Iraqi government introduced new charges for hospital visits and prescriptions at public hospitals.

Although the fees – 2,000 Iraqi dinars ($1.70) for a consultation and 1,000 ($.85) for a prescription – are modest, many people in Sinjar can barely afford food.

Doctor Rashu said that while he understands the new system is countrywide, he can’t see “why the Iraqi government activated it here in Sinjar, where people are very, very poor.”

Mourad, the pharmacist, has already seen the impact of the new costs. He recalled a recent case of a mother and three children, all suffering from influenza. She had only 3,000 Iraqi dinars, so paid for her sickest child to be seen while she and the other two children went without examination or medicine.

Where is the help?

Hospital staff were critical of international NGOs and aid agencies, who they said had done little to help Sinjar, apart from make visits, carry out assessments, and make promises that rarely materialised into practical help.

“We ask them, please, get in your cars and come to Sinjar yourselves to see the reality of our situation,” said the hospital volunteer who asked to remain anonymous. “But, if you do come, please don’t make promises you cannot keep.”

René Nijenhuis, deputy head in Iraq of OCHA, the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, said the UN has 19 humanitarian partners currently providing assistance in Sinjar (including some in the health field), of which seven are international NGOs. The UN Development Programme has 38 projects in Sinjar, including four in the healthcare field, said a spokesman, Sam Kimball, who added that the rehabilitation of two primary healthcare facilities in the Sinjar region has been completed, while other projects remain “under implementation”.

But apart from a polio and measles vaccination programme funded by UNICEF, local medical staff say they have only seen a handful of NGOs operating on the ground in Sinjar. They include: MedAir, which runs a mobile clinic one morning a week to offer basic primary healthcare; the Dutch NGO Dorcas Aid International; and the British NGO Road to Peace.

In the last few weeks, Road to Peace has set up a basic paediatric unit in part of the Sinjar hospital formerly used as an IS base, according to the organisation’s director, Sally Becker. Demand to see the international paediatric specialists who stay for weeks at a time has been overwhelming, she says.

“Apart from MedAir and Dorcas, the only NGOs we’ve seen at the hospital are MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières],” said Becker. “In the meantime though, the people of Sinjar are desperate.”

MSF confirmed it was currently conducting an assessment in Sinjar “to gather information about the healthcare needs of children and adults living in the area, and how MSF can potentially respond.”

It isn’t always easy to access Sinjar, as NGOs need authorisation from Baghdad to visit or work in the area. One Western NGO told IRIN that getting approvals could be challenging and that, with several different military and civilian groups in control of the region, rules could arbitrarily change.

But the Norwegian Refugee Council, which conducted an assessment in December last year and is waiting for prospective donors to respond on funding requests for Sinjar-specific programmes, said that NGOs with authorisation from Iraq’s federal forces were able to access Sinjar.

In the meantime, those who have returned to Sinjar carry on as best they can.

Amshee, 50, was cleaning mats outside what she called a “borrowed” empty house her family had just moved in to. “We need everything here, really everything,” she said. “We have no food, no clean water, no money, no work, not even any spare clothes.”

25,iraq,"Next month general elections are due to take place in Iraq. It will be the fourth time in 15 years that Iraqis vote in multi-party elections since the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s Baath regime in April 2003. Undoubtedly this is a remarkable achievement in a country that, prior to 2003, last witnessed a multi-party general elections, albeit with limitations, in 1957 under the monarchy which was overthrown by a military coup in 1958. However, Iraq is still far from establishing peace, stability, democracy and prosperity. The Iraqi people were liberated from the previous ruthless regime but they had to witness more sufferings, albeit of a different nature, in the past 15 years.

The regime change of 2003 was possible thanks to the invasion of Iraq by an international coalition force headed by the Unites States. The military Operation Iraqi Freedom swiftly lead to the collapse of the Iraqi armed forces. A series of measures followed to decide how to run Iraq in the absence of the pre-invasion authorities. The international Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established and then US president George W Bush appointed Paul Bremer as its leader with unlimited authority. Soon Mr Bremer approved the creation of the interim Iraqi Governing Council (IGC). The council members were chosen by Mr Bremer from among Iraqi groups and individuals who had supported the American invasion of Iraq.

Hopes to create the basis for establishing a free peaceful and democratic Iraq were quickly diminished by the emergence of a destructive insurgency against the coalition forces and their Iraqi allies. The insurgency gradually turned into a Shia-Sunni conflict that by 2006 threatened to engulf Iraq in a sectarian civil war. But thanks to a combined effort, the US-led international coalition and the newly established Iraqi forces, supported by Kurdish Peshmerga in the north and Arab tribes in the south, helped to avoid civil war.

However even during that period, political changes in post-Saddam Iraq were taking place to shape the future of the country. In 2004, the CPA formally handed over authority to a transitional Iraqi government. A National Assembly was elected with the specific task of drafting a permanent constitution. In 2005, the drafted constitution was approved by popular referendum and the first general elections were held.

The newly elected parliament elected the president and the prime minister. Real power was, and still is, concentrated in the hands of the latter, including the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. A consensus by all political groups was agreed upon to allocate the post of prime minister to the Shias, president to the Kurds and parliament speaker to the Sunnis. The irony is that the consensus based on sectarian divide, which was meant to be a solution to stabilise the political and security situation, turned out to be the heart of all problems. The status quo opened the door for regional powers to interfere in Iraq’s affairs, some less, others more so.

_______________

Different groups in Iraq allied themselves with different regional powers. Undoubtedly Iran emerged as a significant player in Iraq. Many outsiders fail to appreciate the nature and extend of Iran’s role in Iraq. Iraq is more and more controlled by a dominating Shia religious and political class closely tied to Iran’s Islamic Republic. The Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) are formed on purely Shia ideology doctrine similar to that of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. No wonder it is closely advised by Iran’s powerful Al Quds Brigade commander Qasim Sulaimani. Many commanders of PMF, including its head Hadi Al Amiri and his deputy Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis served in the past alongside Mr Sulaimani in the Revolutionary Guard. The PMF is now considered by law an independent military force parallel to the Iraqi army. Following last year’s controversial independent referendum the PMF was used as the main force to confront the Kurdish Peshmerga and took back Kirkuk and many other parts of the disputed territories that were under Kurdish rule.

Despite the recent minimisation of tension between the central government and the federal Kurdistan region (KR), a mountain of issues remain disputed between the two sides.

The Kurds are not the only component of Iraq who have serious problems with the Shia-dominant ruling establishment. Sunni Arabs feel they are marginalised and treated as second class citizens. Remarkably during the process of drafting the constitution in 2005, the representatives of Sunni Arabs strongly opposed the article stating that Iraq is a federal state. But now desperation has driven them to make a U-turn by demanding their own Sunni federal region similar to the KR. However, they don’t go as far as a majority of the Kurds opting for independence from Iraq. In other words, neither Kurds nor Sunnis would like to change the status quo by granting them more power to self-rule.

So quo vadis Iraq? Fifteen years after Operation Iraq Freedom, Iraqis still ask the burning question about the future of their country: can a united Iraq survive? Last year a report on the future of Iraq was published by the Iraq Task Force, a group founded a year earlier by the Washington-based Atlantic Council. The group consisted of many politicians, academics and experts. In conclusion, the authors of the report offered a series of recommendations to the US administration. One recommendation stated: ""It is in the interest of our national security that we do our best to help bring about an Iraq that is independent, stable and prosperous: one at peace with its neighbours; one reflecting legitimate and effective governance and one strongly inclined to cooperate closely with the United States in the Middle East and beyond.""

Many Iraqis are not so optimistic and not convinced that such a goal can be achieved without changing the status quo. And change is not coming at least for the next few years. For the fourth time, next month’s elections will be fought between political blocks formed on sectarian bases.

The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) has received a contribution of USD 9.3 million to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action (UN VTF) from the Government of Japan to undertake critical humanitarian mine action programming in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and South Sudan. Japan is one of the largest donors to the UN VTF providing over USD 132 million since 2010. In addition to its financial support, UNMAS benefits from the provision of Japanese in-kind personnel.

“The United Nations thanks the Government and People of Japan for their continued commitment to mine action,” stated Agnès Marcaillou, the Director of UNMAS. “Enduring conflicts, as we see in the Middle East and Africa where Japan is focusing its funding, have resulted in an unprecedented level of contamination by unexploded bombs, rockets and other ammunition. With Japanese support, UNMAS will continue to clear land and open roads allowing refugees and displaced people to return home and enable humanitarian actors to reach populations in need. This work will save lives and provide hope and opportunity for some of the poorest communities in the world.”

His Excellency Dr. Toshiya Hoshino, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations, said, “Humanitarian action cannot be undertaken without mine action. Nor can displaced people return home, or civilians live in safety and escape poverty. Mine action is, therefore, a prerequisite for sustainable development as well as for human security. Based on this idea, Japan has been placing assistance to mine action as one of its diplomatic priorities, and this year’s assistance is also in line with this firm commitment. As one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Mine Action, Japan expects this assistance will be used in an effective and coordinated manner. Japan will continue to play an active role in mine action in collaboration with the United Nations, the Member States, and civil society organizations to achieve our collective goal of creating a mine-free world.”

In these turbulent times, the needs of the humanitarian mine action sector are increasing as highlighted earlier this month when the United Nations launched the Portfolio for Mine Action Projects for 2018. The Portfolio shows the funding requirements increased by 29 per cent compared to 2017, to USD 661 million. With 27 per cent of the total secured, USD 483 million more is needed for clearance of explosive hazards, risk education, and support to victims and their communities. The Portfolio is available online at: http://www.mineaction.org/resources/portfolios.
