0,iraq,"Water levels on four major reservoirs across the globe have reached such low levels they are threatening ‘Day Zero’ – the point at which the authorities have to turn off supplies.

Last month Cape Town was saved from reaching 'Day Zero' when a dramatic 60 per cent reduction in consumption warded off disaster.

But according to a report by the Resource Watch organisation, Morocco, India, Iraq and Spain are facing a similar crisis after water levels have fallen dramatically, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.

Morocco:

The Al Massira dam in Morocco provides water for big cities as well as the country's vital agricultural sector

Resource Watch says the surface area of Al Massira dam, the second-largest reservoir in Morocco, has shrunk by more than 60 percent over the last three years.

The last time Al Massira was at this level was between 2005 and 2008, when more than 700,000 Moroccans were affected by drought and grain production fell by 50 percent.

In common with its north African neighbours, Morocco suffers from recurring droughts and in 2016 was hit by the worst drought in three decades.

As well as the agricultural sector, Al Massira supplies water to many cities, including Casablanca.

India:

In India, the falling water levels of two crucial reservoirs have led to fierce argument about how to allocate water.

The Narmada River flows from east to west through the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, then through the state of Gujarat before emptying into the Arabian Sea.

Poor rains in 2017 have led to a clash how much water should be released from the Indira Sagar reservoir to the downstream Sardar Sarovar reservoir in Gujarat.

The Sardar Sarovar reservoir provides drinking water for 30 million people, almost half of Gujarat’s total population, and the irrigation for more than a million farmers.

Poor rainfall has led to a fierce argument about how much water to release from the Indira Sagar dam (pictured)

But releasing more water from the Indira Sagar dam would have further reduced the its reservoir’s supply during the critical summer period.

‘India is a highly water-stressed country and has suffered through many debilitating droughts in recent years,’ say Resource Watch.

‘These dry spells have devastated farmers, even driving some to commit suicide.'

Iraq:

The reservoir of the Iraq’s Mosul Dam has shrunk 60 percent in surface area from the late 1990s to present day.

According to Resource Watch, there are several reasons behind this including poor water resource management by the Iraqi government and intense regional droughts.

Water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir have fallen by 60 per cent, with a Turkish hydroelectric project to blamed by many

But Turkey’s Southeast Anatolia Project and its 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants across the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are cited by many as a key driver behind the reduced river flow into Iraq.

Spain:

Spain, along with its neighbour Portugal, is fighting a drought that is drying up rivers, ruining crops and sparking wildfires.

The surface area of the Buendia dam reservoir shrunk by 60 percent over the last five years, says Resource Watch,

Levels that low were last seen in 2006, when the country was going through its worst drought in 60 years.

Experts warn that droughts will likely become more frequent and severe in this region, and water stress is projected to increase in many parts of Spain by 2040.","Morocco, India, Iraq, Spain could be next for Day Zero water crisis",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5626133/Could-Morocco-India-Iraq-Spain-face-Day-Zero-water-crisis.html

20th anniversary of IDMC and of the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement - making 2018 the year of IDPs

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, and of IDMC itself.

Twenty years ago, states committed to preventing armed conflict, violence, disasters and human rights violations from displacing people inside their own country, and to providing protection and assistance to them when they did. Since then, internal displacement has been recognised as an issue of global concern, and the plight, needs and vulnerabilities of internally displaced people (IDPs) have been systematically documented and reported on.

In 2017, the world experienced some of the highest rates of violence and internal displacement on record. These were driven by political instability, complex humanitarian emergencies, failed peace agreements, unsustainable refugee returns, urban warfare dynamics, extreme weather and disasters. Well over one million people were displaced across the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the year, fleeing armed attacks and seeking shelter wherever they could, often with no assistance. Armed violence continued to force unacceptably large numbers of people to flee across the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Nigeria, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Yemen’s catastrophic humanitarian situation left the country’s two million IDPs with no access to basic services, severely malnourished and at high risk of famine. World attention was also drawn in 2017 to the Caribbean and South Asia, where violent storms, floods and hurricanes swept across entire communities, destroying critical infrastructure and leaving millions of people homeless.

These human tragedies give us few reasons to celebrate.

Nevertheless, at IDMC we celebrate our 20th anniversary with renewed energy and determination. We commit to elevating the issue of internal displacement within the debates on displacement and migration that have dominated the post-2015 global policy agenda and that have, to date, excluded the tens of millions of people who live in displacement within the borders of their own countries and receive little political attention or support. We argue that the exclusion of internal displacement from these conversations will come at great cost to future peace, development and security, and that it is time to refocus world attention on the most vulnerable and neglected.

If 2018 is to be the year in which we see real change for IDPs, we need to think and talk about internal displacement differently. We must consider it a human rights issue, but also focus on the critical and often neglected political and development dimensions of the phenomenon. Ignoring its longer-term causes and its future impact on individuals, communities and national economies will lead to short-sighted policies and slow progress towards the achievement of national and global development goals. Beyond a moral or legal obligation, it is in the interest of national governments to invest more in preventing and finding lasting solutions to displacement.

Monitoring internal displacement in the future will need to be about more than just numbers. Building on our past research, we will have to systematically assess which investments truly address the drivers of displacement, what can be done to mitigate its impacts, and how to solve practical problems faced by the displaced and by local and national authorities. For this, solid research into the political, social, economic and environmental dimensions of displacement, and a good understanding of how these factors inter-connect and determine different levels of vulnerability, will be needed. This research will have to be comparative across contexts, draw from lessons about what works and what does not, and showcase effective and innovative solutions.

For this research to be translated into effective policy, we will need to actively involve governments and local actors in countries affected by internal displacement. Sustainable solutions to displacement need to be inclusive, locally driven, anchored in countries’ realities, and owned by governments. We will need to work hand-in-hand with these governments to ensure internal displacement becomes an integral part of their planning, and that collective outcomes are achieved by multiple stakeholders reaching across different political and institutional mandates, timeframes and budgets.

IDMC commits to working towards all these objectives in the coming years. We will prioritise building partnerships with governments, NGOs, UN agencies and academic bodies to monitor, analyse and report on internal displacement. We will offer our services and expertise to inform policy-making, and provide thought leadership in framing and creating a global dialogue around the issue. We will build the case for the urgent need to finally mobilise more political will and financial investment, in order to definitively end the displacement of millions worldwide. This will require challenging ourselves, our mandates and our ways of working, which will mean stepping out of our comfort zone, trying out new approaches and daring to embark on an altogether new path. For this, we invite our partners, collaborators and supporters to join forces with us and push the boundaries of our understanding of displacement and our commitment to keep this issue high on the global agenda.",Quarterly Update January - March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/quarterly-update-january-march-2018
2,iraq,"An Irish photographer who captured the human cost of the battle for the city of Mosul in Iraq has spoken of his hope for the country and his time embedded with Iraqi forces during some of the bloodiest fighting against Islamic State (IS).

Last month Ivor Pickett took first prize in the news photographer category at the 2018 World Press Photographers of the Year contest for his New York Times series ‘Battle for Mosul’.

The fight to drive IS out of Mosul left 600,000 of the population of three million displaced and much of the old part of the city in ruins but Cork-born Mr Pickett has just returned there and says he is heartened by the resilience of the people.

This time round he will bear witness to efforts to rebuild the city and to record parliamentary elections in Iraq on Saturday.

“It is quite incredible to see the country and Mosul, in particular, coming back to life,” he told Ryan Tubridy on RTÉ radio.

Based in the Middle East since 2009, Ivor documented the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Libya as well as the Syrian refugee crisis before travelling to Mosul in October 2016 as Iraqi troops began a major offensive to re-take the city which had been under IS control since 2014. It took them more than a year.

Civilians who had remained in west Mosul during the battle to retake the city, lined up for an aid distribution in the Mamun neighbourhood.

“The Iraqi government announced the official defeat of ISIS in December and the country is trying to get back on its feet after the most difficult urban combats since World War II.

""There are huge obstacles in the wake of that yet to be overcome but I am back here since yesterday for the first time in a couple of months and every time you come back it’s bustling that little bit more.”

It is a far cry from his time embedded with Iraqi counter-terrorism forces who were spearheading the operation to defeat IS in Mosul throughout 2016 and 2017.

“I made multiple trips working for The New York Times. It was incredibly dangerous. ISIS were pioneering ways of fighting we had never seen before. The use of commercial drones that they had weaponised to both drop ordnance and to guide suicide car bombers.”

Through it all, he sought to record the toll the fighting was taking on civilians, photographing lines of people queueing for food and capturing the despair of a local woman sitting in the middle of what was once a road as she watched the bodies of her sister and niece being dug from the ruins of her house.

Nadhira Aziz looked on as Iraqi Civil Defence workers dug out the bodies of her sister and niece from her house in the Old City where they were killed by an airstrike in June.

“The focus of a lot of my work was the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of civilians stuck in Mosul when this was going on.”

One of Mr Pickett’s prizewinning photos was of a boy who had survived the siege of the last IS-controlled area in the Old City of Mosul.

“That was towards the end of the battle for Mosul last summer, in July 2017. This young boy was carried by a soldier.

""He had been carried across the front line by a man who was suspected of being an ISIS fighter who had picked up the boy to use as a human shield so the soldiers wouldn’t shoot at him.

“They did not know anything about him. He was probably about two or three years old. He didn’t speak because he was so young and traumatised.

Iraqi Special Forces soldiers surveyed the aftermath of an ISIS suicide car bomb that managed to reach their lines in the Andalus neighbourhood, one of the last areas to be liberated in east Mosul.

""He was one of the last children I saw coming out of that area that was being destroyed. Most people in there were ultimately killed.”

What happened next was incredible, said Mr Pickett.

“The soldiers took the boy and cared for him. After they washed him and his tattered clothing. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the soldier’s shoulder. That’s when I took the picture.

“It was an incredible moment to witness and to watch these battle-hardened men put down their weapons for a second to care for this young boy. It was as if he had made them forget what they were still going through.

""He became a symbol for me of the cost the battle had taken on the civilians of Mosul.”","‘Incredible to see Mosul coming back to life’, says Cork photographer",https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/incredibleto-see-mosul-comingback-to-life-says-cork-photographer-470406.html

Jordan is willing and fully prepared to contribute to Iraq’s reconstruction process, Prime Minister Hani Mulki told visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Jaafari on Sunday.

At their meeting, the premier said that Jordan “in light of its proximity to Iraq and vast experiences in various fields can carry out the necessary consultations with Iraqis and other Arab stakeholders to contribute effectively in the rebuilding process”, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.

Mulki said that after its victory over terrorists, a fight that Jordan has “staunchly supported”, Iraq has regained its regional role and is back on its feet to boost its economy.

Jaafari, who was accompanied by an official delegation, thanked Jordan for backing his country while at war with terror groups and facilitating the life of Iraqis living in the Kingdom, including allowing these expats to cast their votes in Iraq’s parliamentary elections that will take place later this month.

He said Jordanian businesses are welcome to invest in Iraq when security and stability are fully restored to the war-torn country.

Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed Mulki’s remarks at a separate meeting with his Iraqi counterpart.

He said Jordan would put all its capabilities at the disposal of its eastern neighbour as it launches the reconstruction process.

He stressed that Jordan realises the importance of Iraq restoring its role as a “cornerstone” of the region’s stability and in serving the common causes of the Arab and Muslim nations.

He congratulated Jaafari on his country’s victory against the Daesh terror group, stressing that it was a victory of all humanity over the “darkness and delusion” of the terrorists that was achieved by the sacrifices of Iraqis.

The two ministers stressed the keenness of Jordan and Iraq to take all possible measures to boost cooperation in all fields, Petra said.

They highlighted the progress made to implement agreements signed previously to enhance trade exchange and investments, highlighting the reopening of Turaibil border crossing after a three-year closure blamed on the security situation.

The two diplomats also looked into developments in a number of regional issues including the Palestinian cause, the Syrian crisis and the war against terrorism.

On the Palestinian issue, Safadi and Jaafari agreed that the two-state solution is the only way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and is key to security and stability in the Middle East.

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian crisis with a political solution.

Jaafari expressed Iraq’s appreciation for the Jordanian support in fighting terrorism and welcomed Jordan’s prospective role in reconstructing his country, which has been estimated at $200 billion.

The two officials later held a press conference in which they reiterated the two countries’’ willingness to enhance their ties at all levels.

Safadi told reporters that it is a “matter of time” before the two countries restore the level of cooperation they used to have in the past.

Bush in Baghdad in 2008, participates in the country's parliamentary elections, with sincere intentions to fight corruption and vowed to bring Bush and his followers, who launched the war on Iraq in 2003, to international tribunal. The vote of parliamentary election in Iraq will be held on May 12, as around 7,000 candidates will compete for the 329 seats in the Iraqi parliament. (Xinhua/Khalil Dawood)

BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly ten years have passed since an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at George W. Bush in Baghdad and grabbed headlines of major media around the world.

Muntadhar al-Zaidi, 39, an Iraqi who was reporter for the Iraqi-owned Cairo-based al-Baghdadia TV late in 2008, became the hero in the Arab world and even internationally for those who opposed the war on Iraq that destroyed the state and led to blood baths that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.

Zaidi's act undoubtedly bears the meaning of humiliation to president of top power of the world, but he was also imprisoned and was forced to leave the country.

After 10 years, Zaidi returned home to participate in the country's parliamentary elections, with sincere intentions to fight corruption and vowed to bring Bush and his followers, who launched the war on Iraq in 2003, to international tribunal.

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua in his campaign center in Zaafaraniyah neighborhood in southeastern Baghdad, Zaidi said his shoe throwing action was not personal because his family and relatives were not harmed directly by the U.S. troops.

""The occupation forces did not harm my own family and relatives, but they harmed my country and killed my people,"" Zaidi told Xinhua.

He said that his action was planned in advance by himself because he wanted to show the world that what Bush had said before the war that Iraqis would receive his troops with flowers in Baghdad was false.

""I was looking for an equal and opposite reaction that would say to the criminal (Bush) and the world that the people of Iraq would not receive the occupation with flowers, but with rejection, resistance and shoes,"" Zaidi added.

Zaidi told Xinhua that Maliki's guards and security forces detained and tortured him for three months until an Iraqi court sentenced him to one year in prison, but he spend only nine months as he was granted conditional discharge for his good behavior.

Zaidi talked about the suffering in the prison and said he was ""whipped, tortured with electricity,"" and his teeth and nose were broken, and he had ""suffered a fracture in his foot,"" in addition to keeping him for three-month in solitary confinement.

However, he said that all his pain and suffering were diminished in front of his act of throwing his shoes at Bush that he greatly proud of, and diminished ""in front of the suffering of thousands of Iraqis in prisons without a reason and a guilt,"" according to Zaidi.

""Yes, the suffering was similar to the medieval prisons; torture, repression, forced confessions, indicting innocents on false charges,"" he said, adding that Iraqi also suffer from corruption such as ""releasing convicts, killers, Daesh and al-Qaida members for paying money and turns the charges on other innocent people.""

After Zaidi was released from prison, he left Iraq for treating his wounds and established his humanitarian foundation, which he named al-Zaidi Foundation tasked with providing aide to the victims of Iraqi violence.

Zaidi has published a book titled ""The Last Salute To President Bush"" that chronicling the moments leading him to his celebrated act of shoe throwing. Zaidi said that he printed his book in Arabic, Chinese and Turkish languages.

Zaidi spent much of his time outside Iraq, particularly in Beirut, Lebanon, since his release in 2009, but retuned to Baghdad before two months to announce his participation in the country's parliamentary elections.

Zaidi, an independent candidate, promised to fight fiercely the corruption in Iraq, and called for comprehensive reform under an umbrella coalition of Sa'iroon, led by the prominent Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

""I will hold a rod to beat all the corrupt people without fear. I will be a tough figure and a nightmare for them,"" Zaidi pledged.

He said that he will seek trial for those corrupt people and will demand compensation for Iraqis who were affected by the violence and corruption.

Many posters spread across Baghdad, showing Zaidi carrying number 95 at Sa'iroon Coalition, but are only holding his photo with his name without referring to the shoe throwing incident to remind voters.

Zaidi told Xinhua, ""I wouldn't use such publicity (to seek voters), because what I did (with Bush) is belonging to the people of Iraq and to the history, not for personal purposes, not in the past, not currently and not in the future.""

""This is Sa'iroon Coalition, I bet on it in my name. I am sure and confident that this coalition is the one who will achieve the aspirations of the Iraqi people,"" Zaidi concluded.

The vote of parliamentary election in Iraq will be held on May 12, as around 7,000 candidates will compete for the 329 seats in the Iraqi parliament.

This will be the first general election since Iraq's historical victory over the militant Islamic State group in December last year.","Interview: Fighting corruption, shoe thrower at George W.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Iraq remained extremely volatile throughout 2017 as the Government’s military operations shifted and political and inter-group tensions rose. National and international efforts to help people who were affected by recurrent conflicts constituted one of the largest and most complex humanitarian operations in the world.

Since 2014, almost 6 million people have been displaced by virtually non-stop conflicts across the country’s 18 governorates. In 2017 alone, 1.7 million civilians fled their homes due to a series of intense military offensives against ISIL in Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk and Anbar governorates, as well as hostilities in the disputed territories following the September referendum led by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Across the country, an estimated 11 million people required some form of humanitarian aid in 2017.

Successive, concurrent displacement cycles call for agile and flexible humanitarian assistance

Although the crisis affected the whole of Iraqi society, internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps, returnees and resident communities who were unable to access social protection services, and survivors of abuse and violence were particularly vulnerable and required critical life-saving and protection assistance.

As frontlines of military operations shifted, triggering new surges in displacement while returns continued to stabilized areas, the priority needs of these groups diversified. Displaced people required rapid and concerted response support while returnees faced dire conditions in their places of origin with grave risks of explosive hazards and a lack of basic services. Protection remained a priority throughout the year with social, ethnic and political tensions, particularly in disputed areas, putting millions at risk. Underlying all humanitarian response efforts, social cohesion and reconciliation assistance are needed to enable safe and dignified returns and co-existence after years of conflict.

2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP)

The 2017 HRP aimed to reach 6.2 million highly vulnerable people affected by the crisis in Iraq with emergency assistance and protection support sequenced across first-line, second-line and full cluster responses. Humanitarian partners committed to four Strategic Objectives: 1) reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq; 2) facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe and dignified returns; 3) help people brutalized by violence cope and recover from trauma; and 4) give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity.

The HRP received generous donor contributions of $907 million, which covered 92 per cent of the total funding requirements. The funding supported 158 humanitarian partners – including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, and RC/RC organizations – who together reached 8 million people with life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, surpassing the original target. The progress of the HRP was tracked by clusters and compiled by OCHA into monthly Humanitarian Dashboards and a dynamic online HRP monitoring dashboard.

Security and access constraints

Operating amid unpredictable security situations involving multiple security forces and other armed groups, humanitarian partners in Iraq faced frequent security threats and access constraints throughout 2017. Through civil-military-coordination and access negotiation efforts, humanitarians liaised with Iraqi security forces to ensure that protection of civilians was prioritized in military operations. Standardized procedures were established to facilitate needs assessments and deliver direct assistance across numerous checkpoints in a safe, timely and predictable manner to the extent possible.",Iraq Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Baghdad (Iraqinews.com) – An Iraqi fisherman was arrested Sunday in Dhi Qar governorate as he was found implicated in killing two schoolgirls via his locally-made landmines, a security source was quoted as saying.

“A force from the Counter-Terrorism Service raided the fisherman’s house in al-Nasiriyah district in Dhi Qar and took him to a detention center as he will face charges of manufacturing landmines that killed two schoolgirls and injured another earlier in the day,” the source told Alghad Press.

“The three students were on their way to school when the landmine exploded.”

The suspect is believed to be “manufacturing the landmines to use them in his business,” and not for terrorist attacks, the source noted. “He was referred to the authorities concerned to be interrogated,” added the source.

Following decades of fierce conflicts between Iraqi government forces and armed groups, Iraq is still heavily contaminated with landmines and other unexploded materials. The UN says nearly five million people have been displaced since Islamic State militants took over large areas of Iraq in 2014 to proclaim a self-styled “Islamic Caliphate”.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted in over 5 million internally displaced persons across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

7,iraq,"Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq. He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’

Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq.

In a 20-minute slot on the Today programme, the former Labour leader said that although military intervention was difficult, not intervening also had consequences – as Syria proved.

He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’.

Mr Blair said Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’

He also said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed.

He said: ‘They [Assad’s troops] are winning but they are winning because their outside backers are prepared to intervene and to commit and, frankly, we have not been able to.’

Mr Blair, who was the Middle East peace envoy until 2015, said that this was because of the ‘difficulties of intervention’.

He said: ‘I know that it’s extremely difficult but the problem is non-intervention is also a policy with consequences. Iraq shows you that intervening is extremely difficult but non-intervention – as we see from Syria – is also extremely difficult.

‘The problem in the Middle East is that you do have actors that are prepared to intervene and if you look at the commitment that Russia and Iran have made in Syria it is enormous.’

He added: ‘I’m simply saying that where you intervene, as we’ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s extremely difficult but where you don’t intervene, as we’ve seen in Syria, it’s also difficult.

Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’ He said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed

‘It is important to realise that if we allow it to go unchecked and unanswered then obviously the Assad regime and backers will be emboldened to act.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Blair was using Syria to justify his failed intervention in Iraq.

Referring to the Blair government’s alleged attempts to ‘spin’ intelligence reports to overstate the case for war in Iraq, he said: ‘I think he is attempting to rewrite history and thinks the British people don’t remember the dodgy dossier that got us into the situation in the first place.

‘It is a bit much for him trying to get us into another war justified by his illegal intervention in the Iraq War.

‘He was the Middle East peace envoy for a long time and that wasn’t successful because during that time [the region] was the most volatile that it has ever been.’",Tony Blair accused of using crisis in Syria to Iraq war,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5601475/Tony-Blair-accused-using-crisis-Syria-justify-invasion-Iraq.html

A Kurdistan Regional Government media official said KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani had approved the date.

The vote should elect both a parliament and a president for Kurdish regions which have gained self-rule in 1991, when a U.S-led coalition forced Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi army to withdraw from them in the wake of his eight-month occupation of Kuwait.

A federal Iraqi election, which includes the Kurdistan region, is set to take place on Saturday and its results will give clues as to the importance of the different Kurdish political parties.

Longtime Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani stepped down from the KRG presidency on Nov. 1 after the independence referendum last September.

Opposition to the ruling Kurdish establishment, represented by the Barzani and Talabani dynasties, has become more vocal over the past years, especially after the referendum.

The Iraqi government and Shi’ite militias allied to Iran dislodged Kurdish forces from the oil region of Kirkuk in retaliation for the vote, curtailing the oil income of the KRG and leading to an economic crisis in the region.

Unpaid public servants hold regular demonstrations in Kurdish cities, and new parties have been formed to challenge the Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Talabani’s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

The Kurdish elections were set for Nov. 1 but were delayed as the KRG had to deal with the conflict with Baghdad. Nechirvan Barzani has been exercising the function of the presidency since his uncle Masoud stepped down.

The current parliament was elected in 2013.

9,iraq,"Erbil; Iraq. 11 April 2018 – On 10 April, the Kurdistan Regional Government together with the United Nations and its partners held a high-level joint conference on the priority needs in the Kurdistan Region.



Over one million internally displaced people and refugees have sought safety in Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah governorates since January 2014. With the end of large-scale military offensives in late 2017, many families have been returning home and are trying to rebuild their lives. Close to 30 per cent of displaced Iraqis and nearly all of the 250,000 Syrian refugees in the country are living in the Kurdistan Region. This year, humanitarian partners estimate that approximately 736,000 people living in the Kurdistan Region, nearly half of them children, will require some form of humanitarian assistance.



In 2018, the humanitarian community, comprised of United Nations agencies, national and international NGOs and other partners, is requesting US$569 million through the Humanitarian Response Plan to respond to the needs of 3.4 million of the most vulnerable people in Iraq. In order to deliver humanitarian assistance to 600,000 of the most vulnerable people in the Kurdistan Region, the humanitarian community in Iraq is seeking US$156 million in financial support to implement activities outlined in the response plan.



“With the help of its international partners, the Kurdistan Regional Government has been able to provide critical humanitarian assistance, safety and security to over 1.5 million internally displaced Iraqis and 250,000 Syrian refugees” said Mr. Karim Sinjari, Minister of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government, while emphasising that “with continued support and collaboration of the international community, we can and are committed to do even more for the 1.1 million displaced people and 248,000 refugees still hosted in our region until safe, voluntary and dignified return is made possible.”



Additionally, Mr. Sinjari stated that “displacement is protracted and return might take years. An important step is therefore to recognize that the displaced people, refugees and the newly displaced as well as the host communities will continue to need assistance in 2018 and beyond.”



“The humanitarian crisis in Iraq has entered a new phase with the end of large-scale military operations. Nevertheless, protection continues to be the overriding humanitarian priority in Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region; thousands of people have been already or are newly displaced and families have started returning to their homes,” said Mr Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the acting Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.



“Given the scale of the existing humanitarian needs, the United Nations and its partners in the Kurdistan Region remain committed to providing essential services and assistance packages to the vulnerable population, in particular those traumatised by the violence. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to have strong international support for this year’s response plan,” added Mr Balakrishnan.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the Joint Crisis Coordination Centre have provided a conducive environment for the work of the United Nations agencies and international NGOs towards meeting the humanitarian needs of Iraqis. However, local resources remain stretched.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the humanitarian community will continue to coordinate assistance and respond to the needs and challenges faced by displaced people and returnees across the region.

10,iraq,"A close examination of the election map in Iraq and the fierce political competition for representation inside each ethnic bloc leads to the inevitable conclusion that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi crucially needs the Sunni vote and the Sunni community crucially needs Abadi.

Abadi’s interests and those of the Sunni bloc intersect in an unprecedented manner, offering an important opportunity to change the political equation in Iraq. Either Abadi buys the loyalty of the Sunni bloc in the coming elections or the Sunni bloc buys his loyalty.

As a candidate, Abadi can genuinely open up to the Sunni bloc and end the vicious circle of discrimination against the Sunnis in exchange for their vote. The Sunni bloc can take the initiative and vote en masse for Abadi’s camp and expect a return of the favour since their representatives would be part of Abadi’s coalition and in position to defend the political and social rights of the Sunni community.

Both Abadi and the Sunni bloc suffer from the lack of a wide political base to guarantee victory. As an ambitious leader, Abadi is facing fierce competition from within the Shia environment. He desperately needs a stronger popular base for a clear political advantage.

However, to come to an alliance with Sunni communities, Abadi must send clear messages and make frank promises in addition to initiating practical measures that build trust before Election Day. He must prove to the Sunnis that he is different from other Shia leaders who have sold the Sunnis the mirage of egalitarianism and partnership since 2003.

Abadi is aware of the importance of opening to the Sunni bloc but he has yet to realise that this move cannot simply be an election tactic based on his government’s “achievement” of ridding Sunni regions of the Islamic State. It must be based on a national strategy of building for the future. By necessity, that strategy must dismantle discriminatory practices against the Sunnis, end sectarian policies and implement justice and equality measures.

Unfortunately, Abadi apparently believes that opening to the Sunni bloc would damage his popularity with Shia voters. At the same time, he refuses to explicitly identify with the Shia sectarian dream in fear of damaging his image as a nationalist leader and his political project. He therefore ended up with a “dual policy” of profound partiality to the Shias and apparent courtesy to the Sunnis. No wonder he failed to seriously impress either camp.

With the Shias, Abadi is facing competition from the Popular Mobilisation Forces and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who harp on the victimisation of Shias while traditional Sunni forces harp on the victimisation of Sunnis.

Abadi could not tell both camps that a new mandate would mean the eradication of the “victimisation mentality” and convince either camp of the necessity of his project of an “egalitarian state.”

Abadi is trying to reconcile the concepts of “a Shia majority” and “national partnership.” The ideas do not mix and inevitably reproduce the current political crisis in Iraq.

Becoming prisoner of his vision, Abadi fails to realise that a genuine overture to the Sunnis within the context of a comprehensive nationalist pre-election project can win him Shia support as well because they will see him as a daring patriot capable of producing a strong national majority for post-election battles.

Abadi has two choices. He can compete within just the Shia community, where the race is fierce. Even in the scenario of a landslide victory for his coalition, his position remains shaky because he must bargain with opponents in the Shia camp to win another mandate as prime minister and form a new government.

Abadi’s second choice is to take daring and pragmatic steps before the elections to restore the dignity and confidence of the Sunnis. They could be symbolic steps carrying genuine messages of better things to come addressed to the Sunni communities, the overall Iraqi public and the international community. Doing so would reinforce Abadi’s popularity with the Sunnis, win over the voters who are still hesitant and gain a landslide victory in Sunni communities.

For this to happen, Abadi’s coalition must convince Sunni voters that its candidates are real partners capable of replacing the traditional Sunni elite. It is not an easy task because the Sunni opposition can be fierce. Sunni leaders, such as Iraqi Vice-President Osama al-Najafi in Mosul and his ally in Anbar, Khamis al-Khanjar, have formidable means and popularity.

However, Abadi, with a promise to transform the “Shia grip” on Iraq towards a better understanding of diversity inside Iraq and his intentions to put distance between Iraq and the Iranian regime plus his openness on the Arab world, has a chance to win a comfortable majority of the Sunni vote.

There is enough time before the elections for Abadi to woo both Sunnis and Shias. He must put his finger on the real problems of Iraq. The Sunni communities must no longer feel they are second-class citizens and Shia communities must no longer feel they are victimised by a powerful elite that is manipulating them to preserve its private interests and power.",Haider al-Abadi and Iraq’s Sunnis need each other badly,https://thearabweekly.com/haider-al-abadi-and-iraqs-sunnis-need-each-other-badly

13,iraq,"Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center

An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its wounded and injured warriors and their families.

Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured Brooke Army Medical Center’s Warrior and Family Support Center.

The Warrior and Family Support Center provides coordinated services to patients, next of kin and extended family members.

As Umm Qusay walked through the center, she expressed her admiration for its recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.

“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.

‘I See Great Courage Here’

“I see such great courage here helping injured soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”

Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62 year old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at age 13.

In 2014, great tragedy struck her family, at the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorists.

“ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” Umm Qusay said. “They killed children, older people, women.”

On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.

Taking Action to Rescue Others

Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with identification cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shiites how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to ISIS operatives.

“Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shiite,” according to her biography.

For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.

“It was difficult,” Umm Qusay said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”

Caring for Wounded Iraqi Service Members

Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.

When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.

“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”

For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept.

“When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage,” she said.

“We are all created by God,” Umm Qusay said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1489254/famed-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-army-medical-center/
14,iraq,"BAGHDAD — Turkish troops in northern Iraq have begun building military bases to confront the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), according to an April 3 report by Al-Hurra TV that included video footage of construction. This comes after Turkish troops reportedly advanced about 6 miles into Iraqi territory last month in order to fight the PKK in the northern regions of Iraq.

On March 29, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talked about eliminating the PKK fighters in the Iraqi city of Sinjar during a conference held by the Justice and Development Party in Ankara, despite the Turkish government’s earlier pledge to respect Iraqi sovereignty.

Erdogan also announced that Turkey “is gearing up to start cleansing Ain al-Arab [which the Kurds call Kobani], Tell Abyad, Ras al-Ain and Hasakah in Syria from terrorist elements and getting ready to enter Sinjar at any moment.”

Meanwhile, a high-level Iraqi delegation visited the Turkish capital to hold talks on the fight with the PKK, according to Jabbar al-Yawar the secretary-general of the peshmerga forces.

“The Iraqi delegation is trying to reach diplomatic solutions with the Turkish side to spare the region the scourge of military battles. The Sinjar crisis is the prerogative of the Baghdad-based central government that has sent the 15th Brigade there, fearing any interference on the part of the Turkish forces. We believe that the PKK problem must be dealt with comprehensively through Iraqi-Turkish coordination,” Yawar told Al-Monitor.

Yawar acknowledged the presence of PKK forces in the Qandil Mountains of the Kurdistan Region and some areas of Ninevah and Syrian Kurdistan.

“The peshmerga will not intervene in this crisis related to Iraqi sovereignty, especially after it withdrew from Sinjar following its liberation from the Islamic State,” he said.

Yawar ruled out any period of relative calm on the Iraqi-Syrian border before the end of the civil war in Syria. “Sinjar represents a triangle on the border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey. It is only normal for many armed factions to move in this area, taking advantage of the mountainous hinterlands,” he said.

Iraq’s concerns about Turkish threats are not limited to officials in the Kurdistan Region only. Turkmen member of parliament Jassem Mohammed Jaafar, a leader in the ruling Dawa Party in Iraq, said, “The Turkish threats are aimed at exerting pressure on the Iraqi side to speed up the process of exerting its control over Sinjar and to pressure Erbil to cut off support and contact with the PKK.”

Jaafar told Al-Monitor, “The Turkish forces have a lot to lose if they carry out a military operation in Mount Sinjar, giving the area’s rugged nature, located at hundreds of kilometers from the Turkish border. The Turkish forces will have to face the Iraqi security forces deployed there.”

He added, “Yet the Iraqi government is working on containing the crisis, and we believe the statements of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim about respecting Iraq's sovereignty [are genuine].""

Speaking at a press conference April 3, a member of parliament for Sinjar, Vian Dakhil, referenced a statement signed by a group of Iraqi lawmakers condemning Erdogan's threats to enter Sinjar. “We condemn and denounce the statements of the Turkish president threatening a military intervention in Sinjar. This violates all international laws and diplomatic norms,"" she noted.

Dakhil called on the Iraqi government to take all “necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq and the security of its borders and its citizens.” She urged the government not “to coordinate with the Turkish side, away from the legislative authority in relations to the sovereignty and security of Iraq and to work on expelling PKK elements so as to avoid Sinjar becoming an international battlefield for neighboring countries. [The government] has to discredit all justifications by neighboring countries seeking to interfere in Iraq's domestic affairs.”

Dakhil also said that Iraqi parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri had repeatedly rejected to include the Sinjar crisis on the parliament’s agenda, citing only government measures, referring to his bias toward Ankara.

Nevertheless, the situation in Sinjar appears to be different from what the Kurds are witnessing in Afrin and the rest of the Kurdish areas in Syria. This disparity is mainly due to the American presence in Iraq, Washington’s good relations with Baghdad and the large amount of trade between Iraq and Turkey. Ankara, however, is playing at brinkmanship in a bid to get rid of the PKK, especially since it has already started military operations on the ground in Syria.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said March 27 that the presence of the PKK in Iraq’s Sinjar is a threat to Turkey, and the United States is ""intending to see [the PKK] pull out of the Sinjar area.”

According to the US State Department, Tina Kaidanow, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, visited Turkey and Iraq March 28-April 3.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a press statement that the United States “understands the Turkish concerns about the PKK presence in the Kurdistan region and Iraq.”

Nauert stressed that any Turkish military operation in Sinjar must be with the approval of Iraq and in coordination with the Iraqi government.

As things stand now, there are two scenarios for Sinjar’s crisis. The first is the least likely: Turkey would launch a military operation in the Iraqi territories that might reach the Kurdish areas, namely Dahuk. However, this would affect bilateral relations in light of Baghdad’s rejection of the scenario and its likely economic repercussions. Ankara could instead opt for the second scenario: letting the Iraqi government eliminate the PKK. This means airstrikes and land operations in the Kurdistan Region, which is a big concern for the Iraqi Kurdish parties.","How will Sinjar crisis end as tensions mount between Baghdad, Ankara?",https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/sinjar-iraq-kurdistan-turkey-pkk.html

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The overall trend continues to be increased rates of internally displaced populations (IDP) returning to places of origin. Between January and March 2018 IDP numbers have decreased by around 342,500 people, from 2.6 million to 2.27 million, while the returnee population has increased by around 352,700 people, from 3.22 million to 3.57 million. Despite this, complex patterns of movement have still occurred between IDP camps and places of return. Across the country, more than 630,000 IDPs remain in camps and nearly 265,000 in critical shelter arrangements such as informal settlements or unfinished buildings. Between January and March, 5,597 newly-arrived IDP families (approximately 33,500 individuals, including around 15,700 children) were recorded entering IDP sites in Ninewa. The main reasons given by these families for their arrival to camps were firstly, financial or economic – for example, families had no access to livelihood opportunities, no money to pay rent or purchase food – and secondly, destroyed or damaged houses. In addition, military operations undertaken by the Government of Turkey in northern Iraq, including the Sinjar area, halted the return trend for the mainly Yezidi population in that area, who either left homes in the area or remained in neighbouring districts. While humanitarian partners estimate return of an additional two million people by the end of 2018, patterns in the first quarter indicate a continued need for shelter in camps, with potential for more people to choose to return to camps in cases where jobs are not available in their places of origin, or where the progress of local reconstruction is insufficient. These factors indicate that continued investment will be required in coming months to ensure adequate basic services and facilities to populations in camps, as well as continued integration across humanitarian and recovery planning and response.

In March the Government of Iraq (GoI) lifted the embargo on international flights to KRI airports after the two sides reached an agreement to restore federal authority in all international entry points in the Region, including land crossings and airports. This was followed by removal of the ban on telephone calls to/from KRI landlines and phased initiation of delivery of salaries to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) public sector employees. Non- or partial-payment of civil servant salaries, including government health, education, and social services staff over the past two years has impacted availability of public services for children. Relations between the two sides had been at their lowest in the preceding six months following the KRG’s September 2017 independence referendum.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018
16,iraq,"In what is being called the most momentous foreign policy move of Donald Trump’s presidency, the president announced on May 8, 2018 that he’s withdrawing the United States from its historic 2015 nuclear accord with Iran. The end of the nuclear deal means a new beginning for economic sanctions against the country—sanctions that, over the decades, have cratered Iran’s economy and destabilized relations throughout the Middle East.

Technically, the United States and Iran have never been at war. But by imposing unilateral sanctions, the U.S. has long wielded money as a weapon in a shadow war that’s been raging since 1979. Here’s how sanctions went from punitive measure to status quo:

The Iran hostage crisis led Jimmy Carter to mount the first U.S. sanctions against Iran

The history of American sanctions against Iran began with a bang when a group of Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking more than 60 United States citizens hostage and sparking an international crisis. The 444-day-long hostage crisis tanked Jimmy Carter’s presidency, ushered in a new political era for Iran, and helped skyrocket Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a revolutionary cleric who objected to United States interference, to international significance.

It also created a state of permanent deadlock between the U.S. and Iran—a tense standoff characterized by a pattern of sanctions over direct negotiations.

VIDEO: Iran Hostage Crisis Explore the chain of events that set off the Iran hostage crisis – an diplomatic standoff that would keep Americans on edge and shape the course of Jimmy Carter’s presidency.

President Carter swiftly imposed sanctions on Iran after the hostage crisis began, cutting off sales of Iranian oil and freezing Iranian assets. These measures did nothing to help along diplomatic negotiations for the release of the prisoners, so on April 7, 1980, 212 days after the crisis began, he announced even more drastic measures. The U.S. cut off diplomatic relations with Iran, imposed economic sanctions including cutting off food aid, closed Iranian institutions within the U.S., and embargoed all imports from Iran.

“I am committed to the safe return of the hostages,” Carter told the nation. “The steps that I have ordered today are those that are necessary now. Other action may become necessary if these steps do not produce the prompt release of the hostages.”

They didn’t. As the hostage crisis continued, Carter okayed a disastrous rescue mission that had to be aborted after eight service members died in a sandstorm. The hostages were only released after Carter lost a bid for reelection.

VIDEO: Iran-Iraq War The eight-year war between Iran and Iraq cost billions of dollars in damages and claimed millions of lives, but resulted in no real benefit to either side.

Ronald Reagan designated Iran a “state sponsor of terrorism” after the Beirut barracks bombing

Though American hostages were released just hours after President Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, the U.S. didn’t let go of its Iran sanctions. The U.S. had agreed to revoke all trade sanctions with Iran as part of the agreement that released the hostages, but didn’t immediately roll back all of the economic sanctions imposed by Carter.

Meanwhile, Iran was invaded by Iraq in 1980, prompting an eight-year war. At first, the United States maintained a neutral stance. But over time, the U.S. began to support Iraq. In 1983, a truck bomb attack ripped through a Marine compound in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. service members. The Reagan administration suspected that Iran was at least partially behind the attacks, which were carried out by terrorists.

This led the United States to designate Iraq as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” a moniker that gave the U.S. the ability to further sanction Iran. The designation halted loans and foreign aid; it also restricted sales of “dual-use items”—technologies and materials that could possibly be used for warfare in addition to their intended use.

The Reagan administration secretly provided weapons and funds to Iran

In public, Reagan continued a strong sanctions stance against Iran on the national stage. But behind the scenes, his administration officials were funneling money and arms to Iran in exchange for Americans taken hostage by Iran-backed terrorists in Lebanon despite the arms embargo—in what would later become known as the Iran-Contra Affair.

Though the secret program wouldn’t become public until 1987, it secretly helped shape the Reagan administration’s policy toward Iran. In hearings about the scandal, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North claimed he had participated in the arms deals with the full knowledge of President Reagan and admitted to moving funds from the Iran arms deals to the Contras in Nicaragua. However, Reagan denied that he had exchanged arms for hostages, instead insisting that he had participated in the program as a way to encourage “moderate” Iranians to support the United States.

In 1987, the United States purchased Iranian oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Congress was appalled and scolded Reagan. Under political pressure, Reagan outlawed all imports from the U.S. to Iran. However, he painted the move as a necessary response to Iranian aggression. “We are taking these economic measures only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian Government,” Reagan told the nation in a statement about the trade embargo.

Bill Clinton banned U.S. companies from making oil deals with Iran

After the Iran-Iraq war ended, President Clinton developed a policy of “dual containment” designed to capitalize on the now diminished power of Iraq and Iran. The policy centered on what was becoming the most important geopolitical asset of the 1990s—the oil in the Persian Gulf. Since the U.S. could not overthrow Iran, Clinton’s administration decided to use oil to weaken it.

In 1995, Conoco and Iran announced a $1 billion contract that would give the U.S.-owned company unprecedented access to two Iranian oil fields. The Clinton administration leapt into action, claiming the contract threatened national security. Conoco backed out of the deal and Clinton banned U.S. companies from participating in oil deals with Iran. This was further consolidated by the 1996 Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, a law that called for the U.S. to establish “multilateral trade sanctions” against Iran. Sanctions against Iran were now the law of the land.

The Iranian economy tanks after worldwide sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program

In 2002, the international community learned that Iran had been enriching uranium and was developing a nuclear program. The United States had long suspected Iran of a covert nuclear program, and when President George W. Bush dubbed the country part of an “axis of evil” after the 9/11 attacks, relations between the two countries began to degrade.

Soon, the U.S. was working to freeze the assets of individuals and businesses it suspected of aiding Iran. As the international community put pressure on Iran, the U.S. tightened the grip of its existing sanctions, enforcing them more vigorously and levying large penalties on banks and individual that didn’t comply with rigorous rules.

Sanctions tightened even further under President Obama, who targeted Iranian petroleum purchases, banks, and automobile industries in response to Iran’s nuclear activities. Ultimately, the United States forbade almost all trade with Iran. It was joined by much of the international community, which levied significant economic and political sanctions.

As a result, what was left of the Iranian economy tanked. Healthcare, banking, and other critical sectors suffered, and Iran’s currency, the rial, plummeted. Sanctions pushed up prices within Iran, spurring inflation and unemployment. The sanctions are “severely weakening the middle class, breaking the collective will and marginalizing democratic voices while solidifying the power of the ruling elite,” wrote Iranian-American filmmaker Beheshteh Farshneshani in the New York Times in 2013.

These devastating effects only shifted once President Obama announced a historic pact that lifted nuclear sanctions in exchange for an end to Iran’s nuclear program in 2015. The deal gave Iran the ability to sell oil on international markets and effectively opened up the global markets that had slowly closed over decades of sanctions.

Now that President Trump has canceled the nuclear deal—which he called a “horrible one-sided deal” that did not bring peace—sanctions will once again be instituted, and the shadow sanctions war seems poised to begin all over again.","The Tense History of U.S.-Iran Sanctions, from the Hostage Crisis to the Nuclear Deal",http://www.history.com/news/iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-facts-hostage-crisis

The designation halted loans and foreign aid; it also restricted sales of “dual-use items”—technologies and materials that could possibly be used for warfare in addition to their intended use.

The Reagan administration secretly provided weapons and funds to Iran

In public, Reagan continued a strong sanctions stance against Iran on the national stage. But behind the scenes, his administration officials were funneling money and arms to Iran in exchange for Americans taken hostage by Iran-backed terrorists in Lebanon despite the arms embargo—in what would later become known as the Iran-Contra Affair.

Though the secret program wouldn’t become public until 1987, it secretly helped shape the Reagan administration’s policy toward Iran. In hearings about the scandal, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North claimed he had participated in the arms deals with the full knowledge of President Reagan and admitted to moving funds from the Iran arms deals to the Contras in Nicaragua. However, Reagan denied that he had exchanged arms for hostages, instead insisting that he had participated in the program as a way to encourage “moderate” Iranians to support the United States.

In 1987, the United States purchased Iranian oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Congress was appalled and scolded Reagan. Under political pressure, Reagan outlawed all imports from the U.S. to Iran. However, he painted the move as a necessary response to Iranian aggression. “We are taking these economic measures only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian Government,” Reagan told the nation in a statement about the trade embargo.

Bill Clinton banned U.S. companies from making oil deals with Iran

After the Iran-Iraq war ended, President Clinton developed a policy of “dual containment” designed to capitalize on the now diminished power of Iraq and Iran. The policy centered on what was becoming the most important geopolitical asset of the 1990s—the oil in the Persian Gulf. Since the U.S. could not overthrow Iran, Clinton’s administration decided to use oil to weaken it.

In 1995, Conoco and Iran announced a $1 billion contract that would give the U.S.-owned company unprecedented access to two Iranian oil fields. The Clinton administration leapt into action, claiming the contract threatened national security. Conoco backed out of the deal and Clinton banned U.S. companies from participating in oil deals with Iran. This was further consolidated by the 1996 Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, a law that called for the U.S. to establish “multilateral trade sanctions” against Iran. Sanctions against Iran were now the law of the land.

The Iranian economy tanks after worldwide sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program

In 2002, the international community learned that Iran had been enriching uranium and was developing a nuclear program. The United States had long suspected Iran of a covert nuclear program, and when President George W. Bush dubbed the country part of an “axis of evil” after the 9/11 attacks, relations between the two countries began to degrade.

Soon, the U.S. was working to freeze the assets of individuals and businesses it suspected of aiding Iran. As the international community put pressure on Iran, the U.S. tightened the grip of its existing sanctions, enforcing them more vigorously and levying large penalties on banks and individual that didn’t comply with rigorous rules.

Sanctions tightened even further under President Obama, who targeted Iranian petroleum purchases, banks, and automobile industries in response to Iran’s nuclear activities. Ultimately, the United States forbade almost all trade with Iran. It was joined by much of the international community, which levied significant economic and political sanctions.

As a result, what was left of the Iranian economy tanked. Healthcare, banking, and other critical sectors suffered, and Iran’s currency, the rial, plummeted. Sanctions pushed up prices within Iran, spurring inflation and unemployment. The sanctions are “severely weakening the middle class, breaking the collective will and marginalizing democratic voices while solidifying the power of the ruling elite,” wrote Iranian-American filmmaker Beheshteh Farshneshani in the New York Times in 2013.

These devastating effects only shifted once President Obama announced a historic pact that lifted nuclear sanctions in exchange for an end to Iran’s nuclear program in 2015. The deal gave Iran the ability to sell oil on international markets and effectively opened up the global markets that had slowly closed over decades of sanctions.

Now that President Trump has canceled the nuclear deal—which he called a “horrible one-sided deal” that did not bring peace—sanctions will once again be instituted, and the shadow sanctions war seems poised to begin all over again.","The Tense History of U.S.-Iran Sanctions, from the Hostage Crisis to the Nuclear Deal",https://www.history.com/news/iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-facts-hostage-crisis
