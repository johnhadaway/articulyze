With national elections coming up later this week, the commander of Fort Drum has a lot of optimism for the future of Iraq.

Acknowledging the country’s well-known struggles in its past, Maj. Gen. Walter E. Piatt says that Saturday’s elections are a good sign that perhaps the worst is now behind Iraq.

“There are signs of success,” General Piatt said in a telephone interview on Friday from Iraq.

The general spoke about the status of Iraq and what he’s seeing while he and more than 500 Fort Drum soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division’s headquarters unit are serving during a nine-month mission there.

Deployed this spring, they were joined by members of the New York National Guard.

They are serving with international forces at a critical time in ensuring the country’s stability, including Saturday’s elections.

Gen. Piatt said he could not say how many Fort Drum soldiers are in Iraq or their exact location.

He spoke shortly before 12:30 p.m. Friday, seven hours behind Watertown’s time.

The general said Fort Drum’s mission is going well.

He’s been to Iraq several times over the years, but the situation is definitely improving while U.S. and coalition forces continue to work with the Iraqi Army to rebuild the country, he said.

“It’s a unique mission that’s evolving,” he said.

Iraq was liberated from the Islamic State just months ago. ISIS no longer holds any ground after being chased out of Mosul and other areas of the country.

“They’re hiding, they’re on the run but are still pursued,” he said.

He’s proud of the work that the U.S. and coalition forces were able to achieve.

The overwhelming defeat of ISIS left the country and its people with hope for peace, he said.

While there are many security, economic and societal problems still to maneuver through, Iraq continues to move slowly but surely toward recovery.

The Iraqi people can now return to their homes, jobs and schools, Gen. Piatt said.

And they will be headed to the ballot boxes on Saturday to choose Iraq’s parliamentary government.

The election — the second since the country’s occupation — of 329 parliamentarians will determine whether Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s government will continue.

The general said that campaigning and polling are in full swing, with the election just days away.

“It’s a very exciting time to be in Iraq,” he said.

The country’s reconstruction and keeping peace remain the biggest jobs, however.

“I’m optimistic,” he said.

Asked about rumors of the Fort Drum division headquarters coming home early, Gen. Piatt would only say that it will return only when the mission has been completed.",General Piatt is hopeful for Iraq’s future with elections this week,http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/news03/general-piatt-is-hopeful-for-iraqs-future-with-elections-this-week-20180506
1,iraq,"Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center

An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its wounded and injured warriors and their families.

Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured Brooke Army Medical Center’s Warrior and Family Support Center.

The Warrior and Family Support Center provides coordinated services to patients, next of kin and extended family members.

As Umm Qusay walked through the center, she expressed her admiration for its recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.

“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.

‘I See Great Courage Here’

“I see such great courage here helping injured soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”

Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62 year old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at age 13.

In 2014, great tragedy struck her family, at the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorists.

“ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” Umm Qusay said. “They killed children, older people, women.”

On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.

Taking Action to Rescue Others

Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with identification cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shiites how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to ISIS operatives.

“Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shiite,” according to her biography.

For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.

“It was difficult,” Umm Qusay said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”

Caring for Wounded Iraqi Service Members

Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.

When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.

“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”

For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept.

“When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage,” she said.

“We are all created by God,” Umm Qusay said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1489254/famed-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-army-medical-center/

3,iraq,"The most influential organisation representing British Jews could soon have its first leader from a Mizrahi – or Arab – background.

Edwin Shuker, one of four candidates campaigning to be the next president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was born in Baghdad before fleeing persecution and arriving in Britain as a refugee.

Shuker, whose first language is Arabic, says the board, which has played a crucial role in recent controversies about antisemitism in Britain, must be more diverse and inclusive, and is in urgent need of a change of culture to pay more attention to grassroots concerns within the community. “I want to be a voice for the community, and the authority of that voice comes from carrying all parts of the community, their concerns and aspirations, with you,” he told the Observer.

Shuker was born into a dwindling Jewish community in Iraq in 1955. Amid rising tensions in 1971 he escaped with his parents, grandmother and two sisters through the Kurdish mountains into Iran before coming to the UK as a United Nations refugee. He later lived in Israel for six years.

He said his bond with the Middle East was “total and continuing”: “My identity is as a Jew from Arabia, and an Arabic and Hebrew speaker.”

Acknowledging that his background could be a challenge in next Sunday’s election, he said: “It would be a huge cultural step for British Jewry to accept an oriental with a foreign accent to be their president. But I hope we are mature enough for that.”

Shuker praised the actions of Jonathan Arkush, the BoD’s current president, who has joined forces with the Jewish Leadership Council to forcefully tackle Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the Labour party.

“When Jews stand together, we are a powerful force, and that has been demonstrated in recent weeks. But I don’t want our brilliant, creative, vibrant community to be defined by antisemitism or by our enemies.”

There were issues of great importance at grassroots level in the community, such as the inclusion of women and the challenges of an ageing community, he said.

“We need to use the example of the antisemitism campaign to demonstrate how much clearer our voice is when we leave our differences behind. There are people who feel their voice is not heard and their presence is irrelevant. I want to change that culture.”

The BoD leadership was “top down, and I want to make it bottom up,” he said. “We need to listen and unite, and not only when the community is facing an outside danger, but also on issues that are just as important to the welfare of British Jews but aren’t getting as much attention.”

The current campaign against antisemitism in the Labour party was of critical importance, “but I don’t think it can be sustained with such intensity in the long term. We need to look beyond the next headline to other methods of combating antisemitism, such as education in schools.

“We need to build alliances with as wide a range of British society as possible – political parties, Christian, Muslim and other faith communities – against every form of racism. Let’s use this crisis as an opportunity to root out any attack on religion, gender and so on.”

He said criticism of the actions of the Israeli government was legitimate, but that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement “crosses a red line” into antisemitism because it sought to delegitimise the state of Israel itself.

There were individuals within the UK Jewish community who took issue with Israeli government policies and actions, he said. But it was the job of the BoD president to represent the whole community, and it would be inappropriate for the leadership to publicly criticise Israel. There are four candidates in the BoD election.",Iraq-born refugee could become first Arabic speaker to head Britain’s Jews,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/05/iraqi-refugee-edwin-shuker-british-jews-first-leader-arab-origin

AL-KHALDIYEH, Iraq – Agence France-Presse

While the election campaign is in full swing elsewhere in Iraq, the country’s displaced camps holding hundreds of thousands of people barely register on the radars of those running for office.

In “Camp Seven” in the western Anbar province not a single campaign poster can be seen appealing to those who have the right to cast their ballot at the parliamentary vote on May 12.

The rows of U.N. tents are part of nine sprawling encampments in the region housing thousands of people who fled the devastating fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Some five months after the Iraqi government declared victory over the jihadists they remain stuck in the desert camp -- and apparently ignored by the country’s politicians.

For many of the residents the disinterest shown by the election candidates is mirrored by their own antipathy to those running.

“I have no confidence in them,” says Umm Maher, who fled her home in Qaim, a former ISIL-stronghold.

Heightening her anger -- and that of others here -- is the destruction of their homes and the disappearance of male relatives they say were either killed or seized by security services during the battle against ISIL.

“If they want our votes, they can give us back our children and our homes,” adds the 50-year old, who doesn’t know the fate of her husband and son.

Going into the polls, Iraq is only just starting to recover from the years of ISIL dominance over swathes of the country and the punishing fight to end it.

Out of a total displaced population of around two million people, some 285,000 are registered to vote, according to the electoral commission.

166 polling stations are being installed in 70 displaced camps, spread across eight of the country’s 18 provinces.

In a bid to encourage the displaced to vote, election officials say identification requirements have been eased for those in the camps.

But despite that, Umm Maher is not the only female resident of “Camp Seven” who won’t be voting, due to the scar left behind by the violence.

“I will not vote until my eldest son returns,” says 47-year-old Umm Ahmed, who hasn’t seen her 20-year-old child since he was seized three years ago.

“Besides, nobody has come to ask after us,” adds the former resident of Saqlawiya, another ex-ISIL stronghold, a black veil partially covering her face.

Politicians admit that despite the potential votes that could be won in the camps, few have ventured there.

“The campaign is absent in the camps and no candidate goes there, even though the votes of the displaced are important,” confirms Hikmat Zeydan, from the Rally for the Unity of Iraq, fielding five candidates in Anbar.

Many “are afraid of finding themselves in a difficult situation, because they have done nothing to help the return of the displaced.”

One candidate, running on a list for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s Shiite-dominated Victory Alliance in Samarra, north of Baghdad is blunt in explaining why he has stayed away from two nearby camps.

“We have not put up any posters and did not move [around there] because most families are Daesh,” alleges Jassem al-Joubouri, using an Arabic term for ISIL.

Elsewhere in the country some have made an effort at trying to represent the interests of the displaced.

Abdel Bari Abbas, fled his home west of the former ISIL bastion of Mosul, and is now standing as a candidate.

As he runs his campaign from Baharka camp, in Arbil province in northern Iraq, he insists his experiences give him a unique insight into how to help.

“My family and the majority of Mosul residents have had many struggles. It is necessary to have a candidate who will make their voices heard,” says the 48-year-old Arabic teacher.

“The problems will not be solved without us and I promised myself that even if I am elected, my family and I will stay in the camp.”",Iraq’s displaced forgotten in elections,http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/iraqs-displaced-forgotten-in-elections-131405
5,iraq,"Erbil; Iraq. 11 April 2018 – On 10 April, the Kurdistan Regional Government together with the United Nations and its partners held a high-level joint conference on the priority needs in the Kurdistan Region.



Over one million internally displaced people and refugees have sought safety in Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah governorates since January 2014. With the end of large-scale military offensives in late 2017, many families have been returning home and are trying to rebuild their lives. Close to 30 per cent of displaced Iraqis and nearly all of the 250,000 Syrian refugees in the country are living in the Kurdistan Region. This year, humanitarian partners estimate that approximately 736,000 people living in the Kurdistan Region, nearly half of them children, will require some form of humanitarian assistance.



In 2018, the humanitarian community, comprised of United Nations agencies, national and international NGOs and other partners, is requesting US$569 million through the Humanitarian Response Plan to respond to the needs of 3.4 million of the most vulnerable people in Iraq. In order to deliver humanitarian assistance to 600,000 of the most vulnerable people in the Kurdistan Region, the humanitarian community in Iraq is seeking US$156 million in financial support to implement activities outlined in the response plan.



“With the help of its international partners, the Kurdistan Regional Government has been able to provide critical humanitarian assistance, safety and security to over 1.5 million internally displaced Iraqis and 250,000 Syrian refugees” said Mr. Karim Sinjari, Minister of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government, while emphasising that “with continued support and collaboration of the international community, we can and are committed to do even more for the 1.1 million displaced people and 248,000 refugees still hosted in our region until safe, voluntary and dignified return is made possible.”



Additionally, Mr. Sinjari stated that “displacement is protracted and return might take years. An important step is therefore to recognize that the displaced people, refugees and the newly displaced as well as the host communities will continue to need assistance in 2018 and beyond.”



“The humanitarian crisis in Iraq has entered a new phase with the end of large-scale military operations. Nevertheless, protection continues to be the overriding humanitarian priority in Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region; thousands of people have been already or are newly displaced and families have started returning to their homes,” said Mr Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the acting Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.



“Given the scale of the existing humanitarian needs, the United Nations and its partners in the Kurdistan Region remain committed to providing essential services and assistance packages to the vulnerable population, in particular those traumatised by the violence. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to have strong international support for this year’s response plan,” added Mr Balakrishnan.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the Joint Crisis Coordination Centre have provided a conducive environment for the work of the United Nations agencies and international NGOs towards meeting the humanitarian needs of Iraqis. However, local resources remain stretched.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the humanitarian community will continue to coordinate assistance and respond to the needs and challenges faced by displaced people and returnees across the region.

The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at former US President George W Bush is running for parliament.

Muntader al-Zaidi is standing in next week's elections as a candidate for a list founded by the influential Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr.

Mr Zaidi said he wanted to fight the corruption that plagues Iraq.

His protest during a visit by Mr Bush to Baghdad in 2008 made him a hero for many Iraqis. But he was convicted of assaulting a foreign leader.

He served nine months of a 12-month prison sentence. After his release, he alleged that he had been tortured by Iraqi officials and guards, and that he needed treatment for broken teeth, bone fractures and other injuries.

Mr Zaidi was working for al-Baghdadiya TV when he attended a news conference between President Bush and then Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

As the two leaders spoke, he stood up and threw both his shoes at Mr Bush to show his anger at what he considered the injustice of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the violence that followed it.

He shouted: ""This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog. This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Arabs protested against the detention of Mr Zaidi after the shoe-throwing incident

Mr Bush managed to dodge the shoes and in an interview afterwards he insisted he did not harbour any ill feeling. ""It was amusing - I've seen a lot of weird things during my presidency, and this may rank up there as one of the weirdest,"" he said.

After his release from prison, Mr Zaidi quit journalism and moved to Europe, where he set up a humanitarian organisation to help Iraqi war victims.

Mr Zaidi vowed that if he was elected to the Iraqi parliament on 12 May he would ""sweep away the thieves and corrupt people, prosecute those who steal Iraqi money, and stop public money being wasted"".

He is a candidate on the Saeroun (Marching Towards Reform) list, which is an alliance between Moqtada Sadr's Istiqama (Integrity) party and six mostly secular groups, including the Iraqi communist party.

The list is one of 88 contesting the polls and is seen as a challenger to the Victory and Reform list of Shia Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi; State of Law, led by Mr Maliki, who is also Shia; al-Fatah (Conquest), which comprises the political wings of militias in the Shia-led paramilitary Popular Mobilisation force; and Iraqi Solidarity, founded by Sunni Vice-President Osama al-Nujaifi.

Some 24 million people are eligible to vote in the polls. The 328 seats in parliament will be allocated according to a proportional representation system, although 46 seats are reserved for Kurds and at least a quarter of the seats for women.

8,iraq,"ERBIL (Kurdistan 24) – The Iraqi Supreme Federal Court has announced a postponement of hearings for a lawsuit against the Kurdistan Region's oil exports to international markets, the court’s spokesperson said on Sunday.

“The Supreme Federal Court held hearings regarding a lawsuit against the Kurdistan Region’s direct oil export from the oil produced in the Region and has decided to defer it to June 3,” Ayas al-Samuk, a spokesperson for the federal court, said in a statement.

According to the statement, the hearing was postponed at the request of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to allow them a chance to present their case.

The statement noted that Judge Medhat al-Mahmoud chaired the federal court hearing. It added that the lawsuit, initiated by Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi against the KRG’s Natural Resources Minister, Ashti Hawrami, was reviewed during the hearing.

Luaibi’s lawsuit requests that the KRG implement and apply the provisions of the constitution and relevant laws and hand over all the Kurdistan Region’s produced oil to the Federal Ministry of Oil, Samuk explained.

“The representatives of the Iraqi Prime Minister [Haider al-Abadi], Iraqi Finance Minister [Salman Jumaili], Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region [Nechirvan Barzani], in addition to their functions, participated in the hearing as third persons,” the spokesperson added.

The KRG began to export its oil to international markets independently through Turkey’s Ceyhan port in 2014 after the Federal Government of Iraq cut the Region’s national budget share at the start of the same year.

The export of oil sparked tensions between Erbil and Baghdad. Oil revenue distribution has been one of the most pressing issues between the two governments.

In advance of national elections next weekend, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is the front-runner here, and if he ultimately prevails, he will make political history as a Shiite politician in this overwhelmingly ­Sunni city.

The electoral strength of Abadi and his ticket in Mosul, the country’s second-largest city, underscores his nationwide popularity and bodes well for his reelection, which U.S. officials have repeatedly indicated they would like to see.

But beyond that, Abadi’s success in a place that had been the jewel of the Islamic State — an extremist Sunni group — would represent an opening for cooperation between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in a country long bedeviled by sectarian grievance and violence.

When campaigning officially kicked off last month for the May 12 elections, the boulevards of this city were instantly lined with candidate posters. But it was Abadi’s face, smiling softly and ubiquitous on the vehicle-jammed streets, that stood out as both familiar and entirely unexpected.

For the first time since Iraq began electing a legislature in 2006, a Shiite politician is headlining an electoral ticket in Mosul. Abadi’s list is named “Nasr,” or “Victory,” a reference in part to his role in ending the city’s Islamic State trauma by orchestrating the military campaign that liberated the city last year.

Mosul may now be the ultimate proving ground for Abadi’s message of nationalism over sect.

“Abadi is a symbol of shedding sectarianism,” said Rana al-Naemi, 44, an English teacher from Mosul running on the prime minister’s list. “The people of Iraq are ready for this.” Alluding to the traditional colors worn by Sunni and Shiite clerics, she added, “Sectarianism is what destroyed us — whether it was a white turban or a black turban.”

Once considered a weak and unremarkable leader who stumbled into power in the midst of the Islamic State blitz that conquered about one-third of Iraq, Abadi has been campaigning on a message of national unity in hopes of breaking the cycle of sectarian fighting that has marked Iraq’s politics since the U.S. ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Abadi’s popularity has soared since he managed the successful military campaign to claw back Iraqi cities from the Islamic State while artfully juggling the interests of the United States and Iran. He also won plaudits from many Iraqis when he dispatched troops to block an attempted secession by Kurds in the north late last year.

“One thing that we see consistently is that Prime Minister Abadi has a more balanced degree of support across all regions and across all ethnic and sectarian religious groups,” said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Iraq’s internal politics.

For the United States, Abadi’s presence in Mosul and other Sunni areas, such as Fallujah, is reassuring. He has worked closely with Washington in the fight against the Islamic State while maintaining cordial ties with Iran and reestablishing relations with regional powers such as Saudi Arabia.

The war against the Islamic State has significantly altered the political map in Iraq, where Shiites are the majority.

In previous elections, one or two major Shiite coalitions dominated the vote and subsequently the formation of the government.

This year, the support of the Shiite political establishment is fragmented among Abadi and challengers old and new. His predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, though severely diminished because of losses to the Islamic State, is headlining a ticket that is running on a traditional platform of Shiite supremacy.

Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the powerful Badr Organization, is the face of a new coalition called “Fatah,” or “Conquest,” which represents Shiite militias that helped defeat the Islamic State, earning much public support. Many of those militias, including Badr, are backed by Iran, and a key element of their campaign has been urging the expulsion of U.S. forces from Iraq. In a sign of confidence, a number of the militias are running candidates in Mosul even though Abadi kept many of them out of the city during the battle because of their ultra-sectarian leanings.

With those major blocs essentially splitting the vote in Iraq’s Shiite heartland, any candidate hoping to become prime minister must run well in Mosul and other Sunni areas.

The province of Nineveh, of which Mosul is the capital, is quickly emerging as one of the hottest contests in the election. This year, 940 candidates have been registered, compared with just 455 in 2014.

Nineveh holds 31 seats in Iraq’s upcoming 329-member parliament, second only to Baghdad’s 69. Iraq’s parliament elects the prime minister and president, and those 31 votes could prove critical to Abadi winning a second term.

His Nasr coalition is the only one fielding candidates in all 18 provinces, and many observers have concluded that he is the only candidate who can credibly claim to be a genuine centrist leader — even though his rhetoric of making a fresh, nonsectarian start has also been embraced by many of his opponents.

“His attitude is one that he will be more successful with a larger variety of constituencies than many of his opponents,” the U.S. official said.

Rasha Al Aqeedi, a political researcher at the Dubai-based al-Mesbar Studies and Research Center and a Mosul native, said that Iraq’s minorities are unlikely to be enthusiastic about the prospect of another Shiite head of government but that Abadi remains the only candidate with the credentials to garner votes among Sunnis.

“If you compare him to everyone else, he does stand out for sure,” she said.

But there are major roadblocks Abadi must overcome in Mosul. Voter apathy runs deep among the population after the grueling nine-month battle against the Islamic State.

In western Mosul, the situation is dire. The Old City neighborhood, where some of the most intense fighting took place, remains largely leveled, with some families living in the skeletons of what used to be their homes.

On one street, a single election poster was hung next to a sign warning of unexploded ordnance in the area — drawing a scornful smile from a police officer stationed at the corner. “These politicians have no shame,” he said.

Across the Tigris River in eastern Mosul, there are barely any reminders of the fight. New markets have popped up at a startling pace, and cratered roads and bullet-pocked buildings have been repaired. But the restoration has been largely self-financed by the city’s residents, who are becoming impatient with the central government’s slow response.

“There will be no change — if there was going to be any change, it would have happened already,” said Bilal Mohamed, a 41-year-old restaurant owner who said he will abstain from voting. “These candidates are paying attention to Mosul now, but I’m certain once they get elected, they will forget about us.”

But he said that if Abadi wins, it “will be the best possible outcome in a bad overall scenario.”

Saleh Elias, a 34-year-old journalist, said he does not expect much to change after the elections but will vote in the hopes of registering his voice. Not doing so has been disastrous in the past, he said.

“This city has always rejected the political process, and what we ended up with was the Islamic State,” Elias said.

Abadi has stocked his ticket in Mosul with both new and old faces. Most notable is Khaled al-Obeidi, a career politician whom Abadi named as his first defense minister in 2014. Obeidi is a Mosul native widely respected for his role in the battle against the Islamic State. He retains his popularity despite being ousted by parliament in 2016 during a corruption probe in which he was never formally charged.

Mohsen Abdelkader, 37, a law professor also running on the ticket, said Abadi and Obeidi had inherited a “military that was in shambles” and restored it so it could eventually liberate Mosul.

Abdelkader added that they had treated all Iraqis as equal under the law. “People in Mosul are starting to feel like they are citizens just like the people of Baghdad, and this is because of the leadership of Abadi and Obeidi,” he said.

Abadi has also recruited local officials who gained prominence during the battle against the Islamic State. Basma Baseem, the head of the Mosul local council, was vocal during the conflict, drawing attention to the plight of civilians in the crossfire.

“Nasr is not just an election coalition. It’s an ambitious project that will start after the elections,” she said.

But Abadi’s popularity has also made him a prime target for his opponents.

Wissal Ali, a former member of parliament, is running on a purely Sunni ticket led by Osama al-Nujaifi — one of Iraq’s current vice presidents and a former speaker of parliament from ­Mosul.

On the campaign trail, Ali has accused Abadi’s coalition of being no different from that of the Shiite militias: outsiders interested only in votes and not in Mosul’s well-being. She said the legacy of the Islamic State, often known in Arabic as Daesh, has left the city politically vulnerable.

“People understand that the gangs of Daesh destroyed the city but also gave a chance for parties with outside agendas to gain a foothold in the city,” she said.

Army Reserve Sgt. Tracy McKithern loves dogs.

Last year, when McKithern found a little female white stray dog sniffing around camp here during her yearlong deployment to Iraq -- only one thing was going to happen.

“I fell in love with her immediately,” she said.

McKithern, a combat photographer from Tampa, Florida, with the 982nd Combat Camera Company (Airborne), was stationed at the Kurdistan Training Coordination Center, a multinational military organization responsible for the training of peshmerga and Iraqi security forces in and around Irbil, from April 2017 to January 2018.

The little dog and her mother had been wandering around the base for weeks, McKithern found out. Stray dogs are common in Iraq, and the culture is not kind to them. Erby and her mom were kicked and hit with rocks daily and starving. Her brother and sister had disappeared before McKithern arrived.

‘Sweetest Little Soul’

Despite her rough experiences with humans to that point, Erby ran right up to McKithern the first time she held out her hand to the shaky little pup covered in scratches and dirt.

“She loved everyone,” McKithern said of Erby. “She is the sweetest little soul. She came up to me immediately -- probably hungry, but gentle. I think she was looking for love more than anything else.”

McKithern, together with soldiers from the Italian and German armies her unit was partnered with, started caring for the little dog. They named her Erby Kasima, after nearby Irbil, the largest city in northern Iraq, and “Kasima” being the Arabic name for beauty and elegance.

The coalition soldiers would go on convoys into the surrounding countryside to train Iraqi army units six days a week, with McKithern documenting the missions. Every time they returned to the base, Erby was waiting.

“She ran up to our convoy every day,” McKithern recalled. “She was so tiny she would fall and trip all over herself to get to us.”

Getting Healthy

It didn’t take long for Erby and her mom to realize that, not only were they safe around McKithern and her Italian and German friends, but these humans would feed them, too. As the weeks went by, the dogs’ wounds began to heal and they started putting on weight.

Eventually, the growing pup took to sleeping on the step outside McKithern’s quarters.

As the end of her deployment approached, McKithern started to wonder how she could ever leave Erby behind when she went back to the states and lamented about it on her Facebook page.

“One night I posted a pic of us on Facebook, with a caption that read something like, ‘I wish I could take her home,’” McKithern recalled. “I went to sleep, woke up and my friends and family had posted links to various rescue groups. I reached out to one of them, the nonprofit Puppy Rescue Mission, and they responded immediately. We sent them $1,000 and they set up a crowd fund to get the rest. We needed an additional $3,500.”

Generous Donors, Friends’ Help

The immediate outpouring of generosity was astounding, McKithern said.

“We raised the rest of the money very quickly, and most of it was from complete strangers!” she said.

McKithern had many preparations to make before she left Iraq so Erby could eventually follow her. Vaccinations, documentation, travel arrangements -- all had to be done somehow, in a war zone, while she fulfilled her military duties. It seemed like an overwhelming task in an already overwhelming situation. Even though she now had the funding, McKithern began to lose hope that she’d have the time and energy to complete needed details so Erby could join her in the states.

That’s when several Kurdish and German officers that McKithern knew stepped in to help. They offered to complete anything she couldn’t get done and get Erby onto the plane. With their help, McKithern returned home and Erby was set to follow her several weeks later.

Change in Plans

McKithern had only been home in Florida for about a month when she received orders for a 67-day mission to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. She was to depart March 11, the very day Erby was scheduled to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.

“I couldn’t believe it!” McKithern said. “But I’m a soldier first, and my commander received an email looking for volunteers.” McKithern said the gunnery exercise at Fort McCoy was an important mission and so she deployed to Wisconsin.

Reunion

However, McKithern’s husband, Army Sgt. Wes McKithern, who’s also a combat cameraman for the 982nd, met Erby at the airport in New York and drove her home to Tampa, where she’s waiting patiently to be reunited with her rescuer.

In a few short weeks, McKithern will fly home from Fort McCoy to be with Erby at last. It will be the end of a 16-month journey that’s taken her across the world to find a little dog in a war zone -- and with the help of generous strangers, a nonprofit dog rescue, and soldiers from three different armies -- bring her all the way back to become part of a family.

“I can’t believe it,” McKithern said. “It feels like a miracle is happening.”",Face of Defense: Soldier Looks Toward Reunion With Canine Friend From Iraq,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1512594/face-of-defense-soldier-looks-toward-reunion-with-canine-friend-from-iraq/

15,iraq,"May 12 is more than the deadline for Donald Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement. It’s also the day that Iraqis are due to go to the polls to vote for a new parliament. And while the election has been largely overlooked amid the tension over the U.S. president’s decision, it’s hard to understate the significance of the ballot for Washington and Tehran.

Iran is seeking to create a pro-Iranian government in Iraq so Tehran is better placed to hit back at the United States should Trump re-impose sanctions. The defeat of Islamic State in Iraq has been a major victory for U.S.-backed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, but Iran is working towards shifting the political balance in its own favor – to force an early exit of U.S. forces, to end the strategic partnership between Iraq and the United States, and to secure Iraq’s support for its regional agenda. Such an outcome would undermine stability in Iraq and would further strengthen Iran in the Middle East at the expense of the United States.

Washington’s influence has waned in the region, even as Iran has secured substantial leverage in Syria, Lebanon and to some extent Yemen. Iraq is one country where the United States has made gains. Despite a dramatic loss of influence early in the Obama administration, which was compounded by the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011, the United States made a comeback in Iraq in 2014, providing intensive support to defeat Islamic State.

As the Iraqi parliamentary elections approach, Iran is intensifying its efforts to cultivate wide-ranging political partnerships in the country. Trump may yet decide to stay in the accord if the European Union manages to identify new sanctions that could satisfy him without endangering the deal. However, the failure to reach an agreement to date raises the likelihood that Trump will end sanctions relief for Tehran.

Iran may respond by restarting its nuclear weapons program, but this is a high risk strategy that could prompt Trump’s hardline advisers to pursue air strikes on weapons and research facilities in Iran. To avoid such strikes, Iran may instead seek other ways to hit back.

For example, if Iran succeeds in building a loyal political coalition that takes power in Baghdad, that new government could eject U.S. troops from Iraq – something that Iraqi political figures close to Iran have long wanted. As recently as March, a small majority of the Iraqi parliament called on the Iraqi government to set out a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The surprising vote by a largely pro-Iranian group of parliamentarians was seen as an effort by Iran to demonstrate its political leverage in Iraq.

The proportional representation system that governs Iraq’s elections means there will be no clear winner after the vote. Instead, once the results are announced, several electoral blocs will scramble to build a coalition large enough to take power. The two largest blocs are likely to be Nasr (“Victory”), led by Prime Minister Abadi, and Fatah (“Conquest”), led by pro-Iranian former militia leader Hadi al-Amiri.

Iran is seeking to persuade, among others, the major Iraqi Kurdish political parties, the KDP and the PUK, to support Fatah. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq has seen a collapse in its revenues and its political leverage since it lost control of oil-rich Kirkuk and other disputed territories to federal government control following the Kurdish independence referendum last September. Iran is exploiting Kurdish disappointment over the lack of U.S. support over the ballot by offering the Kurds a new political deal with Baghdad that it says Fatah will deliver. Although these efforts are being led by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is responsible for expanding Iran’s networks of influence in the region, other parts of the Iranian government are also supporting this outreach. A high-level Iranian delegation travelled to the Kurdish capital of Erbil this month for a conference designed to bolster trade ties between Iran and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The message to the Kurdish parties is clear: the path to economic vitality and political autonomy goes through Tehran, not Washington.

If Fatah is able to build momentum in its effort to build a governing coalition, it could quickly attract support from political leaders keen to secure a ministerial position. Iran may even be able to persuade Abadi to form an alliance with Fatah, in a bid to stay on as prime minister. In such a scenario, the Iranians would try to ensure that Abadi is simply a figurehead for a staunchly pro-Iranian government. Abadi briefly joined the Fatah coalition earlier this year, before changing his mind and running a separate electoral coalition.

We may even see small, Iranian-backed militia groups attempting to attack U.S. troop positions in Iraq. This tactic was widely used by Iran to undermine the United States after the invasion of Iraq, and Iranian-backed militias have occasionally threatened to target U.S. troops since 2014. Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, which is part of the Fatah coalition, threatened to attack U.S. forces engaged in the liberation of Mosul. Directly targeting U.S. troops is a risky strategy, however, that Iran may avoid for fear of retaliation on Iranian soil.

The premature withdrawal of U.S forces from Iraq would halt the critical effort to rebuild Iraq’s security forces. This would enable Iran to strengthen the position of the Popular Mobilization Units, a recently formalized militia force subject to substantial Iranian influence. The continued undermining of Iraq’s national security forces could threaten stability in Iraq’s liberated areas, where local populations often chafe under the control of the Shi’ite-dominated units.

Iran may also seek Iraqi support for its regional agenda by strengthening the participation of Iraqi militias in the Syrian civil war, isolating Iraq from the Gulf states, and denying the United States access to a strategic foothold in the region. In these efforts, Iran will face little effective push back from U.S.-aligned regional powers. Although there has been much press coverage of the warming relationship between Iraq and the Gulf States, these new ties are only skin deep. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have created much fanfare with high level visits, but, unlike Iran, they have not done the painstaking groundwork needed to build relationships of influence across the political spectrum.

The United States has made great strides in reviving a neglected political relationship between Baghdad and Washington, and restoring at least superficial relationships between Iraq and the Gulf Cooperation Council states. This rare success story could be undermined by an Iran that sees Iraq as a place where it can strike back.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Iraq remained extremely volatile throughout 2017 as the Government’s military operations shifted and political and inter-group tensions rose. National and international efforts to help people who were affected by recurrent conflicts constituted one of the largest and most complex humanitarian operations in the world.

Since 2014, almost 6 million people have been displaced by virtually non-stop conflicts across the country’s 18 governorates. In 2017 alone, 1.7 million civilians fled their homes due to a series of intense military offensives against ISIL in Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk and Anbar governorates, as well as hostilities in the disputed territories following the September referendum led by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Across the country, an estimated 11 million people required some form of humanitarian aid in 2017.

Successive, concurrent displacement cycles call for agile and flexible humanitarian assistance

Although the crisis affected the whole of Iraqi society, internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps, returnees and resident communities who were unable to access social protection services, and survivors of abuse and violence were particularly vulnerable and required critical life-saving and protection assistance.

As frontlines of military operations shifted, triggering new surges in displacement while returns continued to stabilized areas, the priority needs of these groups diversified. Displaced people required rapid and concerted response support while returnees faced dire conditions in their places of origin with grave risks of explosive hazards and a lack of basic services. Protection remained a priority throughout the year with social, ethnic and political tensions, particularly in disputed areas, putting millions at risk. Underlying all humanitarian response efforts, social cohesion and reconciliation assistance are needed to enable safe and dignified returns and co-existence after years of conflict.

2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP)

The 2017 HRP aimed to reach 6.2 million highly vulnerable people affected by the crisis in Iraq with emergency assistance and protection support sequenced across first-line, second-line and full cluster responses. Humanitarian partners committed to four Strategic Objectives: 1) reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq; 2) facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe and dignified returns; 3) help people brutalized by violence cope and recover from trauma; and 4) give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity.

The HRP received generous donor contributions of $907 million, which covered 92 per cent of the total funding requirements. The funding supported 158 humanitarian partners – including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, and RC/RC organizations – who together reached 8 million people with life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, surpassing the original target. The progress of the HRP was tracked by clusters and compiled by OCHA into monthly Humanitarian Dashboards and a dynamic online HRP monitoring dashboard.

Security and access constraints

Operating amid unpredictable security situations involving multiple security forces and other armed groups, humanitarian partners in Iraq faced frequent security threats and access constraints throughout 2017. Through civil-military-coordination and access negotiation efforts, humanitarians liaised with Iraqi security forces to ensure that protection of civilians was prioritized in military operations. Standardized procedures were established to facilitate needs assessments and deliver direct assistance across numerous checkpoints in a safe, timely and predictable manner to the extent possible.",Iraq Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Baghdad (Iraqinews.com) – An Iraqi fisherman was arrested Sunday in Dhi Qar governorate as he was found implicated in killing two schoolgirls via his locally-made landmines, a security source was quoted as saying.

“A force from the Counter-Terrorism Service raided the fisherman’s house in al-Nasiriyah district in Dhi Qar and took him to a detention center as he will face charges of manufacturing landmines that killed two schoolgirls and injured another earlier in the day,” the source told Alghad Press.

“The three students were on their way to school when the landmine exploded.”

The suspect is believed to be “manufacturing the landmines to use them in his business,” and not for terrorist attacks, the source noted. “He was referred to the authorities concerned to be interrogated,” added the source.

Following decades of fierce conflicts between Iraqi government forces and armed groups, Iraq is still heavily contaminated with landmines and other unexploded materials. The UN says nearly five million people have been displaced since Islamic State militants took over large areas of Iraq in 2014 to proclaim a self-styled “Islamic Caliphate”.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted in over 5 million internally displaced persons across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

There’s a decent chance that tearing up the Iran deal, as Trump seems likely to do next week, will lead to escalating confrontation with Iran throughout the Middle East, diplomatic isolation of the United States, and military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities that would likely have to be repeated periodically in the absence of any nuclear agreement or verification regime. I respect Reuel Marc Gerecht’s honesty in his recent Atlantic pieces advocating withdrawal from the Iran deal, and his willingness to accept the logical consequences of his approach, or at least the serious risk that these could be the consequences. Gerecht says one reason America must insist on additional demands of Iran is because otherwise we will never know “whether the clerical regime is cheating outside the surveilled sites.” I’ll admit that no inspection regime could ever be perfect. But the current one that provides for 24/7 surveillance cameras at declared sites and gives the International Atomic Energy Agency the right to go wherever else it needs to go—including to military bases, by the way—is not just good but a whole lot better than no inspection regime at all, which is where I fear Gerecht’s policy prescriptions would lead. Once America bombs Iranian facilities, and they kick all the inspectors out, how are we going to be sure they’re not cheating then? Iran is a big country with lots of scientists, engineers, labs, mountains, cities, and military bases. How will we know what they’re up to? Will we send in inspectors like the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq, and then, if they refuse, invade to change the regime? It’s not as if we haven’t been in a similar situation before. Related Stories Trump Is Setting America on an Unpredictable Course in the Middle East

The Iran Deal Is Strategically and Morally Absurd

Don't Count on Regime Change to Stop Iran's Nuclear Program

The Nuclear Deal Makes America Complicit in Iranian Crimes I also think Gerecht overestimates our ability to persuade America’s international partners— whose support is indispensable if in containing Iran—to join us in supporting an American list of nonnegotiable demands. I, too, would have liked to see a continuation of the international prohibition on Iranian ballistic missile activity that was codified in 2010 in UN Security Council Resolution 1929. But guess what? Beyond the sad reality that our international partners never really enforced it anyway, they only agreed to that ban in the first place to press Iran to accept a nuclear deal, and once the deal was agreed they were unwilling to support the Obama administration’s efforts to include the ban in a new resolution. So we should have walked away from the nuclear deal over that? Unless that somehow led the Russians, Chinese, and Europeans to cave, and Iran to agree, today Iran would be a whole lot closer to a nuclear-weapons capability, if not already there. America can and should continue to sanction Iran’s long-range missile activity and seek an agreement to constrain it—but if you’re willing to have the United States go to war over that you should understand we’ll be doing so almost alone, and probably for a long time. I’m also puzzled by the assertion that the JCPOA prevents America from standing up to Iran in areas outside the nuclear realm. In fact, both at the talks and afterwards, we in the Obama administration specifically preserved the ability to do so, including by confronting Iran in the region and sanctioning it over terrorism, ballistic missile development, and human rights violations, and the United States has done all of those things both under Obama and Trump. Even since the deal, by the way, the United States does not invest in Iran, trade with Iran, or have diplomatic relations with Iran, while it gives and sells hundreds of billions of dollars of defense equipment to Iran’s regional rivals, and cooperates with them on intelligence and missile defense and military operations in places like Syria and Yemen. So the notion that the United States has somehow “tilted” to Iran since the JCPOA was concluded makes no sense.

Gerecht is right of course that Trump’s “new Iran strategy” announced in October wasn’t very new. It basically consisted of a lot of bombastic language and a designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions under new authorities, even though it had already been designated multiple times over under other authorities—a mostly symbolic move. It appears that even people like Generals James Mattis and H.R. McMaster, not known for being soft on Iran, opposed even designating the IRCG as a Foreign Terrorist Organization; striking Iranian targets in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon; or re-imposing all the secondary economic sanctions that would have led to a major clash with all America’s international partners. Perhaps they had an appreciation of the costs of U.S. military action in the Middle East, or just realized that without international support, American economic sanctions are not very effective. The Iran deal does not prevent America from “doing something serious” in Syria. Even consistent with the deal, the U.S. could, if it wanted, conduct airstrikes against regime or Iranian targets, provide unlimited military support to the anti-Assad opposition, and sanction a wide range of Iranian leaders or entities for propping up Assad. There are reasons the U.S. might not want to do all those things, but it’s not because the JCPOA proscribes them. And anyway who says arms control agreements and containing regional aggression are incompatible? Didn’t Ronald Reagan negotiate the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 1) and sign the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Moscow, all while vigorously resisting it militarily, diplomatically, and ideologically around the world?

I disagree with former ambassador Fred Hof’s contention—so widely taken for granted—that it was Obama’s desire to reach a nuclear deal that prevented him from intervening in Syria. I have enormous respect for Hof, one of the most decent people in Washington. We worked closely together in government, including at the 2012 Geneva conference where we tried to negotiate an international agreement that would require Assad to step aside. But on this point Hof—like Gerecht and the many others who make this claim—is just wrong. The idea that Barack Obama needed some extracurricular motivation for wanting to avoid a U.S. military intervention in Syria is absurd. He also opposed putting U.S. troops into Libya and arming Ukraine—is the pursuit of an Iran deal the explanation for those policies as well? As I have noted elsewhere, while at the White House I went to hundreds of meetings on both Iran and Syria and never once heard anyone argue against intervention in Syria on the basis that it might interfere with negotiations with Iran. In fact, the Obama administration officials most focused on getting an Iran deal—including John Kerry, Bill Burns, Jake Sullivan, and Wendy Sherman—all thought we should do more in Syria and that doing so would bolster, not undermine, the U.S. negotiating position on Iran. As for the notion that the JCPOA is responsible for fueling Iranian meddling in the region, Gerecht mocks the predictions by some of my former colleagues that most of the deal’s financial benefits would largely go to domestic spending. What about General Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who last year testified that, in fact, the “preponderance of the money [from sanctions relief] has gone to economic development and infrastructure” in Iran? Was that also just Obama administration propaganda? Personally I have always thought we should acknowledge that some of those revenues—Iran’s access to some of its own money that had been held in frozen foreign accounts—can and will be put to nefarious purposes. But the Iranian meddling in question is just not that costly, money is fungible, and available budgetary resources has never been the long pole in the tent. (If it were, by the way, we should be in a better situation now, since the big fall in oil prices since 2014 has hurt Iran’s budgetary picture more than the increased ability to sell oil has helped it.) Iran, whose influence in Iraq inevitably resulted from the toppling of Saddam Hussein, exploits the conflicts taking place in the region and benefits from real and perceived repression of Shiites in neighboring states. That’s a major problem, and the United States should work with its partners militarily and diplomatically to help contain it—but it wasn’t caused by the JCPOA and wouldn’t be fixed by abandoning it.

Otherwise, what exactly is the alternative? A major U.S. military deployment, like in Iraq from 2003 to 2012? Backing an insurgency like in Syria since 2013 or Afghanistan in the 1980s? Or maybe to avoid ground forces, we could just bomb them from the air like the Saudis are doing in Yemen? Three years into that effort, the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, the Iran-backed Houthis are stronger than ever, al-Qaeda is benefiting from the chaos and civilian casualties, criticism of America’s Saudi ally is mounting in the United Nations and the U.S. Congress, and most important of all, Iran’s role in Yemen is growing, not weakening. There are no easy answers, but this method of confronting Iran is not doing the trick. I’m always puzzled when critics of the Iran deal bring up North Korea as if it shows what happens when you have a nuclear weapons deal, since it actually shows what happens when you don’t. The 1994 Agreed Framework provided modest economic benefits to North Korea in exchange for eliminating its means to produce nuclear weapons. Critics of that deal, including in a newly elected Republican Congress, objected to the provision of fuel oil and light-water reactors to Pyongyang, insisting, just as today regarding Iran, that its bad behavior should not be rewarded and we should insist on a “better deal.” Then, after years of North Korea’s foot-dragging, the incoming Bush administration said in 2001 that the Agreed Framework was no longer on the table and turned instead to isolation of a country already far more economically squeezed than Iran is today. The result is the nuclear-armed and ICBM-building North Korea that poses such a problem now.",Trump Is About to Provoke an Unnecessary Crisis With Iran,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/iran-deal-nuclear-crisis/559730/

Baghdad (Iraqinews.com) – Iraqi and Jordanian foreign ministers discussed on Sunday forming a joint military committee to protect borders from any possible terrorist threat, Elaph news website reported.

Speaking at a press conference along with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi, top Iraqi diplomat Ibrahim al-Jaafari stressed the importance of “forming this committee as soon as possible” to control joint borders and protect them from terrorist groups.

“It is wrong to believe that the terrorist threat was eliminated from a certain country,” Jaafari told reporters, warning that “the threat of terrorism and Daesh (Islamic State) still exists.”

The Iraqi foreign minister admitted that both Baghdad and Amman are now involved in talks to “overcome their differences, and develop and deepen bilateral relations.”

He further called on Jordanian investors to play a role in reconstructing Iraq during the coming period. “When the anti-terror in Iraq is over, we will commence the reconstruction phase immediately, but the remnants of war will take a long period of time.”

Jaafari extended thanks to Jordanian authorities for their support for Iraq over the past period and their cooperation to arrest and bring to trial Iraqi criminals living in the kingdom.

The Jordanian foreign minister, for his part, reiterated that Jordan “will continue to help and support Iraq, and step up mutual coordination at the security and defense levels to face the threat of terrorism.”

Speaking about the Syrian crisis, Safadi stressed his country’s unshakable stance towards maintaining Syria’s independence and unity, and ending the humanitarian disaster there.

22,iraq,"Water levels on four major reservoirs across the globe have reached such low levels they are threatening ‘Day Zero’ – the point at which the authorities have to turn off supplies.

Last month Cape Town was saved from reaching 'Day Zero' when a dramatic 60 per cent reduction in consumption warded off disaster.

But according to a report by the Resource Watch organisation, Morocco, India, Iraq and Spain are facing a similar crisis after water levels have fallen dramatically, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.

Morocco:

The Al Massira dam in Morocco provides water for big cities as well as the country's vital agricultural sector

Resource Watch says the surface area of Al Massira dam, the second-largest reservoir in Morocco, has shrunk by more than 60 percent over the last three years.

The last time Al Massira was at this level was between 2005 and 2008, when more than 700,000 Moroccans were affected by drought and grain production fell by 50 percent.

In common with its north African neighbours, Morocco suffers from recurring droughts and in 2016 was hit by the worst drought in three decades.

As well as the agricultural sector, Al Massira supplies water to many cities, including Casablanca.

India:

In India, the falling water levels of two crucial reservoirs have led to fierce argument about how to allocate water.

The Narmada River flows from east to west through the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, then through the state of Gujarat before emptying into the Arabian Sea.

Poor rains in 2017 have led to a clash how much water should be released from the Indira Sagar reservoir to the downstream Sardar Sarovar reservoir in Gujarat.

The Sardar Sarovar reservoir provides drinking water for 30 million people, almost half of Gujarat’s total population, and the irrigation for more than a million farmers.

Poor rainfall has led to a fierce argument about how much water to release from the Indira Sagar dam (pictured)

But releasing more water from the Indira Sagar dam would have further reduced the its reservoir’s supply during the critical summer period.

‘India is a highly water-stressed country and has suffered through many debilitating droughts in recent years,’ say Resource Watch.

‘These dry spells have devastated farmers, even driving some to commit suicide.'

Iraq:

The reservoir of the Iraq’s Mosul Dam has shrunk 60 percent in surface area from the late 1990s to present day.

According to Resource Watch, there are several reasons behind this including poor water resource management by the Iraqi government and intense regional droughts.

Water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir have fallen by 60 per cent, with a Turkish hydroelectric project to blamed by many

But Turkey’s Southeast Anatolia Project and its 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants across the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are cited by many as a key driver behind the reduced river flow into Iraq.

Spain:

Spain, along with its neighbour Portugal, is fighting a drought that is drying up rivers, ruining crops and sparking wildfires.

The surface area of the Buendia dam reservoir shrunk by 60 percent over the last five years, says Resource Watch,

Levels that low were last seen in 2006, when the country was going through its worst drought in 60 years.

Experts warn that droughts will likely become more frequent and severe in this region, and water stress is projected to increase in many parts of Spain by 2040.","Morocco, India, Iraq, Spain could be next for Day Zero water crisis",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5626133/Could-Morocco-India-Iraq-Spain-face-Day-Zero-water-crisis.html

Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve and its partners continued to strike Islamic State of Iraq and Syria targets in designated parts of Syria and Iraq between April 27-May 3, conducting 27 strikes consisting of 35 engagements, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve officials reported today.

Strikes in Syria

Yesterday, coalition military forces conducted a strike consisting of one engagement against ISIS targets near Abu Kamal.

On May 2, coalition military forces conducted four strikes consisting of four engagements against ISIS targets near Abu Kamal. The strikes destroyed an ISIS storage facility.

On May 1, coalition military forces conducted five strikes consisting of five engagements against ISIS targets:

-- Near Abu Kamal, four strikes damaged an ISIS-held building.

-- Near Shadaddi, a strike engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed two headquarters buildings.

On April 30, coalition military forces conducted 10 strikes consisting of 12 engagements against ISIS targets:

-- Near Abu Kamal, six strikes engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed an ISIS staging area, a tunnel and a headquarters.

-- Near Dayr Az Zawr, a strike engaged an ISIS tactical unit.

-- Near Shadaddi, three strikes engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed an ISIS vehicle, two headquarters buildings and damaged three ISIS-held buildings.

On April 29, coalition military forces conducted two strikes consisting of two engagements against ISIS targets:

-- A strike took place near Dayr Az Zawr.

-- Near Shadaddi, a strike engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed an ISIS vehicle.

Strikes in Iraq

There were no reported strikes in Iraq May 2-3.

On May 1, coalition military forces conducted three strikes consisting of eight engagements against ISIS targets:

-- Near Huwijah, two strikes destroyed 31 ISIS tunnel systems and six caves.

-- Near Rutbah, a strike destroyed an ISIS bunker.

On April 30, coalition military forces conducted two strikes consisting of three engagements against ISIS targets:

-- Near Mosul, a strike destroyed an ISIS tunnel system.

--Near Rutbah, a strike destroyed an ISIS fighting position.

There were no reported strikes in Iraq on April 29.

Part of Operation Inherent Resolve

These strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The destruction of ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria also further limits the group's ability to project terror and conduct external operations throughout the region and the rest of the world, task force officials said.

The list above contains all strikes conducted by fighter, attack, bomber, rotary-wing or remotely piloted aircraft; rocket-propelled artillery; and ground-based tactical artillery, officials noted.

A strike, as defined by the coalition, refers to one or more kinetic engagements that occur in roughly the same geographic location to produce a single or cumulative effect.

For example, task force officials explained, a single aircraft delivering a single weapon against a lone ISIS vehicle is one strike, but so is multiple aircraft delivering dozens of weapons against a group of ISIS-held buildings and weapon systems in a compound, having the cumulative effect of making that facility harder or impossible to use. Strike assessments are based on initial reports and may be refined, officials said.

The task force does not report the number or type of aircraft employed in a strike, the number of munitions dropped in each strike, or the number of individual munition impact points against a target.","Military Strikes Target ISIS Terrorists in Syria, Iraq",https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1512507/military-strikes-target-isis-terrorists-in-syria-iraq/
24,iraq,"Due to popular demand, Israel on Sunday launched a Facebook page geared for the citizens of... Iraq.



That’s right. Iraq, that Arab state still formally at war with Israel, and over whom Iran has tremendous sway.





According to Yonatan Gonen, who heads the Arabic branch in the Foreign Ministry’s digital diplomacy division, the decision to create a special Facebook page for Iraqis – called “Israel in the Iraqi Dialect” – was made after numerous requests by some of the ministry’s Arabic Facebook page followers asked for information more geared toward the Iraqi audience.The ministry’s Arabic page has some 1.5 million followers, and Gonen said many of the positive responses over the last few months have come from Iraq, amid requests for more content and information.Which led to the decision to launch the new page.Gonen said the ministry does not currently have any plans to open specialized pages geared toward other Arab countries, though the decision to do so will depend on the responses that this page generates. He said that the most positive responses on the Arabic language page have come from countries such as Morocco, Iraq, and even from some of the Persian Gulf countries, amid less positive countries from Israel’s immediate neighbors.“We are seeing an openness and an understanding that Israel is an established fact,” he said.Gonen theorized that the less positive responses coming from Israel’s neighbors has to do with the fact that some of these countries have been at war with Israel for years, and that this has generated negative attitudes that are more deeply rooted than in countries that do not immediately border the Jewish state, and which have harbored large Jewish populations in the past.The ministry’s Arabic Facebook page was launched in 2011 in an effort to go over the heads of the traditional media and reach audiences in the Arab world and present them with a picture of Israel they are not usually exposed to. The posts on this page generally focus on the non-political, and deal with “softer” subjects – such as arts, culture, sports, technology and religion. This is part of the ministry’s digital diplomacy outreach.According to Gonen, the Arabic-language page has the most followers of any of the ministry’s pages in various languages. For instance, it far outpaces the English page, which has some 530,000 followers; the Spanish page, with 433,000 followers; and the Farsi page, with some 184,000 followers.The ministry characterizes the new Iraqi page as a kind of “digital embassy” that will focus on content related to the Iraqi audience, be it stories about the Iraqi Jewish community in Israel, or “points of similarity between Israeli and Iraqi cultures.”Foreign Ministry director-general Yuval Rotem said the page is intended to provide a response to “the growing interest that the Arab world is showing in Israel. Social networks allow us to reach this audience – our neighbors – and present the true face of Israel, in a way that was not possible before.”Rotem said the decision to create a page geared toward Iraq was made in light of the rich history of Jews in Iraq, and the interest Iraqis have shown toward Israel in recent years.“We believe that the digital embassy will promote fruitful and positive dialogue and lead to a deeper acquaintance between Israelis and Iraqis from all walks of Iraqi society – Sunnis, Shi’ites, Kurds and other population groups,” he said.Linda Menuhin, who was born in Iraq and serves as an adviser to the ministry’s digital diplomacy division, said one reason for what she termed “growing sympathy toward Israel” among some in Iraq is a “growing sense of nostalgia” for the Jewish community that contributed so heavily to the development of modern Iraq.“There is no doubt that we are witnessing an earthquake in Iraqi public opinion compared to when I lived in Iraq during the Ba’ath period, during which the Jews suffered from hostile treatment and harassment,” she said.The ministry, which wrote on its page that the history of Jews in Mesopotamia extends back some 2,500 years, explained that the purpose of the page is to “create a fruitful communication and dialogue between the Israeli and Iraqi peoples and to deepen feelings of friendliness, rapprochement and understanding in order to serve both peoples and to show the true face of Israel.”","Israel reaches out to the citizens of Iraq, via Facebook",https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-reaches-out-to-the-citizens-of-Iraq-via-Facebook-553650

• In March, UNICEF continued repairs to the water network in Mosul’s Old City in coordination with the Directorate of Water Ninewa. As a prolonged interim measure, UNICEF has ensured continued water trucking services which currently reach around 50,220 individuals in West Mosul.

• Upgrade of WASH facilities for 41 schools was completed in March, improving access to sanitation for 22,480 students (12,280 girls).

• World Water Day celebrations on 22 March engaged 27,150 children in schools, internally displaced people camps, and non-camp locations through awareness-raising and information activities.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The overall trend continues to be increased rates of internally displaced populations (IDP) returning to places of origin. Between January and March 2018 IDP numbers have decreased by around 342,500 people, from 2.6 million to 2.27 million, while the returnee population has increased by around 352,700 people, from 3.22 million to 3.57 million. Despite this, complex patterns of movement have still occurred between IDP camps and places of return. Across the country, more than 630,000 IDPs remain in camps and nearly 265,000 in critical shelter arrangements such as informal settlements or unfinished buildings. Between January and March, 5,597 newly-arrived IDP families (approximately 33,500 individuals, including around 15,700 children) were recorded entering IDP sites in Ninewa. The main reasons given by these families for their arrival to camps were firstly, financial or economic – for example, families had no access to livelihood opportunities, no money to pay rent or purchase food – and secondly, destroyed or damaged houses. In addition, military operations undertaken by the Government of Turkey in northern Iraq, including the Sinjar area, halted the return trend for the mainly Yezidi population in that area, who either left homes in the area or remained in neighbouring districts. While humanitarian partners estimate return of an additional two million people by the end of 2018, patterns in the first quarter indicate a continued need for shelter in camps, with potential for more people to choose to return to camps in cases where jobs are not available in their places of origin, or where the progress of local reconstruction is insufficient. These factors indicate that continued investment will be required in coming months to ensure adequate basic services and facilities to populations in camps, as well as continued integration across humanitarian and recovery planning and response.

In March the Government of Iraq (GoI) lifted the embargo on international flights to KRI airports after the two sides reached an agreement to restore federal authority in all international entry points in the Region, including land crossings and airports. This was followed by removal of the ban on telephone calls to/from KRI landlines and phased initiation of delivery of salaries to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) public sector employees. Non- or partial-payment of civil servant salaries, including government health, education, and social services staff over the past two years has impacted availability of public services for children. Relations between the two sides had been at their lowest in the preceding six months following the KRG’s September 2017 independence referendum.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018
