By Paul Welch

Germany, France, United Kingdom, China, Russia and the European Union agree with the International Atomic Energy Agency's findings that Iran is currently abiding by the Iran nuclear agreement's requirements.

In his U.S. visit, French President Macron has proposed negotiations on a ""new deal"" aimed at curbing Iran's military power and regional activities, to exist alongside the three-year-old Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This new deal would go further, imposing a permanent check on those nuclear activities, while also limiting the country's development of ballistic activities, and its military operations across the region, particularly in Syria. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reinforced Macron's position with President Trump.

France and Germany publicly opposed the Iraq invasion. Regretfully, our Congress, with a majority in both parties in the Senate, enacted the Iraq War Resolution. The primary rationale was the supposed existence of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Despite the pleas of Hans Blix, the United Nations chief weapons inspector, that his team only needed six more months to certify whether Iraq had nuclear weapons or not, President George W. Bush ""let loose the dogs of war."" Four thousand, four hundred and eighty-six American military were killed. Somewhere between 165,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died. Huge numbers of wounded and disabled people on both sides had their lives altered forever. ISIS arose from the smoldering ashes of war- ravaged Iraq.

Blix said ""critical thinking"" was missing in the US decision for war in Iraq. We know about the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the toxicity of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard, their support of Hezbollah, Hamas and Syria's Bashar Assad, and their ballistic missiles. To spur critical thinking, I cite the following:



* Our 1953 coup against Iran's popular, democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, and its aftermath, is the principal reason Iran calls us the Great Satan.

* The toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime turned Iraq from a foe to an ally of Iran.

* Iran holds Israel and the United States responsible for the millions of Palestinians in refugee camps and under Israeli occupation.

* Prior to the 2017 protests, Iranians held four major protests (followed by harsh repressions), which eventually led to a more moderate parliament. The nuclear agreement is a positive for President Hasan Rouhani, a moderate, who last year won re-election with 57 percent of the vote. The radical Islamic Revolutionary Guard wants the agreement scrapped.

* Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'a Iran are engaged in a Middle East power struggle. Iran has an elected Parliament with final power held by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, head of state and commander-in-chief of the military and Islamic Revolutionary Guard. On the other hand, the House of Saud rules Saudi Arabia absolutely, with long standing Wahhabi clerical input. Saudi Arabia has a horrible human rights record, is the home country for 15 of the 9/11 bombers, exports its radical version of Islam throughout the world and is arguably the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. Remarkably, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has targeted Qatar for an embargo because of their support of terrorism. He also states Saudi Arabia will pursue nuclear weapons if Iran does so with the cancellation of the Iran Nuclear Agreement.

Currently, Salman's war in Yemen is now the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people -- three-quarters of the population -- in desperate need of aid and protection, according to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. Guterres calls Yemen ""the stupid war"" which is in nobody's best interest.

* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls the nuclear agreement a ""historic mistake."" Let's remember Netanyahu helped push us into the disastrous Iraq War. Netanyahu is also at odds with his security team over the agreement. Additionally, Israel is a nuclear power.

* Like Netanyahu, President's Trump's judgment differs from his military advisers. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told senators that it was in America's interest to stick with the agreement. Both Marine Gen. James Dunford, and Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the chairman and vice chairman respectively of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported to Congress that Iran is adhering to its Agreement's obligations.

* North Korea will certainly recalculate the viability of a U.S. commitment if the agreement is canceled.

The Afghanistan War, the Wars in Syria and Iraq, the Yemen War, Russian military moves in Eastern Europe/Syria and their electoral meddling, China's claims in the South China Sea, the African jihadist terrorist conflicts, climate enhanced natural calamities, mass killings in our country and trillion dollar deficits are some of the daunting challenges we face. Adding a nuclear-armed Iran to this list is not a reasonable option.

Recommendations:

* Listen to our allies who counsel prudence. We can't afford another Iraq War.

* Adopt the two-part plan proposed by Macron.

* Support the Iranian people by keeping their internet connections alive and allowing Iranians to enter the U.S.

* Be determined to employ dialogue to minimize and end armed conflicts.

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The humanitarian situation in Iraq remained extremely volatile throughout 2017 as the Government’s military operations shifted and political and inter-group tensions rose. National and international efforts to help people who were affected by recurrent conflicts constituted one of the largest and most complex humanitarian operations in the world.

Since 2014, almost 6 million people have been displaced by virtually non-stop conflicts across the country’s 18 governorates. In 2017 alone, 1.7 million civilians fled their homes due to a series of intense military offensives against ISIL in Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Kirkuk and Anbar governorates, as well as hostilities in the disputed territories following the September referendum led by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Across the country, an estimated 11 million people required some form of humanitarian aid in 2017.

Successive, concurrent displacement cycles call for agile and flexible humanitarian assistance

Although the crisis affected the whole of Iraqi society, internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps, returnees and resident communities who were unable to access social protection services, and survivors of abuse and violence were particularly vulnerable and required critical life-saving and protection assistance.

As frontlines of military operations shifted, triggering new surges in displacement while returns continued to stabilized areas, the priority needs of these groups diversified. Displaced people required rapid and concerted response support while returnees faced dire conditions in their places of origin with grave risks of explosive hazards and a lack of basic services. Protection remained a priority throughout the year with social, ethnic and political tensions, particularly in disputed areas, putting millions at risk. Underlying all humanitarian response efforts, social cohesion and reconciliation assistance are needed to enable safe and dignified returns and co-existence after years of conflict.

2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP)

The 2017 HRP aimed to reach 6.2 million highly vulnerable people affected by the crisis in Iraq with emergency assistance and protection support sequenced across first-line, second-line and full cluster responses. Humanitarian partners committed to four Strategic Objectives: 1) reach as many people in need as possible across Iraq; 2) facilitate and advocate for voluntary, safe and dignified returns; 3) help people brutalized by violence cope and recover from trauma; and 4) give options to families to live in Iraq in dignity.

The HRP received generous donor contributions of $907 million, which covered 92 per cent of the total funding requirements. The funding supported 158 humanitarian partners – including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, and RC/RC organizations – who together reached 8 million people with life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, surpassing the original target. The progress of the HRP was tracked by clusters and compiled by OCHA into monthly Humanitarian Dashboards and a dynamic online HRP monitoring dashboard.

Security and access constraints

Operating amid unpredictable security situations involving multiple security forces and other armed groups, humanitarian partners in Iraq faced frequent security threats and access constraints throughout 2017. Through civil-military-coordination and access negotiation efforts, humanitarians liaised with Iraqi security forces to ensure that protection of civilians was prioritized in military operations. Standardized procedures were established to facilitate needs assessments and deliver direct assistance across numerous checkpoints in a safe, timely and predictable manner to the extent possible.",Iraq Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

• In March, Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Consortium partners reached 8,955 individuals across five governorates, including 4,836 children, ensuring provision of immediate supplies to highly at-risk families.

• Between January and March, UNICEF has delivered teaching and learning supplies for 63,514 children (25,569 girls) and supported access to psychosocial services (PSS) for 56,706 children (26,651 girls), and access to specialised services for a total of 4,751 children (2,152 girls).

• Through government and NGO partners, as of March, UNICEF had supported 5,490 pregnant women and new mothers to attend health promotion sessions about Infant and Young Child Feeding counselling practices, and 39,899 children 6-59 months (20,348 girls) were screened for nutritional status.

• In March, UNICEF continued repairs to the water network in Mosul’s Old City in coordination with the Directorate of Water Ninewa. As a prolonged interim measure, UNICEF has ensured continued water trucking services which currently reach around 50,220 individuals in West Mosul.

• Upgrade of WASH facilities for 41 schools was completed in March, improving access to sanitation for 22,480 students (12,280 girls).

• World Water Day celebrations on 22 March engaged 27,150 children in schools, internally displaced people camps, and non-camp locations through awareness-raising and information activities.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The overall trend continues to be increased rates of internally displaced populations (IDP) returning to places of origin. Between January and March 2018 IDP numbers have decreased by around 342,500 people, from 2.6 million to 2.27 million, while the returnee population has increased by around 352,700 people, from 3.22 million to 3.57 million. Despite this, complex patterns of movement have still occurred between IDP camps and places of return. Across the country, more than 630,000 IDPs remain in camps and nearly 265,000 in critical shelter arrangements such as informal settlements or unfinished buildings. Between January and March, 5,597 newly-arrived IDP families (approximately 33,500 individuals, including around 15,700 children) were recorded entering IDP sites in Ninewa. The main reasons given by these families for their arrival to camps were firstly, financial or economic – for example, families had no access to livelihood opportunities, no money to pay rent or purchase food – and secondly, destroyed or damaged houses. In addition, military operations undertaken by the Government of Turkey in northern Iraq, including the Sinjar area, halted the return trend for the mainly Yezidi population in that area, who either left homes in the area or remained in neighbouring districts. While humanitarian partners estimate return of an additional two million people by the end of 2018, patterns in the first quarter indicate a continued need for shelter in camps, with potential for more people to choose to return to camps in cases where jobs are not available in their places of origin, or where the progress of local reconstruction is insufficient. These factors indicate that continued investment will be required in coming months to ensure adequate basic services and facilities to populations in camps, as well as continued integration across humanitarian and recovery planning and response.

In March the Government of Iraq (GoI) lifted the embargo on international flights to KRI airports after the two sides reached an agreement to restore federal authority in all international entry points in the Region, including land crossings and airports. This was followed by removal of the ban on telephone calls to/from KRI landlines and phased initiation of delivery of salaries to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) public sector employees. Non- or partial-payment of civil servant salaries, including government health, education, and social services staff over the past two years has impacted availability of public services for children. Relations between the two sides had been at their lowest in the preceding six months following the KRG’s September 2017 independence referendum.","UNICEF Iraq Monthly Humanitarian Situation Report, March 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/unicef-iraq-monthly-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018

A Kurdistan Regional Government media official said KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani had approved the date.

The vote should elect both a parliament and a president for Kurdish regions which have gained self-rule in 1991, when a U.S-led coalition forced Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi army to withdraw from them in the wake of his eight-month occupation of Kuwait.

A federal Iraqi election, which includes the Kurdistan region, is set to take place on Saturday and its results will give clues as to the importance of the different Kurdish political parties.

Longtime Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani stepped down from the KRG presidency on Nov. 1 after the independence referendum last September.

Opposition to the ruling Kurdish establishment, represented by the Barzani and Talabani dynasties, has become more vocal over the past years, especially after the referendum.

The Iraqi government and Shi’ite militias allied to Iran dislodged Kurdish forces from the oil region of Kirkuk in retaliation for the vote, curtailing the oil income of the KRG and leading to an economic crisis in the region.

Unpaid public servants hold regular demonstrations in Kurdish cities, and new parties have been formed to challenge the Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Talabani’s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

The Kurdish elections were set for Nov. 1 but were delayed as the KRG had to deal with the conflict with Baghdad. Nechirvan Barzani has been exercising the function of the presidency since his uncle Masoud stepped down.

The current parliament was elected in 2013.

4,iraq,"Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center

An Iraqi humanitarian lauded as a national hero visited here March 26 to learn how the U.S. military cares for its wounded and injured warriors and their families.

Aliyah Khalaf Saleh, known as Umm Qusay in Iraq, toured Brooke Army Medical Center’s Warrior and Family Support Center.

The Warrior and Family Support Center provides coordinated services to patients, next of kin and extended family members.

As Umm Qusay walked through the center, she expressed her admiration for its recreational rooms, playgrounds and lush gardens.

“I don’t have enough words to say about this place,” Umm Qusay said through an interpreter as she settled in her chair, gathering her black robes trimmed in gold around her. “I’ve never seen this in Iraq before. I would love to help injured, sick, children who are sleeping in streets, widows who have nothing.

‘I See Great Courage Here’

“I see such great courage here helping injured soldiers and taking care of them, providing services,” she added. “I want to learn from you because of everything being offered here.”

Umm Qusay’s devotion to others came at great cost. The 62 year old was born in the Iraqi province of Salah al-Din, near Tikrit. She was not afforded the opportunity to attend school and was married at age 13.

In 2014, great tragedy struck her family, at the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorists.

“ISIS killed my husband, son and my nephew in front of my eyes,” Umm Qusay said. “They killed children, older people, women.”

On June 12, a group of Iraqi military cadets fleeing ISIS arrived. Umm Qusay and her family watched as young Iraqi military cadets jumped into the river to escape. Although still grief-stricken over the loss of her family, she set her emotions aside and took action.

Taking Action to Rescue Others

Umm Qusay rescued 58 recruits over a period of five months. She hid them, provided them with identification cards from the local university to hide their identities, and helped prepare their escape routes, according to her biography. She also taught the Shiites how to pray as Sunnis to prevent exposure to ISIS operatives.

“Umm Qusay, a Sunni, believed strongly that each young boy deserved her care whether Christian, Kurd, Turkmen, Yezidi, Sunni or Shiite,” according to her biography.

For her actions. Umm Qusay was one of 10 women from around the world honored with the 2018 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage award. Established in 2007, the award honors women “who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women’s equality and social progress, often at great personal risk,” according to the State Department’s website.

“It was difficult,” Umm Qusay said. “I sacrificed everything I had, but I was able to save lives and that was the reason I was given this honor by God’s grace.”

Caring for Wounded Iraqi Service Members

Four years later, Umm Qusay’s life is still devoted to others; she cooks for Iraqi soldiers and visits with wounded service members.

When asked why she put her life on the line four years ago, Umm Qusay said it all came down to family. “I saved 58 young men in order to return them to their wives, their mothers, their homes,” she said.

“A human being no matter nationality or background -- American, Saudi, Iraqi, Afghanistan -- in all of these religions and human beings, God created them; God put the breath of life in them,” she said, her passion evident despite the language barrier. “Any person that wants courage should trust God and go forward. If it’s to do good and serve others … go forward without fear. So any good deed a person wants to do will be supported and cared for by God.”

For Umm Qusay, courage is a simple concept.

“When asked for a robe for cover, give your robe. Courage is generosity and generosity is courage,” she said.

“We are all created by God,” Umm Qusay said in her biography. “We are all the same.”",Famed Iraqi Humanitarian Visits Army Medical Center,https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1489254/famed-iraqi-humanitarian-visits-army-medical-center/
5,iraq,"In what is being called the most momentous foreign policy move of Donald Trump’s presidency, the president announced on May 8, 2018 that he’s withdrawing the United States from its historic 2015 nuclear accord with Iran. The end of the nuclear deal means a new beginning for economic sanctions against the country—sanctions that, over the decades, have cratered Iran’s economy and destabilized relations throughout the Middle East.

Technically, the United States and Iran have never been at war. But by imposing unilateral sanctions, the U.S. has long wielded money as a weapon in a shadow war that’s been raging since 1979. Here’s how sanctions went from punitive measure to status quo:

The Iran hostage crisis led Jimmy Carter to mount the first U.S. sanctions against Iran

The history of American sanctions against Iran began with a bang when a group of Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking more than 60 United States citizens hostage and sparking an international crisis. The 444-day-long hostage crisis tanked Jimmy Carter’s presidency, ushered in a new political era for Iran, and helped skyrocket Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a revolutionary cleric who objected to United States interference, to international significance.

It also created a state of permanent deadlock between the U.S. and Iran—a tense standoff characterized by a pattern of sanctions over direct negotiations.

VIDEO: Iran Hostage Crisis Explore the chain of events that set off the Iran hostage crisis – an diplomatic standoff that would keep Americans on edge and shape the course of Jimmy Carter’s presidency.

President Carter swiftly imposed sanctions on Iran after the hostage crisis began, cutting off sales of Iranian oil and freezing Iranian assets. These measures did nothing to help along diplomatic negotiations for the release of the prisoners, so on April 7, 1980, 212 days after the crisis began, he announced even more drastic measures. The U.S. cut off diplomatic relations with Iran, imposed economic sanctions including cutting off food aid, closed Iranian institutions within the U.S., and embargoed all imports from Iran.

“I am committed to the safe return of the hostages,” Carter told the nation. “The steps that I have ordered today are those that are necessary now. Other action may become necessary if these steps do not produce the prompt release of the hostages.”

They didn’t. As the hostage crisis continued, Carter okayed a disastrous rescue mission that had to be aborted after eight service members died in a sandstorm. The hostages were only released after Carter lost a bid for reelection.

VIDEO: Iran-Iraq War The eight-year war between Iran and Iraq cost billions of dollars in damages and claimed millions of lives, but resulted in no real benefit to either side.

Ronald Reagan designated Iran a “state sponsor of terrorism” after the Beirut barracks bombing

Though American hostages were released just hours after President Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, the U.S. didn’t let go of its Iran sanctions. The U.S. had agreed to revoke all trade sanctions with Iran as part of the agreement that released the hostages, but didn’t immediately roll back all of the economic sanctions imposed by Carter.

Meanwhile, Iran was invaded by Iraq in 1980, prompting an eight-year war. At first, the United States maintained a neutral stance. But over time, the U.S. began to support Iraq. In 1983, a truck bomb attack ripped through a Marine compound in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 U.S. service members. The Reagan administration suspected that Iran was at least partially behind the attacks, which were carried out by terrorists.

This led the United States to designate Iraq as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” a moniker that gave the U.S. the ability to further sanction Iran. The designation halted loans and foreign aid; it also restricted sales of “dual-use items”—technologies and materials that could possibly be used for warfare in addition to their intended use.

The Reagan administration secretly provided weapons and funds to Iran

In public, Reagan continued a strong sanctions stance against Iran on the national stage. But behind the scenes, his administration officials were funneling money and arms to Iran in exchange for Americans taken hostage by Iran-backed terrorists in Lebanon despite the arms embargo—in what would later become known as the Iran-Contra Affair.

Though the secret program wouldn’t become public until 1987, it secretly helped shape the Reagan administration’s policy toward Iran. In hearings about the scandal, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North claimed he had participated in the arms deals with the full knowledge of President Reagan and admitted to moving funds from the Iran arms deals to the Contras in Nicaragua. However, Reagan denied that he had exchanged arms for hostages, instead insisting that he had participated in the program as a way to encourage “moderate” Iranians to support the United States.

In 1987, the United States purchased Iranian oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Congress was appalled and scolded Reagan. Under political pressure, Reagan outlawed all imports from the U.S. to Iran. However, he painted the move as a necessary response to Iranian aggression. “We are taking these economic measures only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian Government,” Reagan told the nation in a statement about the trade embargo.

Bill Clinton banned U.S. companies from making oil deals with Iran

After the Iran-Iraq war ended, President Clinton developed a policy of “dual containment” designed to capitalize on the now diminished power of Iraq and Iran. The policy centered on what was becoming the most important geopolitical asset of the 1990s—the oil in the Persian Gulf. Since the U.S. could not overthrow Iran, Clinton’s administration decided to use oil to weaken it.

In 1995, Conoco and Iran announced a $1 billion contract that would give the U.S.-owned company unprecedented access to two Iranian oil fields. The Clinton administration leapt into action, claiming the contract threatened national security. Conoco backed out of the deal and Clinton banned U.S. companies from participating in oil deals with Iran. This was further consolidated by the 1996 Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, a law that called for the U.S. to establish “multilateral trade sanctions” against Iran. Sanctions against Iran were now the law of the land.

The Iranian economy tanks after worldwide sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program

In 2002, the international community learned that Iran had been enriching uranium and was developing a nuclear program. The United States had long suspected Iran of a covert nuclear program, and when President George W. Bush dubbed the country part of an “axis of evil” after the 9/11 attacks, relations between the two countries began to degrade.

Soon, the U.S. was working to freeze the assets of individuals and businesses it suspected of aiding Iran. As the international community put pressure on Iran, the U.S. tightened the grip of its existing sanctions, enforcing them more vigorously and levying large penalties on banks and individual that didn’t comply with rigorous rules.

Sanctions tightened even further under President Obama, who targeted Iranian petroleum purchases, banks, and automobile industries in response to Iran’s nuclear activities. Ultimately, the United States forbade almost all trade with Iran. It was joined by much of the international community, which levied significant economic and political sanctions.

As a result, what was left of the Iranian economy tanked. Healthcare, banking, and other critical sectors suffered, and Iran’s currency, the rial, plummeted. Sanctions pushed up prices within Iran, spurring inflation and unemployment. The sanctions are “severely weakening the middle class, breaking the collective will and marginalizing democratic voices while solidifying the power of the ruling elite,” wrote Iranian-American filmmaker Beheshteh Farshneshani in the New York Times in 2013.

These devastating effects only shifted once President Obama announced a historic pact that lifted nuclear sanctions in exchange for an end to Iran’s nuclear program in 2015. The deal gave Iran the ability to sell oil on international markets and effectively opened up the global markets that had slowly closed over decades of sanctions.

Now that President Trump has canceled the nuclear deal—which he called a “horrible one-sided deal” that did not bring peace—sanctions will once again be instituted, and the shadow sanctions war seems poised to begin all over again.","The Tense History of U.S.-Iran Sanctions, from the Hostage Crisis to the Nuclear Deal",http://www.history.com/news/iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-facts-hostage-crisis

7,iraq,"THE IOM APPROACH TO RECOVERY IN IRAQ

The UN Migration Agency (IOM) transition programming aims to contribute towards the recovery of Iraqi communities by improving their resilience and promoting social cohesion, while addressing the Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus in a protracted crisis. The key principles underpinning this approach are:

PRINCIPLES

• Accountability to Affected Populations

• Community led and owned

• Confidence in public institutions

• Diagnostic and evidence-based program design

• Integrated and holistic interventions

• Area Based

IOM aims to achieve this through a comprehensive and integrated approach that encompasses five main outcome areas:

1. Increasing Human Capital: Build capacity, provide technical training, raise awareness and enhance the skills of community, which will facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for the execution of all the other components.

2. Promoting Good Governance at the Local Level: Encourage civic engagement and government ownership. This will also build trust in government institutions and facilitate cohesion between the community and local authorities.

3. Improving Access to Community Services: IOM works with communities to rehabilitate public services and infrastructure, improve their quality and support access to and provision of these services.

4. Supporting Local Economies: Provision of grants and technical support to micro-small enterprises with the aim to revitalize small-scale industries and encourage new sectors that respond to market opportunities. In all construction and rehabilitation work (when possible) equipment and materials are purchased locally; labour is hired locally and contracts are signed locally to further invest into the community’s local economy.

5. Creating Safer Communities: IOM contributes to addressing long term safety and security issues by identifying and addressing protection concerns through programmes such as community policing. This approach builds trust and facilitates dialogue between security actors and the wider community.

ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY

The community engagement process creates space for dialogue regarding housing, land and property as well as access to remedies (e.g., transitional justice). IOM’s Community Engagement teams seek to share information and coordinate with other actors working in the area to coordinate response and complement and complete the community’s objectives. At the heart of their work they ensure the implementation of Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP). In addition, programmes that invest in local economies create opportunities to engage young men and women, therefore enhancing stability by mitigating tensions in a post conflict scenario.

COMMUNITY-LED RECONCILIATION

IOM recognizes the importance of community-led reconciliation efforts. To prevent a resurgence of terrorism and/ or sectarian violence it is critical to address the multi-sectoral rights and needs of communities through an inclusive process that is applied through a conflict sensitive lens. Community-led reconciliation requires an understanding of the context within which we operate, including the interactions between the communities and UN agencies and our partners. Importantly, it also requires the ability to act upon this understanding to avoid negative impact.

RAPID RECOVERY PROGRAMME (RRP)

IOM utilizes the Rapid Recovery Programme (RRP) to deliver immediate assistance when areas become accessible after they have been retaken from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) control. In addition, immediate assistance is provided for areas affected by new waves of displacement.

The RRP adopts an Area Based Recovery approach, which uses the geographical area as the main entry point for intervention as opposed to a specific sector/target group. In addition, this method enables RRP to respond to local problems through a multi-sectorial approach, including various types of interventions such as: improving access to basic services; local governance; and economic recovery.","IOM Rapid Recovery Programme Community Assessment Report: Al-Jadida 3, Part I - April 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iom-rapid-recovery-programme-community-assessment-report-al-jadida-3-part-i-april-2018

The last time Al Massira was at this level was between 2005 and 2008, when more than 700,000 Moroccans were affected by drought and grain production fell by 50 percent.

In common with its north African neighbours, Morocco suffers from recurring droughts and in 2016 was hit by the worst drought in three decades.

As well as the agricultural sector, Al Massira supplies water to many cities, including Casablanca.

India:

In India, the falling water levels of two crucial reservoirs have led to fierce argument about how to allocate water.

The Narmada River flows from east to west through the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, then through the state of Gujarat before emptying into the Arabian Sea.

Poor rains in 2017 have led to a clash how much water should be released from the Indira Sagar reservoir to the downstream Sardar Sarovar reservoir in Gujarat.

The Sardar Sarovar reservoir provides drinking water for 30 million people, almost half of Gujarat’s total population, and the irrigation for more than a million farmers.

But releasing more water from the Indira Sagar dam would have further reduced the its reservoir’s supply during the critical summer period.

‘India is a highly water-stressed country and has suffered through many debilitating droughts in recent years,’ say Resource Watch.

‘These dry spells have devastated farmers, even driving some to commit suicide.'

Iraq:

The reservoir of the Iraq’s Mosul Dam has shrunk 60 percent in surface area from the late 1990s to present day.

According to Resource Watch, there are several reasons behind this including poor water resource management by the Iraqi government and intense regional droughts.

Water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir have fallen by 60 per cent, with a Turkish hydroelectric project to blamed by many

But Turkey’s Southeast Anatolia Project and its 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants across the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are cited by many as a key driver behind the reduced river flow into Iraq.

Spain:

Spain, along with its neighbour Portugal, is fighting a drought that is drying up rivers, ruining crops and sparking wildfires.

The surface area of the Buendia dam reservoir shrunk by 60 percent over the last five years, says Resource Watch,

Levels that low were last seen in 2006, when the country was going through its worst drought in 60 years.

Experts warn that droughts will likely become more frequent and severe in this region, and water stress is projected to increase in many parts of Spain by 2040.","Morocco, India, Iraq, Spain could be next for Day Zero water crisis",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5626133/Could-Morocco-India-Iraq-Spain-face-Day-Zero-water-crisis.html
9,iraq,"Background

A worsening drought is threatening agriculture and livelihoods in the Dhi Qar Governorate of Iraq, 300 kilometres south of Baghdad. Other southern agricultural governorates, including Al-Qādisiyyah, Muthanna and Missan, are also suffering under the effects of the drought. The southern agricultural provinces of Iraq are home to nearly a quarter of the total population of the country. The drought is placing increasing pressure on agricultural families, with dozens of families moving out of at least 20 villages in the area.

Comment

Farmers in the agricultural provinces of southern Iraq largely rely on pumps and generators to draw water. According to an engineer with the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, Mehdi Rashid, the drought can largely be attributed to poor rainfall patterns and higher temperatures over the last two seasons. These conditions mean that it is increasingly difficult for farmers to obtain water from drying riverbeds. Mr Rashid has warned that Iraq’s reservoirs are currently holding only about 12 per cent of their total collective capacity.

While they significantly contribute to the current problem, poor rainfall patterns are not the only explanation. Rainfall provides just 30 per cent of Iraq’s water resources. The remaining 70 per cent is drawn from transboundary rivers that Iraq shares with Iran, Turkey and Syria. In the Karun River, for example, Iran has diverted much of the river’s course, so that less water flows into Iraq. Iran has also constructed three dams along the Karaj River, reducing the amount of water that flows into the cross-border wetlands between Iran and Iraq.

Turkey is also constructing dams along its section of the Tigris River. If the dams are completed, the further reduction in the flow of water is likely to cause an environmental disaster within southern Iraq and will threaten the lives and livelihoods of thousands within the region. The Euphrates River, which also originates in Turkey, has traditionally been a large source of water for southern Iraq. An increase in Turkey’s retention of water from the Euphrates has led to many farmers in downstream Iraq struggling to obtain water. Provincial tensions within southern Iraq have been increasing, as local upstream tribes extract more water than their quota allows. Some tribes have warned the Iraqi Government of a “war” that may erupt if measures are not taken to manage the water crisis.

Iraq’s Water Minister has said that as a result of both natural climatic causes and dam construction, the amount of water flowing in Iraqi rivers has fallen by at least 40 per cent in recent decades. In the wake of recent conflicts that have plagued the country, the Iraqi Government’s focus on water policy has, understandably, been a secondary concern.

If the government does not succeed in managing the current drought and, in particular, negotiating with Iraq’s neighbours to ensure that it continues to receive an adequate amount of flow in its rivers, it risks exacerbating instability throughout the region. At best, tensions may rise as a result of people relocating from the countryside, but, at worst, the current drought may have the potential to escalate tensions into a larger conflict.",The Natural and Artificial Causes of the Drought in Southern Iraq,http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/natural-artificial-causes-drought-southern-iraq/

The strike targeted a position used by the commanders of the group, south of the town of Deshaisha, the statement said. “The position was completely destroyed,” it said.

The Iraqi air force has already carried out several air strikes against IS in Syria since last year, with the approval of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.

Abadi last month said he would “take all necessary measures if they threaten the security of Iraq,” referring to the militants who just three years ago overran a third of Iraq.

The prime minister declared final victory over the ultra hardline group in December but it still poses a threat from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq.

13,iraq,"Erbil; Iraq. 11 April 2018 – On 10 April, the Kurdistan Regional Government together with the United Nations and its partners held a high-level joint conference on the priority needs in the Kurdistan Region.



Over one million internally displaced people and refugees have sought safety in Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah governorates since January 2014. With the end of large-scale military offensives in late 2017, many families have been returning home and are trying to rebuild their lives. Close to 30 per cent of displaced Iraqis and nearly all of the 250,000 Syrian refugees in the country are living in the Kurdistan Region. This year, humanitarian partners estimate that approximately 736,000 people living in the Kurdistan Region, nearly half of them children, will require some form of humanitarian assistance.



In 2018, the humanitarian community, comprised of United Nations agencies, national and international NGOs and other partners, is requesting US$569 million through the Humanitarian Response Plan to respond to the needs of 3.4 million of the most vulnerable people in Iraq. In order to deliver humanitarian assistance to 600,000 of the most vulnerable people in the Kurdistan Region, the humanitarian community in Iraq is seeking US$156 million in financial support to implement activities outlined in the response plan.



“With the help of its international partners, the Kurdistan Regional Government has been able to provide critical humanitarian assistance, safety and security to over 1.5 million internally displaced Iraqis and 250,000 Syrian refugees” said Mr. Karim Sinjari, Minister of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government, while emphasising that “with continued support and collaboration of the international community, we can and are committed to do even more for the 1.1 million displaced people and 248,000 refugees still hosted in our region until safe, voluntary and dignified return is made possible.”



Additionally, Mr. Sinjari stated that “displacement is protracted and return might take years. An important step is therefore to recognize that the displaced people, refugees and the newly displaced as well as the host communities will continue to need assistance in 2018 and beyond.”



“The humanitarian crisis in Iraq has entered a new phase with the end of large-scale military operations. Nevertheless, protection continues to be the overriding humanitarian priority in Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region; thousands of people have been already or are newly displaced and families have started returning to their homes,” said Mr Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the acting Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.



“Given the scale of the existing humanitarian needs, the United Nations and its partners in the Kurdistan Region remain committed to providing essential services and assistance packages to the vulnerable population, in particular those traumatised by the violence. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to have strong international support for this year’s response plan,” added Mr Balakrishnan.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the Joint Crisis Coordination Centre have provided a conducive environment for the work of the United Nations agencies and international NGOs towards meeting the humanitarian needs of Iraqis. However, local resources remain stretched.



The Kurdistan Regional Government and the humanitarian community will continue to coordinate assistance and respond to the needs and challenges faced by displaced people and returnees across the region.

Baghdad (Iraqinews.com) – An Iraqi fisherman was arrested Sunday in Dhi Qar governorate as he was found implicated in killing two schoolgirls via his locally-made landmines, a security source was quoted as saying.

“A force from the Counter-Terrorism Service raided the fisherman’s house in al-Nasiriyah district in Dhi Qar and took him to a detention center as he will face charges of manufacturing landmines that killed two schoolgirls and injured another earlier in the day,” the source told Alghad Press.

“The three students were on their way to school when the landmine exploded.”

The suspect is believed to be “manufacturing the landmines to use them in his business,” and not for terrorist attacks, the source noted. “He was referred to the authorities concerned to be interrogated,” added the source.

Following decades of fierce conflicts between Iraqi government forces and armed groups, Iraq is still heavily contaminated with landmines and other unexploded materials. The UN says nearly five million people have been displaced since Islamic State militants took over large areas of Iraq in 2014 to proclaim a self-styled “Islamic Caliphate”.

The surge in violence between armed groups and government forces has resulted in over 5 million internally displaced persons across Iraq and left more than 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

16,iraq,"Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq. He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’

Tony Blair was yesterday accused of using the Syria crisis to justify his disastrous invasion of Iraq.

In a 20-minute slot on the Today programme, the former Labour leader said that although military intervention was difficult, not intervening also had consequences – as Syria proved.

He said that inaction had led to dictator Bashar al-Assad and his backers being ‘emboldened to act’.

Mr Blair said Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’

He also said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed.

He said: ‘They [Assad’s troops] are winning but they are winning because their outside backers are prepared to intervene and to commit and, frankly, we have not been able to.’

Mr Blair, who was the Middle East peace envoy until 2015, said that this was because of the ‘difficulties of intervention’.

He said: ‘I know that it’s extremely difficult but the problem is non-intervention is also a policy with consequences. Iraq shows you that intervening is extremely difficult but non-intervention – as we see from Syria – is also extremely difficult.

‘The problem in the Middle East is that you do have actors that are prepared to intervene and if you look at the commitment that Russia and Iran have made in Syria it is enormous.’

He added: ‘I’m simply saying that where you intervene, as we’ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s extremely difficult but where you don’t intervene, as we’ve seen in Syria, it’s also difficult.

Britain should back US air strikes on Assad’s forces, adding: ‘If the US are taking action we should be prepared to be alongside them.’ He said he did not think it was ‘necessary’ for the Prime Minister to ask MPs to vote on the issue because ground troops would not be deployed

‘It is important to realise that if we allow it to go unchecked and unanswered then obviously the Assad regime and backers will be emboldened to act.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Blair was using Syria to justify his failed intervention in Iraq.

Referring to the Blair government’s alleged attempts to ‘spin’ intelligence reports to overstate the case for war in Iraq, he said: ‘I think he is attempting to rewrite history and thinks the British people don’t remember the dodgy dossier that got us into the situation in the first place.

‘It is a bit much for him trying to get us into another war justified by his illegal intervention in the Iraq War.

‘He was the Middle East peace envoy for a long time and that wasn’t successful because during that time [the region] was the most volatile that it has ever been.’",Tony Blair accused of using crisis in Syria to Iraq war,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5601475/Tony-Blair-accused-using-crisis-Syria-justify-invasion-Iraq.html
