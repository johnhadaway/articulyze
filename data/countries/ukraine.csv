0,ukraine,"A Crimean activist has been sentenced to two years in prison over pro-Ukrainian comments made on social media, a ruling that activists say is unprecedented.

Ihor Movenko was found guilty of extremism by the Russia-controlled court in Sevastopol on May 4.

The charges stem from comments Movenko posted in the ""Crimea is Ukraine"" group on the social network VKontakte in 2016.

“If I’m not mistaken, this is the first time someone has been imprisoned for comments made on social media,” said Darya Sviridova of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union.

""Obviously, a Ukrainian citizen is being persecuted for taking a pro-Ukrainian position on occupied territory,"" Sviridova added.

A lawyer for Movenko, Oksana Zheleznyak, said the ruling would be appealed.

Movenko was beaten in Sevastopol in September 2016 while riding a bicycle that displayed a sticker with the symbol of the far-right Azoz battalion.

Movenko suffered serious injuries in the attack, but police never investigated the incident.

Following the assault, Movenko was detained in December 2016 by Russia-installed security authorities in Crimea and charged with extremism on social media.

Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the human rights situation has reportedly deteriorated on the Ukrainian Peninsula.

1,ukraine,"Washington (CNN) Three Democratic senators have written a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general to ""express great concern"" over reports that Ukrainian officials had looked to potentially hinder special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Sens. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont wrote in the letter to Yuriy Lutsenko that a recent New York Times report said his office ""effectively froze investigations into four open cases in Ukraine in April, thereby eliminating scope for cooperation with the Mueller probe into related issues.""

Ukrainian investigators had been tracing money paid to Paul Manafort , who would later become Trump's campaign chairman, by figures in the political party of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Times reported. Yanukovych was ousted from power in 2014. The decision to halt the investigations came at a delicate moment for Ukraine, as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell it anti-tank missiles called Javelins, the Times reported.

The May 4 letter requests that Lutsenko answer three questions, which include inquiries about whether the office did attempt to ""restrict cooperation"" with Mueller's probe and ""if so, why?""

It also asks if anyone from the Trump administration encouraged ""Ukrainian government or law enforcement officials not to cooperate"" with Mueller's investigation, and if that probe was ""raised in any way during discussions between your government and US officials, including around the meeting of Presidents Trump and Poroshenko in New York in 2017,"" a reference to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

Mueller is investigating Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election and is looking into any potential ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia's efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.

""As strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine, we believe that our cooperation should extend to such legal matters, regardless of politics,"" the three senators wrote.

""Blocking cooperation with the Mueller probe potentially cuts off a significant opportunity for Ukrainian law enforcement to conduct a more thorough inquiry into possible crimes committed during the Yanukovich era,"" they wrote. ""This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal -- to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community -- about your government's commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law,"" the statement continued.",Senators ask about Ukraine involvement in Robert Mueller probe,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/04/politics/robert-mueller-ukraine/index.html

3,ukraine,"The United States completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine on Monday, finalizing a sale that was reluctantly approved by President Donald Trump in November. The deal was widely reported as a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. “This decision … reflects our country’s longstanding commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression,” Republican Senator Bob Corker said late last year. Related Story Mattis's Mission to Reassure Ukraine But the terms of the arrangement show it may be more bark than bite. The weapons “have been delivered to a secure facility in Ukraine, not on the line of conflict,” Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine, told me. He did not elaborate further, but The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the weapons would be stored in training centers in western Ukraine that will be monitored by American soldiers. Trump has said repeatedly that “no one is tougher on Russia” than him. But his critics have accused him of challenging Putin only superficially. Shortly after the Trump administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats in March—48 of whom were actually intelligence officers, according to a State Department spokesperson—the State Department acknowledged that the Kremlin would be allowed to refill the vacated positions. The Treasury Department recently sanctioned more than three dozen Russian oligarchs, officials, and entities who “profit” from Russia’s “malign activity” and “corrupt system.” But many of the sanctioned oligarchs had four months’ notice to move their money, thanks to a list of Russia’s wealthiest individuals released by the Treasury in January. That money might already be back in Russia. “As they say, ‘a barking dog cannot hinder a caravan’s journey,’” Putin told Russia’s TASS news agency at the time. He mocked his own absence from the list. When UN Ambassador Nikki Haley announced new sanctions against Russia over its support for embattled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, she was contradicted by the White House hours later.

“There is confusion about the Putin-Trump relationship,” Major General Volodymyr Havrylov, Ukraine’s defense attaché to the U.S., told me last month. “And an element of unpredictability. But we believe in checks and balances in the United States.” Former National-Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for Trump to approve the lethal weapons sale to Ukraine, according to Havyrlov and another U.S. official familiar with the deal who requested anonymity to discuss it freely. Trump was convinced, at least in part, by the fact that President Barack Obama—to whom Trump frequently compares himself—had balked at the sale. The official relayed a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko last year in which Trump asked why Obama had “done nothing when Russia invaded Crimea.” (Obama sanctioned Russia over the incursion in 2014.) Trump, ever transactional, also wanted to make sure he was not giving away something for nothing. The U.S. official said it was emphasized to the president that this would be a sale, not a gift, and Poroshenko won favor with Trump by facilitating an $80 million coal deal—the first between the U.S. and Ukraine—that was politically expedient for both leaders. In February, Ukrainian Railways signed a $1 billion locomotive deal with GE Transportation. Trump had promised during the campaign to revitalize the U.S. rail industry. “The Trump administration is very much focused on jobs creation,” said Daniel Vajdich, the president of the strategic advisory firm Yorktown Solutions. “So, naturally, Ukraine has thought about its ability to help create jobs for Americans in the context of creating leverage by feeding into Trump’s policy desires.” A Ukrainian-American lobbyist who spoke to me on condition of anonymity put it more bluntly: “Poroshenko has become a hostage of Trump,” he told me.

In June of 2017, Poroshenko attempted to pique the administration’s interest in helping to end the war in Ukraine by offering U.S. construction firms 90 percent of all contracts to repair and rebuild infrastructure in the disputed Donbass region, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant. It is unclear how Trump responded to the pitch, which was made to Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Mattis at the White House. The Ukrainian government hired Haley Barbour, former Republican National Committee chairman and founding partner of BGR Group, to lobby in the United States just after Trump was elected, according to foreign-lobbying registration documents filed with the Justice Department. Ed Rogers, the chairman of BGR, was hired for the lobbying work, too. The firm has ties to this White House: The Trump transition team held meetings with lobbyists at BGR Group’s offices, according to The Washington Post. And Rogers is “as inner-circle Jeff Sessions as they come,” a source with knowledge of their relationship told me on condition of anonymity, referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Both men are from Alabama.) BGR also worked with Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager who still visits the White House regularly, as recently as last summer, The Daily Beast reported. Vajdich, who previously worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he was in charge of regional issues in Europe and Eurasia, cautioned that it was unclear whether Kiev’s engagement with the Trump administration’s policy goals had “fundamentally transformed” Trump’s attitude toward Ukraine. “The fact that the Russians have invaded a country in the heart of Europe in the 21st century is something that hasn’t changed from one administration to the next,” he said.

In the months following the weapons sale, Poroshenko ordered Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor tasked with probing corruption under former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to stop cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s work in Ukraine and ties to Russia, according to two sources familiar with the request. The New York Times first reported on that order on Wednesday, indicating that Kiev had blocked the Manafort investigations just as the Trump administration was finalizing the weapons deal in an attempt to stay on Trump’s good side. Trump, according to the U.S. official, saw Manafort’s legal problems as a function of Yanukovych’s regime rather than a reflection of Poroshenko’s. The deal was a political victory for Poroshenko—who is facing a tough reelection next March—and for Trump, who has been accused of kowtowing to Russia. But it is still largely symbolic. “It’s a political symbol that allows others to understand that Ukrainian security is important to the U.S.,” Havrylov said. “Even just the presence of weapons on Ukrainian soil is significant.” Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace whose research focuses on Ukraine, agreed. “This delivery symbolizes for Kiev the ongoing support of the U.S. for Ukraine, or actually an increased one as Obama never agreed with this step (what was proposed by the Pentagon).”",Ukraine’s Successful Courtship of Trump,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/ukraines-successful-courtship-of-trump/559526/

6,ukraine,"(New York, 20 April) – The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Mr. Neal Walker, today briefed Member States and International Organizations on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people in eastern Ukraine. After four years of conflict, 3.4 million people in Ukraine are struggling to cope with the impact of the humanitarian crisis and urgently require humanitarian assistance and protection.

Every day, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine forces millions of civilians to make impossible choices whether they eat, have medicine, or their children go to school. Critical civilian infrastructure is severely impacted, as ceasefire agreements are consistently disregarded. There were on average 40,000 violations per month last year alone. During his briefing, Mr. Walker said that, “only this week, five water treatment workers were shot while trying to maintain critical water infrastructure along the “contact line”. Today, water supplies to over 345,000 civilians hang in the balance. Last year alone, over 130 incidents affected critical water infrastructure”.

Over 600,000 people, including 100,000 children, bear the brunt of the continued armed clashes along the 457-km ‘contact line’. Every month, over 1 million people are forced to cross the “noman’s land” through checkpoints, many to simply access basic humanitarian and social services.

More than 2,500 civilian men, women and children have been killed, and over 9,000 injured, since hostilities began four years ago.

Explosive hazard contamination in eastern Ukraine is impacting 1.9 million people, including around 200,000 children. The use of landmines across urban areas, farmland and the checkpoints is a constant concern. “Last week, landmines killed a family of four in eastern Ukraine. In 2017, over 235 civilians were killed or injured by landmines and other explosive remnants of war,” said Mr.

Walker.

The humanitarian community is committed to meeting the humanitarian needs of all conflictaffected people in Ukraine. In December 2017, humanitarian agencies launched a highly prioritized US$187 million appeal to reach over 2.3 million of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine with assistance and protection services. So far, this appeal remains largely unfunded. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Walker said: “Today, I call on Member States to stand in solidarity with conflict affected people in Ukraine and to help urgently address this 97 per cent funding gap. I continue to call on the parties to the conflict to take all measures necessary to ensure international humanitarian law is respected – civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. The only solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine is peace. We do not want to mark any further anniversaries of continued conflict.”

8,ukraine,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova has handed prison sentences to eight citizens for fighting on the side of pro-Russian rebels in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, General Prosecutor Eduard Harunjen said on Thursday.

The small ex-Soviet republic is politically and culturally divided between supporters of closer ties with Moscow and those who want Moldova eventually to follow neighboring Romania, with which it shares a language, into the European Union and NATO.

Speaking in parliament, Harunjen said Moldovans working in Russia were at ongoing risk of being drawn into the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people since fighting broke out in 2014.

“This is when brothers, fathers and husbands go away to work in eastern countries and there they are recruited into military groups. Sometimes they die there and sometimes they come home, but their hands are bloodied,” he said.

Those convicted face varying jail terms. A further 25 Moldovans are on international wanted lists in connection with the conflict in eastern Ukraine, he said.

Relations between Moldova and Russia are at a low ebb following tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats last year. At the time, sources told Reuters this was linked partly to attempts by Moscow to recruit fighters in Moldova for the conflict in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s harsh winter: thousands of civilians bear the brunt of the armed conflict

With temperatures plummeting to -19 Celsius in February, suffering of thousands of Ukrainians living in more than 90 settlements on both sides of the ‘contact line’ intensified due to the extreme cold. Many saw their electricity and water supplies disrupted, and heating systems deactivated.

The situation was extreme during the last two weeks of February, particularly due to heavy snowfall. Some 100,000 people on both sides of the ‘contact line’ saw water supply interrupted for more than 24 hours, as on 1 March, the 1st Lift Pumping Station of the South Donbas Water Pipeline was de-energized. Vulnerable men, women and children also struggled to access markets, services and critical facilities, as big piles of snow blocked many roads. People living along the ‘contact line’ also struggled to collect wood for heating, as it was too dangerous for them to enter the forests contaminated by landmines.

Harsh weather conditions also meant that civilians having to cross the ‘contact line’ often waited for long periods in the freezing cold. On several occasions in February, more than 500 people were unable to cross the ‘contact line’ and forced to stay overnight in highly insecure areas near the checkpoints. In addition, thousands of civilians, including children, elderly and people with disabilities, had to walk up to five kilometres of icy dangerous roads after private buses were unable to provide the required documentation to local authorities to be able to arrive near the Maiorske (Donetska oblast) and Stanytsia Luhanska (Luhanska oblast) checkpoints.

Lowest civilian casualties recorded since the start of the conflict

Ordinary men, women and children are paying the highest price for the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. During the first two months of 2018, five civilians were killed and 20 injured according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

""Children are learning in schools with bullet holes in the walls and sandbags in windows, bomb shelters in the basements, and shrapnel in school yards,"" UNICEF Ukraine Representative Giovanna Barberis said in a May 4 statement.

""The children are extremely nervous of shelling, and teachers try to calm them down, but it's hard for them...because they are nervous and stressed,"" Barberis said.

The UN agency did not directly name a particular side in the war, a conflict that has killed more than 10,300 people since March 2014.

It said that ""all sides of the conflict must respect international humanitarian law and ensure that schools are safe places for children to learn.""

'Forgotten' Crisis

UNICEF also said schools and kindergartens on both sides of the tense ""contact line"" are in danger due to the proximity of military sites, including bases, storage facilities, and security check points.

The contact line divides areas controlled by the government and Russia-backed separatists in and around parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, and it is where fighting is the fiercest.

UNICEF said it and its partners have monitored instances in which military and armed groups are based within 500 meters of a kindergarten or school.

It added that it has monitored six former school buildings that have been occupied or used by military forces or armed groups since the start of the current school year.

The European Union and United States back Kyiv in the conflict and have imposed sanctions on Russia for its support of the separatists and for its illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula.

Moscow has denied providing the separatist forces with weapons despite what Kyiv and NATO say is irrefutable evidence proving that it has done so.

Read more: Opinion — Vladimir Putin's great deceit

Vladimir Putin: The road to power KGB cadet Born in St.Petersburg in 1952, Putin signed up with the Soviet intelligence agency the KGB right out of law school in 1975. His first assignment was to monitor foreign nationals and consulate employees in his home city, then called Leningrad. He was then assigned to Dresden, East Germany. He reportedly burned hundreds of KGB files after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Political mentor Putin was one of the deputies to St Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak from 1991 to 1996. Sobchak met Putin at Leningrad State University and the two men were close until Sobchak's death in 2000. Despite accusations of corruption, Sobchak was never charged.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Meteoric rise Putin quickly leapt from St.Petersburg to Moscow. In 1997, President Boris Yeltsin gave Putin a mid-level position on his staff — a position Putin would use to cultivate important political friendships that would serve him in the decades to come.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Death of a friend Putin was deeply affected by Anatoly Sobchak's death in 2000. After the apprentice outstripped his teacher politically, Sobchak became a vocal early proponent of Putin's bid for the presidency. A year earlier, Putin used his political connections to have fraud allegations against Sobchak dropped, the beginning of a pattern for friends of the former spy.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Temporary president In June 2000, Boris Yeltsin stepped down, leaving his prime minister to become interim leader. As he was running for his successful presidential campaign, corruption allegations from his time on the city government in St.Petersburg resurfaced. Marina Salye, the lawmaker who brought up the claims, was silenced and forced to leave the city.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Tandemocracy When Putin was constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term in 2008, his Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ran in his stead. When Medvedev was elected, he appointed Putin as premier. This led to criticism of a ""tandemocracy,"" in Moscow, with many people believing that Medvedev was Putin's puppet.

Vladimir Putin: The road to power Victory In March 2018, Vladimir Putin was elected to his fourth term as president. Because the presidential term has been extended, this means Putin will be in power for the next six years. However, the election was marred by a lack of opposition to the incumbent, as well as allegations of vote tampering and ballot-stuffing. Author: Elizabeth Schumacher



Increasingly authoritarian domestic policy

It was plain to see during the last couple of years what Putin's authoritarian rule meant for domestic politics: restrictions on freedom of assembly, intimidation of civil society, more control in the areas of internet and social networks and even blocking attempts, as in the case of messenger service Telegram.

""I'm afraid the destruction of democratic wiggle room will continue,"" said Martin Schulze Wessel, professor of Eastern European History at the Munich-based Ludwig Maximilian University. In addition, the fight against corruption would not be successful, he added.

""The system will become increasingly authoritarian, without reaching the threshold to open dictatorship,"" said Manfred Hildermeier, a retired colleague from Göttingen University. ""For Putin, that's not necessary. He wants to show the world a democratic smokescreen.""

Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred from running in the election

Little danger from the opposition

An uprising against Putin — as in the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine or, currently, in Armenia — is unlikely to happen in today's Russia, all experts agreed. ""In the elections, the opposition showed that it toiled with fielding one candidate,"" Erler said.

The presidential election saw two candidates, Grigory Yavlinsky and Ksenia Sobchak, who positioned themselves as representatives of the liberal opposition. Opposition leaderAlexei Navalny, who had been barred from running for president, called for an election boycott.

Predictions, however, were difficult, because people could be mobilized quickly via internet, said Hildermeier. Whether there'll be protests in Russia would depend on the country's economic development.

Economy: No breakthrough

Thus far, Putin has been successful in stabilizing the Russian economy after the 2014 slump, triggered primarily by falling oil prices and, in part, by Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea. This stability, however, is under threat from the recent, much stiffer US sanctions.

In the coming years, the economic situation in Russia will get more difficult, according to Stefan Meister of the German think tank Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). ""There will be less funding for pensions, for social welfare, even for the military,"" said Meister. Therefore, he added, domestic policy would play an increasingly important role during Putin's fourth term in office.

In his formulaicstate of the nation address, delivered on March 1, Putin promised his country a technological breakthrough. The experts, however, are skeptical. ""Putin won't achieve this,"" said Hildermeier. ""His Achilles' heel is the economy, as well as economic competitiveness on an international level.""

Russia continued to depend on commodity exports on a large scale. In addition, Russia had — from a historic perspective — ""almost always managed to close the technological gap vis-a-vis Europe only in cooperation with the West."" This, however, was not on the cards. The estrangement between Russia and the West, initiated by Russia's ""aggressive foreign policy,"" was likely to continue.

Maintaining distance to the West

""Russia has a lot of self-confidence and views itself as a peacekeeping power in any future multipolar world order,"" said ex-government representative Erler of Russia's foreign policy. The attempt ""to establish Russia as a world power"" will continue, agreed Meister. In the process, Moscow was benefiting ""from US and EU inaction,"" for example in Syria, and — by virtue of tactical moves of its own — was developing into an important player in the Middle East, said Meister.

All the experts DW spoke with agree as to Russia's continuation of its policy of alienation from the West. The key to a rapprochement, they say, is a solution to the Ukraine crisis, but thus far Moscow has not shown its willingness to come to an agreement.

Russia's complete segregation from the West, however, would not work, said Schulze Wessel. Exchange of information was ""too close,"" and there was the opportunity to travel to the West. The alternative, establishing closer ties to China, is ""not so hot"" as an option, because in that case Moscow would have to be satisfied with the role as Beijing's junior partner.

Putin with Medvedev: Will he step down or change the constitution?

Last term in office?

One of the most intriguing issues of Putin's fourth presidency will be whether it'll be his last. The Russian constitution stipulates that a president may serve for two consecutive terms in office. Putin adhered to this guideline once before, becoming prime minister between 2008 and 2012 and returning to the Kremlin only after switching spots with then-President Dmitry Medvedev.

Now, Putin will face another choice: stepping down or changing the constitution. Hildermeier predicted that the former will happen. ""My guess is there will be a change in leadership,"" he said. Following Putin's six-year term in office, ""a loyal member of the ruling political elite"" could run for president in 2024.

Putin himself has said — after his election win in March — that a constitutional reform was ""not yet"" on his agenda. In a previous statement he had implied that he didn't want to be ""president forever."" However, he will probably come under strong pressure to remain in power.

14,ukraine,"On April 29, in the western Ukraine city of Lviv hundreds of demonstrators marched through the streets chanting anti-Semitic Nazi slogans while repeatedly thrusting their right arms forward in the straight arm Nazi salute.

The purpose of the parade was to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of the 14th Waffen SS Division ‘Galician.’

This unit was comprised of Ukrainian volunteers, many of them from Lviv who served as members of Adolf Hitler’s SS killing machine under the direct control of Heimrich Himmler.

Naturally enough, the Lviv parade honouring SS troopers drew the condemnation of the international Jewish community. Eduard Dolinsky, director of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee told the Times of Israel that this Nazi parade was “a scandalous event that should not be allowed to happen in Ukraine in which murderers of Jews and others are glorified.”

Andrew Srulevitch, director of European Affairs at the Anti-Defamation league wrote on Twitter, “Ukrainian leaders need to condemn such marches, where Ukrainian extremists celebrate Ukrainian Nazi SS divisions (1st Galician), giving Nazi salutes in uniform in the middle of a major Ukrainian city.”

The bizarre and unsettling tribute parade to Nazi killers also drew stern rebuke from none other than the U.S. Congress.

A recent letter signed by 57 Congressmen strongly condemned Ukrainian legislation, which they claimed “glorifies Nazi collaborators.”

Of course in Canada there was no news of this incident and certainly no official condemnation. That is because such behaviour runs counter to the current official narrative of ‘Russia bad, Ukraine good.’ One British media report went so far as to claim that the Ukrainian Nazi supporters in the Lviv parade were “playing into the hands of the Russian propagandists.”

So marching around in a Nazi uniform spewing anti-Semitic slogans is only a bad thing if the Russians can use it as a weapon in the so-called information war?

Have we lost so much perspective already that everything is viewed through the prism of vulnerability to Russian meddling? Glorifying Nazis is bad, period.

For Canada’s part, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has been on the opposite tack from Israel and the U.S. when it comes to relations with Ukraine.

Instead of condemning the Ukrainian leadership for what the U.S. Congressmen’s letter described as the “rise of this hateful [Nazi] ideology,” Freeland has instead been cozying up to her counterpart from Ukraine.

On April 22, on the eve of the G7 Summit in Toronto, Freeland hosted a brunch in her private home. In attendance that day were all the foreign ministers from the G7 countries, with a plus one in the form of Pavlo Klimkin, foreign minister of Ukraine.

No, Ukraine is definitely not a member of the G7, but Freeland wanted Klimkin front and centre to make sure he put the ongoing crisis in Ukraine at the top of the G7 Summit agenda.

That’s all well and good, as a lit powder keg such as Ukraine in the middle of Europe, polarized between NATO and nuclear-armed Russia is certainly a global concern.

Freeland has also never denied the fact she is proud of her Ukrainian-Canadian roots.

In addition to giving Klimkin an inside edge at the G7 meeting, Canada has been at the forefront of providing support — both military and monetary to the Ukraine regime that seized power in Kiev in 2013.

That should give us a lot of clout when it comes to chastising Ukraine for allowing such blatant glorification of Nazism.

It is not an issue of allowing freedom of speech in a democratic society; the very basis of Nazi ideology is rooted in hate.

Freeland would be doing Ukraine a huge favour should she join in condemnation of Nazi glorification with a little tough love; end the Nazi parades or Canada turns off the aid money tap and brings home our military advisers.

This same message should be delivered to the Latvian leaders in Riga. If they insist on staging a Nazi parade every year on March 19 to honour the SS Latvian Legion, then our military commitment to that country will be terminated.

We are in the driver’s seat here, and we say our military is protecting Canadian values.

In that case, we need to tell our allies in Ukraine and Latvia that glorifying the perpetrators of the Holocaust is not a Canadian value.","ON TARGET: ‘Glorifying Nazis is bad, period’",http://thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/1568487-on-target-%25E2%2580%2598glorifying-nazis-is-bad-period%25E2%2580%2599

INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE REGISTERED

(MINISTRY OF SOCIAL POLICY, 18 DECEMBER 2017)

3.4 million

PEOPLE IN NEED OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Nearly four years of ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine has had a significant impact on all aspects of life for the communities residing in the Donbas region. The protracted nature of the crisis has paralyzed economic activity and severely reduced household coping capacities on both sides of the 457 km contact line. At the household level, few employment opportunities have also led to a lack of income and the inability to meet basic needs.

According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy (MoSP), nearly 1.5 million persons are registered as displaced, with the vast majority residing in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and other conflict-affected populations continue to cross the contact line regularly, between the non-government controlled area (NGCA) and government controlled area (GCA) at five checkpoints. Throughout 2017, figures of individuals crossing the contact line reached an all-time high in August, when a recorded 1.2 million people crossed the contact line during the month. The large numbers of people crossing between the GCA and NGCA and limited capacity of the checkpoints to process the increase in crossings has led to long queues, lack of adequate sanitation facilities and exposure to bad weather conditions, or other health and protection concerns, such as those related to psychosocial needs, trafficking in persons and exploitation.

The overall humanitarian situation in Eastern Ukraine remains dire. Assistance continues to be provided in the NGCA despite various challenges, including limitation on transport of humanitarian cargo and limited access to the affected populations. The deterioration of the situation in the NGCA is evidenced by the increase in poor food consumption, application of negative cop ing mechanisms and reduction of food expenditure. Moreover, the damage to or destruction of gas and water pipelines as well as homes and social institutions further increases the vulnerability of entire social segments of conflict-affected communities by limiting their access to adequate heating, hygiene facilities and clean drinking water. The peak in unemployment rates and the scarce public services increase overall dependency on humanitarian aid and public support.

In the GCA, the economic depression and limited resources of the displaced population have placed further strain on already overstretched social services. According to IOM’s National Monitoring System Round 8 report, 33% of surveyed IDP households in the GCA have ‘only enough funds to cover food’ and 11% have to ‘limit expenses even for food’. Despite the continuously increasing percentage of employed IDPs (from 35% in March 2016 to 50% in December 2017), the average IDP household monthly income per person (UAH 2,446 in December 2017) remains below the actual subsistence level established by the Ministry of Social Policy (UAH 3,091 in December 2017).

Due to the protracted nature of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, slow economic growth and increased social tensions, 2018 will be a critical year for the transition from humanitarian assistance to longer-term recovery efforts. Bridging the gap between humanitarian and development interventions is critical to simultaneously address the urgent and longer-term needs of conflictaffected communities in the Donbas. The situation of protracted displacement requires concerted efforts from the Government of Ukraine, humanitarian and development actors as well as conflict affected communities to jointly identify actions in support of durable solutions to end displacement.","IOM Ukraine Crisis Response Plan, 1 January – 31 December 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-crisis-response-plan-1-january-31-december-2018

18,ukraine,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s drive to build a large power-generating turbine to lessen its dependence on Western technology has suffered a major set-back after a prototype broke beyond repair, two sources familiar with the project told Reuters.

In the past few years Russia has imported the large-capacity gas turbines required to run modern power stations from firms such as Siemens (SIEGn.DE), GE (GE.N) and Alstom (ALSO.PA).

After Western sanctions were imposed on Russia over the conflict with Ukraine four years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged officials to replace imported technology with home-grown substitutes in energy, software, aerospace and medicine.

The mishap with the 110 Megawatt turbine, a capacity large enough to power a sizeable town, underlines the technical challenges.

Testing was underway on a prototype 110 MW turbine at the Saturn engineering plant in Rybinsk, central Russia, in December last year according to one of the two sources, who are both in the energy sector and familiar with the results of the tests.

“The turbine fell apart,” said the first source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. “They tried to repair it in time for March, but they did not manage it.”

March was the target date for completion of tests on the turbine. Putin, in power since 1999, won a second consecutive term in an election on March 18.

The first source, and a second source, both said it was not possible to rebuild the prototype turbine and the project would have to start again with new equipment.

“The turbine broke up,” said the second source, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. “There’s no turbine, that’s it.”

“NOT FATAL”

Without any home-grown equivalents, Russia should in most cases still be able to buy turbines from Western suppliers, but U.S. and European Union sanctions have made it harder to import Western power technology under certain circumstances.

Last year Russia clandestinely delivered turbines made by Siemens to a power station in Crimea, which is subject to sanctions, and the European Union retaliated by imposing extra sanctions on officials and companies involved in the operation.

Set-backs to the domestic turbine program could hamper the modernization of power generation if growing tensions with Western states result in tighter sanctions since Russia’s modernization plan is focused on using gas turbines.

The technical hitch also carries a potential political cost: Putin has publicly trumpeted progress in replacing Western technology imports, so any failures will jar with the picture of success he has painted.

The new turbine is being developed by a consortium of ODK, a unit of state-owned conglomerate Rostec that owns the Saturn factory where the testing was being conducted, Russian state technology firm RUSNANO, and state energy firm InterRAO.

In a statement, ODK said one of the mechanisms of the prototype turbine had malfunctioned. It said that would delay work on the project, but could be fixed. “It is not fatal for the project.” It said set-backs were to be expected since this was a pioneering project for Russia.

RUSNANO acknowledged there had been an accident but gave no details. It said it remained committed to the turbine project and expects it will be completed. InterRAO declined to comment.

Russia’s Trade and Industry Ministry, which oversees the machine-building sector, declined to comment and referred questions to Rostec.

WESTERN SANCTIONS

Large capacity gas turbines have been in use around the world for years but their construction is tricky to perfect.

Because they operate at extremely high speeds and high temperatures, they need to be engineered to very precise standards and they use sophisticated electronic control systems to make sure that they operate efficiently.

For many years Russia made no major investment in developing the technology because it was able to import the turbines or the know-how to produce them. A scheme started in the 1990s to develop a large-capacity turbine produced prototypes but they did not go into production.

At a meeting in Russia’s second city of Saint Petersburg in May last year, chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said a 110 MW turbine had been developed and testing should be completed by March 2018.

“This is the first Russian produced powerful machine with 100-percent domestic manufacture and it will, of course, help us to completely substitute purchases of foreign equipment of this capacity,” Novak told the meeting. His ministry did not respond to questions on Tuesday about the set-back.",Exclusive: Russia's drive to replace Western power technology hits snag,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-turbines-exclus/exclusive-russias-drive-to-replace-western-power-technology-hits-snag-idUSKBN1HO26C

“Acute humanitarian needs persist, these include the basics: food, healthcare and water, and of course, employment,” he added.

Latest IOM data indicates that more than 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting, over 200,000 injured, and over 1.4 million displaced from their homes. Food security has also significantly worsened and so has the water, health and sanitation situation.

21,ukraine,"PRAGUE -- A NATO general says he's surprised that Russia is not more openly involved in Armenia's recent tumultuous events that led to longtime leader Serzh Sarkisian being pushed from power.

General Petr Pavel, the chairman of NATO's Military Committee, told RFE/RL on May 3 that he was surprised at the lack of Russian ""interference"" because of the close ties between Moscow and Yerevan and because of Russia's ""significant"" military presence in Armenia.

""Armenia is one of the countries which Russia sees as their near neighborhood and their justified sphere of influence,"" said Pavel, the third-highest-ranking NATO official behind Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Supreme Allied Commander Curtis Scaparrotti.

""Russia identified so-called 'colored revolutions' as one of [its] major security challenges,"" Pavel said. ""To some extent I am surprised there is not so much visible Russian interference, but I believe there is a lot going on beneath the surface.""

Pavel noted that NATO has an Individual Partnership Action Plan with Armenia. But he said that ""obviously, if a new government is in favor of more links with NATO, we are ready for it.""

The Armenian parliament is scheduled to vote on opposition leader Nikol Pashinian's candidacy for prime minister on May 8.

Pashinian led nationwide protests that have forced Sarkisian to give up power, and that has pressured his ruling Republican Party. The events are reminiscent of so-called ""colored revolutions"" from 2003 to 2005 in Georgia and Ukraine.

Pashinian has said there will be no geopolitical changes as a result of the upheaval.

Russia In Ukraine

On Ukraine, Pavel said supplies of ""lethal weapons"" to Kyiv -- such as the recent delivery of some 210 Javelin antitank missiles -- will only be countered by the Russia-backed separatists who control territory in eastern Ukraine taken in 2014.

""I believe adding more lethal weapons would create [an] imbalance that would then be matched from the other side by delivering more lethal weapons as well,"" Pavel said.

He also said he believed ""strongly"" in a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

""Russia, even though [it] denies any involvement in Donbas, keeps all important positions in these two so-called breakaway republics [in parts of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions], and they have all important positions in [the] military structure,"" he said.

Citing NATO sources, Pavel said there were now ""3,000 to 5,000 Russian professionals"" in eastern Ukraine.

He added that Moscow also ""significantly supports these regions [with]…military equipment, heavy weapons, ammunition, all the logistic stocks.""

""Basically we can say that without significant Russian support these two [separatist] regions wouldn't be able to survive,"" he said.

Pavel said the conflict will be resolved through ""a combination of a well-prepared Ukrainian armed forces that would be able to provide a deterrent effect and a reasonable political and social development [that] will eventually lead to what we can call [the] normalization of life in eastern Ukraine.""

Crawling Threat

Pavel said Russia was the greatest danger to ""the security of Western countries and the model of society that we have.""

He said Russia's hybrid war against the West was a ""crawling threat that is beneath the surface and it is gaining more and more ground and that's why it's so important to disclose, name it by its proper names, and react to it with the appropriate tools.""

Pavel said he did not think NATO is losing the information war with Russia. But he admitted the alliance was ""probably late to recognize"" aggressive Russian behavior for what it was.

He said Moscow takes advantage of the multitude of freedoms in Western society, something not possible in Russia's tightly controlled atmosphere. That, he said, put Western cyber-countermeasures at a disadvantage.

""Russia does not hesitate to abuse all of these freedoms to exert more influence using all methods, those that are legal and including those that are beyond legality,"" Pavel said.

Don't Underestimate (Or Overestimate) Russia

The NATO general also discounted a recent think-tank report that concluded Russia sharply cut its military budget in 2017.

""I don't think that we should make defense spending a major element of our calculus,"" he said. ""We have to look -- especially us in uniform -- at real capabilities. Russian military capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, are significant.""

Pavel appeared untroubled by Russian President Vladimir Putin's bold presentation of a host of new weapon systems during his state-of-the-union address in March.

""I don't want to underestimate [the] Russian capability to develop new weapons and come up with new technologically advanced systems,"" he said. ""But the way of presenting these new developments was much more to impress [the] population in Russia and to deliver [a] limited deterrence message to the opponents.""

To underline his point, he said, ""The presentation used by President Putin was mostly for local consumption.""

Macedonia By Any Other Name

As far as NATO expansion goes, Pavel said the so-called ""name issue"" was the only thing preventing Macedonia from being invited to join the alliance.

The long-running name dispute between Macedonia and Greece dates back to 1991, when Skopje declared independence following the collapse of communist Yugoslavia.

Athens objects to Macedonia's name because it has its own northern province called Macedonia, and fears it may imply territorial ambitions.

But Pavel noted that the Macedonian and Greek foreign ministers were ""cautiously optimistic"" about resolving their dispute over the issue.

He said that if ""everything goes well, it will take a couple of months or probably even half a year before this process is completed.""

A Czech, the 56-year-old Pavel is the highest-ranking Central European in NATO history. He was elected to head the alliance's Military Committee in 2014.

Experts in May reevaluated the potential changes in investors’ interest in the assets of these countries amidst the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate, the growth of interest rates and the intensification of trade disputes.

The IIF considers the assets of Russia, the Czech Republic, Colombia, Brazil and the Philippines less exposed to such risks.

Turkey, Argentina, the Republic of South Africa, Ukraine and India have the highest need for financing, the IIF analysts believe.

The most notable improvement compared to the previous year, including that in terms of reducing needs for funding and increasing the attractiveness of assets, was demonstrated by Indonesia. In addition, the situation has improved in Malaysia, Chile, Egypt, and Brazil.

India’s position has worsened significantly, which is largely due to an increase in the deficit of the current account of its balance of payments. A comparative increase of risks is also observed in Turkey, Poland, and Ukraine.
