0,ukraine,"There’s another twist in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The New York Times’s Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report that Mueller is looking into a $150,000 payment from a Ukrainian business to Donald Trump’s charitable foundation in 2015 in exchange for a video appearance by then-candidate Trump.

The existence of the payment to the Trump Foundation was reported shortly after the 2016 election; what’s new is that Mueller has reportedly taken an interest in it. It’s the latest hint that Mueller’s probe is looking beyond Russia and is scrutinizing Trump and his associates’ foreign business ties. In March, Mueller subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, with some reportedly related to Russia.

But apparently not just Russia. According to the New York Times, documents related to this $150,000 payment from Ukrainian steel tycoon Victor Pinchuk were turned over as part of that subpoena. In September 2015, early in the GOP primary race, Pinchuk donated $150,000 to the Trump Foundation. In return, Trump appeared via video conference at an event in Kiev promoting ties between Ukraine and Western countries.

Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, reportedly solicited the donation from Pinchuk. Cohen’s home, office, and hotel were raided by federal authorities Monday in relation to a payment Cohen made to porn actress Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. The raid doesn’t seem to be related to the Russia probe, though Cohen hasn’t entirely evaded scrutiny in the special counsel’s investigation.

A few other details stand out about the payment Pinchuk made. First, the six-figure contribution was the largest to the Trump Foundation in 2015 from a source other than Trump himself, according to the Times. Second is the fact that it went to the Trump Foundation — which came under scrutiny during the presidential campaign for its shady practices, specifically documents that showed Trump pulled about a quarter of a million dollars from the foundation’s budget to settle lawsuits related to his business. He also used foundation money to buy this $20,000 portrait of himself.

But again, Trump came under fire for taking the donation when it was first reported in 2016. That’s partly because Pinchuk — a controversial figure and the son-in-law of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma — was a prominent donor to the Clinton Foundation. Pinchuk gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation and reportedly once lent his private plane to the Clintons. (Doug Schoen, a political consultant with ties to Pinchuk, helped arrange Trump’s video appearance, as well as meetings between Pinchuk and State Department officials while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.)

Considering Trump’s rants against “Crooked Hillary,” it’s a bit ironic that Pinchuk is now appearing as a player in Trump’s own political scandal. And while it’s probably no surprise that Pinchuk would want to curry influence and advance his agenda with the president, the donation came early in the GOP primary, long before Trump was the presumptive nominee.

One more notable thing about Pinchuk’s agenda: Pinchuk promoted ties between Ukraine and the West, which runs counter to the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin (and those of the former pro-Russia Ukrainian president that Trump’s former campaign Paul Manafort, whom Mueller has indicted, worked for.) Trump, in his video speech, did mention Putin, saying that the Russian president “does not respect” then-President Barack Obama.

Either way, this latest investigative thread by Mueller will probably do little to abate Trump’s ire at the Russia investigation. On Monday, Trump railed against the special counsel’s probe, calling it a “witch hunt.” When a reporter asked why he didn’t just fire Mueller, Trump replied: “Why don’t I just fire Mueller? Well, I think it’s a disgrace, but I think it’s a sad situation when you look at what happened and many people have said you should fire him.”","Mueller reportedly investigating Ukrainian tycoon’s $150,000 donation to Trump Foundation",https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17217756/trump-robert-mueller-ukraine-trump-foundation
1,ukraine,"Blitz-interview with European Commission Deputy Director-General for Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Katarina Mathernova

There are talks on about launching European plan for Ukraine in the EU. During the Dragon Capital's investment conference you have also spoken about a new Macro-Financial Assistance programme for Ukraine. I wonder is this possible for these two programmes to exist together?

These are two entirely separate things. EU macro-financial assistance is intended to support a country during balance of payment difficulties. The assistance has its own logic, own rules and conditionality. It is designed to address macroeconomic issues and encourage economic adjustment and structural reforms. So that is one way to support Ukraine.

The External Investment Plan (EIP) that the European Union has put together and has launched, is quite separate; and is a plan to encourage private sector participation in economic development. This is a plan which extends to Africa, and to the EU's Eastern and Southern European neighbourhood. It is very relevant to Ukraine.

And don't forget as well that we also offer a very substantial portfolio of other support programmes to Ukraine through our European Neighborhood Instrument, not to mention the humanitarian assistance that we provide to those Ukrainians who have been affected by the conflict in the East.

At what stage are the discussions about the EU External Investment Plan and how soon Ukraine may apply for the financing under the EIP?

Funding for the European Investment Plan comes through the European Fund for Sustainable Development. Our international partners, the international financial and development institutions (IFIs), will actually implement projects financed through the Fund. They have already submitted 28 project proposals to be guaranteed by the Fund, with each proposal including a portfolio of projects. We consider this a very promising start, and Ukraine is well represented in several of the proposals. We have now started to evaluate them and our idea is to sign the first guarantee contracts after the summer. Once a contract is signed, the IFIs will work through private sector operators. The process has therefore well and truly started and we expect the first projects here in Ukraine to start by the end of the year.

Could you specify who may serve as an intermediate in Ukraine to apply for such project?

We are cooperating closely with European IFIs and EU Member States' national development banks. Let me give you just three examples: the EBRD (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), the EIB (European Investment Bank), and KfW (German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau). As our intermediaries they reach out to private sector operators by providing guarantees for local banks ready to get into riskier operations; and they can themselves invest in equity funds as well. In such cases they will take equity stakes in private enterprises. They can also directly guarantee corporate sector investments in specific projects finance schemes.

There is a conference scheduled for June in Denmark, where reforms in Ukraine will be discussed. I was told that one of the announcements to be made there will be launching of some special agency for coordination of financial programs in Ukraine. Could you confirm or refute this information?

I am well aware of the conference, and will be attending myself. It's something I'm very much looking forward to doing. Denmark has been a very good friend to Ukraine and a very supportive country. As friends of Ukraine we are all ready to look into any and all ideas for best enabling Ukraine to coordinate the financial assistance provided to the country by the international community. We will need to reflect on whether setting up a new agency for the coordination of financial programmes is the best way forward. A number of institutions and structures already exist and are already working to better coordinate support programmes offered by Ukraine's various international partners, and it may be more efficient to concentrate on strengthening those existing institutions.

According to my information, initiation of such agency was raised by IFIs, which from time to time point out ineffectiveness of absorption of funds provided to Ukraine.

There is very clearly a need to strengthen the capacity within Ukraine to generate good investment projects, and to implement those projects effectively once financed. There is no question about that. Yet there are different ways of achieving these improvements in capacity. Strengthening the institutions that already exist would seem to me to be the best and most efficient way forward.",ЕС Deputy Director Mathernova: There is very clearly a need to strengthen the capacity within Ukraine to generate good investment projects,http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/interview/497902.html

On several occasions in February more than five hundred of men, women, elderly and children were forced to stay overnight in highly insecure areas nearby or at the EECPs, as they were not able to cross the ‘contact line’. The Ukrainian traffic police also started an operation to stop so-called ‘irregular transportation’ to the EECPs Maiorske and Stanytsia Luhanska by not allowing unofficial buses to get near the checkpoint. Lack of transportation forced thousands of civilians including elderly, women and disabled people to walk up to five kilometres in heavy snow to reach the closest bus station. Despite harsh weather conditions, when temperatures across east Ukraine plummeted to below -20 Celsius, over 940,000 crossings were made through the five EECPs across the ‘contact line’ in February. Challenges, such as limited heating and sanitary facilities as well as long waiting hours further curtailed civilians’ freedom of movement. As of 1 March, operational hours of all five checkpoints were extended by 2.5 hours (07:00 to 18:30, compared to 08:00 – 17:00) as part of shifting to the so called ‘spring’ operational mode.",Ukraine: Checkpoints - Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 14 March 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-checkpoints-humanitarian-snapshot-14-march-2018
3,ukraine,"German chancellor says Nord Stream 2 project is not possible without clarity on Ukraine’s role

Angela Merkel has intervened in a row over a gas pipeline due to run from Russia to Germany, telling Vladimir Putin he cannot exclude Ukraine from the transit route.

The German chancellor has set herself up for a confrontation with the Russian president over the Nord Stream 2 project amid concerns Putin is attempting to increase western Europe’s dependency on Russian gas at the same time as eroding Ukraine’s importance in the project.

Speaking at a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, in Berlin on Tuesday, Merkel said: “It cannot be that Ukraine plays no significance with regards to the transit of gas.”

She said she had made her views clear to Putin during a telephone conversation on Monday. “I made very clear that a Nord Stream 2 project is not possible without clarity over the future transit role of Ukraine. So as you see, it’s not just an economic issue but there are political considerations as well.”

Germany, as well as other countries in northern Europe that see the benefits of increased gas supplies, has so far been a strong backer of the project, which would double the current Nord Stream pipeline’s annual capacity of 55bn cubic metres.

Ukraine could expect to earn around $3bn a year from transit fees, which Germany has stressed would provide a valuable source of income for a country whose economy has been battered by conflict with pro-Russia separatists.

Merkel admitted there was no avoiding Europe’s dependence on Russian gas. But Ukraine had to retain its strategic significance in the transit of that gas, she stressed.

Nord Stream 2 was established to bring additional supplies from northern Siberia via a shorter route than the existing one, which would help to keep costs down.

The Russian gas giant Gazprom is overseeing a partnership of European companies to build a 750-mile (1,200km) pipeline on the bed of the Baltic Sea to bring gas from the Yamal peninsula up to the German coastal town of Greifswald, from where it would be fed into the European grid. Licensing procedures in the participant countries are currently under way, with construction due to be completed in 2019.

The first Nord Stream pipeline, which began operating in 2011, is run by Gazprom together with German, French, Dutch and Austrian energy companies.

The Ost-Ausschuss, which represents the business interests of German companies in Russia that have already invested more than €4bn (£3.5bn) in the project, said confidence in the scheme would be weakened if its legal basis was changed for political reasons.

Before of his Berlin visit, Poroshenko, called Nord Stream 2 a “purely political project, aimed to finance Russia”. Last month in a separate interview he referred to the backers of Nord Stream 2 as “Russia’s accomplices in its hybrid wars”.",Merkel tells Putin not to exclude Ukraine from gas pipeline route,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/merkel-tells-putin-not-to-exclude-ukraine-from-gas-pipeline-route

By Jack Stubbs and Polina Nikolskaya

MOSCOW (Reuters) - An escalation in U.S. sanctions against Moscow risks derailing a fragile recovery in Russia's economy, which had just begun to take hold after the Kremlin's last confrontation with the West in 2014, analysts and investors said on Monday.

The United States imposed major new sanctions against Russia on Friday, striking at senior Russian officials and some of the country's biggest companies in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity"".

""One gets the impression that since 2014 we have been convinced that sanctions are painless for our economy,"" said Kirill Tremasov, head of research at Loko-Invest and former director of the Russian Economy Ministry's forecasting department.

""This is completely groundless. What happened on Friday opens a new stage in relations with Western countries. We have found ourselves in a new reality. And it is very, very serious.""

Analysts and investors in Moscow said the sanctions could consign Russia to years of low growth, frustrating government efforts to stimulate a rebound from a two-year downturn brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.

Putin was re-elected for his fourth presidential term in March with a huge majority, but is under increasing pressure to meet voters' expectations of better growth and assuage concerns about falling living standards.

SLOW-GROWTH ENVIRONMENT

After two years of contraction, Russian GDP returned to growth of 1.5 percent last year on the back of higher oil prices, still short of a government target of 2 percent.

Chris Weafer, a senior partner at economic and political consultancy Macro Advisory, said he still saw Russia's economy growing by 1.8 percent this year, with oil prices above $60 a barrel.

""But the big question, of course, is 'How long does Russia stay in this low-growth environment?' That's where the impact of sanctions happens,"" he said.

""We all know that the economy needs to grow at a faster pace over the course of the next (presidential) term, it needs to get stronger - and sanctions and the impact on foreign direct investment, that's where it comes in,"" he said. ""2018 is the year of Russia in the doldrums.""

The latest round of U.S. sanctions represents the biggest escalation in Western action against Russia since Washington and the European Union first targeted oligarchs close to Putin and their businesses over the Ukraine crisis in 2014.

Investors said the inclusion of people who are not traditionally seen as part of Putin's inner circle showed that any Russian company or business leader could now be targeted.

Russia's rouble suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years on Monday and stocks in major Russian companies also slid, as investors reacted to the new sanctions. State-owned Sberbank, often seen as a barometer of the wider economy, fell 17 percent in Moscow and aluminum giant Rusal <0486.HK> lost over half its value in Hong Kong after its main owner Oleg Deripaska was named on the sanctions list.

TIGHTER MONEY

The increased uncertainty and risk will make it harder for Russian companies to borrow abroad and reduce the amount of inward investment, said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management.

""Unless there is a move to de-escalation, you have to assume that financing conditions around Russia will get even tighter,"" he said. ""Long-term, that's going to be bad for growth and mean even more stagnation in the Russian economy.""

Natalia Orlova, head economist at Alfa Bank, said the central bank might now take more time over interest rate cuts that could boost growth: ""Based on economic logic ... it seems to me that it is dangerous to hurry with a rate cut in such uncertain conditions.""

Loko-Invest's Kirill Tremasov said the biggest danger of the new sanctions might be in scaring foreign investors off Russian OFZ treasury bonds, popular in the West because of their high yields.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year OFZ rose as high as 7.32 percent on Monday as the price of the bond fell. It had stood at around 7.05 percent last week.

Foreigners' holdings of OFZ bonds stood at nearly $40 billion, or 33.9 percent of all OFZ bonds as of Feb. 1, the last period for which data was available.

""For foreign investors, this is a very, very serious signal ... and now there could be some OFZ outflows,"" Tremasov said. ""This will be reflected in the growth of interest rates in the economy.""

6,ukraine,"The payment from Mr. Pinchuk “is curious because it comes during a campaign and is from a foreigner and looks like an effort to buy influence,” said Marcus S. Owens, a former head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. He called the donation “an unusual amount of money for such a short speech.”

Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, did not return several messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer for the Trump Organization. When The New York Times revealed the existence of the subpoena in March, Mr. Trump’s associates played it down as a routine court order to ensure the Trump Organization had handed over all the documents Mr. Mueller had demanded.

Mr. Trump assailed the special counsel investigation on Monday as a “witch hunt,” reaching for a favored insult in response to the seizure of Mr. Cohen’s records. He complained that he had cooperated with the inquiry and viewed the warrant for the raid, obtained by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after a referral from Mr. Mueller, as an extreme step.

“It’s a disgraceful situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “It’s a total witch hunt. I’ve been saying it for a long time. I’ve wanted to keep it down. I’ve given over a million pages in documents to the special counsel.”

Mr. Mueller has also examined a deal Mr. Cohen was putting together with Mr. Trump to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mr. Trump said last summer that Mr. Mueller should not look at his or his family’s finances beyond issues related directly to Russia.

But the special counsel’s investigators have questioned witnesses about whether money from the Persian Gulf had been used to finance Mr. Trump’s political efforts and asked for information on Mr. Pinchuk.

The inquiry into the Trump Organization’s payments from foreign nationals underscores how diffuse Mr. Trump’s sources of income have been over many years. And the destination of Mr. Pinchuk’s donation — the Trump Foundation instead of the president’s personal coffers — raised fresh questions about how the president handled the entity he set up to deal with charitable giving.

Mr. Trump’s foundation attracted scrutiny during the 2016 campaign over revelations about his lack of financial support for it and his use of it to pay legal settlements rather than fulfill pledges he made to give to charity. In 2007, Mr. Trump used $20,000 from the foundation to buy a six-foot-tall portrait of himself.

Two weeks after he was elected president, the foundation acknowledged in a tax form that it might have broken federal rules designed to prohibit self-dealing, when charities use their money to benefit principals in their organization.

In the same filing, the foundation disclosed the donation from Mr. Pinchuk for Mr. Trump’s video appearance.

Mr. Pinchuk is the son-in-law of a former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, who from 1994 to 2005 led a government criticized for corruption, nepotism and the murder of dissident journalists. Mr. Pinchuk, who has been accused by steel makers in the United States of illegally dumping steel on the American market at artificially low prices, drew more scrutiny during the campaign for his ties to Hillary Clinton and her family foundation. He has donated more than $13 million to that organization since 2006.

Mr. Trump’s appearance was broadcast at the Yalta European Strategy conference, which promotes pro-European Union policies for Ukraine. Through his own foundation, Mr. Pinchuk sponsors the affair, which typically attracts well-known former Western leaders like former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and former President Bill Clinton. It was moved to Kiev after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

In a statement, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation said it reached out to Mr. Trump and other world leaders to help “promote strengthened and enduring ties between Ukraine and the West.”

The foundation said the donation was “a specific request of Mr. Trump Foundation in September of 2015 when there were multiple candidates for the Republican nomination for president and it was by no means assured that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016.”

At the time, Mr. Trump occupied an unusual position in the presidential race. Though he was the Republican front-runner, the primary field was crowded and he was being vetted or seriously considered by few, if any, in the news media or the Republican establishment.

The event, his first foray into global politics during the campaign, was set up by Doug Schoen, a veteran political consultant and pollster who works with Mr. Pinchuk, according to a person familiar with how the speech was arranged. Mr. Schoen, a frequent Fox News guest, has known Mr. Trump for years and contacted him personally to set it up at the end of August 2015, according to the person.

Mr. Trump did not raise the prospect of any payment. But the next day, Mr. Cohen called Mr. Schoen to solicit the $150,000 as an honorarium, the person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Schoen, who had gotten to know Mr. Cohen by running into him in the green room at Fox News, dealt with him and not Mr. Trump directly, according to another person briefed on the exchange.

The Kiev talk received little attention, with the scant coverage focused on the awkward nature of Mr. Trump’s delivery. He repeatedly stopped speaking, apparently believing he had to pause to give translators time to relay what he was saying.

“You need not wait for any translation,” Mr. Schoen finally told him.

Mr. Trump continued to pause and said he was having trouble hearing. “The sound system is terrible because there is a huge delay and feedback,” he said.

Mr. Trump used the appearance to criticize President Barack Obama amid deteriorating relations between the United States and Russia over its incursions into Ukraine, which had begun a year earlier. “Our president is not strong and he is not doing what he should be doing for the Ukraine,” Mr. Trump said, using the article before Ukraine, which is seen as insulting by some Ukrainians.

“Putin does not respect our president whatsoever,” he said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Ukraine, once a part of the Soviet Union, has been at the center of another part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. He is investigating the consulting work done in Kiev by Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, for the country’s pro-Russian former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of tax fraud and other financial crimes.

He resigned from Mr. Trump’s campaign in August 2016 after handwritten ledgers were made public showing that he received $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments from Mr. Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012.","Mueller Investigating Ukrainian’s $150,000 Payment for a Trump Appearance",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html

9,ukraine,"Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating a payment made to President Trump's foundation by a Ukranian billionaire for a speech Mr. Trump made in 2015 during his presidential campaign, according to the New York Times.

After federal investigators subpoenaed the Trump Organization, documents were handed over detailing a $150,000 payment made by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the Times reported. Mr. Trump in September 2015 gave a 20-minute speech to a conference in Kiev, Ukraine, via video video link, commenting on everything from Syria, to having a ""weak"" president in Barack Obama, to his poll numbers. In the video, Mr. Trump frequently referred to Ukraine as ""the Ukraine,"" generally an offensive reference to Ukrainians. The speech was a slightly awkward one, with Mr. Trump apparently experiencing a delay and audio problems, prompting some laughs from the audience.

Pinchuk is a Ukranian businessman and oligarch, who built his wealth particularly from steel.

During the campaign, Mr. Trump and Republicans criticized former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for accepting payments for speeches from foreign governments via the Clinton Family Foundation. Pinchuk also donated $13 million to the Clinton Family Foundation over several years, since 2006, according to the Times.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

2017 witnessed worsening human toll of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, which continues unabated. With a lack of complete adherence to renewed ceasefire agreements, nearly 14,000 security incidents-- an average of 38 incidents a day-- were recorded in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, majority of which were concentrated in the area along the 457-kilometre ‘contact line’. Daily hostilities claimed almost 600 civilian lives and caused damage to houses and critical civilian infrastructures repeatedly. Civilians were caught between parties to the conflict facing abuses, risks from mines, unexploded ordnance and clashes, while less able to access assistance. The ‘contact line’, which is rapidly becoming one of the most mine contaminated lands in the world, long became a de facto border that not only severed socioeconomic connection and inter-dependence between the Government controlled areas (GCA) and NGCA, but also hampered access to essential basic services and goods. Today, one in four Ukrainians suffers from detrimental consequences of the protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine. As resources are shrinking, millions of people, including 1.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), half of whom are the elderly, are being forced to make impossible choices between food, medicine, shelter, heating or their children’s education and rely on humanitarian assistance to survive.

Meanwhile, reported humanitarian funding to Ukraine was halved from US$246 million in 2016 to $127 million in 2017. The 2017 HRP faced a severe underfunding, with only US$71 million received (or 35 per cent of the $204 requirement) – a 32 per cent decrease from $105 million the 2016 HRP received. Humanitarians were forced to terminate several critical operations, while some were even forced to close down. Their decision to end their activities means bigger gaps to fill for those remaining, and ultimately, reduced assistance to the most vulnerable people in need.

Despite funding challenges, humanitarian community mounted a collective response and reached an estimated 1.1 million people with some form of humanitarian assistance at least once. This represents a 47 per cent achievement of 2.4 million people targeted. While the figure may appear somewhat positive, particularly against a very low funding, it has to be interpreted carefully. Overall, it shows a significant decline in the reach of the response by approximately 20 per cent, compared to that of 2016. This seems to directly correlate with the decrease in funding in 2017. In addition, the figure also counts people, who received any type of assistance at least once in a year. In other words, it is not a reflection of the depth and sustained continuation of assistance. Finally, the figure is a result of a carry-over effect of financial resources from 2016 to 2017 given the multiple donors’ different fiscal year cycles and multi-year funding mechanism that are not particularly in line with that of the HRP single year cycle.

A clear set of cash-specific indicators embedded in the 2017 HRP allows for a measurable achievement of cash-based assistance in 2017. Approximately 181,000 people received humanitarian assistance disbursed as cash or voucher. However, coverage of cash-based assistance was limited mainly in the GCA only provided that markets were found to continue functioning and where banking and postal services offered a safe and efficient delivery mechanisms.

Furthermore, a closer look at the geographical breakdown also reveals an uneven distribution of the number of people reached in the GCA and NGCA vis a vis the targets. Persistent insecurity along the ‘contact line’ and continuous hindrances for humanitarian actors to access people living in NGCA compelled humanitarian organizations to adopt a ‘pragmatic’ approach in programming, re-allocating resources to other beneficiaries in accessible areas that met similar vulnerability criteria. As such, some 850,000 of 1.1 million people reached were those in the GCA, including IDPs and those crossing from the NGCA to GCA to access assistance, while only around one-quarter of the targeted population in NGCA, where needs were identified, were reached.

The three Strategic Objectives (SOs) of the HRP 2017 were met at varying degrees individually, but at a lower rate of achievement collectively compared with 2016. Specifically, the target of SO1 - focusing on responding to protection needs of conflict-affected people- was achieved by 42 per cent, with an estimated 1 million receiving some type of protection-related assistance. However, the limited humanitarian access to the NGCA throughout 2017 meant that, out of 1.3 million people in the NGCA initially targeted, protection-related assistance reached only 15 per cent.

The SO2 focusing on delivering life-saving emergency assistance was achieved by only 28 per cent, primarily due to the regular hostilities, increasing emergency needs and constant demands for response vis a vis limited resources. Meanwhile, the SO3 focusing on improving the resilience and early recovery of conflict-affected people achieved only 4 per cent of the target. The low level of achievement against the SO3 called for enhanced commitments and actions for humanitarian and development actors to strengthen humanitarian-development nexus through a range of well-aligned short, medium and longer-term approaches in reducing risks and addressing pre-existing systemic weaknesses.

While the HRP did not reflect the full spectrum of humanitarian actions due to its strict prioritization, it served as a strategic tool that identified shared humanitarian priorities based on common analysis of the situation of needs. As such, the 2017 End-of-Year report captures and recognizes the valuable contribution of non-HRP partners who provided information and coordinated their activities, contributing to achieving common goals in alleviating the suffering of conflict-affected people.","Ukraine - 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) End-of-Year Report, January-December 2017 - Feb 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-2017-humanitarian-response-plan-hrp-end-year-report-january-december-2017-feb

The fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region is entering its fifth year. More than 10,000 people have been killed in this persistent conflict; 2,800 were civilians. Nearly two million people have been internally displaced or put at risk if they remain in their homes.

Today, the Donbas war is among the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with frequent attacks occurring from both sides across the oblasts (provinces) of Donetsk and Luhansk. Before the war, this compact, heavily urbanized and industrialized region held nearly 15 percent of Ukraine’s population (6.6 million) and generated 16 percent of its gross domestic product.

Now it’s a war zone. And our research has documented that, as its hospitals and medical facilities are destroyed — perhaps even targeted — its citizens are being deprived of basic health-care services, echoing Syria’s similar if larger crisis.

So what happened in Ukraine?

Let’s review quickly how that happened.

In 2014, Ukraine was divided between those who wanted to affiliate with Russia and those who leaned toward Europe and NATO. In Kiev, in what was called the Maidan Revolution, the pro-Europe faction overthrew the kleptocratic and Russian-leaning Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

[ When does Russian propaganda work — and when does it backfire? Here’s what we found. ]

Reactions in the Donbas, a region bordering Russia and composed of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, varied. Separatist forces, abetted by Russia, began fighting the Ukrainian military, soon fortified by backup from Russian army units. That fighting has damaged the Donbas’s basic infrastructure, particularly hospitals and clinics — making it hard for the government to deliver core services such as health care.

How we did our research

Combatants often attack hospitals. In Syria, human rights organizations and the U.N. Security Council have denounced these attacks as violations of international law. Fewer observers have noticed the attacks on Ukraine’s hospitals, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) documented 33 such attacks from 2014 through 2016.

As part of a larger study, we compiled an inventory of the 247 registered hospitals and clinics in the Donbas. We then examined U.N. reports, investigations by nongovernmental organizations, central news reports in Ukraine and Russia, and Donetsk and Luhansk newspapers for evidence of health-care infrastructure damage from 2014 through 2017. We geo-located all specific reports of damage, eliminating duplicates.

We found that one-third of all Donbas medical facilities had been damaged

Our resulting geospatial database reveals patterns of “bricks and mortar” damage to the health-care system, as you can see below.

Adjusting for multiple hits, we found that 82 medical facilities — one-third of all those in the Donbas — had reported damage. That’s far more than those reported by WHO.

However, the bricks-and-mortar damage doesn’t show casualties among medical personnel or the loss of vehicles. Nor does it show how local civilians suffered severe damage to their housing and access to heat, electricity and clean water. Many of the residents who’ve stayed must now risk a great deal to reach even basic health care.

[ Could U.N. peacekeepers help end the war in Ukraine? ]

Is this a surprise? Are health-care facilities deliberately attacked?

There are no safe places in a major war

The Donbas conflict is often described as “hybrid warfare,” something akin to Russia’s seizure of Crimea with “little green men.” This is a serious mischaracterization.

Yes, at first it was a skirmish between Ukrainian security forces and local separatist militias, bolstered by Russian mercenaries. But by late 2014, the fighting involved large numbers of troops including Russian army regulars, outfitted with armor and artillery.

Most of the health-care damage happened during the heaviest fighting, before February 2015. Since then, damage has been limited to breaks in the cease-fire agreements. Health infrastructure is damaged when it’s located near the heaviest fighting. Away from the front, we found little harm to medical facilities.

Mapping our data illustrates that attacks on health-care facilities are concentrated in the city of Donetsk and its environs; along the cease-fire line, where the front stabilized after February 2015; and around the city of Sloviansk, which was occupied by separatist forces but later retaken by Ukrainian troops. Along the coast of the Sea of Azov, advances by Russian troops and separatists resulted in a cluster of attacks near Mariupol. Northern Luhansk Oblast and western Donetsk Oblast saw little heavy fighting, and therefore little damage.

Were hospitals targets?

Many health-care facilities in the Donbas were destroyed. Was this deliberate — or was it collateral damage? We looked at what types of weapons were used, for some clues.

In the Syrian civil war, heavy aerial bombardment destroyed a vast amount of infrastructure. By contrast, the Donbas fighting has used conventional artillery, heavy mortars and rockets such as the notorious Grad (“Hail”) system. Such indirect-fire weapons are not accurate enough to target specific buildings. Those using them often can’t see the target — so to destroy a particular target building, such weapons would succeed only when used in sufficient numbers, and would leave behind a great deal of collateral damage.

Some medical locations might have been attacked by shorter-range, direct-fire weapons such as tanks, antitank missiles or rocket-propelled grenades. Examining both witness accounts and the blast patterns in photos of derelict health-care facilities, we find that the damage appears to be what we would expect from artillery rounds or rockets.

It looks more like hospitals and clinics have been collateral damage than targets

When military targets are attacked and are fighting back, it’s hard to conclude which side damaged the surrounding civilian infrastructure. Reliable reports document that both sides have quartered troops in or fired from hospitals, blurring the line between combatant and noncombatant.

In other conflicts, forensic examination of fragments or unexploded ordnance helps identify the type of munitions used to attack hospitals — making it easier to conclude which side attacked which target. But in the Donbas war, both sides mostly use the same weaponry, making it difficult to deduce which side attacked the health-care facilities.

Were attacks on health-care facilities deliberate? Our preliminary examination suggests that they haven’t been targeted. They appear to have suffered collateral damage, and have been hit by both sides. To draw conclusions about responsibility, one would need to employ the sophisticated open-source data and methods used to analyze the Syrian war damage.

No matter who is responsible, the fighting has damaged not just health-care services, but other civilian infrastructure such as housing, schools and election facilities — while killing, terrifying and displacing civilians. If Ukraine can’t deliver essential services, the war has undermined the legitimacy of the state and made it harder to reach a reconciliation if and when the conflict ends.

Surkov wrote this in an article for Russia in Global Affairs magazine released April 9, 2018.

Surkov wrote in the piece for Russia in Global Affairs that ""Russia's epic journey toward the West"" is over, marking an end to its ""repeated vain attempts to become part of Western civilization"" over four centuries.

Russia-West ties have sunk to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and other issues, most recently the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that triggered mass expulsions of diplomats.

Surkov, a longtime Putin aide who served as his top strategist for many years and currently works as the presidential adviser on Ukraine, wrote: ""Loneliness doesn't mean complete isolation,"" but added that Russia's openness would be limited.

Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine triggered U.S. and European Union sanctions that together with a slump in global oil prices sent the Russian economy into a two-year recession.

A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped reduce the scale of the hostilities in eastern Ukraine, but regular clashes have continued.

Surkov, who held several rounds of fruitless talks on the Ukrainian crisis with U.S. counterpart Kurt Volker, said 2014 marked a watershed that in his view launched ""a century (or perhaps two or three centuries) of geopolitical loneliness.""

The hostilities picked up again on both sides of the ‘contact line’ after a relative lull in January, while harsh weather conditions, with temperatures plummeting to below -20 Celsius over the last week of February further deepened people’s suffering.

Interruption of operations of the 1st Lift Pumping Station of the South Donbas Water Pipeline due to harsh weather alone left 100,000 people without water or heat for more than 24 hours. Of alarming concern is the incidents targeting staff and infrastructure at the Donetsk Filter Station (DFS) which supplies water to 345,000 men, women and children in eastern Ukraine.

Russian R-330Zh Zhitel GPS / satcom / cellular jammer deployed in an exercise, 2017 (topwar.ru)

By MarEx 2018-04-10 20:50:00

Maritime security experts have warned for years about the hazards that simple GPS jamming methods could pose to merchant shipping. According to American defense officials, the Russian military is deploying a weaponized form of GPS jamming that is effectively blocking some U.S. drone aircraft operations over Syria - and is even affecting drones equipped with anti-jamming technology. As more and more operators contemplate the deployment of autonomous vessels and aircraft in the maritime space, the vulnerability of high-specification military hardware to GPS jamming may pose a cautionary tale.

So far, the attacks have only affected small surveillance drones, four officials told NBC News, not the U.S. Air Force's armed Predator and Reaper models. They declined to discuss whether any of the small aircraft had gone down as a result of jamming. High-end drones like the Global Hawk, Predator and Reaper are equipped with inertial navigation systems, which do not depend upon external signals for positioning, in addition to their GPS receivers.

According to the U.S. Army's Asymmetric Warfare Group, the Russian military has invested heavily in electronic warfare gear in recent years, and its units ""layer these systems to shut down FM, SATCOM, cellular, GPS, and other signals.” Russian forces have used these jamming capabilities before. During the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russian forces grounded a U.N. surveillance drone fleet during operations in Eastern Ukraine using GPS jamming, and Ukrainian forces reported widespread comms degradation. Last year, the U.S. Maritime Administration reported a GPS spoofing attack off the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, which caused the GPS displays on multiple merchant ships to show incorrect positions. The incident was not definitively linked to Russian forces, but reports indicate that it affected at least 20 ships.

Jamming coincides with suspected poison gas attack

The jamming incidents over Syria have been happening for several weeks, according to NBC News. The time period and the location of the jamming overlap with the latest series of suspected chemical weapons attacks on civilians in rebel-held eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, and U.S. officials told NBC that they believed that Russian forces used the jamming to impede aerial surveillance after the incidents. The U.S. is currently considering retaliatory measures for the use of chemical weapons on a civilian population; Russia, which backs the Syrian government regime of Bashar al-Assad, has denied that the attacks occurred.

Five years ago, Ghouta was the scene of another massive chemical weapons attack: on August 21, Syrian forces used rockets filled with sarin gas to kill between 280 and 1,700 people in the region, including civilians. To prevent a Western military intervention, Syria's government reached a diplomatic agreement with the U.S. to dispose of all of its chemical weapons, with Russia as the guarantor of the program. The U.S. alleges that Russia has not fulfilled this role. “For Russia to claim that the Assad regime has eliminated its chemical stockpiles is just absurd. Its continued denial of the Assad’s regime culpability in the use of chemical weapons is simply incredible,” U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said in February.

16,ukraine,"On April 4, Volodymyr Yelchenko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, spoke at the University about the now four-year-long crisis of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the brutal “hybrid war” being waged in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Yelchenko began by summarizing the events of the past four years.

According to Yelchenko, the crisis began on Feb. 26, 2014, with “little green men” — unmarked Russian soldiers without insignias, armed with modern weapons, and moving in armored vehicles.

Yelchenko explained that these soldiers seized key infrastructure sites and that overnight, the Crimean parliament was seized and a pro-Russian government took power. This government promptly held a referendum on whether to stay in Ukraine or join Russia.

But no one in the international community regarded Crimea’s referendum as official, according to Yelchenko. Then, on March 18, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation.

Tensions quickly expanded beyond Crimea. As Ukrainians ousted their pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, separatist groups in the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk began an active armed conflict with the Ukrainian government, supported by Russian hardware and personnel support, Yelchenko explained.

This quasi-war has since flared up occasionally. Yelchenko and the Ukrainian government estimate the total death count to be approximately 10,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

Ukraine has since improved relations with the West, distancing itself from the expansionist Russia, Yelchenko explained, citing that Ukrainian citizens can travel to European Union states without visas, bringing Ukraine closer to Western Europe.

The United States has placed heavy trade sanctions on the Russian Federation, which, according to Yelchenko, have reduced the Russian gross domestic product by about 35 percent.

Meanwhile, without seven percent of its land and while fighting an active civil war, Ukrainian GDP has risen up to two percent per quarter, mostly due to closer ties with the European Union.

However, while the issue has largely disappeared from the public’s eye, casualties occur in Ukraine almost daily, according to Yelchenko.

“All human life is precious. One death is a tragedy,” Yelchenko said.

Russia’s goals remain in line with the goals of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, primarily territorial expansion, and Russian tactics and technology have evolved greatly since the collapse of the USSR, Yelchenko said.

For the West, there are several critical conclusions to draw on, according to the ambassador. Fake news, cyber attacks on critical infrastructure such as power plants, and the use of internet trolls have all been implemented to create a doctrine of hybrid war, according to Yelchenko.

Yelchenko explained that no one is entirely sure what hybrid warfare is. This hybrid war strategy has been implemented alongside traditional military tactics and equipment to take territory without drawing international attention or responses.

It is suspected that these same tactics have been used to influence foreign elections and governments far beyond the nations bordering Russia.

Yelchenko’s talk was sponsored by the Center for International Security Studies; the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies; the Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies; and the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination.

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has abandoned its centuries-long aspirations of integrating into the West and is bracing for a new era of ""geopolitical loneliness,"" a top adviser to President Vladimir Putin warned in a magazine article released Monday.

Vladislav Surkov wrote in the piece for Russia in Global Affairs that ""Russia's epic journey toward the West"" is over, marking an end to its ""repeated vain attempts to become part of Western civilization"" over four centuries.

Surkov's article echoes statements from Putin. The Russian leader sought to forge close ties with the West after his first election in 2000, but later grew increasingly critical of the United States and its NATO allies. He accuses them of shunning Moscow's offers of cooperation and trying to sideline and weaken his country.

Russia-West ties have sunk to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and other issues, most recently the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that triggered mass expulsions of diplomats.

Surkov, a longtime Putin aide who served as his top strategist for many years and currently works as the presidential adviser on Ukraine, wrote: ""Loneliness doesn't mean complete isolation,"" but added that Russia's openness would be limited.

Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine triggered U.S. and European Union sanctions that together with a slump in global oil prices sent the Russian economy into a two-year recession.

A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped reduce the scale of the hostilities in eastern Ukraine, but regular clashes have continued.

Surkov, who held several rounds of fruitless talks on the Ukrainian crisis with U.S. counterpart Kurt Volker, said 2014 marked a watershed that in his view launched ""a century (or perhaps two or three centuries) of geopolitical loneliness.""

He lamented futile attempts at Westernization by past Russian rulers, noting that Russia has attempted to imitate the Netherlands, France and the United States and ""edge into the West"" during its history.

""Our elite perceived the ideas and trepidations coming from it with a huge and probably excessive enthusiasm,"" Surkov said.

Not any more, he warned.

""Russia without doubt will engage in trade, attract investments, exchange know-how and fight wars ... compete and cooperate, cause fear, hatred, curiosity, sympathy and admiration,"" Surkov wrote. ""But without false goals and self-denial.""

The 53-year-old Surkov, a colorful character who admires American rapper Tupac Shakur and has written novels, ended his piece on a somewhat enigmatic note.

""It's going to be tough,"" he said, adding that Russia will face a long journey ""through the thorns to the stars.""

On 7 April, the SMM observed damage caused by shelling at three residential properties, two of which were inhabited at the time, on Myru Street in Sakhanka (non-government-controlled, 24km north-east of Mariupol). Two metres east of the eastern wall of a single-family house at 35 Myru Street, the SMM observed a fresh crater. The wall itself was scarred by innumerable 1-2cm-wide pockmarks. In a field 5m north of a summer kitchen at 37 Myru Street, the SMM observed a second fresh crater. The north-facing wall of the summer kitchen was also scarred by 1-2cm wide pockmarks. In the fields adjacent to the single-family house at 38 Myru Street, the SMM observed five fresh craters five, ten and 30m south of the house and 50 and 60m south-east of the house. The SMM observed that two south-facing windows of the house itself had been boarded up, while the house’s south-facing wall as well as two water tanks and a tractor standing south of the house were all scarred similarly to the walls of the previous two sites. The SMM assessed all the craters to have been caused by the explosions of 82mm mortar shells fired from a south-western direction. Four local residents – including three who said had been in the houses at 27 and 38 Myru street when the explosions occurred – separately told the SMM that the explosions had occurred around 21:20 on 5 April, one added that for more than an hour before the explosions, there had been an exchange of small-arms fire nearby that had devolved into shelling.

The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (government-controlled, 16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (government-controlled, 60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (non-government-controlled, 41km south of Donetsk), as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM’s access remained restricted, but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.*

On 5 April, the SMM camera in Petrivske recorded an explosion 2-3km south-south-west and an explosion 2-3km north-west assessed as an impact, both assessed as outside the disengagement area and 15 tracer rounds in flight from east to west 1.5-2km south, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

On the early morning of 7 April, while on the eastern edge of Stanytsia Luhanska, the SMM heard an undetermined explosion 4km south-west; it could not assess whether it was in- or outside the disengagement area. On the evening of the same day, while in the same location, the SMM heard seven undetermined explosions 4km west, assessed as outside the disengagement area.

On the evening of 8 April, the SMM camera in Stanytsia Luhanska recorded an undetermined explosion and 11 shots of small-arms fire 300m south, assessed as inside the disengagement area.

On 7 and 8 April, positioned near the disengagement areas near Petrivske and Zolote, the SMM observed calm situations.

On 9 April, positioned near all three disengagement areas, the SMM observed calm situations.

The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Package of Measures and its Addendum as well as the Memorandum.

In violation of withdrawal lines in government-controlled areas, an SMM mini unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted two surface-to-air missile systems (9K35 Strela-10): one near Vodiane (94km south of Donetsk) on 5 April and one east of Mariupol (102km south of Donetsk) on 6 April.

In non-government-controlled areas, on 4 April, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted an anti-tank gun (MT-12 Rapira, 100mm) near Stavky (30km north of Donetsk). On 6 April the SMM saw eight self-propelled howitzer (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) near Manuilivka (65km east of Donetsk) and an SMM mid-range UAV spotted three tanks (two T-64 and one T-72) in the yards of houses in Verkhnoshyrokivske (formerly Oktiabr, 85km south of Donetsk) and two tanks (T-64) in Sosnivske (78km south of Donetsk). On 7 April, an SMM mini-UAV spotted six tanks (T-64) and three propelled howitzers (2S1) near Sofiivka (formerly Karlo‑Marksove, 40km north-east of Donetsk); the SMM saw seven self-propelled howitzers (2S1), seven tanks (T-72), seven multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) (BM-21 Grad, 122mm), seven surface-to-air missile systems (9K35), and ten towed howitzers (five 2A65 Msta-B, 152mm, and five D-30 Lyagushka, 122mm) at an airfield on the south-eastern outskirts of Luhansk city (for previous observations, see SMM Daily Report 6 April 2018). On 9 April at the same location, the SMM again saw seven self-propelled howitzers (2S1), seven tanks (T‑72), seven multiple launch rocket systems (BM-21), seven surface-to-air missile systems (9K35) and ten towed howitzers (five 2A65 and five D-30).

Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites near Kostiantynivka (government-controlled, 60km north of Donetsk), on 8 April the SMM saw a surface-to-air missile system (9K37).

The SMM observed weapons that could not be verified as withdrawn, as their storage did not comply with the criteria set out in the 16 October 2015 notification from the SMM to the signatories of the Package of Measures on effective monitoring and verification of the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In government-controlled areas of Donetsk region on 7 April, the SMM noted the following weapons were missing: 41 towed howitzers (D-20, 152mm) (including nine missing for the first time), 18 self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya, 152mm), 56 towed howitzers (44 2A36 Giatsint-B, 152mm, and 12 2A65), and six anti-tank guns (D-48, 85mm). The following day, the SMM saw a surface-to-air missile system (9K35) and eight MLRS (BM-21) and noted that the following weapons were again missing: a surface-to-air missile system (9K35), a self-propelled howitzer (2S1) and 15 MLRS (BM-21). On 9 April, the SMM noted that 24 anti-tank guns (MT-12) and four towed mortars (2B9 Vasilek, 82mm) remained missing.

The same day in non-government-controlled areas, the SMM saw six self-propelled howitzers (2S1) and noted that five mortars (four PM-38, 120mm, and a 2B11) remained missing.

The SMM revisited a permanent storage site whose location was beyond the respective withdrawal lines in a government-controlled area of Donetsk region on 7 April and noted 14 mortars (2B11 Sani, 120mm) remained missing. On 9 April, the SMM visited two such sites in areas of Donetsk outside government control and noted 14 tanks (eight T-64 and six T-72), nine mortars (2B14 Podnos, 82mm), and 15 anti-tank guns (MT-12) remained missing.

The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[2], anti-aircraft weapons, and trenches in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, on 4 April, near Novhorodske (35km north of Donetsk), an SMM mid-range UAV spotted an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) (BMP-2) and newly dug trenches. On 5 April, near Avdiivka, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted an armoured personnel carrier (APC) (BTR-80). On 6 April, the SMM saw two IFVs (BMP-2): one near Mykolaivka (40km south of Donetsk) and one near Novohnativka (40km south of Donetsk); an SMM mini-UAV spotted five self-propelled anti-aircraft systems (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 23mm) east of Mariupol. On 7 April, the SMM saw an APC (MT-LB) near Muratove (51km north-west of Luhansk).

In non-government-controlled areas, on 6 April, an SMM mid-range spotted two APCs (BTR-70) and an IFV (BMP variant) near Verkhnoshyrokivske and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23, 23mm) mounted on an APC (MT-LB) near Sosnivske. On 7 April an SMM mini-UAV spotted nine IFVs (BMP-1), an APC (MT-LB) and an anti-aircraft gun (ZU-23) near Lobacheve (13km east of Luhansk) as well as three IFV (BMP variants) near Sofiivka; the SMM saw seven IFVs (BMP-2), seven APCs (BTR-80) and an armoured recovery vehicle (BREM-1) at an airfield on the south-eastern outskirts of Luhansk city. On 9 April, the SMM saw seven IFVs (BMP-2), seven APCs (BTR-80) and an armoured recovery vehicle (BREM-1) at the same location as well as freshly dug trenches near Zhovte (17km north-west of Luhansk).

The SMM continued to observe mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). On 30 March, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted about 170 anti-tank mines laid out in four rows in a field north-east of road H15 south-east of Marinka (23km south-west of Donetsk) for the first time. On 5 April, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted about 160 surface-laid mines laid in two minefields near Avdiivka for the first time, one minefield south-west of the Avdiivka (at least 93 anti-tank mines) and one minefield south of Avdiivka (at least 71 anti-tank mines). The same day, about 750m north-west of the contact line near Zaitseve (50km north-east of Donetsk), an SMM mid-range UAV spotted over 300 surface-laid anti-tank mines (TM-62). On 8 April, approximately 1km south-west of Molodizhne (non-government-controlled, 63km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM observed the tailfin of a recoilless-gun (SPG-9, 73mm) round embedded in a road; it assessed this tailfin to have been there for some time.

The SMM visited nine border areas not under government control. On 6 April, while at a border crossing point near Marynivka (78km east of Donetsk) for an hour, the SMM saw 11 cars (four with Ukrainian and six with Russian Federation licence plates, and one with “DPR” plates) and a pedestrian exiting Ukraine as well as 13 cars (three with Ukrainian and eight with Russian licence plates, and two with “DPR” plates), two covered cargo trucks (one with Ukrainian licence plates, one with “DPR” plates) and two pedestrians entering Ukraine.

On 7 April, while at a border crossing point near Novoborovytsi (79km south of Luhansk) for 45 minutes, the SMM observed a woman and a young girl enter Ukraine. The same day while at a border crossing point near Uspenka (73km south-east of Donetsk) for 45 minutes, the SMM observed 25 cars (five with Ukrainian, nine with Russian Federation, one with Lithuanian and one with Georgian licence plates, and nine with “DPR” plates), seven covered cargo trucks (three with Ukrainian and four with Russian Federation licence plates), and two busses (one with Ukrainian and one with Russian Federation licence plates) exiting Ukraine as well as 21 cars (eight with Ukrainian, nine with Russian Federation and one with Lithuanian licence plates, and three with “DPR” plates), five covered cargo trucks (two with Russian Federation and one with Belarussian licence plates, and two with “DPR” plates) and two buses (both with “DPR” plates) entering Ukraine. Also on 7 April, while at a border crossing point near Ulianivske (61km south-east of Donetsk) for 30 minutes, the SMM saw three pedestrians exiting Ukraine and two pedestrians entering Ukraine.

On 8 April, while at a border crossing point near Izvaryne (52km south-east of Luhansk) for about 20 minutes, the SM observed seven pedestrians entering Ukraine.* The same day while at a border crossing point near Verkhnoharasymivka (57km south-east of Luhansk) for about 25 minutes, the SMM observed about thirty pedestrians (mixed gender, aged 20-40) entering Ukraine.

On 9 April, while at a border crossing point near Dovzhanske (84km south-east of Luhansk) for about two minutes, the SMM observed no traffic.* The same day while at a border crossing point near Voznesenivka (formerly Chervonopartyzansk, 65km south-east of Luhansk) for about one minute, the SMM observed no traffic.* At a border crossing point near Ulianivske for 15 minutes, the SMM observed no traffic entering or exiting Ukraine. While at a border crossing point near Uspenka for an hour, the SMM observed 15 cars (six with Ukrainian, four with Russian Federation and one with Georgian licence plates, and four with “DPR” plates), one bus (with Ukrainian licence plates) and 15 pedestrians entering Ukraine as well as 30 cars (six with Ukrainian, 14 with Russian Federation and one with Georgian licence plates, and nine with “DPR” plates), nine covered cargo trucks (seven with Ukrainian and one with Russian Federation plates; one with “DPR” plates) and a bus (plates not visible) and 16 pedestrians exiting Ukraine. While at a border crossing point near Novoazovsk (101km south-east of Donetsk) for about an hour, the SMM observed seven cars (three with Ukrainian licence plates, two with Russian Federation licence plates, and two with “DPR” plates) and seven covered cargo trucks (six with Ukrainian and one with Russian Federation licence plates) exiting Ukraine as well as five cars (three with Ukrainian and one with Russian Federation licence plates, and one with “DPR” plates), and six pedestrians entering Ukraine.

The SMM observed the fishing ship Nord moored at the merchant port in Berdiansk (Zaporizhzhia region, 230km south-east of Dnipro) on 9 April. (See SMM Daily Report 7 April 2018.) On 6 April, at the Prymorskyi District Court in Mariupol, the SMM observed eight members of the Nord’s crew, who had been charged with violating the order of entry and exit for the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, were fined UAH 3750 and released.

In light of the Easter holiday, the SMM visited churches of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate throughout Ukraine where, by and large, clergymen and parishioners told it that there were no tensions between the religious communities and that they were all praying for peace.

The SMM monitored the security situation at several locations in Zakarpattia associated with the Hungarian parliamentary elections on 8 April. At the Hungarian consulates in Uzhhorod and Berehove, the SMM observed 10-15 police officers securing a 150m perimeter around the consulate buildings and observed people waiting in short queues to be allowed in.

The SMM continued monitoring in Kherson, Odessa, Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Chernivtsi, and Kyiv.","Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of 19:30, 9 April 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/latest-osce-special-monitoring-mission-ukraine-smm-based-information-received-402

The present Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) was prepared on the basis of the financing decision ECHO/WWD/BUD/2018/01000 (Worldwide Decision) and the related General Guidelines for Operational Priorities on Humanitarian Aid (Operational Priorities). The purpose of the HIP and its annex is to serve as a communication tool for DG ECHO's partners and to assist in the preparation of their proposals. The provisions of the Worldwide Decision and the General Conditions of the Agreement with the European Commission shall take precedence over the provisions in this document.

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE HIP

Modification 1 – March 2018 Despite the renewed ceasefire agreed in Minsk on 28 February, fighting continues around the hotspots along the contact line. Recent assessments carried out by humanitarian agencies confirm the increase of needs across all sectors. Damages to civilian infrastructure, including several multi-storey apartment buildings, private houses and education facilities were recently reported. Critical water and electricity supply facilities continue to experience interruptions, underscoring the fragility of water and heating supply to 4.2 million people. There is also continued water shortages, affecting more urban than rural populations, and an increase of households using untreated and unpurified drinking water, i.e. in Luhansk 51% of the population are using untreated drinking water. The Food Security cluster estimates an increase of households near the contact line with poor or borderline food consumption patterns from 11% in 2016 to 14% in 2017. The lack of adequate access to healthcare affects 88% of the population, an increase from 29% (2016) to 46% (2017). Winterization needs are also acute for 80% of the conflict-affected people. The number of households relying on pensions and social benefits is increasing, it is reported that half of them along the line of contact are receiving no other income in 2017.

The situation in the Non-Government Controlled Areas (NGCA) is worsening, due to a lack of sufficient humanitarian support, which is also a result of some humanitarian organisations which had to stop operating in the NGCA. The Food Security cluster estimates that 150 000 people are currently severely food insecure in this area.

The UN-led Humanitarian Response Plan 2018, that assessed humanitarian needs for an amount of USD 187 million, was only funded by 3 per cent as of end February.

An additional allocation of EUR 5 million will aim at covering the needs of the most vulnerable conflict-affected persons in the NGCA in the following sectors:",Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) Ukraine and Eastern Neighbourhood (ECHO/UKR/BUD/2018/91000) Version 2 – 20/03/2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-implementation-plan-hip-ukraine-and-eastern-neighbourhood

24,ukraine,"Russia’s goals remain in line with the goals of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, primarily territorial expansion, and Russian tactics and technology have evolved greatly since the collapse of the USSR, Yelchenko said.

On April 4, Volodymyr Yelchenko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, spoke at Princeton University about the now four-year-long crisis of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the brutal “hybrid war” being waged in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.

According to Yelchenko, the crisis began on Feb 26, 2014, with “little green men” — unmarked Russian soldiers without insignias, armed with modern weapons, and moving in armored vehicles, The Daily Princetonian reports.

Yelchenko explained that these soldiers seized key infrastructure sites and that overnight, the Crimean parliament was seized and a pro-Russian government took power. This government promptly held a referendum on whether to stay in Ukraine or join Russia.

But no one in the international community regarded Crimea’s referendum as official, according to Yelchenko. Then, on March 18, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation.

Tensions quickly expanded beyond Crimea. As Ukrainians ousted their pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, separatist groups in the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk began an active armed conflict with the Ukrainian government, supported by Russian hardware and personnel support, Yelchenko explained.

This quasi-war has since flared up occasionally. Yelchenko and the Ukrainian government estimate the total death count to be approximately 10,000, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

Read alsoYelchenko: Russians ignored Ukraine's appeals to explain what they were doing in CrimeaUkraine has since improved relations with the West, distancing itself from the expansionist Russia, Yelchenko explained, citing that Ukrainian citizens can travel to European Union states without visas, bringing Ukraine closer to Western Europe.

The United States has placed heavy trade sanctions on the Russian Federation, which, according to Yelchenko, have reduced the Russian gross domestic product by about 35 percent.

Meanwhile, without seven percent of its land and while fighting an active civil war, Ukrainian GDP has risen up to two percent per quarter, mostly due to closer ties with the European Union.

However, while the issue has largely disappeared from the public’s eye, casualties occur in Ukraine almost daily, according to Yelchenko.

“All human life is precious. One death is a tragedy,” Yelchenko said.

For the West, there are several critical conclusions to draw on, according to the ambassador. Fake news, cyber attacks on critical infrastructure such as power plants, and the use of internet trolls have all been implemented to create a doctrine of hybrid war, according to Yelchenko.

Yelchenko explained that no one is entirely sure what hybrid warfare is. This hybrid war strategy has been implemented alongside traditional military tactics and equipment to take territory without drawing international attention or responses.

It is suspected that these same tactics have been used to influence foreign elections and governments far beyond the nations bordering Russia.",Ukrainian ambassador to UN talks Crimean crisis,https://www.unian.info/politics/10069994-ukrainian-ambassador-to-un-talks-crimean-crisis.html

In the Kremlin’s telling, this is a country under siege.

The United States is considering strikes on Russian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, prompting ominous speculation among people close to the Kremlin that such a move could touch off a wider conflict. One scholar who advises the Russian Defense Ministry even raised the specter of “World War III.”

At the same time, U.S. sanctions against top Russian business executives wiped billions of dollars off Russian stock market values this week, prompting fears that the country’s already stagnant economy could be thrown back into recession.

As if to drive the point home, a new article from a top Kremlin aide declared that Russia must prepare for a century of “geopolitical solitude” and that its “epic journey toward the West” was over.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his supporters have for years been casting their country as one that has to rally around its leader and fight back in the face of an increasingly aggressive West.

Russia's rouble experienced its biggest one-day fall in more than two years on April 9 as investors reacted to a new round of U.S. sanctions targeting some of the country’s biggest tycoons. (Reuters)

That “besieged fortress” narrative has now roared back to the forefront in ways not seen since the height of the Ukraine crisis in 2014 and Russia’s internationally denounced annexation of Crimea.

The question now is how Russia responds — both to the sanctions and to any U.S. strike in Syria, where Moscow has military forces aiding Assad’s regime.

[Trump says Putin shares blame for Syrian chemical attack]

Putin has said little on both topics in recent days. He visited Russian scientists Tuesday and thanked them for their role in helping develop new Russian nuclear weapons.

“This all strengthens the isolationist, consolidating logic of a besieged fortress,” Andrei Koles­nikov, a domestic policy specialist at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said of the sanctions and Syria developments. “The regime won’t fall. It will only become more isolationist and aggressive toward the West.”

Slides in the Russian stock market this week showed that Friday’s U.S. sanctions were the Trump administration’s most damaging move against Moscow so far.

The ruble fell to 63 against the dollar, the Russian currency’s weakest level since December 2016, and government officials said they were preparing to take steps to stabilize the Russian businesses affected.

In 1992, two Russian scientists approached The Post's Will Englund, then the Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, about the country’s secret efforts to create Novichok, the deadly nerve agent that would later allegedly be used to poison double agent Sergei Skripal. (Joyce Lee,Will Englund/The Washington Post)

“A blow to any of the groups of companies” affected by the sanctions “is a blow to the economy as a whole,” Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said Tuesday.

Sanctioned businessman Oleg Deripaska’s company Rusal, an aluminum giant that employs 62,000 people worldwide, has lost more than half its stock market value since the sanctions were announced. Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, has lost some 15 percent on the stock market this week even though it was not sanctioned. Monday’s plunge of more than 8 percent in the benchmark MOEX Russia Index was the worst since March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, though the index recovered some of those losses Tuesday.

[Trump’s rebuke of Putin resets tone from White House]

“If a very strong sanctions regime spreads to other sectors, this can lead to a financial crisis and certainly a renewed recession,” said economist Alexandre Abramov, a financial-markets expert at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics. The risk, he said, is that investors will shun all Russian company stocks, fearing further sanctions.

Even as Russia reeled from the blow to its economy, another crisis was deepening in Syria.

The suspected chemical attack in rebel-held Douma brought dire predictions in Moscow that disaster could follow if Washington launched airstrikes in response. Russia denies that its Syrian allies used chlorine or other agents in the Saturday attack, which claimed dozens of lives.

The West says overwhelming evidence points to Assad’s forces, with their backers Russia and Iran sharing responsibility.

Igor Korotchenko, a Russian military scholar and a member of the Defense Ministry’s public advisory council, said a U.S. attack that killed Russians in Syria would compel a military response, potentially against a U.S. plane or ship. That could bring about a chain of events as dangerous as the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, Korotchenko said, and potentially “provoke World War III.”

“Trump has to understand that we’re going to be talking about the possibility of nuclear escalation if we have a collision of the U.S. and Russian militaries,” Korotchenko said. “Everything can happen very quickly, and the situation can spin out of the control of the politicians.”

[Opinion: Why Trump must drive Putin crazy]

Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov said last month that Russia had information that the United States was planning to fake a chemical attack in Syria and use it as a pretext for a strike on Assad. If such a strike endangered Russian lives, he warned at the time, Russia would respond by hitting the missiles and their launchers.

Russia has said the suspected chemical attack in Douma was, indeed, fake — staged in part to distract from another episode that Moscow has also described as falsely blaming Russia: the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England last month.

“The U.S. declared economic war on us, they also declared diplomatic war, and everything now indicates that they want to test our armed forces in a local conflict,” lawmaker Igor Morozov said on a state TV talk show Monday.

On another such show, war correspondent Yevgeny Poddubny warned, “Russia has the forces and the means to stop the American groups — the question is, how far does this conflict, this confrontation, go.”

Representatives of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, as well as Russian specialists, have visited the site of the Douma incident “and found no trace of any use of chemical weapons,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday.

He said Russia would propose a U.N. Security Council resolution later Tuesday that would call on international experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to visit the site, at the invitation of the Syrian government.

Syria and Russia, he said, would be prepared to guarantee the inspectors’ security.

If the West rejected the Russian proposal, Lavrov said, this would be further evidence of its ­“anti-Syrian and Russophobic line.”

Amid the fast-moving developments, a longtime architect of Putin’s rule, Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov, this week published an article in the journal Russia in Global Affairs that presented a theoretical foundation for the estrangement between Russia and the West.

Only now is it becoming clear, he wrote, that the year 2014 — the year of the Ukraine crisis — for Russia marked “the end of multiple and fruitless efforts to become part of Western civilization.”

“A new period of unknown length now spreads before us, the ‘14+’ era, in which we face one hundred (two hundred? three hundred?) years of geopolitical solitude,” Surkov wrote.

The sanctions, including travel restrictions and asset freezes against 150 people and 38 companies, would be extended until Sept. 15, the European Council said.

“An assessment of the situation did not justify a change in the sanctions regime,” the Council said in a statement.

After annexing Crimea in 2014, in a move that has not been recognized internationally, Russia said it would not return the region.

The EU and other Western countries say Russia has also been providing a lifeline to separatists in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.",EU extends Russia sanctions over Ukraine crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-eu/eu-extends-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-crisis-idUSKCN1GO0YL
