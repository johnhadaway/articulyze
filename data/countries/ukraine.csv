1,ukraine,"The April revolution in Armenia came as a huge surprise to the Russian leadership, as it did for most stakeholders in the multiple conflicts in the Caucasus. But you’d expect that Moscow would have been better informed. There had been expert warnings about the brewing discontent in this impoverished South Caucasian state, but the Kremlin is not generally interested in even moderately independent expertise. President Vladimir Putin called and “warmly congratulated” the Moscow-friendly Serzh Sargsyan when he was appointed prime minister in mid-April (although by protocol, he didn’t have to), and from that moment, the Russian official and mainstream media completely ignored the street protests in the Armenian capital of Yerevan.

That silence stimulated rather than tempered fierce debates on this turmoil in Russian social media networks. Putin pays scant attention to these sources, but his briefings tell him mostly what he wants to hear, and this tightly managed information flow possibly reinforced the self-deception in the proverbial Kremlin corridors that nothing of import was happening. Sargsyan’s resignation on April 23 came, therefore, as a shock, and while the propaganda machine scrambled to explain it away, Putin was—not for the first time during his long reign—paralyzed into inaction. In the crucial two weeks when opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan advanced his claim for the position of prime minister, Moscow remained indifferent and uncharacteristically aloof, which will definitely have serious repercussions not only for the Russian-Armenian relations, but also for Russia’s profile in the international arena.

Abandoning the “principled” stance against revolutions

The dominant discourse in Russia on the subject of revolutions has been strongly negative, in contrast with the Soviet glorification of this phenomenon as an “engine of progress.” The proposition that a forceful overthrow of legitimate order brings only chaos and violence is accepted as a political axiom, while discussions on such politically incorrect issues as the “right for rebellion” are reduced to the margins of blogosphere. This fierce condemnation goes beyond the rational stance of an authoritarian regime, which firmly controls the elections and finds street protests a threat to its existence. Vladimir Putin tends to take this issue personally, still feeling the old profound shock from watching helplessly as angry crowds marched by the Dresden KGB headquarters back in November 1989 and, more recently, reflecting on the horrible end of Muammar Gadhafi.

What makes this natural rejectionism particularly aggressive is the assertion that the so-called “color revolutions” in Russia’s neighborhood—as well as the hopeful Arab Spring in the Middle East—were instigated and manipulated by the United States and the European Union. The elevation of conspiracy theories to the level of state policy makes Russia’s opposition to various attempts at forceful “regime change” a part of its fast-evolving confrontation with the West. In portraying himself as a champion of counter-revolution, Putin claims leadership in the global resistance against the U.S. policy of preserving its eroding “hegemony.” The “color revolutions” were even defined as a new form of warfare, despite scant enthusiasm among the top brass for elaborating on this theoretical innovation.

Moscow’s lack of response to the explosion of street protests in Yerevan goes strikingly against this ideological counter-revolutionary stance. For sure, there were no anti-Russian or pro-EU slogans in the peaceful rallies across Armenia, and Pashinyan asserted that the alliance with Russia would remain strong—this allowed opinion-influencers in Moscow to venture that the unfolding crisis was different from “color revolutions.” In the previous series of street protests in summer 2015, friendship with Russia was also never questioned, but it didn’t stop Moscow from inventing Western interference. Explaining the new Russian passivity is hard to find, but Syria may well be a part of it. Related Content Order from Chaos Russia stumbles in the fog of Syrian war Order from Chaos Putin’s road from Damascus: After the “victory,” what?

The long shadow of Syrian “victory”

Many intentions and ambitions determined Putin’s risky decision to launch a military intervention into the Syrian civil war in September 2015, and a prominent one among them was the perceived need to stop and push back the wave of revolutions. The explosion of social anger in the Arab world and the uprising in Ukraine were caused by vastly different drivers, but from Moscow’s perspective, the Tahrir and the Maidan were parts of the same Western conspiracy. By early 2018, however, the Arab Spring retreated, leaving behind two collapsed states (Libya and Yemen), two forcefully suppressed upheavals (Bahrain and Egypt), and only one success story (Tunisia), while the Ukrainian breakthrough degenerated into political squabbles in Kiev and military deadlock in Donbass. Syria is no longer a key battlefield in the struggle against revolutions, but just a permanently mutating violent disaster. Putin declared “victory” in the war against the rebels of various persuasions, only to find Russian forces entrapped in new spasms of fighting.

Moscow is stuck with an ostracized dictator who can only sustain his grasp on power with large-scale military support from Russia and Iran, but this “brotherhood-in-arms” involves all sorts of troubles. The Russian forces stay clear from the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel in Syria, as well as from the fighting between the Turkish army and the Kurdish forces, while trying to preserve the “de-conflicting” mode with U.S. forces. This complicated maneuvering means that Putin’s order to reduce Russian forces cannot be executed, because without a good many boots on the ground, Russia cannot influence the new post-ISIS phase of the Syrian war and cannot ensure security of its two bases (Khmeimin and Tartus). This imperative to sustain the intervention signifies a protracted stress for the Russian navy and air-space forces—and undercuts the ability to launch new military interventions.

Overload results in mistakes

At the moment when politics were heating up in Armenia, Russia’s Syrian engagement was not only demanding more resources from Moscow (for instance, for rebuilding the Syrian air defense system), but was also demanding attention to the fast-transforming crisis. Meanwhile, there were escalating tensions in U.S.-Russia relations after the U.S. Treasury enforced new heavy-hitting sanctions, which compelled some mainstream Moscow experts to question whether the Trump administration really aimed at undermining the elite support for Putin’s regime. The need to monitor the developments on the Korean peninsula, where Russia’s exposure is high but the impact is low, was another source of stress, so the system of political decisionmaking in Moscow faced significant overload, which inevitably results in miscalculations and procrastinations.

Russia’s political system is centralized to the extreme—and that the attention span of the “decider” is inevitably limited.

The proposition that the non-response to the crisis in Armenia was a mistake might appear far-fetched, but it rests on the fact that Russia’s political system is centralized to the extreme—and that the attention span of the “decider” is inevitably limited. Since the start of the Ukraine crisis in early 2014, Putin has shown little interest in the conflict transformations in the Caucasus, and never developed a particular chemistry with Sargsyan. The quick end to the escalation of fighting in Nagorno Karabakh in April 2016 was taken as proof positive of Russia’s capacity for controlling the status quo. The Kremlin administration was also quite preoccupied with ensuring that no undesirable disturbance would upset Putin’s presidential inauguration on May 7. It is quite possible that Putin’s aids dismissed Pashinyan’s Gandhi-style march across Armenia in early April as a mere theater by a marginal trouble-maker.

While a military intervention was certainly out of the question, Moscow has mastered the application of a wide range of hybrid means that could have been effectively deployed in support of the friendly dictator-in-distress in Yerevan. But Moscow missed the right moment for such indirect power projection, and even Pashinyan’s high-impact posts on Facebook were not attacked by the infamous Russian troll factories. Corruption, which is the main irritant for Armenians, has produced many profitable links between Moscow and Yerevan that are ideally suited for manipulating elites and crowds; yet, they remained idle. That Sargsyan made the hard decision to say “I was wrong,” rather than ask Moscow for emergency support, is testament to the strength of a very particular war-forged Armenian political culture that remains profoundly incomprehensible for the Kremlin. His astounding resignation could have triggered an over-reaction from Russia, but Putin couldn’t find a counterpart to connect with and wasn’t inclined to grace the intrigues of the beleaguered Republican party with his attention.

Russia’s ability to provide security guarantees to post-Soviet autocrats is seriously compromised.

Conclusions

In hindsight, a wise analyst might suggest that if Moscow had attempted a hybrid intervention in the Armenian crisis and failed, the damage to its international positions would have been significantly greater. The chances for forcefully suppressing the protests at their early stages were, however, as good as in Moscow, where peaceful rallies on May 5 were brutally dispersed, so the Kremlin’s rather unconvincing pose of “non-interference in internal affairs” is dubious. It is possible that the unsatisfactory experiences from Syria informed Moscow’s self-restraint, as resources for proactive foreign policy moves are now assessed with greater care. The Occam’s razor explanation, however, leaves an observer with the notion that Putin and his court made the mistake of ignoring the beginning of the explosive crisis—but avoided the more serious blunder of attempting a belated intervention. Russia’s ability to provide security guarantees to post-Soviet autocrats is seriously compromised, but a reproduction in Moscow of a joyful triumph of street democracy in Yerevan remains rather improbable.",What explains Russia’s uncharacteristic indifference to the revolution in Armenia?,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/07/what-explains-russias-uncharacteristic-indifference-to-the-revolution-in-armenia/

Metro said Palazzi, 46, who previously ran Metro’s cash and carry business in Italy, was taking over with immediate effect.

“He has demonstrated that he is able to realise successful repositionings with a clear earnings increase. He identifies our customers’ needs, addresses them and aligns the business accordingly,” Chairman Juergen Steinemann said in a statement on Monday.

Metro said Boone, who joined as operations director of the Russian cash and carry business in 2011 and took over as its managing director in 2012, was leaving by “mutual consent”.

Boone retained operational responsibility for the Russian business after becoming COO in July 2017.

Metro shares tumbled last month after it cut its earnings and sales forecast for its 2017/18 financial year, blaming an expected fall in sales at its Russia business in the second half of the year, and higher-than-forecast restructuring costs.

Metro, which runs wholesale stores in 35 countries as well as Real hypermarkets in Germany, is due to publish results for the first half of the 2017/18 financial year on May 15.

3,ukraine,"RN breakfast program under fire for introducing Mark Sleboda as a ‘Moscow-based political analyst’ but not disclosing his work for the state-owned RT

A political analyst interviewed on ABC radio about the weekend protests against Russian president Vladimir Putin is a mouthpiece for the Kremlin, Russia experts have said.



Mark Sleboda, described by the ABC simply as a “Moscow-based political analyst”, was interviewed on Monday morning by Radio National host Fran Kelly.

Asked for his views on the anti-Putin demonstrations and the release of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny from custody, Sleboda said the protests were small and “lucky to have pulled 6,000 people”. He dismissed the suggestion people had stayed away due to fear. “I don’t think there’s any cause for people to be frightened,” he said.



Mark Sleboda (@MarkSleboda1) Better question. Why do we even allow Western state media to broadcast in Russia and the Rest of the world? https://t.co/OPQofKxZph

“Putin’s approval has increased since the last election due to his handling of the economy and foreign policy,” he said. He defended the arrest of Navalny on the grounds he had broken the law by demonstrating and he said the opposition leader had been barred from running in the election because he had “twice been convicted of fraud”.

Alexey Muraviev, associate professor of national security and strategic studies at of Curtin University, said he fundamentally disagreed with much of what Sleboda said and he did not sound like an independent analyst.

“When he says that Navalny broke the law by protesting, that’s the official government line and the reality is every time something happens Navalny just gets neutralised by Putin forces.”

The ABC did not disclose during the nine-minute interview or on its website that Sleboda is an analyst for the state-owned English-language television channel Russia Today, now known as RT.

RT is a powerful PR arm of the Russian government which is used as a weapon in the global information war.



Antfarmer (@antfarmer) This guy had the gall to equate Putin fixing elections and the constitution to stay in power to Germany’s Angela Merkel actually...you know.. winning elections! 4 terms as Chancellor...

Kelly noted that Navalny’s supporters had chanted “Out with the Tsar”, a reference to the fact that Putin has been either prime minister or president of Russia “for almost 20 years and will be in until 2024”.

Sleboda responded that it was “exactly the same amount of time that Angela Merkel has been the leader of Germany”.

Kelly: “Will Angela Merkel be in for 24 years?”

Sleboda: “She just renewed for her fourth term, so 23 or 24, yes.”

Merkel, who was sworn in for a fourth term earlier this year despite her CDU party losing ground in September’s election, has been chancellor of Germany since 2005 – 13 years.

Muraviev said Sleboda did not utter “a single discordant note in terms of the official positions of the Putin administration”.

He said it was surprising to hear the US-born commentator expressing views that were “effectively reflective of the official position of the Kremlin”.

“He spoke as the promoter and the defender of the official position of Putin’s government,” Muraviev told Guardian Australia.



“Some of the statements he made were way too categorical, he debated, he argued, he advocated.

“To me he sounds either incredibly ill-informed or incredibly naive or somehow politically biased.”

Kyle Wilson, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University’s Centre for European Studies, said Sleboda was not a critical source the public broadcaster should rely on.



“In my view there is a question mark about the credibility of Sleboda as a commentator for two reasons,” Wilson told Guardian Australia. “Firstly he has for some years been a commentator for Russia Today and he represents the more extreme end of the spectrum in terms of offering the Kremlin view.

“Second he has an association with Alexander Dugin, who is a xenophobic, hard-right, nationalist ideologue about whom even the Kremlin has some doubts.

“So it seems to be reasonable to assume that Mark Sleboda is an apologist, a blatantly pro-Kremlin apologist.

“ABC radio is far more effective in dealing with matters that are extremely controversial when it offers a range of opinion.



“But to give a platform on a mainstream program to a Kremlin apologist doesn’t seem to be the most effective way of presenting controversial issues.”

The ABC said in a statement: “This was just one interview in the ABC’s long-term and comprehensive coverage of this area, which has involved interviewing a variety of analysts from a range of different perspectives. We will continue to cover these issues from an array of viewpoints.”

In 2014 Russia Today’s British channel was censured by the UK media regulator for coverage involving Sleboda. It was found to have breached the broadcasting code on impartiality over its coverage of the Ukraine crisis, including for one report in which Sleboda described the Ukrainian administration as a “putsch government” that came to power with the help of “a number of extremists”.",Russia analyst interviewed by ABC a 'blatantly pro-Kremlin apologist',https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/08/russia-analyst-interviewed-by-abc-a-blatantly-pro-kremlin-apologist
4,ukraine,"The Russia press made a note of it. But it hardly got covered in the U.S., largely because Ukraine never was part of the American sphere of influence. Ukraine remains an afterthought except for a (boisterous) minority in Washington foreign policy circles who use it as a wedge between Moscow and Washington. And so on April 26, when the Trump Administration removed Ukraine from favored nation trade status, no one went all that ballistic about the decision. Over the weekend, the Ukrainian government made a note of the decision by Washington and hinted that they will try to persuade Trump's trade policy team to change their mind.

It was the U.S. Trade Representative Office that suspended the operation of the Generalized System of Preferences for 155 Ukrainian imports, including electrical appliances and food products two weeks ago. Despite the change, Ukraine is still part of the Generalized System of Preferences , so they are allowed to sell here duty-free for around 3,500 items.

Nevertheless, Ukraine was unhappy with the decision and the Ministry of Economic Development said Saturday that they are talking with Washington about a possible ""solution to the problem."" Ukraine's government believes that some of the tariffs are due to intellectual property concerns by Washington. Their parliament is addressing that issue.

Ukraine has been the main source of Washington's ire against Vladimir Putin. Although that has now shifted to Putin's railroading another shot at regime change in Syria, and alleged meddling in the 2016 election, Ukraine has definitely suited U.S. foreign policy interests. Siding with Ukraine has been a great way to get Washington to sanction Nord Stream II, known as the anti-Ukraine pipeline to Ukraine supporters. Washington gets to give Ukraine some attention by threatening fines against the Russia-to-German gas line, while pressuring powerful European companies like Royal Dutch Shell with hefty fines if they buy gas from Gazprom through those pipes, instead of -- perhaps -- LNG from Poland or, better yet, the U.S.

Getting 155 items cut from the generalized preference on tariffs and trade is a small price to pay for a guillotine hanging over the heads of Shell, Wintershall, OMV and Basf for their work on Nord Stream II with the Russians.

It is unclear how long those items will be tariffed. It could very well be averted this week seeing how Ukraine's Economic Ministry is now on Washington's case about it.

Ukraine has been through turmoil for much of the past 20 years. The fall of the Soviet Union did not go as well in Ukraine as it has in Russia, with some arguing that it is because Ukraine is more democratic. Its leaders are allowed to be toppled. Russia has had the same, leading governing party now -- United Russia -- since it merged with two other parties in 2001. And Putin has been president or Prime Minister since 1999. Without that steady hand, one could argue that Russia would have gone through the same series of revolution as Ukraine.

Ukraine's government is stuck in perennial crisis. President Petro Poroshenko is less popular than Donald Trump is here in the U.S. He is up for re-election in March 2019.

Poroshenko, also known as the Chocolate King for the wealth he has built up from this Roshen brand of chocolates, has been a more calming force for Ukraine than Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the defacto leader of the new government following the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych by extra-legal means in February 2014.

Poroshenko has tried to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union, something his predecessor also tried to do but was cut short by Russia. Yanukovych rejected a customs union with the E.U. in exchange for better natural gas terms with the Russian state. Protest erupted and Ukraine was once again home to mass protest, the most recent one referred to as the Euromaidan.

Russia saw Yatsesnyuk as the leader of a new vassal state controlled by Washington and quickly moved to protect its interests in Ukraine. With the help of the autonomous regional government of Crimea, consisting of a Russian ethnic majority, Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine in March 2014 and Russia immediately annexed it. Shortly after, Russia began its backdoor support of separatists, also led by ethnic Russians, in industrial hubs like the Donbass. Ukraine's economy has suffered since.

Nevertheless, Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has remained stable for the last 12 months despite some weakness at the start of the year. Its local bonds are still junk and yield over 16.5% in the local currency. The country's GDP is forecast to grow by 3.2% this year, according to the most recent government forecast.

Ukraine remains a thorn in Russia's side. Its gas firm Naftogaz is fighting Gazprom in international courts over gas delivery contracts. Naftogaz absolutely despises Nord Stream II.

The bitter divorce between Russia and Ukraine has everything to do with Naftogaz and Gazprom.

The U.S. keeps siding with Ukraine while Europe is largely wish-washy about picking sides due to its proximity and trade relationship with Russia. Germany is a key player in Nord Stream II, with Wintershall and Basf both part of the consortium that wants to build it, regardless of Washington's opinions.

France has also been ignoring the Anglo-American push to isolate Russia, only throwing them anti-Putin rhetoric now and again.

Over the weekend, French president Emmanuel Macron sounded more like 2016 Donald Trump when he said it is better to work with Russia than to box them in behind an iron curtain. Macron is scheduled to meet with Putin this month. Both are in favor of cooler heads prevailing in the Iran nuclear deal which is under serious review this month. French oil giant Total SA has tens of millions of dollars at stake in Iran.

Macron's ambassador to Russia, Sylvie Bermann, said in an interview with the Kommersant business daily that France's siding with the Brits and Americans to bomb Syria last month was not a slight against Russia.

Pakistan tested its joint air and land capabilities in a Central Command exercise over the weekend. The exercise was the culmination of a process to integrate firepower assets in the two domains. Each of Pakistan’s armed branches—air, land and naval—is highly autonomous. The air force has tended to be particularly poorly integrated into military planning. With last year’s increase in defence spending and air force procurement, the exercise suggests that Pakistan is placing a renewed emphasis on air power.

The Diplomat did an extensive analysis of a mysterious Chinese stealth bomber that was featured on a prominent Chinese aerospace magazine last month. The article argues that the pictured plane isn’t the highly secret H‑20 project, but rather the so-called JH-XX, said to combine supersonic, stealthy deep-strike capabilities with long range. Such technology is distant though, so it’s possible that the magazine was deliberately obscuring information about the more imminent H‑20.

More than 50 UAE troops landed on Yemen’s strategic Socotra Island on Wednesday without the knowledge of the Yemeni government.

The Emiratis have long been expanding their influence in southern Yemen, backing anti-government separatists in southern Yemen since January, while the UAE flag and images of the UAE Crown Prince adorn many official buildings in Socotra.

The US has also proven to be a controversial ally in Yemen. This report by the New York Times reveals that a dozen US Army Green Berets have been stationed on the Saudi border without congressional authorisation. The revelation comes amid criticisms that the Trump administration has repeatedly blurred the lines between train-and-equip missions and combat.

In today’s budget release we can expect the government to commit $50 million to Australia’s new space agency. Australia’s 2016 Defence White Paper highlights the importance of space-based satellite systems to policing and security agencies. Given the range of critical data that satellites provide, Kim Carr argues that there’s significant risk in relying on foreign technologies. Currently 24 countries have either a national space agency or a space research institute.

Are there laws in space? A group of international experts are creating a manual of how international law applies to space operations. The Woomera manual on the international law of military space operations aims to clarify how the law of armed conflict would apply to warfare in space. As warfare domains expand, so too does the need for international regulations, as seen by the creation of a similar manual for cyber operations in 2013, the Tallinn manual.

The US Air Force will procure new satellites from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to improve its missile-warning capabilities. The new satellites will replace the current space-based infrared system. The Air Force will use ‘rapid procurement authorities’ to speed the acquisition process. This reveals an awareness in US policymaking of the need to respond to growing challenges in space. As private companies such as SpaceX continue to develop rockets, satellites and space technologies at a much faster pace than nation-states, the space race is now between companies, not just countries.

Crossing the ‘contact line’ in eastern Ukraine continues to force millions of Ukrainians to endure dire conditions, long waiting hours and constant insecurity from shelling and mine contamination. Of particular concern is the lack of adequate facilities, such as heating/resting points, transportation, medical units and latrines in the “no man’s land” - a 2-km stretch between the EECPs of Government controlled areas (GCA) and Non-Government controlled areas (NGCA).

Over a million individual crossings were recorded in March, a 6 per cent increase compared with the same period in 2017. In mid-March, thousands of civilians, particularly the elderly, children and pregnant women, faced further hardship, while making this journey as they had to walk up to 5 kilometers to the EECPs. This was due to the interruption of ‘irregular’ public transportation to/ from EECPs’, for about 2 weeks. As part of shifting to “spring” season, the operational hours of all EECPs were extended by 2.5 hours, from 07:00 to 18:30",Ukraine: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of 13 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-snapshot-13-april-2018

""Children are learning in schools with bullet holes in the walls and sandbags in windows, bomb shelters in the basements, and shrapnel in school yards,"" UNICEF Ukraine Representative Giovanna Barberis said in a May 4 statement.

""The children are extremely nervous of shelling, and teachers try to calm them down, but it's hard for them...because they are nervous and stressed,"" Barberis said.

The UN agency did not directly name a particular side in the war, a conflict that has killed more than 10,300 people since March 2014.

It said that ""all sides of the conflict must respect international humanitarian law and ensure that schools are safe places for children to learn.""

'Forgotten' Crisis

UNICEF also said schools and kindergartens on both sides of the tense ""contact line"" are in danger due to the proximity of military sites, including bases, storage facilities, and security check points.

The contact line divides areas controlled by the government and Russia-backed separatists in and around parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, and it is where fighting is the fiercest.

UNICEF said it and its partners have monitored instances in which military and armed groups are based within 500 meters of a kindergarten or school.

It added that it has monitored six former school buildings that have been occupied or used by military forces or armed groups since the start of the current school year.

The European Union and United States back Kyiv in the conflict and have imposed sanctions on Russia for its support of the separatists and for its illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula.

Moscow has denied providing the separatist forces with weapons despite what Kyiv and NATO say is irrefutable evidence proving that it has done so.

In previous reports, UNICEF has said that more than 1 million children are in need of urgent humanitarian aid in eastern Ukraine.

PEOPLE IN NEED OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Nearly four years of ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine has had a significant impact on all aspects of life for the communities residing in the Donbas region. The protracted nature of the crisis has paralyzed economic activity and severely reduced household coping capacities on both sides of the 457 km contact line. At the household level, few employment opportunities have also led to a lack of income and the inability to meet basic needs.

According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy (MoSP), nearly 1.5 million persons are registered as displaced, with the vast majority residing in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and other conflict-affected populations continue to cross the contact line regularly, between the non-government controlled area (NGCA) and government controlled area (GCA) at five checkpoints. Throughout 2017, figures of individuals crossing the contact line reached an all-time high in August, when a recorded 1.2 million people crossed the contact line during the month. The large numbers of people crossing between the GCA and NGCA and limited capacity of the checkpoints to process the increase in crossings has led to long queues, lack of adequate sanitation facilities and exposure to bad weather conditions, or other health and protection concerns, such as those related to psychosocial needs, trafficking in persons and exploitation.

The overall humanitarian situation in Eastern Ukraine remains dire. Assistance continues to be provided in the NGCA despite various challenges, including limitation on transport of humanitarian cargo and limited access to the affected populations. The deterioration of the situation in the NGCA is evidenced by the increase in poor food consumption, application of negative cop ing mechanisms and reduction of food expenditure. Moreover, the damage to or destruction of gas and water pipelines as well as homes and social institutions further increases the vulnerability of entire social segments of conflict-affected communities by limiting their access to adequate heating, hygiene facilities and clean drinking water. The peak in unemployment rates and the scarce public services increase overall dependency on humanitarian aid and public support.

In the GCA, the economic depression and limited resources of the displaced population have placed further strain on already overstretched social services. According to IOM’s National Monitoring System Round 8 report, 33% of surveyed IDP households in the GCA have ‘only enough funds to cover food’ and 11% have to ‘limit expenses even for food’. Despite the continuously increasing percentage of employed IDPs (from 35% in March 2016 to 50% in December 2017), the average IDP household monthly income per person (UAH 2,446 in December 2017) remains below the actual subsistence level established by the Ministry of Social Policy (UAH 3,091 in December 2017).

Due to the protracted nature of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, slow economic growth and increased social tensions, 2018 will be a critical year for the transition from humanitarian assistance to longer-term recovery efforts. Bridging the gap between humanitarian and development interventions is critical to simultaneously address the urgent and longer-term needs of conflictaffected communities in the Donbas. The situation of protracted displacement requires concerted efforts from the Government of Ukraine, humanitarian and development actors as well as conflict affected communities to jointly identify actions in support of durable solutions to end displacement.","IOM Ukraine Crisis Response Plan, 1 January – 31 December 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-crisis-response-plan-1-january-31-december-2018

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin shook hands with just three people in the audience after he took the oath of office on Monday. They were the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill; Putin’s longtime prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev; and former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder.

It was a remarkable and revealing moment. At Russia’s biggest political event of the year, just two days before the country celebrates the Soviet World War II victory over the Nazis, a front-row spot of the utmost honor was granted to a former German leader.

Schröder’s placement, captured repeatedly by state TV cameras and broadcast on the evening news, showed the depth of the ties between Putin and his perhaps most important foreign friend. It served as a reminder that the former East Germany-based KGB officer who now rules Russia continues to look to Berlin as his key bridge to Europe. And it looked to be an effort to show Russians — and the West — that the Kremlin still has allies abroad despite sanctions and criticism.

“This was a signal that those who take a positive position in relation to the Kremlin will be supported by it,” said Alexey Chesnakov, a former Kremlin adviser turned pro-Putin commentator.

Schröder took office in 1998, just over a year before Putin, and soon bonded with him at international summits, where the Russian president was often the only other world leader who also spoke German. After losing his reelection bid in 2005, Schröder shrugged off criticism to go to work for Nord Stream, the gas pipeline project linking Russia to Germany. In the fall, Schröder doubled down and became chairman of Russia’s biggest oil producer, Rosneft.

Among other things, Schröder has been lobbying for Nord Stream 2, a new pipeline that critics say will boost Moscow’s ability to use its energy supply for political leverage in Europe.

Putin has long been intent on building closer ties to Germany, and analysts say he was shocked when Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed for European Union sanctions against Russia amid the Ukraine crisis in 2014. Another close Putin friend from Germany stood behind Schröder at Monday’s inauguration: banker Matthias Warnig, a former East German secret police agent who, like Putin, worked in Dresden in the twilight of the Cold War.

Both men also attended Putin’s 2012 inauguration, but video footage of the event shows that Schröder didn’t have a prime front-row spot next to the patriarch.

The Germans’ placement on Monday provoked a torrent of criticism. In Russia, opposition leader Alexei Navalny said it showed the meaninglessness of the Kremlin’s “talk of ‘greatness and independence from the West.’ ” In Berlin, the conservative Welt newspaper said Schröder’s “depressing” appearance showed he had left “his moral compass in the Kremlin cloakroom.” Schröder's visit came as Western governments, including Germany's, have been criticizing Russia over the arrest of more than 1,600 protesters who participated in anti-Putin rallies Saturday.

Schröder’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Merkel, who has taken a tougher line on Russia but has allowed the Nord Stream 2 project to proceed, declined to comment on Schröder’s appearance. A German official close to Merkel, however, wrote in a text message: “I’m quite sure that this is not the path that Merkel will take after her tenure.”","At Putin’s inauguration, former German chancellor Schröder got a front-row spot.

As of April 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require US$25.27 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 95.3 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.

Three significant humanitarian resource mobilization events took place in April: the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, 3 April, Geneva, co-hosted by the UN, Sweden and Switzerland, where US$2.01 billion in contributions for 2018 were announced by 40 entities and a further $20.2 million were announced in multi-year funding; the Humanitarian Conference on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 13 April, co-hosted in Geneva by the UN, the Netherlands and the EU, where $528.1 million were pledged by 22 donors for 2018 and a further $38.7 million for 2019-2020; and the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region Brussels II Conference, 24-25 April, co-hosted by the UN and the EU. This drew 36 announcements of humanitarian funding totalling $4.4 billion for 2018 and an additional $3.4 billion for 2019-2020.

The humanitarian funding outlook for the protracted, entrenched humanitarian crisis in DPRK is particularly concerning, with a persistent risk that geo-political tension – even with the recent positive developments – could dampen funding. 10.3 million people in DPRK are estimated to be undernourished. More than one-quarter of children are stunted and 4% wasted, while about 30% of women of reproductive age are anaemic. The lack of safe water and the poor sanitation contribute to high levels of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, which are the most common causes of death among young children. The 2018 Needs and Priorities Plan released in April calls for $111 million to provide food assistance, health and nutrition services and improved access to safe water and sanitation for 6 million highly vulnerable people.

On 20 April, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine briefed Member States in New York on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people after four years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Disrupted access to critical facilities and diminished livelihoods mean that 3.4 million people are without basic supplies and services and need protection and life-saving assistance. Ukraine has the highest proportion of elderly people affected by humanitarian crisis in the world. Some 1.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced across the country, and some 200,000 live in daily fear of shelling. Funding for the HRP is urgently needed.

In 2018, as many as 7 million people in South Sudan need humanitarian assistance to cope with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and grave protection violations including conflict-related sexual violence. This is the world’s third largest refugee crisis: more than 4.2 million people have been displaced, including 1.8 million IDPs and more than 2.4 million refugees.

Severe food insecurity continues to rise as people are unable to plant or harvest and have limited access to humanitarian assistance. With the lean season beginning in May, urgent funding is required to save lives and resources. On 27 April, the DSRSG/RC/HC for South Sudan formally invited the USG to support him in delivering three key messages when he visits the country in mid-May. Namely, calling for a sustainable political solution to the conflict to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis, with IGAD-led peace talks expected to resume in May; urging parties to the conflict, including the numerous splinter groups, to address the insecurity that affects civilians and aid workers; and advocating for resources towards the HRP which is currently funded at 21%.

Humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic have increased from 2.2 million people in need in early 2017 to 2.5 million this year, with a multiplication of hotspots. The spike in tensions and armed violence that erupted in April is also affecting the capital, Bangui. Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70% over the first quarter of 2017, and the number of refugees increased by 30%; effectively, 25% of Central Africans are currently displaced either as IDPs or refugees. Underfunding remains one of the biggest impediments to stepping up the humanitarian response. By end April 2018 the HRP had received less than 10 per cent of its $515.6 million requirements.

By 30 April, 21 donors had contributed a combined $278 million (including pledges) to 17 country-based pooled funds (CBPFs), which translated into financial support for 308 humanitarian projects implemented by 229 partners. These included international NGOs which received $55.3 million (42% of total budget allocations) while UN agencies received $42.6 million (32% of allocations). Support to national NGOs included $33.6 million (25% of allocations) and to the Red Cross / Crescent movement $0.6 million (0.5% of total allocations). The largest amounts were channelled to Yemen ($77.9 million), the whole of Syria response ($41.7 million), Sudan ($28.2 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($26.5 million). New reserve allocations were launched by the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (HF) for $16.2 million and by the occupied Palestinian territories HF for $2.2 million, on top of its first standard allocation of the year for $3.9 million, to respond to immediate health and protection needs in the Gaza Strip. The Turkey HF launched a second reserve allocation for $4 million to cover urgent life-saving needs of people displaced inside besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria.",2018 Humanitarian Funding Update (as of April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2018-humanitarian-funding-update-april-2018
16,ukraine,"(New York, 20 April) – The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Mr. Neal Walker, today briefed Member States and International Organizations on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people in eastern Ukraine. After four years of conflict, 3.4 million people in Ukraine are struggling to cope with the impact of the humanitarian crisis and urgently require humanitarian assistance and protection.

Every day, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine forces millions of civilians to make impossible choices whether they eat, have medicine, or their children go to school. Critical civilian infrastructure is severely impacted, as ceasefire agreements are consistently disregarded. There were on average 40,000 violations per month last year alone. During his briefing, Mr. Walker said that, “only this week, five water treatment workers were shot while trying to maintain critical water infrastructure along the “contact line”. Today, water supplies to over 345,000 civilians hang in the balance. Last year alone, over 130 incidents affected critical water infrastructure”.

Over 600,000 people, including 100,000 children, bear the brunt of the continued armed clashes along the 457-km ‘contact line’. Every month, over 1 million people are forced to cross the “noman’s land” through checkpoints, many to simply access basic humanitarian and social services.

More than 2,500 civilian men, women and children have been killed, and over 9,000 injured, since hostilities began four years ago.

Explosive hazard contamination in eastern Ukraine is impacting 1.9 million people, including around 200,000 children. The use of landmines across urban areas, farmland and the checkpoints is a constant concern. “Last week, landmines killed a family of four in eastern Ukraine. In 2017, over 235 civilians were killed or injured by landmines and other explosive remnants of war,” said Mr.

Walker.

The humanitarian community is committed to meeting the humanitarian needs of all conflictaffected people in Ukraine. In December 2017, humanitarian agencies launched a highly prioritized US$187 million appeal to reach over 2.3 million of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine with assistance and protection services. So far, this appeal remains largely unfunded. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Walker said: “Today, I call on Member States to stand in solidarity with conflict affected people in Ukraine and to help urgently address this 97 per cent funding gap. I continue to call on the parties to the conflict to take all measures necessary to ensure international humanitarian law is respected – civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. The only solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine is peace. We do not want to mark any further anniversaries of continued conflict.”
