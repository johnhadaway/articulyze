The conference was organised by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), the EU and the Netherlands.

‘The humanitarian situation in the DRC is heartbreaking and requires a fast response,’ said the minister. ‘We cannot abandon the internally displaced and other victims of this forgotten crisis to their fate. The suffering must stop.’ Last month Ms Kaag visited the DRC, accompanied by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Sir Mark Lowcock.

Of the €10.4 million set aside, the majority will go to a UN fund for the DRC, with the rest going to non-governmental organisations that provide emergency aid. For many years now, the Netherlands has also contributed to emergency aid funds through other channels – including those dedicated to easing the Congolese people's plight.

In her speech Ms Kaag stressed that humanitarian assistance alone is not enough, however. She repeated the UN Security Council's call for all armed groups in the DRC to halt the violence.",Netherlands to contribute to humanitarian assistance for Congolese,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/netherlands-contribute-humanitarian-assistance-congolese

""They chased me and the children in the bush,"" said Nyine Richard, 37, sitting among a dozen other machete attack survivors inside a camp for internally displaced people in Bunia, Democratic Republic of Congo.

“They killed my wife and my three children.”

Two deep cuts from a machete blade ran across Richard’s forehead and lower back. His voice quivered as he talked about his pregnant wife, who was hacked to death by a machete, and his youngest daughter, Rachele, 2, who was cut across her face and head.

Weeks earlier he’d fled Tche village with his three surviving children and hundreds of other Hema villagers after it was attacked by a Lendu militia. The attackers set fire to homes and massacred the women and children.

“Their aim is just to finish us. We are so scared for our lives,” he told VICE News.

Richard’s fear is shared by the thousands of other Hema survivors who have escaped gruesome violence in DRC’s Ituri province in recent months.

Since December, fighting between neighboring ethnic groups the Hema and Lendu has flared across Ituri province in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. But the victims have overwhelmingly come from the Hema community, raising fears that an ethnic cleansing campaign is underway. Hundreds of villages have been burnt to the ground, 200,000 have been displaced and at least 250 people have been killed, according to Human Rights Watch.

Now, the U.N. says the surge in violence could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.

“This may be genocide,” Hadji Ruhingwa Bamaraki, the president of the Hema community’s cultural association, told VICE News in March. “The government should tell us why Hema are being killed.”

Rachele Ngabusi, 2, was cut by a machete on her face and head by a Lendu militia that attacked her home in Tche village. The attackers killed three members of her family including her pregnant mother. She was rescued and transported to this camp for internally displaced people in Bunia by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Adam Desiderio for VICE News.

The wave of violence in Ituri has drawn comparisons to an earlier “ethnic” war between Lendu and Hema that ended in 2003. But leaders of both communities say this time is different, and place the blame on unseen political forces. In February, the local Catholic diocese published a report stating that paid mercenaries were deliberately fueling conflict between the Lendu and Hema.

Survivors told the diocese that assailants appeared to be highly organized and were speaking in outside languages, one of which was Lingala — the language spoken 2,000 miles away in the country’s capital.

The military has also faced scrutiny for its failure to stop the violence. Survivors of recent attacks told VICE News that the National Police and the Congolese Army were in the surrounding area during the attacks but did nothing to stop them. We witnessed this firsthand days later when we were escorted by the Congolese army back from Maze village, the site of one of the worst ethnic massacres. The army sped past a burning village nearby — seemingly too afraid or too helpless to stop the attack. Flames could be be seen for miles. Hundreds of villagers were seen streaming alongside the only working road in the area, looking for safety and carrying all their belongings on their back.

The government has repeatedly denied these charges. “Those are false allegations,” Lt. Jules Tshikudi, spokesperson for the Congolese army, told VICE News. “Whenever there is a massacre, every time we have the information about the attacks, we arrive to defend the population.”

Congolese soldiers have denied claims that they were absent during some of the most brutal attacks on Hema tribesman earlier this year. Adam Desiderio for VICE News.

The violence in Ituri comes as the country faces a constitutional crisis roughly 2,000 miles away in the capital of Kinshasa. DRC’s longtime president, Joseph Kabila, is under mounting pressure to relinquish his post after 17 years in power. He was expected to step down in December 2016 after reaching the constitutionally mandated two-term limit, but he has repeatedly postponed elections, citing instability and violence outside the capital as cause for the delays.

In response the Catholic Church has organized monthly rallies across the country urging Kabila to step down. Since December, hundreds of protesters have been taking to the street demanding “Elections without Kabila!” and “Kabila must go!”, but the Kabila government has responded with deadly force — 47 protesters have been killed by security forces in the last year, according to the U.N.

“We don't ask for much. We just want elections!” a protester told VICE News outside Notre-Dame Cathedral in Kinshasa during the Feb. 25 rally held by the Lay Coordination Committee. “All we want is elections. We don't want anymore excuses.”

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

In 2017, the humanitarian crisis dramatically worsened and spread, affecting people in areas previously considered stable and exhausting the adaptive capacity of those previously affected. The sharp increase in violence and inter-communal tensions, particularly in eastern Congo, Tanganyika and Kasais, made DRC one of the world’s biggest displacement crises with 2.2 million new internally displaced people (IDPs) in 2017, bringing the total number of IDPs in the country to 4.5 million. The displacement crisis in DRC also includes over 540,000 refugees from neighboring countries, out of which more than 90,000 arrived in 2017 and are often located in hard-to-reach areas.

By the end of 2017, the rapid deterioration of the situation, along with the combined consequences of epidemic outbreaks and severe food and nutrition insecurity, left some 13.1 million people – more than 1 in 10 Congolese – in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, a 50 per cent increase from January. Women, children and those with special needs remain the most vulnerable. The humanitarian context is further compounded by the political stalemate, the economic downturn, and structural weaknesses in development. In certain areas, logistical and security challenges hinder humanitarian access. In October, the UN activated an L3 emergency for the Kasais, Tanganyika and South Kivu provinces.

Massive displacement and rapid escalation of needs

The beginning of year was marked by the explosion of a new crisis in the Kasai provinces. Initial tensions in Central Kasai rapidly extended to the wider area. More than 1.4 million people - three out of five - were displaced at the height of the crisis, prompting the launch of a Flash Appeal in April 2017. While a relative improvement in the security situation has allowed for many people to return home, 896,000 people remain internally displaced and 33,000 have fled to Angola. Prior to this crisis, humanitarian actors did not have a presence in the Kasai.

At the same time, in the eastern regions of Congo, resurgence of intercommunal tensions and armed conflict between armed groups and the FARDC progressively spread from Tanganyika to neighboring provinces of South Kivu and Maniema, causing massive waves of displacements. The situation did not improve in North Kivu province either, where armed group and militia violence triggered new displacement. In north east and north-west DRC, a new influx of over 90,000 refugees from Central African Republic, Sudan and Burundi resulted in increased competition for scarce resources and contributed to the deterioration of living conditions for the host community.

Acute protection crisis

The resurgence of violence, population movements, as well as frustrations related to the difficult socio-economic context have led to an alarming increase in human rights violations. In the third trimester of 2017, over 30,000 new protection incidents were reported by the protection monitoring mechanism, while some 26,000 new cases of sexual violence were registered in the provinces affected by the humanitarian crisis, out of which 31 per cent in North Kivu alone.

Critical thresholds in food security, health and nutrition

Hunger and malnutrition have reached the highest level on record. 7.7 million people across the country – 11 per cent of the population – are severely food insecure, with this number expected to rise in 2018. This represents a 30 per cent increase from 2017. Insecurity has had a devastating impact on the agricultural season which will be felt well in to 2018, particularly in the Kasais were there has been a 750 per cent increase in food insecurity from pre-crisis to today, and three consecutive planting seasons have been lost. 4.5 million children are acutely malnourished, including an estimated 2.2 million severely acute malnourished (SAM) cases.

Increased displacement and limited access to basic services has left the population increasingly susceptible to epidemics and disease. The current cholera outbreak is the largest on record in more than two decades. Lack of infrastructure also impedes humanitarian access. The poor state of roads and other transport infrastructure across vast swaths of country leave many areas cut off from state services and difficult for humanitarians to access.",DRC Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

As the conflict worsens, 18 of the DRC’s 26 provinces are facing an internal crisis, with 13.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

The Kasai and Kivu provinces have seen the worst effects of the civil war, causing widespread displacement, chronic malnutrition, and the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera.

Direct Relief recently dispatched two tons of medical aid to the DRC. The shipment contained supplies to treat cholera, including 10,000 doses of oral rehydration salts and antibiotics, as well as basic yet essential hygiene items.

The donation was shipped to Save the Children, located in the country’s North Kivu Province, to support mobile medical clinics that travel to serve the country’s displaced populations. The clinics are staffed by local doctors, nurses, and midwives who are placed in areas lacking healthcare facilities and medical services.

Direct Relief will continue to monitor the ongoing crisis in the DRC and provide donations of essential medicines and supplies as needed.

Situation Overview

The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has remained the same during the reporting period. It has been characterized by displacement, Congolese communities continued to flee violence in Ituri and North Kivu to mainly Uganda; malnutrition, especially among children; gender-based violence; and outbreaks of communicable diseases, mainly cholera.

On 13 April 2018, a pledging conference was organized in Geneva by OCHA, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the European Union on the DRC. The aim of the conference was to boost the funding for the humanitarian crisis in the country.

At the conference, international donors announced that they will support the humanitarian assistance in DRC with USD 528 million during 2018.

IOM’s appeal for 2018 amounts to USD 75 million. Currently, the appeal is only 11 per cent funded with USD 8.3 million received since January 2018.",DR Congo Humanitarian Crisis - Situation Report #5 (27 March - 19 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-humanitarian-crisis-situation-report-5-27-march-19-april
8,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Relations between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and international aid agencies have hit a “low point” since the government refused to attend its own donor conference earlier this month, humanitarian experts and officials here and in Geneva said, elevating concerns that relief to more than 13 million people could become a political bargaining chip, ahead of elections now slated for December.

After its no-show at the Congo fundraising conference in Geneva on 13 April, President Joseph Kabila’s government upped the stakes last week by declaring it will set up a new Humanitarian Fund Management Agency to “manage, monitor and control humanitarian funds and work to channel all financial flows affecting the humanitarian sector” in the country.

""Money has been raised. The DRC government must now be involved in its management. If not, there will be serious consequences,"" warned Congolese Foreign Minister Léonard She Okitundu in an interview with local media.

The 13 April donor conference, attended by 54 countries, raised $530 million of the $1.7 billion the UN says is required to meet the needs of 10.5 million people targeted for assistance, including 4.5 million displaced by conflict, many of them suffering from disease and malnutrition.

Three weeks before the conference, however, the government announced it would boycott, with Congolese Acting Prime Minister José Makila accusing the UN and the international NGO community of propagating a ""bad image of DRC throughout the world"".

The government has not elaborated on what the “serious consequences” might be for aid agencies or donor governments that don’t cooperate with its proposal to manage funds. It is not yet clear how the fund is expected to work, but experts on international aid said it is unlikely that donors would use the Congolese government as a conduit for large sums of aid money.

“Can you image the United Kingdom government saying the money they were supposed to send to UNICEF will instead go to the Congolese government to manage?” a senior UN staffer in Kinshasa working closely with the relief effort said. “We are not talking about a normal government. Nobody will send them money to address the humanitarian crisis.”

Few aid workers or officials with international donors and humanitarian organisations who spoke to IRIN would agree to be named for fear that public statements might jeopardise their ongoing work in the country.

But, in a series of interviews with several people close to the matter, serious concerns were raised over both the long- and short-term impact that tensions between the government and the aid sector could have on providing assistance to Congo’s 13.1 million people in need. One UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described relations as at a “low point”.

Congo has suffered from decades of conflict and political dysfunction. As unrest has continued to escalate in North and South Kivu, Tanganyika, Kasai, and Ituri, the number of Congolese requiring humanitarian assistance has doubled since 2014, reaching the same overall numbers as Syria.

Disputing the data

Analysts and aid workers point to domestic politics as the main reason behind the government’s boycott of the Geneva donor conference.

Kabila, who has faced international condemnation since his refusal to stand down from power in December 2016 (several top officials have also been sanctioned by the European Union and the United States) had little to gain from an event focused on the ills of his country. He has vowed not to seek re-election, but voting has been repeatedly delayed and the police have cracked down hard on political protests that have turned deadly in the capital, Kinshasa.

Kabila’s government views a negative portrayal of the country’s humanitarian situation as a gift to the opposition, in advance of the December elections.

The government has disputed the data used to assess the situation. Congo's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Bernard Biango, for example, points to only 230,000 internally displaced people nationwide, compared to the UN’s estimate of 4.5 million.

Kinshasa has said it rejects the UN’s assessment of the humanitarian crisis in Congo, in particular the designation last October of parts of the country as a ‘Level 3 emergency’ – the gravest classification possible – putting the country on a par with Syria and Yemen. The designation was downgraded early in April, a move the UN said was routine, but one that was criticised by some who saw it as a misguided gesture designed to mollify the Congolese government.

As well as contesting the scale of the crisis, two people within the UN said the Congolese government was aggrieved by the decision to invite it to the conference as a guest rather than as co-host and organiser. “It may have been a mistake,” one said.

A Security Council briefing on 19 March by UN relief chief Mark Lowcock, which linked the humanitarian crisis in Congo to the political crisis in Kinshasa, may have also “angered the government”, that same person said.

Implications for aid work

What impact any lasting discord between the Congolese government, donor countries, and aid agencies will have on the relief effort, spread across several insecure regions in the vast country – around two thirds the size of Western Europe – remains to be seen. Earlier disagreements have already had some effect, however.

After a diplomatic spat that began in January, when the Belgian government announced it would carry out a “fundamental revision” of cooperation with the DRC until “credible elections” were held, Kinshasa threatened local and international NGOs that received money from its former colonial power.

At the pledging conference, Belgium said it would contribute up to 25 million euros to “continue expressing its solidarity with the Congolese people”, but Foreign Minister Okitundu has said NGOs that receive this money will not be authorised to work in the DRC.

Analysts said that strained relations could impact aid workers in other ways, too.

NGOs in the DRC regularly confront complicated visa and registration procedures, for example.

Recent statements by Congolese officials “clearly signal that this may worsen, and that they are trying to tarnish the reputation of aid agencies,” said Alexandra Lamarche, advocate for sub-Saharan Africa and peacekeeping for Refugees International. “Bureaucratic impediments could increase and become more crippling and even dangerous.”

For now, however, humanitarians working in the field said they have not noticed any changes. “Local authorities tend to appreciate what we are doing,” one aid worker said, adding: “They don’t receive any help from Kinshasa.”

What would make a difference to people in need is more funding reaching aid programmes on the ground. Before the Geneva conference, still relatively early in the calendar-year process, donors had pledged only 13 percent of the funds requested by the UN, compared to 23 percent for Syria and 46 percent for Yemen.

Some observers suggested the absence of the Congolese government reduced the amount of money raised in Geneva, although it was never expected to near the $1.7 billion target. “All the main crises go through the same donors: if I am a donor and have three conferences, and one of the countries is playing smart and doesn’t want to participate – I’ll keep my money and give to somebody else,” the senior UN source in Kinshasa said.

Veronique Barbelet, a fellow at the London-based Overseas Development Institute, said there was an anxious atmosphere, especially among some local aid agencies working in Congo, for example in places like South Kivu, from where resources have been diverted to help emergencies elsewhere in the country. “It’s not back to square one, but we are seeing serious implications,” she said. “Humanitarian organisations were already thin on the ground.”

Stephanie Wolters, head of the peace and security research programme at the Institute for Security Studies, said the Congolese government’s decision to boycott the Geneva conference was “grotesque political posturing”.

“A responsible government,” she said, “would have welcomed the opportunity to access additional resources to assist its own population.”

The government of President Joseph Kabila has said that it will boycott the gathering, denying that his central African nation faces a humanitarian crisis at all.

The move, which took some diplomats by surprise, was another sign of the increasing isolation of the government of Mr. Kabila, who has faced internal rebellion and international criticism for holding on to power in defiance of constitutional term limits.

The government’s increasingly bellicose stance comes as it has been blasting what it calls international “meddling” in the country’s politics. Under intense international pressure, Mr. Kabila’s government will hold new elections in December, but it has rejected any outside assistance with the poll.","Despite Millions of Displaced People, Congo Rejects U.N.

Complicating the situation, approximately 1.8 million displaced people have started returning to their homes, including some 1.4 million in the Kasai province, where they are faced with abandoned services and destroyed infrastructure, including their homes.

Episcopal Relief & Development is working through the provincial office to serve the Anglican dioceses of Aru, Boga and Bukavu to provide critical food, clothing, medical care and pastoral support to 650 families.

The dioceses will offer pastoral counseling and referrals to trauma specialists as needed.

In 2017, the number of people in the DRC in need of assistance doubled to 13 million. Inter-ethnic conflict and an epidemic of violence against women and children have created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. According to the United Nations, 2.2 million Congolese children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.

“The Church has been very involved in these communities.

11,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Donors gathered in Geneva pledged $528 million (428 million euros) towards addressing a towering humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the UN said.

The amount was less than a quarter of the some $2.2 billion the UN has estimated is required this year to provide desperately needed aid inside DRC and to Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries.

But UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock stressed that the expectation had never been to raise the entire amount in one conference.

“I am pleased with the progress,” he told reporters, highlighting that a number of countries which had not yet made pledges had indicated they planned to do so soon.

Around 100 delegations, including from 54 UN member countries, took part in Friday’s conference.

DRC boycotting conference

But the DRC itself was conspicuously missing. The government has accused the UN of exaggerating the crisis and is boycotting the event.

That move has deepened political divisions in a country facing mounting strife, while its legacy of ethnic conflict, corruption and instability are combining with political tensions to spark fears of bloodshed.

The growing violence has worsened an already dire humanitarian situation in several areas, with underfunded aid agencies struggling to keep up with the needs.

In a video address to Friday’s conference, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the DRC was “experiencing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.”

“Millions of people are suffering,” he said, warning that “the single biggest obstacle is the lack of funding.”

In January, the UN and Kinshasa said $1.68 billion was needed in 2018 to provide urgently needed assistance to some 10.5 million people inside the country.

The UN refugee agency has meanwhile said another $508 million is needed to support more than 800,000 Congolese refugees in surrounding countries, as well as the some 540,000 refugees from the Central African Republic, South Sudan and other countries who have fled into DRC.

Friday’s conference got off to a strong start, with co-host Christos Stylianides, the European Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, pledging 77 million euros ($95 million) of EU aid inside the DRC this year.

DRC’s former colonial power Belgium meanwhile announced that it would give 25 million euros this year, up from 17 million in 2017.

Lowcock said at least 15 donor countries had “significantly” increased their pledged amounts this year.

Impossible choices

In a statement, a coalition of humanitarian organisations warned Friday that the dire underfunding had forced them to cut back on essential aid, including providing food, water and safety to people fleeing violence.

“The lack of funding forces us to make choices we shouldn’t have to make,” Jose Barahona, Oxfam’s Country Director in DRC, said in the statement.

Norwegian Refugee Council chief Jan Egeland meanwhile voiced dismay that Friday’s conference had not generated more funds.

“We are disappointed that too few countries sent a real message of hope to the millions of Congolese children, women and men in desperate need of assistance,” he said in a statement.

In all, the UN estimates that 13 million Congolese need aid, including 7.7 million who are food insecure, and 4.5 million internally displaced people.

The DRC has angrily contested the UN figures, with humanitarian affairs minister Bernard Biango putting the number of IDPs at just 231,241.

Aid bodies and NGOs are propagating a “bad image of the Democratic Republic of Congo throughout the world,” Prime Minister Jose Makila charged last month.

The government has meanwhile promised $100 million “to ease humanitarian distress” and earmarked $10 million to help refugees or those internally displaced to return home.

Lowcock hailed that pledge and said “the government of the DRC is providing the leadership on this crisis.”

The BBC's Africa editor Fergal Keane reports on how the Catholic Church has become the main opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

By the time her brother arrived on the scene Thérèse Kapangala was already dead.

She lay in a pool of blood just inside the main door of the Church of St Francis de Sales, about 15 minutes from central Kinshasa.

Thérèse was a novice nun who grew up in a devoutly Catholic family in the narrow streets of Kintambo, an old Kinshasa neighbourhood where the colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley established his first settlement in 1881.

She lived a short walk from the church.

'Revolt of the reasonable'

On Sunday 21 January she joined protesters who had gathered at St Francis calling for free and fair elections.

Her brother Jean-Claude remembers hearing shooting and the firing of tear gas canisters.

""I said to her: 'Look there's a lot of tear gas, please take this margarine butter' because it is something we use to lessen the effects of the gas on our skin.

""But she already had some and threw away what I gave her. That day she was happy. She was joyful.""

Mobile phone footage from the protests shows people fleeing in panic as tear gas and live ammunition were fired by security forces who surrounded the compound.

Thérèse was dead within minutes of being struck by a single round.

""Even now I can't believe it,"" recalls her mother Mado Longo. ""I think I am dreaming that she has only gone to rest. She was my child but also my friend.""

We were sitting in the family's tiny sitting room. A small shrine had been erected to the memory of Thérèse - there was a memorial candle, some Rosary beads, a statuette of the Blessed Virgin, and a photograph of a serene-looking young woman in her 24th year.

The Kapangalas are not natural rebels. Nor are they partisans of any political party.

In a country where politics has long been contaminated by corruption and division, where human rights abuses are endemic, they represent the revolt of the reasonable.

Thérèse belonged to a broad-based human rights movement that has succeeded in transcending ethnic divisions and challenging the deep-rooted culture of impunity.

'The church will never shut up'

This is not by any means exclusively rooted in the Catholic Church but in recent years clergy and lay people have been at the forefront of attempts to push for democratic change.

It began with church-mediated efforts in 2016 to achieve a peaceful transition from the rule of President Joseph Kabila, whose mandate expired in December that year.

When they failed, it morphed into a mass protest movement.

President Kabila has so far failed to step down, overstaying the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution.

In a country where roughly half of the population is Catholic, the state tends to pay attention when the church intervenes in politics.

The leader of the Catholic Church in DR Congo, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, declared at the beginning of the year that it was ""time for truth to win out over systemic lying, for the mediocre to clear out and for peace and justice to reign in DR Congo"".

What ‘Dr Love’ says about DR Congo

But when priests led public protests the government cracked down with shootings, beatings and arrests.

After the bloodshed, Catholic lay groups called off the protests, saying they would wait to see if President Kabila was sincere about holding elections.

Apparently unconvinced, they announced on 1 May that the truce was over and promised a fresh wave of demonstrations.

""The church will never shut up. No force can make it shiver,"" says Father Joseph Musubao, a relative of Thérèse Kapangala who was saying mass at the church of St Francis on the day she was shot.

""The government's behaviour, their way of doing things, their mode of governing is indescribable… it is bloody and without regrets.""

The state recently allowed a public meeting by the leading opposition party and has promised presidential elections by the end of the year.

But there is continuing suspicion that elections will be delayed again or rigged.

Morally bankrupt?

When I met the Information Minister Lambert Mende, I put it to him that the church was taking a moral leadership role because the government was seen as morally bankrupt.

He replied by denouncing the activities of the Catholic groups.

""I don't know if it is because the government is bankrupt that the bishops are taking a moral role. But they don't have the role… If you want to play a political role please go for elections and tell people to give you a mandate.""

It is possible that elections will take place by the end of the year. But will they be free and fair? Is Mr Kabila really ready to hand over power?

The promised return to the streets of Catholic-led protest groups would be a significant test of the government's true intentions.

Another violent crackdown like that which led to the death of Thérèse Kapangala would not bode well for the hopes of peaceful change in Africa's second-largest country.

DR Congo's political crisis in numbers

13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance

More than 4 million displaced

More than 7 million face severe food insecurity

Two million children at risk of starvation- 12% of cases worldwide

13,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Despite massive natural resources and major socio-economic changes under Government-led initiatives, years of violence by armed groups vying for control – along with ethnic strife in the country’s restive east, and political and ethnic instability – has created massive food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

In Geneva, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock told donors that more than two million children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition in DRC and 13 million people require assistance there urgently – double the number of those in need last year.

He added that DRC is also facing “the worst outbreak of cholera in fifteen years,” as well as “an epidemic of sexual violence,” committed mainly against children.

“As I speak, the resurgence of an inter-ethnic conflict in Ituri in February is killing many people and leading to internal and cross-border displacement of even more,” he said.

Thousands of farmers in the crisis gripped Kasais have missed three successive agricultural seasons, resulting in a drop in agricultural production, he added.

Speaking to journalists in Geneva during a break in the conference, Mr. Lowcock said that he expected to confirm more than $500 million in pledges before the end of the day.

Total needs for the DRC for this year are estimated at $1.7 billion ­– nearly four times more than the amount secured last year.

An additional $500 million is needed to support 807,000 Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries and more than 540,000 refugees from other countries who are in DRC.

The question of securing sufficient funding was underlined by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his opening address to the pledging conference.

He urged Member States in Geneva via a video message to show solidarity for the “millions of people who are suffering” in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises as the UN and the DRC Government work together to respond to needs.

During the conference, Jean-Philippe Chauzy, from the UN migration agency, spoke of the need to strengthen international support for the people of the DRC.

“Confronted with rising intercommunal tensions, political instability and an increasingly insecure environment, the international humanitarian community needs to strengthen its support and commitment to the Congolese people,” said Mr. Chauzy, who is DRC Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

He added: “We simply cannot ignore the speed, and magnitude of [this] crisis.”

Alongside the UN, the pledging conference was co-hosted by the Netherlands and the European Commission.

Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands, described the DRC as a “forgotten” conflict that desperately needed more support from the international community.

She highlighted the impact of gender-based violence on girls and young women whom she had met on a recent visit to DRC.

Some had requested help in the form of rape kits, while others had asked how to look after the babies they had given birth to after their sexual assault.

That message was underlined by conference co-host Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, who spoke of the violence and “stories of unbelievable pain” that he heard while visiting the country in recent weeks.

Asked at the press conference about the decision by the DRC authorities not to attend the pledging conference, Mark Lowcock underlined the scale of the problems in the country – and the importance of securing funding for some 150 organizations working to support humanitarian action “under the leadership” of the DRC authorities in 20 provinces.

“I think everybody recognizes that there is a substantial crisis in the DRC, the Government recognizes that themselves, which [acknowledges] their own very substantial financial commitment to it,” he said, in reference to its $100 million pledge to provide additional aid.",Donors pledge over $500 million to tackle growing needs in DR Congo; UN warns humanitarian crisis cannot be ignored,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1007251

The event brought together its various partners as well as the media outlets in the room Anuarite within its Kinshasa-Gombe Reception Center.

Caritas Congo Asbl was able to mobilize US $ 24,461,919.96 in 2017 for Actions which benefited nearly 8.8 million people, of whom 2.3 million were sensitized on WASH (Water, Hygiene and Sanitation) program. These beneficiaries have been sensitized, treated, assisted, variously supervised and supported, in the vision of Caritas Congo Asbl of a Congo where people live a dignified, responsible and independent life.

Furthermore, Caritas Congo Asbl has urged its internal and external partners to save lives; relieve misery; promote farming and food security; to cure diseases; support education; improve access to basic social services; facilitate good local governance; fight against violence and reintegrate vulnerable people economically.

This work was carried out through projects, implemented by some of its Caritas-Diocesan Offices, whose interventions are not included in this annual report. That is why, the new team of the Executive Secretariat of Caritas Congo Asbl has organized in Kinshasa a workshop on the prevention and the management of the programmatic and financial risks in the implementation of the projects. It brought together both its diocesan members and its partners (Caritas Network and bi or multi-lateral).

This shows the extent to which Caritas Congo Asbl is committed to improve its governance for more effective interventions towards the beneficiary population.

The Executive Secretary of Caritas Congo Asbl in his remarks, thanked “all the Technical and Financial Partners who continue to place their trust in his Institution ‘through various supports ‘. « Caritas Congo Asbl is asking them to continue this support so that it can be able to continue assisting the most vulnerable people in Congo, » indicated Mr Boniface ata Deagbo.

17,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"DR Congo is following through with plans to boycott a conference in Geneva on Friday, which aims to raise almost $1.7 billion (1.38 billion euros) for the conflict-torn country.

The conference comes amid fears of mounting violence in DR Congo, where decades of corruption, instability and ethnic conflict are colliding with deepening political tensions.

However, DR Congo has angrily contested claims by the United Nations (UN) that the humanitarian crisis is currently at ""breaking point"" — a position which has only served to worsen political tensions in the country.

A very real crisis

For those who have fled their homes, the crisis in DR Congo is very real. ""It's like when we had the civil war,"" said one Congolese man, referring to a period of intense violence that ravaged the northeastern province of Ituri between 1999 and 2003. He is one of an estimated 50,000 people who have escaped the recent surge of ethnic conflict in Ituri since January by fleeing across Lake Albert into neighboring Uganda.

The deadly fighting isn't restricted to Ituri — home to long-simmering conflicts over land and mineral wealth. It's also spilled into provinces previously thought to be stable, such as Kasai and Tanganyika.

Adding to the misery is the political crisis surrounding President Joseph Kabila that doesn't look like it's ending any time soon. Kabila's mandate officially ended in December 2016 but he has stayed on in power, saying it's impossible to hold elections amid the fighting. Elections to replace Kabila are repeatedly postponed. Widespread protests against Kabila's failure to step down have been met with deadly violence.

Massive numbers of people on the move

Tens of thousands of people from countries such as Central African Republic, South Sudan and Barundi, seek refuge in DR Congo, adding to the humanitarian crisis

Since the beginning of 2017, some 600,000 Congolese have fled the violence and general instability to other countries in the region. In addition, around 4.3 million people are now internally displaced, estimates OCHA, the UN office responsible for coordinating humanitarian affairs. DR Congo is also home to around 500,000 refugees from other countries.

The UN warned in March that the crisis in Congo was at a ""breaking point."" During a trip to the country last week, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said: ""Unfortunately, operations, refugee operations, humanitarian operations, in the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to be underfunded everywhere.""

Congo's government denies numbers, amid investment fears

Congo's government is at loggerheads with humanitarian organizations over the scale of the problem. Congo's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Bernard Biango, puts the number of internally displaced people at 231,241 — nearly 20 times lower than UN estimates.

Congo's military are fighting rebels and armed groups on many fronts

Regarding Friday's donor conference, DR Congo's Minister of Communications, Lambert Mende, said international organizations were deliberately ""misrepresenting"" refugee numbers in order to gain a ""colossal budget."" ""We do not call this international support, we call it marketing humanitarian aid,"" he told DW.

Congo won't be able to attend the conference, Mende said, if the numbers of refugees aren't reconciled. ""The high numbers of displaced people are frightening investors, and the country is much more dependent on investment for development than development aid,"" he said.

Civil society is 'horrified and upset'

The move has angered church groups and and civil society organizations in Congo.

""Beyond statistics, it is crucial that those in need are helped,"" said the Deputy Secretary General of Congo's National Episcopal Conference, Andre Masinganda. ""This is where international support comes in.""

Congo's Lay Coordinating Commission (Comitee Laic de Coordination) said in a statement it was ""extremely surprised and dismayed"" that the government did not want to speak of a humanitarian catastrophe.

Of course the government is committed to its numbers, commission spokesperson Jonas Tshiombela told DW. ""But on the other hand, [the government] is itself responsible for people's suffering; it hasn't complied with its duty to protect human lives and goods.""

Tshiombela is worried some in the international community will succomb to pressure to stay away. According to French broadcaster RFI, the Congolese government has written to some potential donors asking them to boycott the conference — the United Arab Emirates has already canceled its attendance.

18,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Rwandan President Paul Kagame says the political situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) affects all of its neighbours directly or indirectly hence, neighbours can have a say in what happens there.

He said with as many as nine neighbours bordering the country, its problems were as good as a regional problem. He added that the government should also be clear about what help they need from neighbours as and when.

“Maybe if the leaders of Congo are listening, they should be figuring out what they need to do and also (maybe) let people know where they can help ro resolve that problem.

“Because Congo’s problems are not just Congo’s problems, they affect us as well, as neighbours. Congo has nine neighbours, each one of us is affected by what happens in Congo, there is no question about that,” he stressed.

Kagame was speaking during the Mo Ibrahim governance summit’s dialogue series that took place in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.

The situation in the DRC is essentially a political crisis of Kabila having overstayed his tenure by two years. He was expected to step down in December 2016 but polls were postponed citing lack of a credible register and insecurity.

Other parts of the country continue to experience violent clashes between rebels and government forces. A humanitarian situation has arisen with Congolese fleeing into Zambia and Angola. Elections are slated for December 2018.

Top government officials including Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala and Information Minister Lambert Mende have said Kabila will not ammend the consitution to run. Meanwhile, anti-government protests are routinely dispersed by police.","DR Congo crisis affects an entire region, transition must be credible – Kagame",http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/03/dr-congo-crisis-has-regional-implication-transition-must-be-credible-kagame/
19,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The BBC’s Africa editor Fergal Keane reports on how the Catholic Church has become the main opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

By the time her brother arrived on the scene Thérèse Kapangala was already dead.

She lay in a pool of blood just inside the main door of the Church of St Francis de Sales, about 15 minutes from central Kinshasa.

Thérèse was a novice nun who grew up in a devoutly Catholic family in the narrow streets of Kintambo, an old Kinshasa neighbourhood where the colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley established his first settlement in 1881.

She lived a short walk from the church.

‘Revolt of the reasonable’

On Sunday 21 January she joined protesters who had gathered at St Francis calling for free and fair elections.

Her brother Jean-Claude remembers hearing shooting and the firing of tear gas canisters.

“I said to her: ‘Look there’s a lot of tear gas, please take this margarine butter’ because it is something we use to lessen the effects of the gas on our skin.

“But she already had some and threw away what I gave her. That day she was happy. She was joyful.”

Mobile phone footage from the protests shows people fleeing in panic as tear gas and live ammunition were fired by security forces who surrounded the compound.

Thérèse was dead within minutes of being struck by a single round.

“Even now I can’t believe it,” recalls her mother Mado Longo. “I think I am dreaming that she has only gone to rest. She was my child but also my friend.”

We were sitting in the family’s tiny sitting room. A small shrine had been erected to the memory of Thérèse – there was a memorial candle, some Rosary beads, a statuette of the Blessed Virgin, and a photograph of a serene-looking young woman in her 24th year.

The Kapangalas are not natural rebels. Nor are they partisans of any political party.

In a country where politics has long been contaminated by corruption and division, where human rights abuses are endemic, they represent the revolt of the reasonable.

Thérèse belonged to a broad-based human rights movement that has succeeded in transcending ethnic divisions and challenging the deep-rooted culture of impunity.

‘The church will never shut up’

This is not by any means exclusively rooted in the Catholic Church but in recent years clergy and lay people have been at the forefront of attempts to push for democratic change.

It began with church-mediated efforts in 2016 to achieve a peaceful transition from the rule of President Joseph Kabila, whose mandate expired in December that year.

When they failed, it morphed into a mass protest movement. President Kabila has so far failed to step down, overstaying the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution.

In a country where roughly half of the population is Catholic, the state tends to pay attention when the church intervenes in politics.

The leader of the Catholic Church in DR Congo, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, declared at the beginning of the year that it was “time for truth to win out over systemic lying, for the mediocre to clear out and for peace and justice to reign in DR Congo”.

But when priests led public protests the government cracked down with shootings, beatings and arrests.

After the bloodshed, Catholic lay groups called off the protests, saying they would wait to see if President Kabila was sincere about holding elections.

Apparently unconvinced, they announced on 1 May that the truce was over and promised a fresh wave of demonstrations.

“The church will never shut up. No force can make it shiver,” says Father Joseph Musubao, a relative of Thérèse Kapangala who was saying mass at the church of St Francis on the day she was shot.

“The government’s behaviour, their way of doing things, their mode of governing is indescribable… it is bloody and without regrets.”

The state recently allowed a public meeting by the leading opposition party and has promised presidential elections by the end of the year.

But there is continuing suspicion that elections will be delayed again or rigged.

Morally bankrupt?

When I met the Information Minister Lambert Mende, I put it to him that the church was taking a moral leadership role because the government was seen as morally bankrupt.

He replied by denouncing the activities of the Catholic groups.

“I don’t know if it is because the government is bankrupt that the bishops are taking a moral role. But they don’t have the role… If you want to play a political role please go for elections and tell people to give you a mandate.

The Catholic Church is powerful in DR Congo where nearly half population are believers

It is possible that elections will take place by the end of the year. But will they be free and fair? Is Mr Kabila really ready to hand over power?

The promised return to the streets of Catholic-led protest groups would be a significant test of the government’s true intentions.

Another violent crackdown like that which led to the death of Thérèse Kapangala would not bode well for the hopes of peaceful change in Africa’s second-largest country. – BBC",DR Congo crisis: Why a trainee nun was shot dead at church – Nehanda Radio,http://nehandaradio.com/2018/05/04/dr-congo-crisis-why-a-trainee-nun-was-shot-dead-at-church/
