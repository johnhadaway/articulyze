To date, the DRC RC has nearly completed its target of sensitization communities at risk of the cholera infection as describe in the first phase of the appeal that focuses on the essential epidemiological health and WATSAN needs. This start includes fundamental capacity building of newly formed territorial chapters and a volunteer base that is accustomed to basic lifesaving response activities. The successful growing of skills and support set up and knowledge of the evolving situation on the communities will permit the eventual expansion of the response into its second phase to address needs in Helath, nutrition and livelihood and eventual a potential third phase that would see the geographic expansion of the familiar activities.

In the EPoA published on December 22, 2017, the intervention area is broadly defined as the Lomami province, which is divided into 21 health zones with a total population of 2,443,000. After evaluating the epidemiological situation, it was decided that the response will not specifically target displaced, returnees and host families but instead those communities in the cholera affected areas (or at risk of being affected). Using official Ministry of Health epidemiology data and in collaborations with the health authorities in Lomami province, the DRC RC and IFRC proposed that the first phase of the EA to focus on reducing the risk of cholera in five health zones; Kabinda, Kalambayi, Kamiji, Kanda-Kanda and Ngandajika (total population 1,173,055).

At the time, Ngandajika was the only of the 5 zones with confirmed cholera deaths and the highest confirmed cases reported. Having an active presence in the zones has allowed the teams to focus the sensitization where the cases are still emerging, considering the existing government capacity to deliver sensitization as well as avoid duplication with other organisations doing similar work. Their reports will allow the DRC RC to proactively respond to cases with intensified campaigns as well as disinfection work.

The timing of response activities of the first phase is divided into two parts and has had activities revised and added;

First month:

Sensitization for the reduction of risks of contracting cholera, identifying new cases and reference to medical aid through house-by-house visits by 192 trained volunteers and 19 team leaders to reach 244,300 individuals in all 5 priority health zones. Train and supply materials and equipment for safe burials and household disinfection for suspected cases. Ensure the protection of volunteers (orientations, insurance, protection equipment, etc.)

Subsequent 7 months: In week 6 of 2018 the Ministry of Health warned of an increase in cholera cases, with 79% originating in the Grand Kasai region. This region includes the Lomami province where the Ngandajika health zone reported18 confirmed cases in week six and a total of 9 deaths this year. Given this epidemiological development, not all activities will need to be implemented in all of the five health zones and still require further evaluation to select the areas where. Therefore, the second phase will consist of two blocks of activities:

(i) Focus on disease surveillance in 4 Health Zones with very low caseloads. Minimum community based monitoring in case of a flare, and a gradual exit strategy with capacity building for the territorial branches. Activities will focus on:

• Surveillance and active case search: Training of 150 volunteers in Module 6 of the CBHFA training cycle in all 5 priority health zones. Use the training to highlight gender inclusion in the activities.

• In the 5 health zones, train focal points and supply them with materials and safety equipment to carry out household disinfection of cholera cases and safe and dignified burials. These focal points will be working in close collaboration with the local health authorities.

• Training of WATSAN focal points with the PHAST tool in the 15 territorial branches. This will ensure future capacity to report on needs and initate community based WATSAN activities.

• Liaising with other implementers in the health zones to discuss if RC volunteers could be used as agents in their program implementation (Save the Children is currently conducting an evaluation)

• Discussion with other RC Movement partners to evaluate possibility of bilateral program implementation

(ii) Concentrate risk reduction activities in the most affected Health Areas within the Ngandajika Health Zone. One hundred volunteers and 5 supervisors deliver intensified sensitization to 45,000 persons and WATSAN support to 1,500 households in most affected areas using vulnerability as selection criteria;

• WATSAN baseline and Household vulnerability assessment of 7,500 households

• Establish three chlorination points in the three most affected « health areas »in the health zone of Ngandajika

• Train population of targeted communities on safe water storage/household water treatment and safe use of chlorine tablets (aqua tab).

• Distribute up to 3000 covered containers (jerry cans) for transporting and storing drinking water at the household and soap bars to 1500 vulnerable HH.

• Distribute up to 2,065,500 chlorine tablets (aqua tab) for household water treatment, sufficient for 90 days, to 45,000 people.

(iii) Following an evaluation that will consider the impacts the displaced and returning families on their host communities, select areas to assists with structural WATSAN improvements. Concentrate risk reduction activities in the most affected Health Areas within the Ngandajika Health Zone. One hundred

• Provide safe water to the higher risk schools, market places and health centres by constructing 10 boreholes

• Monitor treatment, use and storage of water through household surveys and household water quality tests.

• Construct up to 10 latrines in public spaces such as schools, markets or health centres. Each latrine will consist of 4 blocks of 5 doors.

• Roll out PHAST (Participatory activity) to promote the construction and proper maintenance along with forming a sustainable promotion structure in the community by training of committees. Provision of essential consumables for maintenance and incentives to ensure most vulnerable can build latrines.

• Hygiene promotion activities in public spaces and at household level,

• Proposed BOCAC evaluation to help guide the capacity building of existing and newly established Territorial National Society chapters. Specific trainings to ensure basic capacity for WATSAN and disease surveillance activities across the province with minimum rehabilitation of NS Provincial offices and provision of basic IT equipment to ensure effective support to the activities and timely reporting by the National Society The funding coverage reached around 40% of the total budget. Efforts are being made to mobilize resources to the Emergency Appeal operation. A partners conference call with partner National Societies (pNSs) was held on 9 March 2018 to update on implementation and request for additional support. Following the partners call, bilateral discussion with partners are taking place exploring windows for new or supplementary contribution.

1,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"(Kinshasa, 10 April 2018) – CARE International is calling on donors to significantly increase their commitment to the humanitarian crisis in the DRC ahead of this week’s pledging conference taking place in Geneva.

Labelled a “silent humanitarian tsunami”, as the humanitarian situation in the DRC deteriorates dramatically, this week’s meeting will seek to raise $1.68 billion, nearly four times the amount secured in 2017.

“Every day, people across Congo are dying because of conflict and violence, and right now there’s not enough resources to help them all,” says David Bisimwa, CARE’s Emergency Coordinator in DRC. “This year, we’re expecting around 13 million Congolese will need humanitarian assistance, that’s one out of every six people. “

The scale of need in DRC is enormous. According to the United Nations, more than 7.5 million Congolese do not have enough food to eat, an increase of 30 per cent over 12 months, and more than 2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. Girls and women have suffered horrific sexual and gender-based violence, and outbreak of diseases, including cholera, measles and malaria, affect tens of thousands of people every year.

A surge in violent conflict and intercommunal tensions forced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them women and children, to flee their homes in 2017.

Escalating violence, particularly in the country’s east, has seen an exodus of Congolese seeking refugee in neighbouring countries in recent months. Refugees from DRC have sought shelter in Angola, Burundi, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

“DRC is a very complex humanitarian emergency, and more than anything people need peace. But for now we need to make sure people survive. Without sufficient funds it is impossible for us to reach all the people in need,” says Bisimwa. “Right now, aid agencies cannot reach all of the seven and a half million Congolese who don’t have enough food to eat.”

2,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing a humanitarian crisis comparable to that seen in Syria, aid agencies warn.

The central African nation, home to 83 million people, “has been hit by waves of violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil in recent months, leading to worries about a new civil war like that which killed five million people between 1997 and 2003”, says The Guardian.

Why is there so much unrest in the DRC?

President Joseph Kabila’s term in office should have ended in December 2016, but the 46-year-old politician has clung to power, using the army to quell growing dissent over his unconstitutional extended mandate.

Kabila promised that elections will be held on 23 December this year, but fears that he will refuse to go quietly are well-founded – the DRC has not experienced a peaceful transition of power since it won independence from Belgium in 1960.

How bad is the situation?

“Few areas are considered safe in the restive DRC right now,” Sky News reports, with the ethnically-divided east and south-east particularly fraught.

Uncertainty around Kabila’s intentions has erupted into unrest and violent repression. “Security forces have killed dozens of people during street protests against the president’s extended rule,” says Reuters.

In addition to government-sanctioned repression, the political chaos and upheaval “have contributed to rising militia violence in eastern Congo’s borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda”, Reuters reports.

More than 15,000 UN peacekeepers are stationed in the country, making it the largest peacekeeping operation in the world.

Violence, hunger and the breakdown of public institutions such as hospitals, schools and police services have driven around five million Congolese from their homes, according to UN estimates.

It also estimates that more than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, making the situation in the DRC a crisis on a similar scale to that seen in Syria. Of these, 7.7 million are facing “severe food insecurity”, defined by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation as going for entire days without eating.

However, UN migration agency chief Jean-Philippe Chauzy warned last month that demand for assistance far outstripped the agency’s means. “Some funding has come in but not nearly enough to meet the critical needs of millions in the DRC,” he said.

What is the future for the DRC?

A poll by the Congo Research Group at New York University and Congolese polling group the Bureau d'Etudes, de Recherches, et de Consulting International ( BERCI) lays bare the bleak future of the DRC as seen by its citizens.

Eight in ten Congolese have an unfavourable opinion of Kabila, “but nearly seven in ten don’t think the December vote to replace him will be fair”, says Reuters.

Tom Perriello, former US envoy to the DRC, told a discussion group at the Brookings Institute in March he had seen a “push for change” from ordinary Congolese keen to bring fresh leadership to the destitute but copper and cobalt-rich nation.

A best-case scenario in December would see a “historic” democratic handover of power, but the alternative is “a breakdown and a great deal of violence”, he said. “The stakes are very high.”",Democratic Republic of the Congo on verge of breakdown,http://www.theweek.co.uk/92682/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-on-verge-of-breakdown

The UN has long been engaged in efforts to bring peace and stability to the vast region, stretches across Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

It has been plagued by decades of political instability and armed conflicts, porous borders and humanitarian crises, as well as tensions over natural resources and other potentially destabilizing factors.

A key step has been the adoption of a UN-brokered accord in February 2013 aimed at stabilizing the DRC and the region.

In today’s briefing, Mr. Djinnit told the Council that while implementation of this accord, formally known as the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, has been slow and requires greater political will, it remains a vital tool to bring stability to the region.

One of the root causes of conflict in the region is exploitation of natural resources from the DRC.

“Continued illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources from the DRC contributes, as we know, to financing negative forces and deprives the country of critical sources of growth and development,” he said.

He also said that in the DRC, tensions persist between the Government and the opposition despite progress in preparations for the elections.

Mr. Djinnit noted that in Burundi, the political and human rights situation remains of great concern as the country heads towards a referendum for constitutional changes.

Further, human rights violations and impunity remain central to the instability across the region, he added, stressing that the humanitarian situation there also requires greater attention.

In a press statement issued after the briefing, the Council reaffirmed that the accord “remains an essential mechanism to achieve durable peace and stability” in the DRC and the region, and called on all signatories to fulfil their respective commitments to address the root causes of conflict and promote lasting regional development.

The accord was signed by 11 countries, namely Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The UN, the African Union (AU), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) act as guarantors of the accord. In early 2014, Kenya and Sudan became the 12th and 13th signatories of the accord, respectively.",UN Security Council urges an end to recurring cycles of instability in Africa’s Great Lakes region,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1006971

To respond to the crisis, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance organized the donor conference in Geneva on April 13 to make its biggest appeal yet for aid to Congo to provide emergency assistance — including food, sanitation, shelter and education — to more than 13 million people affected by the violence.

Mr. Kita said the calls for assistance are “a demonization campaign.” Congolese officials convened a separate meeting in Geneva with other African officials, asking them denounce the aid effort, according to a diplomat with knowledge of the matter. The other nations did not agree to the request.

Still, diplomats and aid workers say they expect the Congolese government’s opposition to have an effect by making it harder for countries at the conference to agree to donate.

The United Arab Emirates, a co-host of the conference, has already said it would suspend participation if the Congolese government did not support the appeal. Congo also threatened Swedish and Dutch diplomats who helped convene the donor conference, saying they did not consult with their Congolese counterparts and warning of unspecified consequences if the European nations continued with the conference.

Christos Stylianides, the European Commission’s top crisis envoy, said during a visit to Kinshasa late last month that foreign assistance would be ineffective without local government cooperation. Donor nations have already pledged $171 million.

An appeal for aid last year fell far short of needs, as donors provided less than 60 percent of what aid agencies requested.

Jose Barahona, Congo country director for Oxfam International, said he has witnessed firsthand what the funding shortfall means for the ordinary Congolese. His organization had to halve its assistance last year, when promised donor funds did not materialize.

The people left out felt hopeless, he said. He recalled one of them pointing to the ground and saying: “I have two of my younger sons buried here. Do you want me to bury more sons?’”","Despite Millions of Displaced People, Congo Rejects U.N. Aid Effort",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/africa/congo-kabila-aid.html

Five rangers and their driver have been killed at the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a spokesman says.

The group was killed in an ambush by suspected rebels operating in the park, Joel Wengamulay told the BBC.

Virunga boasts Africa's most diverse wildlife habitat and is home to endangered mountain gorillas.

Some of eastern DR Congo's armed groups are also based in the park, where they often poach animals.

Virunga is home to about a quarter of the world's remaining 880 mountain gorillas, as well as lions, elephants and hippos.

More than 130 park rangers have been killed in the park since 1996.

6,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"On Monday, the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) held a roundtable on the ongoing crisis taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The various speakers looked at the challenges regarding the electoral process in Congo and what Congolese actors can learn from the various pro-democracy and anti-corruption movements in South Africa. The Daily Vox team were at the roundtable.

The main issues that were raised during the roundtable were that the current president of the DRC Joseph Kabila needs to step down immediately and secondly that elections cannot take place in the current climate that the DRC finds itself in. The speakers’ discussion centred around what needs to happen in order for Kabila to step down, elections to take place and a change in leadership to happen.

However, many of the speakers raised questions around whether the current environment that exists in the DRC would be conducive to elections taking place this year with the general consensus from the panelists and audience that is not something that can happen.

Gerard Bisambu, the executive director of the civil society observer organisation Agir pour les Elections Transparentes et Apaisées who presented on the electoral crisis in the DRC said the environment in the country does not support elections and that the election calendar created by the government just serves to trick the international community. Bisambu said if elections take place in the current situation, they will only seek to reposition Kabila into power.

Additionally, Bisambu said that those in power actually want a referendum which they will then use to change the constitution to allow Kabila to rule without limit. Bisambu said the violence that is ongoing in the country is a political ploy: “Violence in political instrumentation to prevent elections. Kabila’s removal will allow relative stability.”

Bisambu also said that the way moving forward for the people of the DRC was a citizen’s transition meaning the people should be allowed to pick their leader and their own futures.

Ida Sawyer, central Africa director at HRW said that there needs to be stronger political leadership from the South African Development Community (SADC). In particular, Sawyer said that South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa needs to take a stronger position against Kabila, something which was absent while former president Jacob Zuma was in power.

In response to a question from the audience, Sawyer said South Africa should be taking the following measures: “Cutting bilateral support to the Congolese government is certain benchmarks aren’t met like credible elections are held and Kabila stepping down. South Africa could consider imposing targeted sanctions against top Congolese officials and those responsible for the oppression, corruption and human rights abuses. A lot of Congolese officials have assets in South Africa.”

She said South Africa could also support a transition towards elections with a condition of Kabila stepping down. However, over and above, Sawyer said there needs to be bolder leadership from African leaders in getting Kabila to step down.

Another important issue that was raised was regarding the role that South Africa needs to play. It was discussed that South Africa’s role in the Congo needs to extend beyond just the government’s role towards the role that South African multinationals play in the continuing conflict in the region. Participants said that multinationals, many of them South Africa, that operate in the DRC are benefitting from the continuing political instability in the DRC and that is something that needs to be addressed along with the removal of Kabila.

One of the audience make a heart-wrenching statement to the audience saying that Congolese life is being reduced to statistics and asked where is the humanity. This was a sentiment echoed by many of the audience members, who formed part of the Congolese diaspora. The audience members questioned where was the international outrage, media support and general awareness of the terrible conditions that people of the DRC were being made to live in.

Hameeda Deedat, a researcher from Cosatu (Congress of South African Trade Unions) who presented on lessons from South Africa for the DRC said an important thing to note which is that democracy is not as simple as just elections and that the framework of economic interests and democracy needs to be rethought.

The discussion was a very robust and interesting one that posed many questions for the struggle of the Congolese people moving forward. It also showed how nobody can dictate the struggles and means of resistance of another as well as the importance of an intersectional struggle. Representatives from both the HRW and EISA distanced themselves from comments made by audience members and panelists regarding the use of violence in the struggle. They also distanced themselves from comments made by audience members which could have been interpreted as anti-semitic.

Armed men burst into a church meeting room in the North Kivu region April 8 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and killed 38-year-old Fr. Étienne Sengiyumva, the Parish Pastor.

Apr 11, 2018

GOMA: Armed men burst into a church meeting room in the North Kivu region April 8 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and killed 38-year-old Fr. Étienne Sengiyumva, the parish pastor.

Bishop Théophile Kaboy Ruboneka of Goma, in North Kivu Province announced the news to the Vatican’s Fides News Agency

""After celebrating the Mass at Kyahemba, a district in his parish, around 3pm, Fr. Étienne was meeting with his parish staff, when an armed man, accompanied by others, entered the meeting room and shot the priest point blank in the head, killing him instantly, "" the Bishop recounted.



“The murder happened so quickly that those present couldn't take note of how many people had entered the room to kill Fr. Étienne,” he lamented.

The bishop also told Fides that ”it's hard to know who is responsible. Our region is infested with armed groups, at least 15, that fail to be dismantled despite the constant presence of the army and the blue-helmeted UN soldiers.”

Bishop Ruboneka explained that “Fr. Étienne is the third priest killed in the region” and that “the investigations to find those responsible for these deaths go nowhere. On our part, we are doing everything we can to identify Fr. Étienne's killers, even though we have no illusions.”

“In these cases the witnesses fear for their own lives and the lives of their loved ones and it would be hard for them to offer any information useful for the investigation,” he pointed out.

The bishop also stated that Fr. Célestin Ngango was kidnapped from the diocese after celebrating Easter Mass. He was later released, blindfolded, at around 3 am following heavy pressure from the local inhabitants. The Congolese bishops' conference told Fides ""the freed priest was not mistreated and he appears to be in good health. However, he will undergo a medical examination.""



Bishop Ruboneka does not think there is any connection between the two incidents.

“I repeat, in our region there are so many armed groups that it is hard to know who committed this act or another. Here in North Kivu we are living in total chaos,” Bishop Ruboneka said.

In conclusion the prelate stressed that “the situation of the Diocese of Goma, as well as Butembo-Beni, is unbelievable. We are completely abandoned by everyone and we live thanks to the grace of Providence. I ask the faithful of the Universal Church to pray for our region so we can again find peace.”--CNA","Priest killed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, another freed",http://www.heraldmalaysia.com/news/priest-killed-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-another-freed/41806/1

By Dana Hughes in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo | 07 April 2018

UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has met with successful refugee entrepreneurs living in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a landmark visit to the Great Lakes region.

Inside a hip and modern art gallery, Grandi spoke with men and women refugees who own clothing businesses, sell produce from farming, and work in innovation and technology. After hearing how they had triumphed over adversity, he praised their success stories and said they would serve to encourage others driven from their homes and forced to flee.

The refugees have benefitted from education, skills and business management training, supported by local partners and UNHCR. Emmanuel Hulem, fled war in the Central African Republic at 14, along with his family. As refugees in Congo, the family was extremely poor, with Emmanuel responsible for helping his younger siblings. Wanting to go to school to better his life, Emmanuel received help through the urban refugee program. Today he is an information technology specialist, who has won international awards for his innovations in the field.

Emmanuel said the support he received as a young refugee set the foundation for his future success.

“When I got my high school diploma I said to myself, I have made it,” he said. “I was motivated to continue on.”

The Democratic Republic of Congo hosts over 540,000 refugees while also having several million people internally displaced and over 700,000 Congolese living as refugees in neighbouring countries.

“This is a very hospitable country, with open borders, ready to take in people from neighboring countries that have been in trouble for decades” said Grandi. “But it is also a country that has it’s own problems, that has produced refugees, sometimes in the same countries from where refugees come here.”

The High Commissioner, who will be visiting Rwanda and Burundi on this trip, called the region “ a complex web of displacement.”",UNHCR chief meets urban refugees on Congo visit,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/unhcr-chief-meets-urban-refugees-congo-visit

On 23 March 2018, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo met with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on the arms embargo monitoring mandate of MONUSCO. Also present during the meeting were the representatives of MONUSCO’s Joint Mission Analysis Centre (JMAC), United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and the Coordinator of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

During the meeting, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and her team provided updates concerning the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since her predecessor’s briefing to the Committee in May 2017. Armed groups continued to be a major source of concern, and in the space of the last six months, over 27 new armed groups had emerged. This brought the total number of armed groups up to 121 as of February 2018. Armed groups were also using political rhetoric as a justification for their existence, frequently citing the political impasse in the country as the main reason they were fighting. Finally, armed groups continued to attack the Democratic Republic of the Congo security forces and in some instances obtained weapons and uniforms from them. MONUSCO continued to monitor the evolution of these groups, and of some potential spoilers which may endeavour to stoke pre-existing conflicts to raise the electoral stakes. Furthermore, new cycles of violence had erupted in Ituri, with thousands of Congolese refugees fleeing into Uganda. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General called upon the members to continue to pay attention to the dire humanitarian situation in the country.

Following the briefing from MONUSCO, UNMAS gave an updated presentation on weapons and ammunition management activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conveying updated information concerning UNMAS’ role in assisting with the safe storage and management of arms. The representative noted that UNMAS had also been engaging in implementing recommendations from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning weapons and ammunition management in the country. However, she pointed out that there continued to be a lack of financing for UNMAS’ activities, which were more and more necessary in the country.

Committee members welcomed the briefings. They expressed concern over the continued violence in the country, the reports of armed groups attacking security forces, as well as the dire humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Delegations also stated their intention to continue working with and supporting UNMAS’ activities.

This has been effective in mobilizing international capacity to scale up humanitarian support. Since the L3 activation, over 1.1 million people have been successfully reached with life-saving assistance in the Kasais, Tanganyika and the Kivus. The benchmarks established on 20 October 2017 to measure the L3 scale-up have largely been met. The L3 status will accordingly be deactivated on 20 April 2018.

Given that the single most critical issue for the humanitarian response is funding, it is vital that the focus now be on raising the required funds to reach people in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance across the DRC. The 2018 United Nations humanitarian appeal requires US$1.7 billion.

The United Nations continues to engage closely with Government counterparts on the humanitarian situation in the DRC. I look forward to continued, close coordination with the authorities as we continue to work to support millions of people across the country.

Speaking on Monday, the UN's Under-Secretary-General Mark Lowcock said 13 million people are affected by internal conflict gripping the country and require humanitarian assistance.

""More than 4.6 million children are acutely malnourished, including 2.2 million suffering from severe acute malnutrition,"" Lowcock said.

""We're seeing mushrooming epidemics including the worst outbreak of cholera in 15 years. There's also an epidemic of sexual violence - most of it unreported and unaddressed - and much of it against children.""

Fighting in the central African country has much to do with the long-delayed vote to replace President Joseph Kabila.

While elections were initially set for November 2016, they were pushed to December 2018. But the electoral commission has since said voting may not be possible until April 2019.

In the meantime, political opposition has been building up and a report released by the UN on Monday said at least 47 people were killed in the past year in demonstration-related violence.

Various warlords

Speaking from the UN headquarters in New York City, Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna said the UN Security Council is drawing attention to the crisis in DRC - one that involves many layers.

""There's the ongoing political uncertainty with a president who has overstayed his constitutional term in office,"" Hanna said.

This has resulted in a massive amount of internally displaced people, Hanna said.

The UN has scheduled a donor's conference on April 13, where Lowcock said $1.7bn in aid is needed for this year. To date, only four percent of the funds needed for 2018 has been received by the UN.

12,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The European Union’s aid chief urged the Democratic Republic of Congo to take part in a donor meeting on tackling a humanitarian crisis in the vast central African country that’s left more than 13 million people in need of aid.

Congo’s government, which has been under pressure to hold elections that would see President Joseph Kabila leave power, has said it won’t participate in the April 13 donor conference and rejects United Nations’ estimates of the scale of the crisis. Recent conflict in Congo’s east and center has forced millions to flee their homes, caused widespread hunger and stirred echoes of the country’s 1998-2003 ruinous war.

“The figures are shocking and the situation on the ground is getting worse day by day,” European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides said in an interview Monday in the capital, Kinshasa. “Our assistance cannot be effective without the cooperation of the government,” which is “not only valuable but absolutely necessary,” he said.

The EU, UN and governments of the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates are organizing next month’s conference in Geneva, where they’ll seek $1.7 billion funding for aid activities in Congo. Last year, just over a quarter that amount was secured for humanitarian response activities in the African country as disasters such as Syria and Yemen seized world attention.

Highest Emergency Level

More than 5 million Congolese have fled their homes -- about 4.5 million internally displaced and the rest in neighboring countries -- and 2.4 million more may be uprooted this year, according to the UN. In October, the organization designated parts of Congo an L3 crisis -- its highest emergency level.

Congo’s government described the L3 rating as “excessive” in a March 22 statement and said there was “discordance” between its statistics and those from humanitarian organizations. Activating the emergency “based on facts that are not real constitutes a brake on development” that discourages investors while the authorities are working to stabilize the economy, it said.

Any change in its stance on participating will depend “on the harmonization of views between the government and the humanitarian partners,” Congo’s government said.

Stylianides, speaking at the end of a three-day visit to the country, said he had “very frank and constructive discussions” on Monday with Humanitarian Affairs Minister Bernard Biando Sango and Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Agee Matembo Toto and he’s hopeful the government will rethink its position.

By Agence France-Presse

A humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo is worsening and has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country, with millions facing severe hunger, the UN Security Council warned Thursday.

At least 13.1 million Congolese are in need of humanitarian aid including 7.7 million who are severely food insecure, said a unanimous statement from the top UN body.

The humanitarian crisis has been compounded by a doubling over the past year of the number of Congolese fleeing violence in the country who now total close to 4.4 million.

Council members “expressed great concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, which has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country”, said the statement.

The council “emphasized the need to address the presence of armed groups in the country” and renewed its call for “transparent, credible and inclusive elections”.

Kinshasa authorities have set a date of December 23 to hold historic elections but it remains unclear whether President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, will step aside to allow a transition.

UN officials fear the country could slide into all-out violence as the countdown to the elections begin.

An international conference will be held in Geneva on April 13 to mobilize funding for a $1.7 billion humanitarian appeal for the DR Congo — four times the amount secured last year.

The United Nations has declared the humanitarian crisis in the DR Congo to be a Level 3, the UN’s highest-level emergency.

The council statement followed a meeting on Monday on the crisis.

At that meeting, the US head of the international development agency, Mark Green, said the Kabila government had done “so little to alleviate suffering, even as many of its leaders have apparently been lining their pockets.”

The Kabila family owns either partially or wholly more than 80 of the largest businesses in the country and more than 450 miles of diamond concessions, Green said, quoting the Congo Research Group.

SECURITY COUNCIL

8227TH MEETING (AM)

Credible and inclusive elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by a peaceful transfer of power, would have a positive effect on peace, stability and development in the wider Great Lakes region of Central Africa, speakers said today as the Security Council debated regional developments that also included humanitarian concerns and the activities of armed groups.

Said Djinnit, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region, reporting on the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, urged the Council to remain united in its support for the implementation of the 31 December 2016 political agreement among Congolese political leaders under which elections would be held on 23 December 2018 for a successor to President Joseph Kabila.

The Great Lakes was among Africa’s most volatile and complex regions, but it was also one that could make a meaningful contribution to the continent’s stability and development, he said. He encouraged the Council to keep urging the parties concerned to work towards the common goal of peace, stability and sustainable development for the region and its populations.

The representative of the Congo, whose President holds the Chair of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region’s Regional Oversight Mechanism, said the Democratic Republic of the Congo was undoubtedly the nerve centre of the Great Lakes region and the cornerstone of the Framework. The task at hand was to help that country regain stability so it could become a catalyst for lasting peace in the wider region. In that regard, he added, the international community must mobilize around regional efforts with strengthened coordination and cooperation.

In the ensuing debate, which followed the Council’s renewal on 27 March of the mandate of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) (see Press Release SC/13265), several speakers drew a link between the forthcoming elections and improving the lives of millions in the wider Great Lakes region. Many drew attention to other challenges, too, including human rights abuses, the humanitarian situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the flow of refugees and internally displaced persons.

The representative of France, the Council penholder on the Great Lakes region, emphasized the importance of elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a peaceful handover of power, stating that regional stability was at stake. Respect for human rights and the electoral calendar was key, he asserted, underscoring the role of regional organizations as well as the need to confront armed groups and the illicit trafficking in natural resources.

Equatorial Guinea’s delegate said the Great Lakes region had strategic importance for the stability of all Africa. The enormous potential of the region’s natural resources — once peace was achieved — would allow the region to flourish. As things stood now, conflicts were “bleeding its countries dry”. Emphasizing that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was central to overall regional stability, he said the upcoming elections could help open a new chapter, and that Kinshasa must work closely with its regional and international partners to ensure that voting was carried out smoothly.

In the same vein, the representative of the United States urged the Special Envoy to ensure that the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo moved forward. Those elections must be inclusive and credible, followed by a peaceful handover of power, she said, adding: “No more delays would be tolerated.” For its part, the Council must not lose sight of other challenges in Great Lakes region, she said, urging the Special Envoy of any steps that might be required to advance his mission.

Ethiopia’s delegate said displacement resulting from conflicts had resulted in a humanitarian crisis. A major challenge faced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the persistence of armed groups in the east. Expressing hope that the Council would seriously consider that matter, he called for enhanced regional cooperation to support the successful conduct of the upcoming elections. Going forward, the work of Special Envoy’s office and the implementation of the Framework would remain crucial, he added.

Also speaking were representatives of the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Kuwait, Netherlands, Bolivia, Poland and Peru.

The meeting began at 10:52 a.m. and ended at 12:42 p.m.

**Briefing*

SAID DJINNIT, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region, introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region (document S/2018/209). Since his last briefing to the Council, his office had continued to support the Framework’s implementation in close collaboration with the African Union, Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. In particular, it focused on negative forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, support to meaningful dialogue and electoral processes, addressing root causes of conflict and mobilizing the region’s leadership through the Framework’s governing mechanism to promote dialogue and cooperation between its signatory countries.

Noting the Framework’s recent fifth anniversary, he said that instrument had yet to fully deliver on expectations. However, it remained a vital tool for promoting regional cooperation, peace and stability alongside the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region of 2006. At a consultation in Addis Ababa, participants highlighted the need for greater political will. Going forward, he said there must be greater resolve to mitigate mistrust between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, and cited efforts in that regard by regional leaders, the African Union and the President of the Congo in his capacity as President of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.

Turning to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he said that — in addition to strengthening the United Nations force intervention brigade under the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) — it was important to tackle the financing of armed groups by combatting the illicit exploitation and trafficking of resources. To set the stage for inclusive and credible elections, it was crucial that the Council remain united in its support for the implementation of the 31 December 2016 peace accord. Regarding the situation in Burundi, he said regional leaders and the African Union, with United Nations support, must do more to encourage dialogue between the parties in that country. States in the region and humanitarian actors must also propose sustainable regional solutions to the Great Lakes region’s humanitarian crisis.

He said that the United Nations must, in collaboration with leaders in the region, address the overlap of mandates and objectives between the Framework and the Pact on Security, Stability and Development, considering the comparative advantages of each instrument and the need to ensure complementarity and synergy. Concluding, he said the Great Lakes remained one of Africa’s most volatile and complex regions, but also one that could make a meaningful contribution to the continent’s stability and development. He encouraged the Council to continue to urge the parties concerned to work towards the common goal of peace, stability and sustainable development for the region and its populations.

Statements

RAYMOND SERGE BALÉ (Congo), noting that his country’s President was Chair of both the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region’s Regional Oversight Mechanism, briefed the Council on the 19 October 2017 regional summit in Brazzaville, which focused on the neutralization of negative forces, the repatriation of disarmed fighters, and dialogue and political processes. He drew attention to significant progress in the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, emphasizing, however, the need to respect the electoral calendar and to make progress on electoral financing, logistics and security vis‑à-vis armed groups. “We are moving into a critical phase,” he said, calling on the political class and civil society to go the extra distance and ensure a peaceful electoral process. The international community had an essential role to play in that regard and the guarantors of the Framework must work towards the implementation of the electoral road map.

He went on to review developments elsewhere in the region, including the reconciliation agreement in Kenya, the persistence of violence in the Central African Republic, the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) dialogue process in South Sudan and the upcoming constitutional referendum in Burundi, as well as efforts to improve relations between Burundi and Rwanda. Emphasizing the link between peace and development, he said the international community must look beyond electoral calendars, as lasting peace and security would require other means of support. Returning to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he said that country was undoubtedly the nerve centre of the Great Lakes region and the cornerstone of the Framework. The duty now was to help it regain stability so that it could become a catalyst for lasting peace in the wider region. In that regard, the international community must mobilize around regional efforts with strengthened coordination and cooperation.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France) said the development of the Great Lakes region hinged on reinforcing political stability, strengthening democratic institutions and fighting impunity. He emphasized the importance of elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a peaceful handover of power, stating that regional stability was at stake. Respect for human rights and the electoral calendar was key. Underscoring the role of regional organizations, he emphasized the need for military engagement against armed groups, as well as political action to demobilize, disarm and reintegrate foreign fighters in their countries of origin. At the same time, there could be no stability so long as illicit trafficking in resources continued, he said.

TEKEDA ALEMU (Ethiopia) said that, five years after the Framework’s signing, the security situation in the Great Lakes region remained worrying. The displacement resulting from conflicts had resulted in a major humanitarian crisis. The major challenge faced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular, was the continuing operation of armed groups in the country’s eastern section. Expressing hope that the Council would seriously consider that matter — especially in light of the country’s upcoming elections — he also hoped more efforts would be pursued towards confidence-building measures among actors on the ground, and that all would refrain from actions that might escalate tensions. Calling for enhanced regional cooperation to support the successful conduct of the upcoming elections, he said conflicts in the region could only be resolved through a peaceful political process on the basis of the Arusha Agreement. Going forward, the work of the Office of the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region and the implementation of the Framework would remain crucial, he said, underlining the need to redouble efforts towards the latter.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea) said the Great Lakes region had strategic importance for the stability of the entire African continent. All actors must seek a common ground, in particular in implementing the Framework. The great potential of the region’s natural resources — if peace was achieved — would allow the Great Lakes region to flourish, he said, noting that on contrast the current conflicts were “bleeding its countries dry”. Calling for full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and all the States of the region, he said the situation in that country was central to the region’s overall stability and added that its upcoming elections could help open a new chapter for its people. All possible scenarios for the election should be studied with great care, and that country’s Government must work closely with its regional and international partners to ensure that it was carried out smoothly.

KAREN PIERCE (United Kingdom) said “what happens in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] over the next few months could be a defining moment in greater regional stability”. The United Kingdom remained committed to supporting the Framework’s implementation, as well as the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December. However, several key challenges — including a lack of progress in repatriating some foreign fighters — remained, and she was concerned about the continued proliferation of violence in North and South Kivu, the Kasaïs and other parts of the country. There were more internally displaced people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo than in any other country in Africa and more than 13.1 million of its people needed humanitarian assistance and protection. The signatories of the Framework must work to implement that accord, and ensure the smooth conduct of the upcoming elections by adhering to the electoral calendar and fully respecting the confidence-building measures agreed in 2016, she said.

DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said his delegation concurred that the Framework was a cornerstone for Great Lakes stability. There must be full compliance by all signatories of that still relevant document. Five years after the Framework’s adoption, its military provisions were far from being implemented, with the activities of armed groups prolonging interethnic conflict, illicit resource trafficking and fuelling a deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Emphasizing the need to address root causes, he said it would be unacceptable to impose solutions at a time when many Great Lakes countries were building or reforming democratic institutions. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular, responsibility for normalizing the situation rested with the people. External assistance — including robust mediation involving the African Union, United Nations, the International Conference and others — should in that context play a constructive and positive role.

ZHANG DIANBIN (China) said peace and stability in the Great Lakes region had remained fragile. Emphasizing the principle of “African solutions to African problems”, he said the leadership of regional countries and organizations must be respected. The international community should do more to help the region build up its security capacity, honour its commitments in a timely fashion and increase its infrastructure investment. Economic and social development should be promoted, including effective solutions to youth employment and refugees. He went on to note China’s support for peace efforts and its contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations in the region.

BERNARD TANOH-BOUTCHOUE (Côte d’Ivoire), noting that the Council had often discussed the situation in the Great Lakes region several times in the past three months, said it was clear that progress towards lasting peace and stability was running up against security, political and humanitarian challenges. He urged the Special Envoy to persevere in his efforts towards the effective implementation of the Framework, and expressed support for the priorities set out by the instrument’s signatories. Côte d’Ivoire called on all stakeholders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to implement the 31 December 2016 agreement with the aim of holding credible elections. At the same time, he said the worsening security and humanitarian situation in the east of that country was especially alarming, and urged donors to ensure the success of the upcoming high-level conference in Geneva on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

DIDAR TEMENOV (Kazakhstan), welcoming the Framework’s signatories’ increasing ownership for its implementation, nevertheless expressed concern about recurring cycles of violence in the region and its deteriorating humanitarian situation. Noting that the destabilizing actions of local and foreign armed groups exacerbated political tensions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he called for efforts to strengthen the capacity of that country’s armed forces to combat such groups with the help of the Mission’s intervention brigade. Also critical would be reactivating the regional follow-up mechanism to expedite the repatriation of disarmed combatants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries. Echoing concerns about the lack of progress in the inter-Burundian dialogue, he called on all stakeholders to establish constructive dialogue in the spirit of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, and urged the international community to continue to support the East African Community’s promotion of inclusive dialogue. Additionally, the suffering of the region’s 11 million internally displaced persons should remain a focus, and efforts must be pursued to address the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the region’s combat zones, which funded armed groups and criminal networks.

OLOF SKOOG (Sweden) said that strengthening regional forums for dialogue, information-sharing and transparency, as well as increased joint monitoring, could help the Great Lakes region resolve key issues central to building sustainable peace. The United Nations had an important role to play in that regard. Emphasizing that the humanitarian, political and security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the most pressing issue, he said that — in partnership with regional actors — the Council must support credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections on 23 December. It was essential for women’s voices to be heard, he said, adding that continued regional leadership — including implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — was essential for peace and development.

MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI (Kuwait) described the spread of armed groups in the Great Lakes, as well as the violence they committed and their pillaging of natural resources, as a critical challenge to the region’s stability and to its future development. Expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he said all actors must prioritize efforts to end conflicts, neutralize armed groups and address the humanitarian crises resulting from forced displacement. The United Nations missions in the region were among the world’s largest in terms of human resources and budgets, he said, noting that that activities reflected the international community’s common commitment to restore stability and alleviate suffering. When the Framework Agreement was signed in 2013, it had been held up as a source of hope and a possible cornerstone for stability in the Great Lakes region; regrettably, the agreement was now entering its fifth year without adequate implementation. Calling on States and regional organizations to step up efforts in that regard, he said the escalation of violence by armed groups in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo — and especially their attacks against civilians and peacekeepers — were of critical concern. The Governments of the region must unify their efforts to curb those attacks, he stressed.

KAREL JAN GUSTAAF VAN OOSTEROM (Netherlands), citing significant progress achieved in the five years since the Framework’s adoption, said the presence of some foreign armed groups had been reduced, judicial and development cooperation had been increased, and regional organizations, such as the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, had been strengthened. However, challenges remained, including the continued operation of some armed groups and the failure to repatriate members of some foreign groups such as the 23 March Movement and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. The Framework remained a relevant and viable tool to deal with those challenges, he stressed, citing the region’s complex security environment and spotlighting the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s December elections. Calling on the Government of that country, and of Burundi, to respect fundamental human rights and to open political space to ensure the full and free participation of peaceful political parties, civil society and media, he also underscored the importance of regional cooperation, welcoming the roles played by the African Union, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and SADC in the Framework’s implementation.

SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia) said his country was optimistic about the Framework’s implementation and called on its signatories to keep promoting peace and security. The Great Lakes region was rich in natural resources, but multinationals and neocolonial mechanisms had weakened the ability of States to use those resources to their own benefit. Armed groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and the Lord’s Resistance Army meanwhile remained a constant threat. Expressing concern over violence and a worsening security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, he said confidence-building measures must be strengthened.

PAWEL RADOMSKI (Poland) said political tensions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, South Sudan and the Central African Republic remained a source of instability. Implementing confidence-building measures and ensuring a peaceful political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo would be critical to the stability for the wider region, while countering illegal cross‑border activities was essential for addressing the threat posed by armed groups. Expressing concern about a significant increase in refugees and internally displaced persons, he said more attention must be given to the human rights situation, as well as an effective international response to attacks and abuses, including those which targeted women and children. Full implementation of the Framework was in the interest of its signatories, who should step up their commitments, he said, calling also for more preventative diplomacy, promotion of good practices and continued interest by the international community with the situation on the ground.

ELAINE MARIE FRENCH (United States) said political impasse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had heightened tensions, weakened State authority and increased the risk of unrest. The United States urged the Special Envoy to ensure that the electoral process moved forward, with the 31 December 2016 political agreement being fully implemented. Elections must be inclusive and credible, followed by a peaceful handover of power, she said, adding: “No more delays would be tolerated.” While the focus remained on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Council must not lose sight of other challenges, she said, urging regional stakeholders to do more to foster dialogue in Burundi. She went urged the Special Envoy to continue engaging with regional stakeholders and to inform the Council of any steps necessary to advance his mission.

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru), Council President for April, speaking in his national capacity, highlighted the importance of a regional approach, emphasizing that efforts by various partners must be coherent in order to be complementary, leading to better cooperation for the benefit of all. Elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and dialogue in Burundi must advance in an inclusive manner, with broad participation from their respective populations. Expressing concern about the humanitarian situation, he said violence and insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had put more than 11 million people in a precarious situation. They must be protected, including women, girls and boys, he said, emphasizing also the need to effectively fight impunity.

15,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"DRC, a vast country in Central Africa attracts less attention from donors (probably due to its protracted nature); but continues to be in a humanitarian crisis.

In line with UN Policies, in October 2017, DRC L3 Emergency was declared, as a consequence of the complexity of a conflict crisis. The emergency covers the provinces of Kasai, Tanganyika and South Kivu.

The Kasai Provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo are currently experiencing violent ethnic /tribal conflicts, fueled by the violent death of the local tribal chief, Kamuina Nsapu and the subsequent calls among his followers to avenge his death have caused unrest among the population.

As a result, an unprecedented massive population displacement has been reported within and outside 5 provinces of Great Kasai which encompass Kasai, Kasai central, Kasai Oriental, Sankuru and Lomami to date.

Last year (June 2017), it was reported that 1.4 million people were forced to flee from their homes, escaping violence. About 33,132 people reportedly crossed the border to Angola and displacement has continued to date both internally and to neighboring countries.

The DRC forum has launched a call for action (Full appeal) to the Kasai crisis due to the many emerging changes in the crisis in DRC contextual scope after DRC ACT alliance forum released the concept note.

DRC ACT alliance members namely Christian Aid (CA), Lutheran World Federation (LWF), Church of Christ in Congo (ECC) and Bureau Oecumenique d'Appui au Development (BOAD) are preparing a response in the sectors of NFI/Shelter, Nutrition, Psycho social support, WASH and Food security amounting to $ 2,868,034 for a period of 18 months starting April 2018.

This document is the 2018 Update of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2017 - 2019 for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In 2017, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) adopted its first multi-year strategy. The multi-year HRP is grounded in the recommendations emanating from the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and aims to foster a more effective humanitarian response adapted to the specific humanitarian context of the DRC - namely the scale, the cyclic and acute nature of the crisis. While 2017 was characterized by a dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation, the HCT has agreed that the multi-year and multi-sectoral approach of the 2017 - 2019 HRP remains valid.

The 2018 edition of the HRP reflects updated objectives, activities, indicators, and sectoral strategies adapted to suit the current context. The document also includes an overview of the progress made in implementing the collective commitments of the humanitarian community on the key themes identified in the 2017 - 2019 HRP.

2017 OVERVIEW

Humanitarian actors worked tirelessly in 2017 under the HCT leadership and in support of the DRC authorities to deliver lifesaving assistance to millions of people across the country. Faced with a dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation across much of the country - namely the outbreak of violence in the Kasai region and the resurgence of conflict in the East - the humanitarian community quickly mobilized to launch significant coordination and advocacy initiatives. A Flash Appeal for the Kasais was launched in April which, thanks to the support of donors, led to a major deployment in Kasai region where humanitarian actors have traditionally had little presence. The advocacy by the humanitarian community led the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to declare System-wide “Level 3” Emergency in October to rapidly scale up capacity for the crises in Kasai region and provinces of Tanganyika (including Pweto and Malemba-Nkulu territories) and South Kivu (including Maniema), where the situation had deteriorated dramatically. Humanitarian organizations assisted 2.7 million people across the DRC in 2017. However, more efforts are required, as assistance reached only 33 per cent of the people in need. Underfunding was a significant impediment to the response in 2017, with only US$398 million received – 49 per cent – of the $812.6 million required under the HRP.

PREFACE BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR

In January 2017, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Humanitarian Country Team launched its first multisectoral and multi-year Humanitarian Response Plan covering 2017-2019. In addition to implementing the global commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit, this approach allowed the humanitarian community to focus more strategically on a humanitarian situation that was already deteriorating.

The humanitarian situation worsened dramatically in 2017, exceeding the planning projections. Conflict expanded across several localities in Kasai region and violence intensified in the country’s east, exponentially driving up population displacement, food insecurity, malnutrition and the spread of epidemics. Today, the DRC hosts more than 4.5 million internally displaced people, the highest number of any country on the African continent.

The overall objectives and response strategies of the threeyear plan remain broadly relevant. However, the figures and the strategy have had to be updated to suit the current context. The 2018 edition reflects these revisions.

In a country nearly the size of Western Europe, humanitarian actors have striven to assist a growing number of people in increasingly large areas amid some of the lowest aid funding in 10 years. The factors contributing to the deterioration in the humanitarian situation severely stretched the capacity of humanitarian actors to respond, prompting the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator to activate the highest level of emergency response – a Level 3 – for the Kasai, Tanganyika and South Kivu crises. A reform of the humanitarian coordination structures is being carried out to streamline the system and improve the flexibility of response.

The projections are alarming: the current high level of vulnerability and need is unprecedented in the history of humanitarian appeals in the DRC, jeopardizing stability and development endeavours. Eighteen of the DRC’s 26 provinces face humanitarian emergencies. Around 13.1 million – including 7.7 million children – will need humanitarian protection and assistance in 2018, representing a 50 per cent increase from 2017. This includes 7.5 million people who are displaced or returned and need assistance to meet basic needs such as shelter and clean water; 9.9 million people who require assistance to meet their food needs; and 4.5 million children who require treatment for malnutrition. The alleviation of suffering – and at times survival – of millions of men, women, girls and boys will depend on the humanitarian community’s ability to mobilize in the year ahead.

I take this opportunity to salute the partners who have contributed to the significant collective progress of the humanitarian response in the DRC. Efforts are now required to build on this progress and adapt the response to meet urgent needs across the country. In 2018, US$1.68 billion is required to assist 10.5 million people. The importance of flexible funding in this volatile environment cannot be understated, and it is essential that contributions to the DRC Humanitarian Fund reach 15 per cent of the total HRP requirement. I would like to encourage donors to prioritize funding over several years in accordance with their commitments under the “Grand Bargain”.

18,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The United Nations is downgrading Congo from its highest level of humanitarian emergency after the arrival of aid - and an outcry from government officials who say the focus on such woes is deterring investment.

It activated a so-called Level 3 emergency for Democratic Republic of Congo in October, putting on the country on the same footing as Syria and Yemen.

But that is due to be deactivated this month, a senior U.N. official said in a statement on Thursday.

Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, according to a U.N. report last month, as militia violence spikes across much of the country’s eastern borderlands.

Humanitarian officials from foreign donors and aid agencies have repeatedly said in recent weeks that the crisis is worsening and that the country’s needs are well short of being met.

Congo’s government rejects that the humanitarian situation is getting worse. It says it only recognizes about 231,000 internally displaced Congolese compared with U.N. estimates of around 4.3 million - 19 times higher.

The government is also shunning a conference this month in Geneva organized by the United Nations and other donors in an effort to raise $1.7 billion for Congo, saying the focus on humanitarian woes is deterring investment.

In the statement, U.N. Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said that since the Level 3 emergency was activated for Congo last October over 1.1 million people had received life-saving aid.

“The benchmarks established on 20 October 2017 to measure the L3 scale-up have largely been met. The L3 status will accordingly be deactivated on 20 April 2018,” Lowcock said.

The crisis in Congo’s perpetually volatile east - where conflict, hunger and disease killed millions in civil wars around the turn of the century - has been further fueled by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in 2016.

Kabila denies clinging to power and says that elections have been delayed because of logistical problems.

19,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Presentation at the roundtable: “Political, Electoral and Human Rights Crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Learning from Experiences in South Africa and the SADC Region,” co-hosted by the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) and Human Rights Watch

The Democratic Republic of Congo faces a worsening humanitarian, human rights, and security crisis. The consequences have been devastating for the Congolese people, with some 4.5 million people displaced from their homes – more than in any other country in Africa – and 2 million children at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of refugees have fled into Uganda, Angola, Tanzania, and Zambia in recent months – raising the specter of increased regional instability if the crisis is not contained.

The South African government and the broader Southern African Development Community (SADC) region – which South Africa now chairs – can play a critical role in helping to bring durable peace, stability, and greater respect for human rights in the vast central African country.

The potential opportunities that a stable Congo could bring to the Congolese people and the broader region are mind boggling. The country is teeming with natural resources – gold, diamonds, coltan, tin, uranium, and oil – just to name a few. Congo is Africa’s biggest copper producer and the world’s largest source of cobalt– a metal that has tripled in value in the past 18 months, given the surge in demand for electric cars. Congo is home to immense biodiversity and the world’s second largest rainforest, which serves as a significant carbon sink for greenhouse gases. Congo’s rivers have the hydropower potential that could one day power half of sub-Saharan Africa. With 80 million hectares of arable land and diverse climate conditions, Congo has the agricultural potential to feed much of Africa. And the country’s volcanoes, gorillas, and stunning landscapes present enormous opportunities for the tourism industry.

Yet despite these riches, Congo is one of the world’s poorest countries in the world. Ten out of 100 children in Congo die before they reach the age of 5, and more than 40 percent have stunted growth due to malnutrition. Poor governance and largescale abuses by armed groups and members of the Congolese security forces – fueled by widespread impunity and struggles for control over the country’s vast resources – have stunted the country’s development and left countless victims. Today, more than 13 million Congolese affected by recent violence are in need of emergency assistance, including food, sanitation, shelter, and education, according to the United Nations.

Much of the violence that plagues Congo today is linked to the country’s broader political crisis, as President Joseph Kabila has stayed in power beyond his constitutionally mandated two-term limit by delaying elections and quashing dissent. Security forces have killed over 300 people during largely peaceful protests since 2015. Hundreds of opposition supporters and democracy activists have been thrown in jail. Kabila’s ruling coalition has systematically banned meetings and demonstrations by the opposition while jailing hundreds of opposition leaders and supporters, as well as human rights and pro-democracy activists. Many have been held in secret detention facilities without charge or access to family members or lawyers. Others have been tried on trumped-up charges. Last July, unidentified armed men shot and nearly killed a judge who refused to hand down a ruling against an opposition leader. The government has also shut down Congolese media outlets, expelled hard-hitting international journalists and researchers, and periodically curtailed access to the internet and text messaging.

During the most recent protests – on December 31, January 21, and February 25 – Congolese security forces hit a new low by firing into Catholic church grounds to disrupt peaceful services and processions following Sunday mass, killing at least 18 people and wounding and arresting scores of others. When confronted by the heavily armed police and soldiers, some protesters, dressed in white or holding religious symbols – such as crosses, bibles, rosaries, and palms – sang hymns or knelt on the ground.

In the days leading up to the February 25 protests, ruling party officials and senior security officers paid at least several hundred youth recruits – including many from the ruling party’s youth league – and gave them instructions to infiltrate churches, arrest priests when they attempted to march after the services, beat those who resisted, and provoke violence and disorder to prevent the marches from going forward and to “justify” a brutal response from the security forces.

These latest protests were organized by the Lay Coordination Committee (CLC), a group of Catholic intellectuals, backed by Catholic priests and bishops in Congo. All the main political opposition leaders as well as many civil society groups and citizens’ movements supported the demonstrations. They appealed to all Congolese to protest the failure to implement the so-called St. Sylvestre Accord, a Catholic Church-mediated power-sharing agreement signed on New Year’s Eve 2016. The deal provided Kabila an excuse to stay in power another year – beyond the end of his constitutional two-term limit on December 19, 2016 – but also a commitment to implement confidence-building measures and organize elections by the end of 2017. But instead, these commitments were largely flouted: the new government, the so-called National Follow-up Council (CNSA), and the electoral commission (CENI) excluded members of the main opposition coalition and are in full control of Kabila’s presidential majority coalition, while repression and election delays continue.

The CENI finally published a new electoral calendar in November, which set December 23, 2018 as the new date for elections, with the caveat that numerous “constraints” could push the date back even further. Yet Kabila himself has not demonstrated that he is preparing to step down or create a climate conducive to free, fair, and credible elections. In a rare press conference in January, Kabila refused to say explicitly that he will step down by the end of 2018 or that he will not attempt to run again. Some in Kabila’s majority coalition are still talking about a possible referendum or other changes to the electoral process that would allow Kabila to stay in power.

Many Congolese civil society groups have denounced the CENI’s calendar as merely another delaying tactic, and they have called on Kabila to step down immediately and for a citizens’ transition to be organized without Kabila that would restore constitutional order and organize credible elections. According to a recent poll by the New York University-based Congo Research Group and the Congolese polling agency, BERCI, a full 74 percent of Congolese support the demand for Kabila to step down before elections are held.

Kabila’s refusal to abide by the constitution and relinquish the presidency can partly be explained by the considerable fortune he and his family have amassed during his tenure and the hundreds of millions of dollars in mining revenue that have gone missing. Such corruption has helped leave the government bereft of funds to meet the basic needs of an impoverished population.

To make matters worse, well-placed security and intelligence sources have described to Human Rights Watch official efforts to sow violence and instability across much of the country in an apparently deliberate “strategy of chaos” to justify further election delays.

Since August 2016, an outbreak of violence in the country’s central Kasi region, involving Congolese security forces, government-backed militias, and local armed groups, has left up to 5,000 people dead. Last March, two UN investigators – Michael Sharp, an American, and Zaida Catalán, a Swedish and Chilean dual national – were killed while investigating serious human rights abuses in the region. As the Congolese authorities continue to blame members of a local militia and have repeatedly interfered in the Congolese judicial investigation into the murders, Human Rights Watch research and Radio France Internationale and Reuters reports suggest government responsibility.

Since mid-December, a wave of horrific violence has engulfed Djugu territory, an area of northeastern Congo’s Ituri province that had been largely peaceful in recent years. The incredible speed at which assailants killed more than 250 civilians and torched scores of villages has taken many by surprise. More than 200,000 people have been forced to flee their homes, including tens of thousands of refugees who fled to neighboring Uganda.

Human Rights Watch has received terrifying accounts of massacres, rapes, and decapitation. In February, after an attack on Seseti village, a survivor described finding 15 bodies, including three children, the following morning. “They cut off the heads and arms of some… and even slit open their bellies,” he said. “We were too afraid to stay and bury them properly, so we just dug a small hole… and quickly left.”

While government officials have insisted that the recent Ituri violence is the consequence of inter-ethnic tensions between the ethnic Lendu and Hema communities, local leaders and survivors we spoke to have been left baffled. While low-level tensions existed – like in many parts of Congo – the communities were not preparing to go to war with each other. Many survivors referred to a “hidden hand” when describing those who might be behind the attacks: Seemingly professional killers came into their villages and hacked people to death with notable efficiency and brutality, in what appeared to be pre-meditated and well-planned attacks. Some alleged that government officials may be involved.

Large-scale violence has also continued in eastern Congo’s North and South Kivu and Tanganyika provinces. Today, over 120 armed groups are active in eastern Congo. Many of these groups receive support from the Congolese government and security forces, while others have formed coalitions against the Kabila government. Yet the gravest threat to Congolese civilians comes from the security forces meant to protect them. According to the UN human rights office in Congo, some 1,180 people were extrajudicially executed by Congolese “state agents” in 2017, far more than those killed by any of the armed groups and a threefold increase over two years.

As the security forces are themselves fomenting much of the violence in Congo, this has in turn been used as an excuse for election delays. Last July, the CENI president, Corneille Nangaa, said that violence in the Kasais was one of the main reasons why elections would not be held in 2017. This February, he said the renewed violence in Ituri could have a “negative impact” on the electoral calendar.

While the logistics of organizing elections in Congo are no doubt challenging, the country has managed in the past – both in 2006 and 2011 when Kabila was elected for his first and second terms, despite persistent security threats.

The key question now is: What can be done today to convince Kabila to stop making excuses, agree to abide by the constitution and step down, and allow for the organization of credible elections – before more Congolese are killed, injured and imprisoned as they seek to exercise their basic human rights to peacefully demonstrate, speak out, and freely associate, and before a new outbreak of large-scale violence leads to new refugee flows across Congo’s borders?

Kabila has become increasingly isolated internationally. The United States, the European Union, and the UN Security Council have all imposed targeted sanctions – including travel bans and assets freezes – against senior Congolese government and security force officers responsible for serious human rights abuses, repression, and election delays. In December, the US sanctioned Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, one of Kabila’s close friends and financial associates who “amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals” in Congo, as well as a number of individuals and companies associated with Gertler. Earlier this year, Belgium announced it is suspending all direct bilateral support to the Congolese government and redirecting its aid to humanitarian and civil society organizations.

Yet until now, Kabila has appeared to rely on support from the region – including from other leaders who have used repression, violence, and corruption to force through constitutional referendums and other maneuvers to entrench their hold on power while attempting to maintain a façade of democracy. Botswana has been a notable exception, with its Ministry of International Affairs stating this February that Congo is facing a “worsening humanitarian situation…mainly because its leader has persistently delayed the holding of elections and has lost control over the security of his country."" Botswana urged ""the international community to put more pressure on the leadership in the Democratic Republic of Congo to relinquish power and pave the way for the ushering in of a new political dispensation."" Some other countries have also expressed concerns publicly, including Angola. And some efforts have been made by SADC to address the crisis, including the appointment of a special envoy.

Yet much more could be done. Stronger political leadership from the region is needed to break the political and electoral deadlock that risks igniting a new war in Congo and plunging the entire region into severe instability.

The new presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa in South Africa presents an important opportunity for a real regional shift in policy towards Congo. The South African government and SADC more broadly could support the Congolese people’s aspirations for democracy and human rights, and help prevent more violence and instability if they choose to take a strong position by urging Kabila to act in accordance with his country’s constitution and to allow for a peaceful transition to a newly elected leader. They should also insist that key human rights benchmarks are met to ensure that elections are truly credible. The messaging should be clear that there will be real consequences if these measures are not respected.

Taking such a position could play an important role in refocusing attention and helping to restore South Africa’s role as a leader and promoter of peace, security, equality, and human rights — in South Africa and beyond.

10 APRIL 2018

The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Gustavo Meza-Cuadra (Peru):

The members of the Security Council met on 10 April 2018 to discuss the situation in the Great Lakes region, five years after the signature of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region. They were briefed by Said Djinnit, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes, and Raymond Serge Balé, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Congo, as Chair of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Regional Oversight Mechanism.

The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework remains an essential mechanism to achieve durable peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region. They welcomed the renewed commitment of its signatories towards its full implementation, and reiterated their call to all signatories to fulfil promptly, fully and in good faith their respective commitments under this Framework, in order to address the root causes of conflict and put an end to recurring cycles of violence, and promote lasting regional development. They reaffirmed their support to the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and called for further engagement to address the remaining challenges in implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework and to promote peace and stability in the region.

The members of the Security Council commended the efforts of the African Union, as well as the subregional organizations, in particular the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), East African Community (EAC), International Conference of the Great Lakes Region and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), towards supporting political processes and finding peaceful solutions for the conflict situations in the region. They underlined the need for a continued and close coordination between those organizations in order to strengthen their efficiency. They welcomed, under the auspices of Angola followed by the Republic of the Congo, the reactivation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework follow-up mechanism as a sign of a renewed commitment from the countries of the Great Lakes, and encouraged them to intensify their interactions at a significant level.

The members of the Security Council urged continued regional and international support for initiatives aimed at promoting inclusive dialogue amongst national stakeholders and stressed the importance of opening political space to enable the full and free participation of political parties, civil society and the media, as well as the full participation of both men and women in the political process. They stressed that women’s participation in political and dialogue processes must be further promoted. They further urged international and regional support for strengthening and improving capacity for elections and governance in the countries of the region, and called on Member States in the Great Lakes region to take steps to ensure that electoral processes promote peace and security through timely, peaceful, inclusive and credible elections, in line with countries’ own constitutions and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, as applicable. They recognized that the strengthening of regional cooperation in the field of justice would contribute to the fight against impunity, and through reinforcing the confidence of the people of the region in the reliability of judicial institutions, play a stabilizing role.

The members of the Security Council welcomed the commitment of the signatory States of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework to complete, without precondition, the repatriation of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) disarmed combatants and former M23 combatants within the shortest time frame possible. They urged the Governments of the region, with the support of the Peace, Security and Cooperation guarantors, to strengthen their collaboration to meet the agreed time frame.

The members of the Security Council urged the Governments of the region, as well as regional and international partners, to continue addressing urgent and drastically increasing humanitarian needs, and pursue durable solutions for internally displaced persons, refugees and asylum seekers. They commended United Nations humanitarian agencies, partners and donors for their efforts to provide urgent and coordinated support to the population. They noted that, despite increasing needs, humanitarian appeals remain underfunded across the region, and urged international partners and the donor community at large to step up their support to humanitarian action in the region and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Multiple crises are spiraling out of control in Congo - in the central Kasai region and in the eastern Kivu and Ituri provinces - aggravated by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his elected mandate in 2016.

Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30 percent from a year ago, the United Nations said in a report earlier this month.

It has declared the crisis to be at Level 3, the world body’s highest-level emergency.

“We all believe that the humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day. It’s not business as usual,” said Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.

He spoke to Reuters during a trip to eastern Congo.

Concern over the deterioration of the situation in Congo, a country with a long history of war and humanitarian crises, has pushed the United Nations, the European Union and donor nations to organize a conference in Geneva next month.

They are seeking to raise $1.7 billion, nearly four times the amount secured last year, to support humanitarian activities in Congo.

But Congo this week disputed the U.N. assessment of the gravity of the crisis, which it said would discourage investment at a time when the government was attempting to stabilize the volatile economy.

“Activating the highest level of humanitarian emergency based on facts that are not real constitutes a hindrance to development,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

It added that, unless the humanitarian statistics were brought in line with the government’s own figures, it would not send representatives to the conference in Geneva.

Stylianides, who was touring Congo’s hard-hit North Kivu province on Sunday, was due to travel to the capital Kinshasa later in the day to attempt to convince the foreign and humanitarian affairs ministers to reverse the decision.

“We will try to persuade them that this is not good for DRC but above all for the vulnerable people in DRC,” he said.","Congo crisis worsening, EU says, as government shuns aid conference",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-eu/congo-crisis-worsening-eu-says-as-government-shuns-aid-conference-idUSKBN1H10PK

In December, the US sanctioned Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, one of Kabila's close friends and financial associates who ""amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals"" in Congo, as well as a number of individuals and companies associated with Gertler. Earlier this year, Belgium announced it is suspending all direct bilateral support to the Congolese government and redirecting its aid to humanitarian and civil society organizations.

Yet until now, Kabila has appeared to rely on support from the region - including from other leaders who have used repression, violence, and corruption to force through constitutional referendums and other maneuvers to entrench their hold on power while attempting to maintain a façade of democracy. Botswana has been a notable exception, with its Ministry of International Affairs stating this February that Congo is facing a ""worsening humanitarian situation... mainly because its leader has persistently delayed the holding of elections and has lost control over the security of his country."" Botswana urged ""the international community to put more pressure on the leadership in the Democratic Republic of Congo to relinquish power and pave the way for the ushering in of a new political dispensation."" Some other countries have also expressed concerns publicly, including Angola. And some efforts have been made by SADC to address the crisis, including the appointment of a special envoy.

Yet much more could be done. Stronger political leadership from the region is needed to break the political and electoral deadlock that risks igniting a new war in Congo and plunging the entire region into severe instability.

The new presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa in South Africa presents an important opportunity for a real regional shift in policy towards Congo. The South African government and SADC more broadly could support the Congolese people's aspirations for democracy and human rights, and help prevent more violence and instability if they choose to take a strong position by urging Kabila to act in accordance with his country's constitution and to allow for a peaceful transition to a newly elected leader. They should also insist that key human rights benchmarks are met to ensure that elections are truly credible. The messaging should be clear that there will be real consequences if these measures are not respected.

Taking such a position could play an important role in refocusing attention and helping to restore South Africa's role as a leader and promoter of peace, security, equality, and human rights -- in South Africa and beyond.
