People in need: 130.6 M

People to receive aid: 95.3 M

Countries affected: 40

As of April 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require US$25.27 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 95.3 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.

Three significant humanitarian resource mobilization events took place in April: the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, 3 April, Geneva, co-hosted by the UN, Sweden and Switzerland, where US$2.01 billion in contributions for 2018 were announced by 40 entities and a further $20.2 million were announced in multi-year funding; the Humanitarian Conference on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 13 April, co-hosted in Geneva by the UN, the Netherlands and the EU, where $528.1 million were pledged by 22 donors for 2018 and a further $38.7 million for 2019-2020; and the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region Brussels II Conference, 24-25 April, co-hosted by the UN and the EU. This drew 36 announcements of humanitarian funding totalling $4.4 billion for 2018 and an additional $3.4 billion for 2019-2020.

The humanitarian funding outlook for the protracted, entrenched humanitarian crisis in DPRK is particularly concerning, with a persistent risk that geo-political tension – even with the recent positive developments – could dampen funding. 10.3 million people in DPRK are estimated to be undernourished. More than one-quarter of children are stunted and 4% wasted, while about 30% of women of reproductive age are anaemic. The lack of safe water and the poor sanitation contribute to high levels of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, which are the most common causes of death among young children. The 2018 Needs and Priorities Plan released in April calls for $111 million to provide food assistance, health and nutrition services and improved access to safe water and sanitation for 6 million highly vulnerable people.

On 20 April, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine briefed Member States in New York on the dire humanitarian situation faced by 4.4 million conflict-affected people after four years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Disrupted access to critical facilities and diminished livelihoods mean that 3.4 million people are without basic supplies and services and need protection and life-saving assistance. Ukraine has the highest proportion of elderly people affected by humanitarian crisis in the world. Some 1.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced across the country, and some 200,000 live in daily fear of shelling. Funding for the HRP is urgently needed.

In 2018, as many as 7 million people in South Sudan need humanitarian assistance to cope with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and grave protection violations including conflict-related sexual violence. This is the world’s third largest refugee crisis: more than 4.2 million people have been displaced, including 1.8 million IDPs and more than 2.4 million refugees.

Severe food insecurity continues to rise as people are unable to plant or harvest and have limited access to humanitarian assistance. With the lean season beginning in May, urgent funding is required to save lives and resources. On 27 April, the DSRSG/RC/HC for South Sudan formally invited the USG to support him in delivering three key messages when he visits the country in mid-May. Namely, calling for a sustainable political solution to the conflict to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis, with IGAD-led peace talks expected to resume in May; urging parties to the conflict, including the numerous splinter groups, to address the insecurity that affects civilians and aid workers; and advocating for resources towards the HRP which is currently funded at 21%.

Humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic have increased from 2.2 million people in need in early 2017 to 2.5 million this year, with a multiplication of hotspots. The spike in tensions and armed violence that erupted in April is also affecting the capital, Bangui. Over the first quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced people increased by 70% over the first quarter of 2017, and the number of refugees increased by 30%; effectively, 25% of Central Africans are currently displaced either as IDPs or refugees. Underfunding remains one of the biggest impediments to stepping up the humanitarian response. By end April 2018 the HRP had received less than 10 per cent of its $515.6 million requirements.

By 30 April, 21 donors had contributed a combined $278 million (including pledges) to 17 country-based pooled funds (CBPFs), which translated into financial support for 308 humanitarian projects implemented by 229 partners. These included international NGOs which received $55.3 million (42% of total budget allocations) while UN agencies received $42.6 million (32% of allocations). Support to national NGOs included $33.6 million (25% of allocations) and to the Red Cross / Crescent movement $0.6 million (0.5% of total allocations). The largest amounts were channelled to Yemen ($77.9 million), the whole of Syria response ($41.7 million), Sudan ($28.2 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($26.5 million). New reserve allocations were launched by the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (HF) for $16.2 million and by the occupied Palestinian territories HF for $2.2 million, on top of its first standard allocation of the year for $3.9 million, to respond to immediate health and protection needs in the Gaza Strip. The Turkey HF launched a second reserve allocation for $4 million to cover urgent life-saving needs of people displaced inside besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria.",2018 Humanitarian Funding Update (as of April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2018-humanitarian-funding-update-april-2018

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The latest nutrition surveillance and early warning system sheet1 (SNSAP January- March 2018) reveals that 77 out of 508 health zones were in nutrition alert, meaning that at least 4 out of 6 tracked nutrition indicators are above predefined thresholds (see the report for more details on the methodology). Two nutrition SMART surveys conducted by NGO partners in in Komanda and Nyakunde health zones, in Ituri province, and in Kahemba, Kwango Province were validated in February 2018. In Kahemba, the surveys reveal global acute malnutrition (GAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) rates at respectively 14% and 3.6%. In Komanda, the GAM is 5% and SAM 0.7% and in Nyakunde the GAM is 3.3% and SAM 0%.

Measles outbreaks registered a slight reduction in incidence compared to 2017 (1st quarter), with 3,404 cases, including 30 deaths (case fatality rate 0.9%) since January 2018. Around 490 measles cases were reported in Haut Katanga Province, 64% of which were in Lubumbashi. The number of cases are almost eight times higher than those registered in the same period in 2017 (56 cases).

During the week ending on 25 March, 497 new suspected cases of cholera were registered with 10 deaths (case fatality rate 2%) in 13 out of the country’s 26 provinces. The majority (70%) of new reported cases were in five provinces: Maidombé (84 cases), North Kivu (77 cases), Equateur (73 cases), South Kivu (58 cases) and Kongo Central (56 cases). In the province of Kinshasa, the downward trend noticed early in the year continues with 12 new suspected cases and zero deaths reported until the end of March. Since the beginning of the outbreak in Kinshasa in May 2017, a total of 1,191 suspected cases with 43 deaths (including 34 community deaths) were reported (case fatality rate 3.3%).

The inter-communal violence between ethnic communities in the province of Ituri continues to force people into displacement. Attacks on villages and civilians have forced approximately 343,000 persons into displacement within the province. Around Bunia, there are three spontaneous displacement sites hosting approximately 23,600 internally displaced persons (IDPs). In addition, some 40,000 Congolese have crossed Lake Albert into Uganda from Ituri to escape the violence.","UNICEF DRC Humanitarian Situation Report March, 2018",https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/unicef-drc-humanitarian-situation-report-march-2018
3,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"DR Congo is following through with plans to boycott a conference in Geneva on Friday, which aims to raise almost $1.7 billion (1.38 billion euros) for the conflict-torn country.

The conference comes amid fears of mounting violence in DR Congo, where decades of corruption, instability and ethnic conflict are colliding with deepening political tensions.

However, DR Congo has angrily contested claims by the United Nations (UN) that the humanitarian crisis is currently at ""breaking point"" — a position which has only served to worsen political tensions in the country.

A very real crisis

For those who have fled their homes, the crisis in DR Congo is very real. ""It's like when we had the civil war,"" said one Congolese man, referring to a period of intense violence that ravaged the northeastern province of Ituri between 1999 and 2003. He is one of an estimated 50,000 people who have escaped the recent surge of ethnic conflict in Ituri since January by fleeing across Lake Albert into neighboring Uganda.

The deadly fighting isn't restricted to Ituri — home to long-simmering conflicts over land and mineral wealth. It's also spilled into provinces previously thought to be stable, such as Kasai and Tanganyika.

Adding to the misery is the political crisis surrounding President Joseph Kabila that doesn't look like it's ending any time soon. Kabila's mandate officially ended in December 2016 but he has stayed on in power, saying it's impossible to hold elections amid the fighting. Elections to replace Kabila are repeatedly postponed. Widespread protests against Kabila's failure to step down have been met with deadly violence.

Massive numbers of people on the move

Tens of thousands of people from countries such as Central African Republic, South Sudan and Barundi, seek refuge in DR Congo, adding to the humanitarian crisis

Since the beginning of 2017, some 600,000 Congolese have fled the violence and general instability to other countries in the region. In addition, around 4.3 million people are now internally displaced, estimates OCHA, the UN office responsible for coordinating humanitarian affairs. DR Congo is also home to around 500,000 refugees from other countries.

The UN warned in March that the crisis in Congo was at a ""breaking point."" During a trip to the country last week, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said: ""Unfortunately, operations, refugee operations, humanitarian operations, in the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to be underfunded everywhere.""

Congo's government denies numbers, amid investment fears

Congo's government is at loggerheads with humanitarian organizations over the scale of the problem. Congo's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Bernard Biango, puts the number of internally displaced people at 231,241 — nearly 20 times lower than UN estimates.

Congo's military are fighting rebels and armed groups on many fronts

Regarding Friday's donor conference, DR Congo's Minister of Communications, Lambert Mende, said international organizations were deliberately ""misrepresenting"" refugee numbers in order to gain a ""colossal budget."" ""We do not call this international support, we call it marketing humanitarian aid,"" he told DW.

Congo won't be able to attend the conference, Mende said, if the numbers of refugees aren't reconciled. ""The high numbers of displaced people are frightening investors, and the country is much more dependent on investment for development than development aid,"" he said.

Civil society is 'horrified and upset'

The move has angered church groups and and civil society organizations in Congo.

""Beyond statistics, it is crucial that those in need are helped,"" said the Deputy Secretary General of Congo's National Episcopal Conference, Andre Masinganda. ""This is where international support comes in.""

Congo's Lay Coordinating Commission (Comitee Laic de Coordination) said in a statement it was ""extremely surprised and dismayed"" that the government did not want to speak of a humanitarian catastrophe.

Of course the government is committed to its numbers, commission spokesperson Jonas Tshiombela told DW. ""But on the other hand, [the government] is itself responsible for people's suffering; it hasn't complied with its duty to protect human lives and goods.""

Tshiombela is worried some in the international community will succomb to pressure to stay away. According to French broadcaster RFI, the Congolese government has written to some potential donors asking them to boycott the conference — the United Arab Emirates has already canceled its attendance.

IOM distributed tarpaulins, shelter and non-food item kits to a total of 3,954 vulnerable internally displaced households in North Kivu.

IOM has expanded its Displacement Tracking Matrix activities in DRC to include seven provinces in order to capture population movement in the areas affected by conflict.

Situation Overview

The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has remained the same during the reporting period. It has been characterized by displacement, Congolese communities continued to flee violence in Ituri and North Kivu to mainly Uganda; malnutrition, especially among children; gender-based violence; and outbreaks of communicable diseases, mainly cholera.

On 13 April 2018, a pledging conference was organized in Geneva by OCHA, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the European Union on the DRC. The aim of the conference was to boost the funding for the humanitarian crisis in the country.

At the conference, international donors announced that they will support the humanitarian assistance in DRC with USD 528 million during 2018.

IOM’s appeal for 2018 amounts to USD 75 million. Currently, the appeal is only 11 per cent funded with USD 8.3 million received since January 2018.",DR Congo Humanitarian Crisis - Situation Report #5 (27 March - 19 April 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-humanitarian-crisis-situation-report-5-27-march-19-april
5,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Despite massive natural resources and major socio-economic changes under Government-led initiatives, years of violence by armed groups vying for control – along with ethnic strife in the country’s restive east, and political and ethnic instability – has created massive food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

In Geneva, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock told donors that more than two million children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition in DRC and 13 million people require assistance there urgently – double the number of those in need last year.

He added that DRC is also facing “the worst outbreak of cholera in fifteen years,” as well as “an epidemic of sexual violence,” committed mainly against children.

“As I speak, the resurgence of an inter-ethnic conflict in Ituri in February is killing many people and leading to internal and cross-border displacement of even more,” he said.

Thousands of farmers in the crisis gripped Kasais have missed three successive agricultural seasons, resulting in a drop in agricultural production, he added.

Speaking to journalists in Geneva during a break in the conference, Mr. Lowcock said that he expected to confirm more than $500 million in pledges before the end of the day.

Total needs for the DRC for this year are estimated at $1.7 billion ­– nearly four times more than the amount secured last year.

An additional $500 million is needed to support 807,000 Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries and more than 540,000 refugees from other countries who are in DRC.

The question of securing sufficient funding was underlined by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his opening address to the pledging conference.

He urged Member States in Geneva via a video message to show solidarity for the “millions of people who are suffering” in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises as the UN and the DRC Government work together to respond to needs.

During the conference, Jean-Philippe Chauzy, from the UN migration agency, spoke of the need to strengthen international support for the people of the DRC.

“Confronted with rising intercommunal tensions, political instability and an increasingly insecure environment, the international humanitarian community needs to strengthen its support and commitment to the Congolese people,” said Mr. Chauzy, who is DRC Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

He added: “We simply cannot ignore the speed, and magnitude of [this] crisis.”

Alongside the UN, the pledging conference was co-hosted by the Netherlands and the European Commission.

Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands, described the DRC as a “forgotten” conflict that desperately needed more support from the international community.

She highlighted the impact of gender-based violence on girls and young women whom she had met on a recent visit to DRC.

Some had requested help in the form of rape kits, while others had asked how to look after the babies they had given birth to after their sexual assault.

That message was underlined by conference co-host Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, who spoke of the violence and “stories of unbelievable pain” that he heard while visiting the country in recent weeks.

Asked at the press conference about the decision by the DRC authorities not to attend the pledging conference, Mark Lowcock underlined the scale of the problems in the country – and the importance of securing funding for some 150 organizations working to support humanitarian action “under the leadership” of the DRC authorities in 20 provinces.

“I think everybody recognizes that there is a substantial crisis in the DRC, the Government recognizes that themselves, which [acknowledges] their own very substantial financial commitment to it,” he said, in reference to its $100 million pledge to provide additional aid.",Donors pledge over $500 million to tackle growing needs in DR Congo; UN warns humanitarian crisis cannot be ignored,https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1007251
6,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Donors gathered in Geneva pledged $528 million (428 million euros) towards addressing a towering humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the UN said.

The amount was less than a quarter of the some $2.2 billion the UN has estimated is required this year to provide desperately needed aid inside DRC and to Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries.

But UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock stressed that the expectation had never been to raise the entire amount in one conference.

“I am pleased with the progress,” he told reporters, highlighting that a number of countries which had not yet made pledges had indicated they planned to do so soon.

Around 100 delegations, including from 54 UN member countries, took part in Friday’s conference.

DRC boycotting conference

But the DRC itself was conspicuously missing. The government has accused the UN of exaggerating the crisis and is boycotting the event.

That move has deepened political divisions in a country facing mounting strife, while its legacy of ethnic conflict, corruption and instability are combining with political tensions to spark fears of bloodshed.

The growing violence has worsened an already dire humanitarian situation in several areas, with underfunded aid agencies struggling to keep up with the needs.

In a video address to Friday’s conference, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the DRC was “experiencing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.”

“Millions of people are suffering,” he said, warning that “the single biggest obstacle is the lack of funding.”

In January, the UN and Kinshasa said $1.68 billion was needed in 2018 to provide urgently needed assistance to some 10.5 million people inside the country.

The UN refugee agency has meanwhile said another $508 million is needed to support more than 800,000 Congolese refugees in surrounding countries, as well as the some 540,000 refugees from the Central African Republic, South Sudan and other countries who have fled into DRC.

Friday’s conference got off to a strong start, with co-host Christos Stylianides, the European Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, pledging 77 million euros ($95 million) of EU aid inside the DRC this year.

DRC’s former colonial power Belgium meanwhile announced that it would give 25 million euros this year, up from 17 million in 2017.

Lowcock said at least 15 donor countries had “significantly” increased their pledged amounts this year.

Impossible choices

In a statement, a coalition of humanitarian organisations warned Friday that the dire underfunding had forced them to cut back on essential aid, including providing food, water and safety to people fleeing violence.

“The lack of funding forces us to make choices we shouldn’t have to make,” Jose Barahona, Oxfam’s Country Director in DRC, said in the statement.

Norwegian Refugee Council chief Jan Egeland meanwhile voiced dismay that Friday’s conference had not generated more funds.

“We are disappointed that too few countries sent a real message of hope to the millions of Congolese children, women and men in desperate need of assistance,” he said in a statement.

In all, the UN estimates that 13 million Congolese need aid, including 7.7 million who are food insecure, and 4.5 million internally displaced people.

The DRC has angrily contested the UN figures, with humanitarian affairs minister Bernard Biango putting the number of IDPs at just 231,241.

Aid bodies and NGOs are propagating a “bad image of the Democratic Republic of Congo throughout the world,” Prime Minister Jose Makila charged last month.

The government has meanwhile promised $100 million “to ease humanitarian distress” and earmarked $10 million to help refugees or those internally displaced to return home.

Lowcock hailed that pledge and said “the government of the DRC is providing the leadership on this crisis.”

The BBC's Africa editor Fergal Keane reports on how the Catholic Church has become the main opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

By the time her brother arrived on the scene Thérèse Kapangala was already dead.

She lay in a pool of blood just inside the main door of the Church of St Francis de Sales, about 15 minutes from central Kinshasa.

Thérèse was a novice nun who grew up in a devoutly Catholic family in the narrow streets of Kintambo, an old Kinshasa neighbourhood where the colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley established his first settlement in 1881.

She lived a short walk from the church.

'Revolt of the reasonable'

On Sunday 21 January she joined protesters who had gathered at St Francis calling for free and fair elections.

Her brother Jean-Claude remembers hearing shooting and the firing of tear gas canisters.

""I said to her: 'Look there's a lot of tear gas, please take this margarine butter' because it is something we use to lessen the effects of the gas on our skin.

""But she already had some and threw away what I gave her. That day she was happy. She was joyful.""

Mobile phone footage from the protests shows people fleeing in panic as tear gas and live ammunition were fired by security forces who surrounded the compound.

Thérèse was dead within minutes of being struck by a single round.

Image caption A small shrine had been erected to the memory of Thérèse Kapangala

""Even now I can't believe it,"" recalls her mother Mado Longo. ""I think I am dreaming that she has only gone to rest. She was my child but also my friend.""

We were sitting in the family's tiny sitting room. A small shrine had been erected to the memory of Thérèse - there was a memorial candle, some Rosary beads, a statuette of the Blessed Virgin, and a photograph of a serene-looking young woman in her 24th year.

Image caption ""I can't stand the pain I feel,"" says Mado Longo Kapangala about losing her daughter

The Kapangalas are not natural rebels. Nor are they partisans of any political party.

In a country where politics has long been contaminated by corruption and division, where human rights abuses are endemic, they represent the revolt of the reasonable.

Thérèse belonged to a broad-based human rights movement that has succeeded in transcending ethnic divisions and challenging the deep-rooted culture of impunity.

'The church will never shut up'

This is not by any means exclusively rooted in the Catholic Church but in recent years clergy and lay people have been at the forefront of attempts to push for democratic change.

It began with church-mediated efforts in 2016 to achieve a peaceful transition from the rule of President Joseph Kabila, whose mandate expired in December that year.

When they failed, it morphed into a mass protest movement.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Security forces killed at least seven people at this anti-Kabila protest in December 2017 which was backed by church activists

President Kabila has so far failed to step down, overstaying the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution.

In a country where roughly half of the population is Catholic, the state tends to pay attention when the church intervenes in politics.

The leader of the Catholic Church in DR Congo, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, declared at the beginning of the year that it was ""time for truth to win out over systemic lying, for the mediocre to clear out and for peace and justice to reign in DR Congo"".

What ‘Dr Love’ says about DR Congo

But when priests led public protests the government cracked down with shootings, beatings and arrests.

After the bloodshed, Catholic lay groups called off the protests, saying they would wait to see if President Kabila was sincere about holding elections.

Apparently unconvinced, they announced on 1 May that the truce was over and promised a fresh wave of demonstrations.

Image copyright Alice Doyard/BBC Image caption Father Joseph Musubao was at the church when Thérèse Kapangala was killed

""The church will never shut up. No force can make it shiver,"" says Father Joseph Musubao, a relative of Thérèse Kapangala who was saying mass at the church of St Francis on the day she was shot.

""The government's behaviour, their way of doing things, their mode of governing is indescribable… it is bloody and without regrets.""

The state recently allowed a public meeting by the leading opposition party and has promised presidential elections by the end of the year.

But there is continuing suspicion that elections will be delayed again or rigged.

Morally bankrupt?

When I met the Information Minister Lambert Mende, I put it to him that the church was taking a moral leadership role because the government was seen as morally bankrupt.

He replied by denouncing the activities of the Catholic groups.

""I don't know if it is because the government is bankrupt that the bishops are taking a moral role. But they don't have the role… If you want to play a political role please go for elections and tell people to give you a mandate.""

Image caption The Catholic Church is powerful in DR Congo where nearly half population are believers

It is possible that elections will take place by the end of the year. But will they be free and fair? Is Mr Kabila really ready to hand over power?

The promised return to the streets of Catholic-led protest groups would be a significant test of the government's true intentions.

Another violent crackdown like that which led to the death of Thérèse Kapangala would not bode well for the hopes of peaceful change in Africa's second-largest country.

8,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of Ebola after the Democratic Republic of the Congo confirmed two cases of the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever.

At least 10 more cases are suspected in the northwestern town of Bikoro, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, the head of the DRC’s National Institute for Biomedical Research, said Tuesday.

In the past five weeks, the DRC has seen 21 suspected cases with Ebola-like symptoms and 17 deaths.

A team of experts from WHO, Doctors Without Borders and the central African country’s Provincial Division of Health traveled on Tuesday to the outbreak area. WHO said in a statement that it is working with the DRC government to “rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners using the model of a successful response to a similar EVD [Ebola virus disease] outbreak in 2017.”

According to Doctors Without Borders spokesperson Brienne Prusak, the humanitarian medical organization has been supporting the DRC Ministry of Health on the ground in its investigation of the current outbreak since last Saturday.

“Time is of the essence,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told HuffPost. “The faster you get to the core of the outbreak and the quicker you get in place those necessary measures ― isolating those people who are sick, identifying contacts they know ― it [increases] the chances you have that the virus will not spread somewhere else.”

All means of air travel and other transportation methods are being used to get to the town quickly, Jasarevic said. He noted that the team is currently in discussions about setting up a mobile laboratory unit and whether to deploy some of the Ebola vaccine.

Last year’s DRC outbreak was contained shortly before an agreement on using the vaccine was reached, so its potential use this year would mark its first deployment in the country.

Ebola is considered endemic in the DRC, and this is the second outbreak there in less than a year. Last May, an outbreak in the northern part of the country led to eight infections and four deaths.

The virus typically spreads among humans in one of two ways: through exposure to animals that carry it ― often bats or bushmeat (that is, wild animals caught and eaten in the region, such as monkeys, antelope and rats) ― or through exposure to bodily fluids of infected patients. The average fatality rate for Ebola is 50 percent.

The last major Ebola outbreak that swept through West Africa officially ended more than two years ago, killing approximately 11,300 people and infecting 28,600. Global health experts have called WHO’s failure to quickly raise the alarm and adequately respond to that epidemic, which began in 2014, an “egregious failure.”

The difference in response between 2014 and now is “night and day,” according to Loyce Pace, the president and executive director of the Global Health Leadership Council, a membership organization that lobbies for global health priorities. In this “new normal,” Pace said the world health community must immediately dispatch resources and enlist international actors to fight outbreaks.

“The global health community collectively has learned its lesson,” she said, although she added that some pandemic preparedness issues still need to be worked out.

While the global health community has improved its mobilization efforts, U.S. leadership is sending mixed messages.

Recently, Congress almost doubled global health security funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But President Donald Trump’s stance has been to cut such global health aid. Previous versions of the president’s budgets have called for spending reductions at the CDC, USAID and the Global Fund.

Trump’s newly proposed rescissions package includes the taking back of $252 million not spent on the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak. While technically the money was aimed at the Ebola outbreak, officials have been directing the remaining funds toward other public health outbreaks, such as the Zika virus.

This kind of mixed government messaging undermines the U.S. as a world leader and, more importantly, harms global preparedness and commitment to fighting potential pandemics, Pace said.

“We need to keep our foot on the gas when it comes to global health security,” Pace argued. “We don’t necessarily know what the next Ebola or Zika could be, and it’s pretty irresponsible not to stay ahead of the curve considering the resources we have as a country.”

Trump’s track record on Ebola itself includes his infamous tweets (over 100 of them during the last major outbreak) lobbying to close U.S. borders and institute a travel ban against those infected ― steps that public health experts said would worsen the problem by driving people to hide their travel.

As the conflict worsens, 18 of the DRC’s 26 provinces are facing an internal crisis, with 13.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

The Kasai and Kivu provinces have seen the worst effects of the civil war, causing widespread displacement, chronic malnutrition, and the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera.

Direct Relief recently dispatched two tons of medical aid to the DRC. The shipment contained supplies to treat cholera, including 10,000 doses of oral rehydration salts and antibiotics, as well as basic yet essential hygiene items.

The donation was shipped to Save the Children, located in the country’s North Kivu Province, to support mobile medical clinics that travel to serve the country’s displaced populations. The clinics are staffed by local doctors, nurses, and midwives who are placed in areas lacking healthcare facilities and medical services.

Direct Relief will continue to monitor the ongoing crisis in the DRC and provide donations of essential medicines and supplies as needed.

He said with as many as nine neighbours bordering the country, its problems were as good as a regional problem. He added that the government should also be clear about what help they need from neighbours as and when.

“Maybe if the leaders of Congo are listening, they should be figuring out what they need to do and also (maybe) let people know where they can help ro resolve that problem.

“Because Congo’s problems are not just Congo’s problems, they affect us as well, as neighbours. Congo has nine neighbours, each one of us is affected by what happens in Congo, there is no question about that,” he stressed.

Kagame was speaking during the Mo Ibrahim governance summit’s dialogue series that took place in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.

The situation in the DRC is essentially a political crisis of Kabila having overstayed his tenure by two years. He was expected to step down in December 2016 but polls were postponed citing lack of a credible register and insecurity.

Other parts of the country continue to experience violent clashes between rebels and government forces. A humanitarian situation has arisen with Congolese fleeing into Zambia and Angola. Elections are slated for December 2018.

Top government officials including Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala and Information Minister Lambert Mende have said Kabila will not ammend the consitution to run. Meanwhile, anti-government protests are routinely dispersed by police.","DR Congo crisis affects an entire region, transition must be credible – Kagame",http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/03/dr-congo-crisis-has-regional-implication-transition-must-be-credible-kagame/

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

In 2017, the humanitarian crisis dramatically worsened and spread, affecting people in areas previously considered stable and exhausting the adaptive capacity of those previously affected. The sharp increase in violence and inter-communal tensions, particularly in eastern Congo, Tanganyika and Kasais, made DRC one of the world’s biggest displacement crises with 2.2 million new internally displaced people (IDPs) in 2017, bringing the total number of IDPs in the country to 4.5 million. The displacement crisis in DRC also includes over 540,000 refugees from neighboring countries, out of which more than 90,000 arrived in 2017 and are often located in hard-to-reach areas.

By the end of 2017, the rapid deterioration of the situation, along with the combined consequences of epidemic outbreaks and severe food and nutrition insecurity, left some 13.1 million people – more than 1 in 10 Congolese – in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, a 50 per cent increase from January. Women, children and those with special needs remain the most vulnerable. The humanitarian context is further compounded by the political stalemate, the economic downturn, and structural weaknesses in development. In certain areas, logistical and security challenges hinder humanitarian access. In October, the UN activated an L3 emergency for the Kasais, Tanganyika and South Kivu provinces.

Massive displacement and rapid escalation of needs

The beginning of year was marked by the explosion of a new crisis in the Kasai provinces. Initial tensions in Central Kasai rapidly extended to the wider area. More than 1.4 million people - three out of five - were displaced at the height of the crisis, prompting the launch of a Flash Appeal in April 2017. While a relative improvement in the security situation has allowed for many people to return home, 896,000 people remain internally displaced and 33,000 have fled to Angola. Prior to this crisis, humanitarian actors did not have a presence in the Kasai.

At the same time, in the eastern regions of Congo, resurgence of intercommunal tensions and armed conflict between armed groups and the FARDC progressively spread from Tanganyika to neighboring provinces of South Kivu and Maniema, causing massive waves of displacements. The situation did not improve in North Kivu province either, where armed group and militia violence triggered new displacement. In north east and north-west DRC, a new influx of over 90,000 refugees from Central African Republic, Sudan and Burundi resulted in increased competition for scarce resources and contributed to the deterioration of living conditions for the host community.

Acute protection crisis

The resurgence of violence, population movements, as well as frustrations related to the difficult socio-economic context have led to an alarming increase in human rights violations. In the third trimester of 2017, over 30,000 new protection incidents were reported by the protection monitoring mechanism, while some 26,000 new cases of sexual violence were registered in the provinces affected by the humanitarian crisis, out of which 31 per cent in North Kivu alone.

Critical thresholds in food security, health and nutrition

Hunger and malnutrition have reached the highest level on record. 7.7 million people across the country – 11 per cent of the population – are severely food insecure, with this number expected to rise in 2018. This represents a 30 per cent increase from 2017. Insecurity has had a devastating impact on the agricultural season which will be felt well in to 2018, particularly in the Kasais were there has been a 750 per cent increase in food insecurity from pre-crisis to today, and three consecutive planting seasons have been lost. 4.5 million children are acutely malnourished, including an estimated 2.2 million severely acute malnourished (SAM) cases.

Increased displacement and limited access to basic services has left the population increasingly susceptible to epidemics and disease. The current cholera outbreak is the largest on record in more than two decades. Lack of infrastructure also impedes humanitarian access. The poor state of roads and other transport infrastructure across vast swaths of country leave many areas cut off from state services and difficult for humanitarians to access.",DRC Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017
