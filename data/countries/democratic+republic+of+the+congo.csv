0,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The European Union’s aid chief urged the Democratic Republic of Congo to take part in a donor meeting on tackling a humanitarian crisis in the vast central African country that’s left more than 13 million people in need of aid.

Congo’s government, which has been under pressure to hold elections that would see President Joseph Kabila leave power, has said it won’t participate in the April 13 donor conference and rejects United Nations’ estimates of the scale of the crisis. Recent conflict in Congo’s east and center has forced millions to flee their homes, caused widespread hunger and stirred echoes of the country’s 1998-2003 ruinous war.

“The figures are shocking and the situation on the ground is getting worse day by day,” European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides said in an interview Monday in the capital, Kinshasa. “Our assistance cannot be effective without the cooperation of the government,” which is “not only valuable but absolutely necessary,” he said.

The EU, UN and governments of the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates are organizing next month’s conference in Geneva, where they’ll seek $1.7 billion funding for aid activities in Congo. Last year, just over a quarter that amount was secured for humanitarian response activities in the African country as disasters such as Syria and Yemen seized world attention.

Highest Emergency Level

More than 5 million Congolese have fled their homes -- about 4.5 million internally displaced and the rest in neighboring countries -- and 2.4 million more may be uprooted this year, according to the UN. In October, the organization designated parts of Congo an L3 crisis -- its highest emergency level.

Congo’s government described the L3 rating as “excessive” in a March 22 statement and said there was “discordance” between its statistics and those from humanitarian organizations. Activating the emergency “based on facts that are not real constitutes a brake on development” that discourages investors while the authorities are working to stabilize the economy, it said.

Any change in its stance on participating will depend “on the harmonization of views between the government and the humanitarian partners,” Congo’s government said.

Stylianides, speaking at the end of a three-day visit to the country, said he had “very frank and constructive discussions” on Monday with Humanitarian Affairs Minister Bernard Biando Sango and Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Agee Matembo Toto and he’s hopeful the government will rethink its position.

“I don’t want to discuss the possibility of their absence from this event,” he said.",EU Urges Congo to Attend Aid Talks as Conflict Imperils Millions,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/eu-urges-congo-to-attend-aid-talks-as-conflict-imperils-millions

On 23 March 2018, the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo met with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on the arms embargo monitoring mandate of MONUSCO. Also present during the meeting were the representatives of MONUSCO’s Joint Mission Analysis Centre (JMAC), United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and the Coordinator of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

During the meeting, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and her team provided updates concerning the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since her predecessor’s briefing to the Committee in May 2017. Armed groups continued to be a major source of concern, and in the space of the last six months, over 27 new armed groups had emerged. This brought the total number of armed groups up to 121 as of February 2018. Armed groups were also using political rhetoric as a justification for their existence, frequently citing the political impasse in the country as the main reason they were fighting. Finally, armed groups continued to attack the Democratic Republic of the Congo security forces and in some instances obtained weapons and uniforms from them. MONUSCO continued to monitor the evolution of these groups, and of some potential spoilers which may endeavour to stoke pre-existing conflicts to raise the electoral stakes. Furthermore, new cycles of violence had erupted in Ituri, with thousands of Congolese refugees fleeing into Uganda. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General called upon the members to continue to pay attention to the dire humanitarian situation in the country.

Following the briefing from MONUSCO, UNMAS gave an updated presentation on weapons and ammunition management activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conveying updated information concerning UNMAS’ role in assisting with the safe storage and management of arms. The representative noted that UNMAS had also been engaging in implementing recommendations from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning weapons and ammunition management in the country. However, she pointed out that there continued to be a lack of financing for UNMAS’ activities, which were more and more necessary in the country.

Committee members welcomed the briefings. They expressed concern over the continued violence in the country, the reports of armed groups attacking security forces, as well as the dire humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Delegations also stated their intention to continue working with and supporting UNMAS’ activities.

Speaking on Monday, the UN's Under-Secretary-General Mark Lowcock said 13 million people are affected by internal conflict gripping the country and require humanitarian assistance.

""More than 4.6 million children are acutely malnourished, including 2.2 million suffering from severe acute malnutrition,"" Lowcock said.

""We're seeing mushrooming epidemics including the worst outbreak of cholera in 15 years. There's also an epidemic of sexual violence - most of it unreported and unaddressed - and much of it against children.""

Fighting in the central African country has much to do with the long-delayed vote to replace President Joseph Kabila.

While elections were initially set for November 2016, they were pushed to December 2018. But the electoral commission has since said voting may not be possible until April 2019.

In the meantime, political opposition has been building up and a report released by the UN on Monday said at least 47 people were killed in the past year in demonstration-related violence.

Various warlords

Speaking from the UN headquarters in New York City, Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna said the UN Security Council is drawing attention to the crisis in DRC - one that involves many layers.

""There's the ongoing political uncertainty with a president who has overstayed his constitutional term in office,"" Hanna said.

""There's been ongoing conflict particularly in the north of the country where there are rebel groups still operating. There are also military groups associated with various warlords in the particular region.""

This has resulted in a massive amount of internally displaced people, Hanna said.

The UN has scheduled a donor's conference on April 13, where Lowcock said $1.7bn in aid is needed for this year. To date, only four percent of the funds needed for 2018 has been received by the UN.

""Underfunding is the largest single impediment to the humanitarian response in the DRC,"" Lowcock said, adding the crisis will continue to escalate if there is no successful political transition and a halt to the violence.",UNSC: 13 million people need humanitarian aid in DR Congo,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/unsc-13-million-people-humanitarian-aid-dr-congo-180319193647677.html
3,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing a humanitarian crisis comparable to that seen in Syria, aid agencies warn.

The central African nation, home to 83 million people, “has been hit by waves of violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil in recent months, leading to worries about a new civil war like that which killed five million people between 1997 and 2003”, says The Guardian.

Why is there so much unrest in the DRC?

President Joseph Kabila’s term in office should have ended in December 2016, but the 46-year-old politician has clung to power, using the army to quell growing dissent over his unconstitutional extended mandate.

Kabila promised that elections will be held on 23 December this year, but fears that he will refuse to go quietly are well-founded – the DRC has not experienced a peaceful transition of power since it won independence from Belgium in 1960.

How bad is the situation?

“Few areas are considered safe in the restive DRC right now,” Sky News reports, with the ethnically-divided east and south-east particularly fraught.

Uncertainty around Kabila’s intentions has erupted into unrest and violent repression. “Security forces have killed dozens of people during street protests against the president’s extended rule,” says Reuters.

In addition to government-sanctioned repression, the political chaos and upheaval “have contributed to rising militia violence in eastern Congo’s borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda”, Reuters reports.

More than 15,000 UN peacekeepers are stationed in the country, making it the largest peacekeeping operation in the world.

Violence, hunger and the breakdown of public institutions such as hospitals, schools and police services have driven around five million Congolese from their homes, according to UN estimates.

It also estimates that more than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, making the situation in the DRC a crisis on a similar scale to that seen in Syria. Of these, 7.7 million are facing “severe food insecurity”, defined by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation as going for entire days without eating.

However, UN migration agency chief Jean-Philippe Chauzy warned last month that demand for assistance far outstripped the agency’s means. “Some funding has come in but not nearly enough to meet the critical needs of millions in the DRC,” he said.

What is the future for the DRC?

A poll by the Congo Research Group at New York University and Congolese polling group the Bureau d'Etudes, de Recherches, et de Consulting International ( BERCI) lays bare the bleak future of the DRC as seen by its citizens.

Eight in ten Congolese have an unfavourable opinion of Kabila, “but nearly seven in ten don’t think the December vote to replace him will be fair”, says Reuters.

Tom Perriello, former US envoy to the DRC, told a discussion group at the Brookings Institute in March he had seen a “push for change” from ordinary Congolese keen to bring fresh leadership to the destitute but copper and cobalt-rich nation.

A best-case scenario in December would see a “historic” democratic handover of power, but the alternative is “a breakdown and a great deal of violence”, he said. “The stakes are very high.”",Democratic Republic of the Congo on verge of breakdown,http://www.theweek.co.uk/92682/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-on-verge-of-breakdown

This has been effective in mobilizing international capacity to scale up humanitarian support. Since the L3 activation, over 1.1 million people have been successfully reached with life-saving assistance in the Kasais, Tanganyika and the Kivus. The benchmarks established on 20 October 2017 to measure the L3 scale-up have largely been met. The L3 status will accordingly be deactivated on 20 April 2018.

Given that the single most critical issue for the humanitarian response is funding, it is vital that the focus now be on raising the required funds to reach people in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance across the DRC. The 2018 United Nations humanitarian appeal requires US$1.7 billion.

The United Nations continues to engage closely with Government counterparts on the humanitarian situation in the DRC. I look forward to continued, close coordination with the authorities as we continue to work to support millions of people across the country.

By Agence France-Presse

A humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo is worsening and has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country, with millions facing severe hunger, the UN Security Council warned Thursday.

At least 13.1 million Congolese are in need of humanitarian aid including 7.7 million who are severely food insecure, said a unanimous statement from the top UN body.

The humanitarian crisis has been compounded by a doubling over the past year of the number of Congolese fleeing violence in the country who now total close to 4.4 million.

Council members “expressed great concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, which has reached catastrophic levels in some parts of the country”, said the statement.

The council “emphasized the need to address the presence of armed groups in the country” and renewed its call for “transparent, credible and inclusive elections”.

Kinshasa authorities have set a date of December 23 to hold historic elections but it remains unclear whether President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, will step aside to allow a transition.

UN officials fear the country could slide into all-out violence as the countdown to the elections begin.

An international conference will be held in Geneva on April 13 to mobilize funding for a $1.7 billion humanitarian appeal for the DR Congo — four times the amount secured last year.

The United Nations has declared the humanitarian crisis in the DR Congo to be a Level 3, the UN’s highest-level emergency.

The council statement followed a meeting on Monday on the crisis.

At that meeting, the US head of the international development agency, Mark Green, said the Kabila government had done “so little to alleviate suffering, even as many of its leaders have apparently been lining their pockets.”

The Kabila family owns either partially or wholly more than 80 of the largest businesses in the country and more than 450 miles of diamond concessions, Green said, quoting the Congo Research Group.

But by the mid-2000s, a tenuous peace prevailed. Healing was beginning between Ituri’s two main ethnic groups, whose animosity had spiraled into tit-for-tat massacres. Most who had fled made a cautious return. There were even interethnic marriages. Two warlords from the province were the first people in the world to be convicted by the International Criminal Court.

A sudden return to violence in February and March has shattered any illusion of stability.

Nearly 400,000 people have been displaced by renewed violence, according to the United Nations. More than 40,000 of them have fled Congo entirely, crossing Lake Albert in rickety boats to Uganda, where they have been resettled in an ever-expanding refu­gee camp.

Ituri is only the latest of Congo’s provinces to veer toward humanitarian catastrophe. More than 13 million Congolese need emergency aid, and 4.5 million have been displaced from their homes nationwide — more than anywhere else in Africa. But even by Congo’s standards, the speed and scale at which the crisis in Ituri has unfolded is extraordinary, catching many, including locals, by surprise.

Vomulia Yeruse was in her garden when she heard the voices of a group of men approaching her home. The house was perched on a steep hillside, and her garden was downslope and out of sight. Her husband, she said, was inside, probably relaxing and listening to their transistor radio.

People in her village, Gobu, had been saying the old war was starting again, but it came quicker than Yeruse expected.

With nothing but her daughter, Christine, 3, tied to her back, her son, David, 6, in her arms, and about $11 she had tucked into a sock, she fled down the hill and into the bush. She has not seen her husband since that day in mid-March.

“If they find you in the house, they will burn it so you come outside,” Yeruse said. “Then they catch you and chop you with the machete.”

Yeruse and more than a dozen other refugees in Uganda interviewed by The Washington Post said they had passed through burned villages and stepped over bodies all the way after fleeing their homes until they boarded overloaded boats operated by men who made them sell everything they had for seats.

“If they don’t chop you, you may still starve in the bush,” said Yeruse, just hours after she arrived in the fishing village of Sebagoro on the Ugandan shore of Lake Albert. “People are even starving at the dock because they have no money to pay for the boat or for food.”

To those who are fleeing and to outside observers, some aspects of the current situation worryingly echo Ituri’s traumatic past.

Relations between the Hema and Lendu, thought to be on the mend, are plainly still raw, imbued with generations-old grievances over land ownership and unsettled scores from past conflicts. The brutality displayed over the past two months is on par with some of the worst from the crisis years ago: widespread rape, dismemberment of victims, the kidnapping of small children. The displaced are almost entirely Hema.

Growing instability across Congo comes against the backdrop of an increasingly intransigent president. Joseph Kabila, who had already served through a two-term limit, refused to step down in 2016. Strife in other provinces has benefited Kabila, who has used it as grounds for putting off elections, effectively keeping himself in power long after his tenure should have ended.

Three independent observers working in the province, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their ability to work there, said there was no direct evidence linking Kabila’s government to instability in Ituri, but they said there were reasons to believe the fighting was not purely ethnic in nature.

Many who flee violence in Congo across Lake Albert end up at the sprawling Kyangwali refugee camp in Uganda.

They, as well as numerous refugees now in Uganda, cited a recent statement by Corneille Nangaa, the head of Congo’s electoral commission, that instability in Ituri could hamper the government’s ability to conduct a general election, long-delayed but now scheduled for December. Vast swaths of Congo are under limited government control at best, and the U.N. peacekeeping force, despite being the world’s largest and most expensive, is increasingly stretched.

Lambert Mende, a spokesman for Congo’s government, said that Nangaa’s comments had been taken out of context and that “the situation is cooling down” in Ituri. He vehemently denied that the government was providing Lendu militias with weapons.

“There is no reason to delay elections,” he told The Post, adding that reporters should be wary of “desperate opponents” who are trying to smear the government with a “bad image.”

The Congolese government has held close to that line. In saying it will boycott a U.N. conference in Geneva this month aimed at raising funds to alleviate Congo’s humanitarian crises, acting prime minister José Makila accused the United Nations of overstating the severity of the situation. Aid organizations were propagating a “bad image of D.R. Congo throughout the world,” he said, using an abbreviated form of the country’s name, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Anti-Kabila sentiment was palpable in Kyangwali refugee camp in Uganda, about two hours by road from Sebagoro, where the refu­gee boats land.

“If Kabila isn’t giving the Lendu pangas and petrol, then who is?” asked Makivuno Silva, 18, using a common word for machetes. He said that this time around, as opposed to the war that started just before he was born, no one thought of putting up a fight against the Lendu. “How can we even think of fighting back when we are outmatched like that?”

He and others scoffed at the idea of returning to Congo anytime soon, expressing a sentiment that may point to another political calculation behind the violence. If the displacement numbers are correct, and most of the displaced are indeed Hema, then Lendu politicians may be able to prevail over Hema candidates who they claim are wealthier, favored by the central government and use those advantages to win elections despite coming from a minority population.

David Gressly, the U.N. secretary general’s deputy special rapporteur for Congo, recently traveled through the affected parts of Ituri and said that while most of the Lendu population seemed still to be in place, Hema villages were devoid of women and children. Some Hema men, ages 15 to 50, have stayed behind to protect what is left of their livelihoods. The United Nations says nearly 80 percent of those who have fled to Uganda are women and children.

“We consider the situation to be quite tense and quite serious,” Gressly said. Battalions of Uruguayan and Bangladeshi peacekeepers are being deployed in Ituri to prevent fighting from spreading farther south and west, he said. “This needs to be contained before it sets the whole place on fire.”

Of Congo’s tinderboxes, Ituri is the most combustible. Four major bouts of ethnic violence predate this year’s strife, and locals say grievances between the Hema and Lendu go back to colonial times, when Belgian administrators gave the Hema better access to education and government jobs.

Although two militia leaders from Ituri were convicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague in 2012 and 2014, another, Bosco Ntaganda, a Hema warlord, is still on trial, accused of 13 counts of war crimes and five counts of crimes against humanity.

A new set of ringleaders may be behind the recent violence, but journalists and human rights groups have not determined exactly who.

“You can’t live a settled life there, not now, maybe never,” said Yeruse. “Maybe I will die in Uganda.”

Not returning to Congo means settling in Kyangwali. The land it sits on was bought by the Ugandan government in the 1960s and has been used to host successive waves of refugees from Sudan, Rwanda and Congo. New arrivals are bused to the camp from Sebagoro and given basic items like jerrycans for water collection, tarpaulins for shelter and machetes to chop tree branches from a nearby forest to prop up the tarps.

Congolese refugees stand at a gate of the Kyangwali refugee camp in Uganda.

The journey from Ituri can take three to 10 hours, depending on the quality of the boat’s motor. Many operators prefer to cross at night, when the lake is calmer, their boats navigating among the thousands of scattered Ugandan fishermen who set their nets in the dark. From the shore, the fishermen’s lanterns make it appear that the boats filled with those fleeing Congo are passing through the reflection of a starry sky, while the silhouette of Ituri’s Blue Mountains looms behind them.

Most who arrive have not eaten for days and have spent multiple nights sleeping in Ituri’s dense forest. Compounding the misery, some of the most recent arrivals have brought cholera, which is endemic in eastern Congo. Nearly 2,000 cases have been reported in Kyangwali. Thirty-six people have died, and new cases have been reported in locals near where the refu­gee boats come ashore. The only silver lining is that this outbreak is not of the drug-resistant variety. By government order, each person arriving in Uganda by boat is now put on a prophylactic course of antibiotics.

But a much more common affliction — boredom — has spread more widely through the camp, making the prospects of settling here all the grimmer for its largely young inhabitants.

“I had been in school for almost two years back in Congo. I might have wanted to be a nurse, or a teacher, but no matter what, I wanted to learn English,” said Mapenzi Dzanina, a 16-year-old who managed to bring with her a cherished necklace but little else.

In late February, she and a few schoolmates watched from the forest as a group of men set their village alight. The arsonists spoke to each other in Lendu, which she understands, and to her, it seemed that they were under the influence of drugs. While storage rooms full of corn and cassava that their families had harvested went up in flames, the men laughed, she said.

It was not until she reached the Ugandan shore three days later that Mapenzi had anything to eat — biscuits given to her by a U.N. worker. In Kyangwali, she stood again among her friends from home, this time surveying the hills dotted with tents made of white tarp, sticks and mud that would be their home for the foreseeable future.

“There are no schools here,” she said. “Maybe I won’t ever go to school again.”

7,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The United Nations is downgrading Congo from its highest level of humanitarian emergency after the arrival of aid - and an outcry from government officials who say the focus on such woes is deterring investment.

It activated a so-called Level 3 emergency for Democratic Republic of Congo in October, putting on the country on the same footing as Syria and Yemen.

But that is due to be deactivated this month, a senior U.N. official said in a statement on Thursday.

Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, according to a U.N. report last month, as militia violence spikes across much of the country’s eastern borderlands.

Humanitarian officials from foreign donors and aid agencies have repeatedly said in recent weeks that the crisis is worsening and that the country’s needs are well short of being met.

Congo’s government rejects that the humanitarian situation is getting worse. It says it only recognizes about 231,000 internally displaced Congolese compared with U.N. estimates of around 4.3 million - 19 times higher.

The government is also shunning a conference this month in Geneva organized by the United Nations and other donors in an effort to raise $1.7 billion for Congo, saying the focus on humanitarian woes is deterring investment.

In the statement, U.N. Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said that since the Level 3 emergency was activated for Congo last October over 1.1 million people had received life-saving aid.

“The benchmarks established on 20 October 2017 to measure the L3 scale-up have largely been met. The L3 status will accordingly be deactivated on 20 April 2018,” Lowcock said.

The crisis in Congo’s perpetually volatile east - where conflict, hunger and disease killed millions in civil wars around the turn of the century - has been further fueled by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in 2016.

Kabila denies clinging to power and says that elections have been delayed because of logistical problems.

8,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:

To date, the DRC RC has nearly completed its target of sensitization communities at risk of the cholera infection as describe in the first phase of the appeal that focuses on the essential epidemiological health and WATSAN needs. This start includes fundamental capacity building of newly formed territorial chapters and a volunteer base that is accustomed to basic lifesaving response activities. The successful growing of skills and support set up and knowledge of the evolving situation on the communities will permit the eventual expansion of the response into its second phase to address needs in Helath, nutrition and livelihood and eventual a potential third phase that would see the geographic expansion of the familiar activities.

In the EPoA published on December 22, 2017, the intervention area is broadly defined as the Lomami province, which is divided into 21 health zones with a total population of 2,443,000. After evaluating the epidemiological situation, it was decided that the response will not specifically target displaced, returnees and host families but instead those communities in the cholera affected areas (or at risk of being affected). Using official Ministry of Health epidemiology data and in collaborations with the health authorities in Lomami province, the DRC RC and IFRC proposed that the first phase of the EA to focus on reducing the risk of cholera in five health zones; Kabinda, Kalambayi, Kamiji, Kanda-Kanda and Ngandajika (total population 1,173,055).

At the time, Ngandajika was the only of the 5 zones with confirmed cholera deaths and the highest confirmed cases reported. Having an active presence in the zones has allowed the teams to focus the sensitization where the cases are still emerging, considering the existing government capacity to deliver sensitization as well as avoid duplication with other organisations doing similar work. Their reports will allow the DRC RC to proactively respond to cases with intensified campaigns as well as disinfection work.

The timing of response activities of the first phase is divided into two parts and has had activities revised and added;

First month:

Sensitization for the reduction of risks of contracting cholera, identifying new cases and reference to medical aid through house-by-house visits by 192 trained volunteers and 19 team leaders to reach 244,300 individuals in all 5 priority health zones. Train and supply materials and equipment for safe burials and household disinfection for suspected cases. Ensure the protection of volunteers (orientations, insurance, protection equipment, etc.)

Subsequent 7 months: In week 6 of 2018 the Ministry of Health warned of an increase in cholera cases, with 79% originating in the Grand Kasai region. This region includes the Lomami province where the Ngandajika health zone reported18 confirmed cases in week six and a total of 9 deaths this year. Given this epidemiological development, not all activities will need to be implemented in all of the five health zones and still require further evaluation to select the areas where. Therefore, the second phase will consist of two blocks of activities:

(i) Focus on disease surveillance in 4 Health Zones with very low caseloads. Minimum community based monitoring in case of a flare, and a gradual exit strategy with capacity building for the territorial branches. Activities will focus on:

• Surveillance and active case search: Training of 150 volunteers in Module 6 of the CBHFA training cycle in all 5 priority health zones. Use the training to highlight gender inclusion in the activities.

• In the 5 health zones, train focal points and supply them with materials and safety equipment to carry out household disinfection of cholera cases and safe and dignified burials. These focal points will be working in close collaboration with the local health authorities.

• Training of WATSAN focal points with the PHAST tool in the 15 territorial branches. This will ensure future capacity to report on needs and initate community based WATSAN activities.

• Liaising with other implementers in the health zones to discuss if RC volunteers could be used as agents in their program implementation (Save the Children is currently conducting an evaluation)

• Discussion with other RC Movement partners to evaluate possibility of bilateral program implementation

(ii) Concentrate risk reduction activities in the most affected Health Areas within the Ngandajika Health Zone. One hundred volunteers and 5 supervisors deliver intensified sensitization to 45,000 persons and WATSAN support to 1,500 households in most affected areas using vulnerability as selection criteria;

• WATSAN baseline and Household vulnerability assessment of 7,500 households

The Democratic Republic of Congo faces a worsening humanitarian, human rights, and security crisis. The consequences have been devastating for the Congolese people, with some 4.5 million people displaced from their homes – more than in any other country in Africa – and 2 million children at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of refugees have fled into Uganda, Angola, Tanzania, and Zambia in recent months – raising the specter of increased regional instability if the crisis is not contained.

The South African government and the broader Southern African Development Community (SADC) region – which South Africa now chairs – can play a critical role in helping to bring durable peace, stability, and greater respect for human rights in the vast central African country.

The potential opportunities that a stable Congo could bring to the Congolese people and the broader region are mind boggling. The country is teeming with natural resources – gold, diamonds, coltan, tin, uranium, and oil – just to name a few. Congo is Africa’s biggest copper producer and the world’s largest source of cobalt– a metal that has tripled in value in the past 18 months, given the surge in demand for electric cars. Congo is home to immense biodiversity and the world’s second largest rainforest, which serves as a significant carbon sink for greenhouse gases. Congo’s rivers have the hydropower potential that could one day power half of sub-Saharan Africa. With 80 million hectares of arable land and diverse climate conditions, Congo has the agricultural potential to feed much of Africa. And the country’s volcanoes, gorillas, and stunning landscapes present enormous opportunities for the tourism industry.

Yet despite these riches, Congo is one of the world’s poorest countries in the world. Ten out of 100 children in Congo die before they reach the age of 5, and more than 40 percent have stunted growth due to malnutrition. Poor governance and largescale abuses by armed groups and members of the Congolese security forces – fueled by widespread impunity and struggles for control over the country’s vast resources – have stunted the country’s development and left countless victims. Today, more than 13 million Congolese affected by recent violence are in need of emergency assistance, including food, sanitation, shelter, and education, according to the United Nations.

Much of the violence that plagues Congo today is linked to the country’s broader political crisis, as President Joseph Kabila has stayed in power beyond his constitutionally mandated two-term limit by delaying elections and quashing dissent. Security forces have killed over 300 people during largely peaceful protests since 2015. Hundreds of opposition supporters and democracy activists have been thrown in jail. Kabila’s ruling coalition has systematically banned meetings and demonstrations by the opposition while jailing hundreds of opposition leaders and supporters, as well as human rights and pro-democracy activists. Many have been held in secret detention facilities without charge or access to family members or lawyers. Others have been tried on trumped-up charges. Last July, unidentified armed men shot and nearly killed a judge who refused to hand down a ruling against an opposition leader. The government has also shut down Congolese media outlets, expelled hard-hitting international journalists and researchers, and periodically curtailed access to the internet and text messaging.

During the most recent protests – on December 31, January 21, and February 25 – Congolese security forces hit a new low by firing into Catholic church grounds to disrupt peaceful services and processions following Sunday mass, killing at least 18 people and wounding and arresting scores of others. When confronted by the heavily armed police and soldiers, some protesters, dressed in white or holding religious symbols – such as crosses, bibles, rosaries, and palms – sang hymns or knelt on the ground.

In the days leading up to the February 25 protests, ruling party officials and senior security officers paid at least several hundred youth recruits – including many from the ruling party’s youth league – and gave them instructions to infiltrate churches, arrest priests when they attempted to march after the services, beat those who resisted, and provoke violence and disorder to prevent the marches from going forward and to “justify” a brutal response from the security forces.

These latest protests were organized by the Lay Coordination Committee (CLC), a group of Catholic intellectuals, backed by Catholic priests and bishops in Congo. All the main political opposition leaders as well as many civil society groups and citizens’ movements supported the demonstrations. They appealed to all Congolese to protest the failure to implement the so-called St. Sylvestre Accord, a Catholic Church-mediated power-sharing agreement signed on New Year’s Eve 2016. The deal provided Kabila an excuse to stay in power another year – beyond the end of his constitutional two-term limit on December 19, 2016 – but also a commitment to implement confidence-building measures and organize elections by the end of 2017. But instead, these commitments were largely flouted: the new government, the so-called National Follow-up Council (CNSA), and the electoral commission (CENI) excluded members of the main opposition coalition and are in full control of Kabila’s presidential majority coalition, while repression and election delays continue.

The CENI finally published a new electoral calendar in November, which set December 23, 2018 as the new date for elections, with the caveat that numerous “constraints” could push the date back even further. Yet Kabila himself has not demonstrated that he is preparing to step down or create a climate conducive to free, fair, and credible elections. In a rare press conference in January, Kabila refused to say explicitly that he will step down by the end of 2018 or that he will not attempt to run again. Some in Kabila’s majority coalition are still talking about a possible referendum or other changes to the electoral process that would allow Kabila to stay in power.

Many Congolese civil society groups have denounced the CENI’s calendar as merely another delaying tactic, and they have called on Kabila to step down immediately and for a citizens’ transition to be organized without Kabila that would restore constitutional order and organize credible elections. According to a recent poll by the New York University-based Congo Research Group and the Congolese polling agency, BERCI, a full 74 percent of Congolese support the demand for Kabila to step down before elections are held.

Kabila’s refusal to abide by the constitution and relinquish the presidency can partly be explained by the considerable fortune he and his family have amassed during his tenure and the hundreds of millions of dollars in mining revenue that have gone missing. Such corruption has helped leave the government bereft of funds to meet the basic needs of an impoverished population.

To make matters worse, well-placed security and intelligence sources have described to Human Rights Watch official efforts to sow violence and instability across much of the country in an apparently deliberate “strategy of chaos” to justify further election delays.

Since August 2016, an outbreak of violence in the country’s central Kasi region, involving Congolese security forces, government-backed militias, and local armed groups, has left up to 5,000 people dead. Last March, two UN investigators – Michael Sharp, an American, and Zaida Catalán, a Swedish and Chilean dual national – were killed while investigating serious human rights abuses in the region. As the Congolese authorities continue to blame members of a local militia and have repeatedly interfered in the Congolese judicial investigation into the murders, Human Rights Watch research and Radio France Internationale and Reuters reports suggest government responsibility.

Since mid-December, a wave of horrific violence has engulfed Djugu territory, an area of northeastern Congo’s Ituri province that had been largely peaceful in recent years. The incredible speed at which assailants killed more than 250 civilians and torched scores of villages has taken many by surprise. More than 200,000 people have been forced to flee their homes, including tens of thousands of refugees who fled to neighboring Uganda.

Human Rights Watch has received terrifying accounts of massacres, rapes, and decapitation. In February, after an attack on Seseti village, a survivor described finding 15 bodies, including three children, the following morning. “They cut off the heads and arms of some… and even slit open their bellies,” he said. “We were too afraid to stay and bury them properly, so we just dug a small hole… and quickly left.”

While government officials have insisted that the recent Ituri violence is the consequence of inter-ethnic tensions between the ethnic Lendu and Hema communities, local leaders and survivors we spoke to have been left baffled. While low-level tensions existed – like in many parts of Congo – the communities were not preparing to go to war with each other. Many survivors referred to a “hidden hand” when describing those who might be behind the attacks: Seemingly professional killers came into their villages and hacked people to death with notable efficiency and brutality, in what appeared to be pre-meditated and well-planned attacks. Some alleged that government officials may be involved.

Large-scale violence has also continued in eastern Congo’s North and South Kivu and Tanganyika provinces. Today, over 120 armed groups are active in eastern Congo. Many of these groups receive support from the Congolese government and security forces, while others have formed coalitions against the Kabila government. Yet the gravest threat to Congolese civilians comes from the security forces meant to protect them. According to the UN human rights office in Congo, some 1,180 people were extrajudicially executed by Congolese “state agents” in 2017, far more than those killed by any of the armed groups and a threefold increase over two years.

As the security forces are themselves fomenting much of the violence in Congo, this has in turn been used as an excuse for election delays. Last July, the CENI president, Corneille Nangaa, said that violence in the Kasais was one of the main reasons why elections would not be held in 2017. This February, he said the renewed violence in Ituri could have a “negative impact” on the electoral calendar.

While the logistics of organizing elections in Congo are no doubt challenging, the country has managed in the past – both in 2006 and 2011 when Kabila was elected for his first and second terms, despite persistent security threats.

The key question now is: What can be done today to convince Kabila to stop making excuses, agree to abide by the constitution and step down, and allow for the organization of credible elections – before more Congolese are killed, injured and imprisoned as they seek to exercise their basic human rights to peacefully demonstrate, speak out, and freely associate, and before a new outbreak of large-scale violence leads to new refugee flows across Congo’s borders?

Kabila has become increasingly isolated internationally. The United States, the European Union, and the UN Security Council have all imposed targeted sanctions – including travel bans and assets freezes – against senior Congolese government and security force officers responsible for serious human rights abuses, repression, and election delays. In December, the US sanctioned Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, one of Kabila’s close friends and financial associates who “amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals” in Congo, as well as a number of individuals and companies associated with Gertler. Earlier this year, Belgium announced it is suspending all direct bilateral support to the Congolese government and redirecting its aid to humanitarian and civil society organizations.

Yet until now, Kabila has appeared to rely on support from the region – including from other leaders who have used repression, violence, and corruption to force through constitutional referendums and other maneuvers to entrench their hold on power while attempting to maintain a façade of democracy. Botswana has been a notable exception, with its Ministry of International Affairs stating this February that Congo is facing a “worsening humanitarian situation…mainly because its leader has persistently delayed the holding of elections and has lost control over the security of his country."" Botswana urged ""the international community to put more pressure on the leadership in the Democratic Republic of Congo to relinquish power and pave the way for the ushering in of a new political dispensation."" Some other countries have also expressed concerns publicly, including Angola. And some efforts have been made by SADC to address the crisis, including the appointment of a special envoy.

Yet much more could be done. Stronger political leadership from the region is needed to break the political and electoral deadlock that risks igniting a new war in Congo and plunging the entire region into severe instability.

The new presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa in South Africa presents an important opportunity for a real regional shift in policy towards Congo. The South African government and SADC more broadly could support the Congolese people’s aspirations for democracy and human rights, and help prevent more violence and instability if they choose to take a strong position by urging Kabila to act in accordance with his country’s constitution and to allow for a peaceful transition to a newly elected leader. They should also insist that key human rights benchmarks are met to ensure that elections are truly credible. The messaging should be clear that there will be real consequences if these measures are not respected.

Taking such a position could play an important role in refocusing attention and helping to restore South Africa’s role as a leader and promoter of peace, security, equality, and human rights — in South Africa and beyond.

11,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"Sébastien Jagla, MSF project coordinator in the north of Democratic Republic of Congo, describes the challenges to provide humanitarian assistance to Central African refugees, constantly on the move between two places and with no real home.

“Refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) in the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) can be invisible at times. Since mid-2017, tens of thousands have fled a brutal conflict and settled over the last months on the other side of the Ubangi river, in the Congolese districts of Gbadolite and Mobayi-Mbongo. The current number of refugees stands at approximately 42,000, fewer than the approximately 67,000 at the peak of the displacement some months ago.

It is difficult to trace them. Many are still looking after their fields and remaining properties just a few kilometres away and they go back sporadically to look for food and subsistence. They are constantly on the move, living in uncertainty as part time-refugees and part-time returnees, without really benefitting from either status and being subjected to violence and harassment by different parties on both sides of the river.

Mixing with the local communities

Some have managed to blend into the local communities or to live next to them in small settlements in villages and towns across the riverine Congolese border. They have built their own shelters: usually wooden huts. This allows them to fish and farm while remaining close to their country of origin. However, sometimes difficulties arise when accessing the existing resources and basic services.

Central African refugees in these areas are somewhat removed from the camps where humanitarian assistance from the DRC authorities and UNHCR is concentrated. They are also more difficult to access for the few aid organisations present in a remote region where logistics pose big challenges to intervening in a crisis which, on top of this, has not raised much attention.

Risky crossings

Many of the refugees continue to periodically cross over into CAR despite often facing violence by armed groups on the way or upon their temporary return to the country. As one refugee explained to us, some militiamen cut him with a machete because he went back to collect some remaining coffee harvest. The armed men argued that the refugee man was no longer entitled to harvest since he had chosen to live on the other side of the river.

Other refugees have spoken of similar accounts about their return journeys, but also stories of disputes with local Congolese people when accessing water points or dividing the manioc harvests they were allowed to collect for the benefit of both communities.

Scattered humanitarian assistance

These daily tensions and, more importantly, the risky returns to an obviously unsafe place, would probably be less prevalent if there were proper humanitarian assistance in place, but what we have seen over the past six months of intervention is that these crossings have become common practice, while the crisis has not managed to raise any kind of awareness.

While this may not be an emergency in terms of mortality and child malnutrition levels, our fixed and mobile teams have observed prevalent severe diseases, with malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections being the most common, a usual pattern in displacement crises. Our teams see very vulnerable people who deserve attention in a context in which the already limited health system and basic services have become clearly overstretched, consequently affecting the host community as well. The lack of visibility and knowledge of this vulnerable population undermines the capacity to address their needs.”

MSF worked between mid-September 2017 and the end of March 2018 supporting two hospitals and nine health centres in the northern Congolese districts of Gbadolite and Mobayi-Mbongo and running mobile clinics for both refugees and the host community.

Teams provided more than 38,600 medical consultations, admitted 3,970 inpatients, treated nearly 2,000 children under five for malnutrition and vaccinated 20,000 children for measles as part of a vaccination campaign against a range of other diseases. Its logistical teams have also helped to improve water and sanitation conditions by constructing 13 boreholes and rehabilitating other water sources.

The intervention has now been handed over to the Ministry of Health after some staff received training, while MSF keeps a surveillance system in Nord-Ubangi province in order to be ready to intervene should an emergency develop.

Since May 2017, MSF has also been providing medical care in the village of Ndu, east of Gbadolite, to more than 12,000 refugees from the Central African city of Bangassou. After an attack on its staff last November, MSF suspended its activities in Bangassou but continues to provide remote support to CAR refugees in Ndu.",CAR/DRC: Lives split over the Congolese border,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/cardrc-lives-split-over-congolese-border

To respond to the crisis, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance organized the donor conference in Geneva on April 13 to make its biggest appeal yet for aid to Congo to provide emergency assistance — including food, sanitation, shelter and education — to more than 13 million people affected by the violence.

Mr. Kita said the calls for assistance are “a demonization campaign.” Congolese officials convened a separate meeting in Geneva with other African officials, asking them denounce the aid effort, according to a diplomat with knowledge of the matter. The other nations did not agree to the request.

Still, diplomats and aid workers say they expect the Congolese government’s opposition to have an effect by making it harder for countries at the conference to agree to donate.

The United Arab Emirates, a co-host of the conference, has already said it would suspend participation if the Congolese government did not support the appeal. Congo also threatened Swedish and Dutch diplomats who helped convene the donor conference, saying they did not consult with their Congolese counterparts and warning of unspecified consequences if the European nations continued with the conference.

Christos Stylianides, the European Commission’s top crisis envoy, said during a visit to Kinshasa late last month that foreign assistance would be ineffective without local government cooperation. Donor nations have already pledged $171 million.

An appeal for aid last year fell far short of needs, as donors provided less than 60 percent of what aid agencies requested.

Jose Barahona, Congo country director for Oxfam International, said he has witnessed firsthand what the funding shortfall means for the ordinary Congolese. His organization had to halve its assistance last year, when promised donor funds did not materialize.

The people left out felt hopeless, he said. He recalled one of them pointing to the ground and saying: “I have two of my younger sons buried here. Do you want me to bury more sons?’”","Despite Millions of Displaced People, Congo Rejects U.N. Aid Effort",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/africa/congo-kabila-aid.html

Five rangers and their driver have been killed at the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a spokesman says.

The group was killed in an ambush by suspected rebels operating in the park, Joel Wengamulay told the BBC.

Virunga boasts Africa's most diverse wildlife habitat and is home to endangered mountain gorillas.

Some of eastern DR Congo's armed groups are also based in the park, where they often poach animals.

Virunga is home to about a quarter of the world's remaining 880 mountain gorillas, as well as lions, elephants and hippos.

More than 130 park rangers have been killed in the park since 1996.

14,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,".- Armed men burst into a church meeting room in the North Kivu region April 8 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and killed 38-year-old Fr. Étienne Sengiyumva, the parish pastor.

Bishop Théophile Kaboy Ruboneka of Goma, in North Kivu Province announced the news to the Vatican’s Fides News Agency

""After celebrating the Mass at Kyahemba, a district in his parish, around 3pm, Fr. Étienne was meeting with his parish staff, when an armed man, accompanied by others, entered the meeting room and shot the priest point blank in the head, killing him instantly, "" the bishop recounted.

“The murder happened so quickly that those present couldn't take note of how many people had entered the room to kill Fr. Étienne,” he lamented.

The bishop also told Fides that ”it's hard to know who is responsible. Our region is infested with armed groups, at least 15, that fail to be dismantled despite the constant presence of the army and the blue-helmeted UN soldiers.”

Bishop Ruboneka explained that “Fr. Étienne is the third priest killed in the region” and that “the investigations to find those responsible for these deaths go nowhere. On our part, we are doing everything we can to identify Fr. Étienne's killers, even though we have no illusions.”

“In these cases the witnesses fear for their own lives and the lives of their loved ones and it would be hard for them to offer any information useful for the investigation,” he pointed out.

The bishop also stated that Fr. Célestin Ngango was kidnapped from the diocese after celebrating Easter Mass. He was later released, blindfolded, at around 3 am following heavy pressure from the local inhabitants. The Congolese bishops' conference told Fides ""the freed priest was not mistreated and he appears to be in good health. However, he will undergo a medical examination.""

Bishop Ruboneka does not think there is any connection between the two incidents.

“I repeat, in our region there are so many armed groups that it is hard to know who committed this act or another. Here in North Kivu we are living in total chaos,” Bishop Ruboneka said.

In conclusion the prelate stressed that “the situation of the Diocese of Goma, as well as Butembo-Beni, is unbelievable. We are completely abandoned by everyone and we live thanks to the grace of Providence. I ask the faithful of the Universal Church to pray for our region so we can again find peace.”

16,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi praises generosity of Congo, urges more international support for concrete solutions.

By Jonathan Clayton

MULONGWE, Democratic Republic of Congo – Praising the generosity of the Congolese people for hosting refugees and sharing often meagre resources, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has called on the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbours to step up efforts to find “principled, just and concrete” solutions to the complex crises of the region.

Grandi also urged the international community not to forget the inter-connected plight of millions of refugees and internally displaced people simply because they are a long way from Europe.

“I must say I am very impressed… this is not a rich area, it is a poor area and yet refugees share many resources together with the local community,” he said during a visit to this site for Burundian refugees in the troubled province of South Kivu in eastern DRC.

Funding shortages cause cuts in food rations.

“There are 35,000 Burundian refugees in this area around us … they have been given land and the children go to local schools and the refugee population can go to the health centres that are provided for the local population,” he added.

Ending a four-day visit the country, Grandi met refugees in this refugee site at Mulongwe. Several told him there was insufficent food aid after funding shortages forced the UN World Food Programme to reduce weekly rations.

A 32-year-old mother of six told the High Commissioner she now felt much safer than when she was in Burundi. However, she said there was not enough to eat and little other help, like clothes and lighting for their mud-walled temporary shelters.

“My children have to go to school barefoot, we have nothing – we left everything behind when we fled. after my husband was killed,” she said.

Grandi, who flew to Eastern Congo on Saturday (April 7) after meeting senior government officials, including President Joseph Kabila, and visiting urban refugees in the capital Kinshasa, said his visit served as a reminder that countries like DRC, which hosts a total of some 540,000 refugees, needed support.

“In many of the places where the refugees are, the impact is very substantive on the meagre resources of the local community,” he declared.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come.”

However, noting that the Great Lakes region had suffered from inter-linked crises for more than a quarter of a century, he said that a renewed emphasis on finding solutions needed to be undertaken.

“Solutions exist but they are yet to come and meanwhile people are still suffering – Burundian refugees, the local population and we need to keep these people strong. We need to help the local authorities and the national authorities of Congo to bear the brunt of this hospitality,” Grandi said, adding that recent insecurity in this area had also led to large numbers of internally displaced people who also needed support.

“There is an urgent need to find principled, just, concrete and durable solutions … Many of these refugees will not trek for thousands of miles, cross the sea to remind the world of their existence... They stay here, they suffer here, but they are equally in need and they deserve our attention — our political attention to find solutions, and our humanitarian attention to bring relief to their plight,” he said.

The High Commissioner also met a group of displaced Congolese, all of whom had fled their homes in Nyanzale in North Kivu province at the end of 2017, when armed groups attacked the civilian population.

Grandi said internal displacement again highlighted the need to establish security in the affected areas and then provide longer-term assistance to encourage development to complement humanitarian initiatives.",UN refugee chief calls for solutions to crises affecting Great Lakes region,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/un-refugee-chief-calls-solutions-crises-affecting-great-lakes
17,democratic+republic+of+the+congo,"2018 UPDATE OF THE 2017 – 2019 HRP

This document is the 2018 Update of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2017 - 2019 for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In 2017, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) adopted its first multi-year strategy. The multi-year HRP is grounded in the recommendations emanating from the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and aims to foster a more effective humanitarian response adapted to the specific humanitarian context of the DRC - namely the scale, the cyclic and acute nature of the crisis. While 2017 was characterized by a dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation, the HCT has agreed that the multi-year and multi-sectoral approach of the 2017 - 2019 HRP remains valid.

The 2018 edition of the HRP reflects updated objectives, activities, indicators, and sectoral strategies adapted to suit the current context. The document also includes an overview of the progress made in implementing the collective commitments of the humanitarian community on the key themes identified in the 2017 - 2019 HRP.

2017 OVERVIEW

Humanitarian actors worked tirelessly in 2017 under the HCT leadership and in support of the DRC authorities to deliver lifesaving assistance to millions of people across the country. Faced with a dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation across much of the country - namely the outbreak of violence in the Kasai region and the resurgence of conflict in the East - the humanitarian community quickly mobilized to launch significant coordination and advocacy initiatives. A Flash Appeal for the Kasais was launched in April which, thanks to the support of donors, led to a major deployment in Kasai region where humanitarian actors have traditionally had little presence. The advocacy by the humanitarian community led the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to declare System-wide “Level 3” Emergency in October to rapidly scale up capacity for the crises in Kasai region and provinces of Tanganyika (including Pweto and Malemba-Nkulu territories) and South Kivu (including Maniema), where the situation had deteriorated dramatically. Humanitarian organizations assisted 2.7 million people across the DRC in 2017. However, more efforts are required, as assistance reached only 33 per cent of the people in need. Underfunding was a significant impediment to the response in 2017, with only US$398 million received – 49 per cent – of the $812.6 million required under the HRP.

PREFACE BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR

In January 2017, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Humanitarian Country Team launched its first multisectoral and multi-year Humanitarian Response Plan covering 2017-2019. In addition to implementing the global commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit, this approach allowed the humanitarian community to focus more strategically on a humanitarian situation that was already deteriorating.

The humanitarian situation worsened dramatically in 2017, exceeding the planning projections. Conflict expanded across several localities in Kasai region and violence intensified in the country’s east, exponentially driving up population displacement, food insecurity, malnutrition and the spread of epidemics. Today, the DRC hosts more than 4.5 million internally displaced people, the highest number of any country on the African continent.

The overall objectives and response strategies of the threeyear plan remain broadly relevant. However, the figures and the strategy have had to be updated to suit the current context. The 2018 edition reflects these revisions.

In a country nearly the size of Western Europe, humanitarian actors have striven to assist a growing number of people in increasingly large areas amid some of the lowest aid funding in 10 years. The factors contributing to the deterioration in the humanitarian situation severely stretched the capacity of humanitarian actors to respond, prompting the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator to activate the highest level of emergency response – a Level 3 – for the Kasai, Tanganyika and South Kivu crises. A reform of the humanitarian coordination structures is being carried out to streamline the system and improve the flexibility of response.

The projections are alarming: the current high level of vulnerability and need is unprecedented in the history of humanitarian appeals in the DRC, jeopardizing stability and development endeavours. Eighteen of the DRC’s 26 provinces face humanitarian emergencies. Around 13.1 million – including 7.7 million children – will need humanitarian protection and assistance in 2018, representing a 50 per cent increase from 2017. This includes 7.5 million people who are displaced or returned and need assistance to meet basic needs such as shelter and clean water; 9.9 million people who require assistance to meet their food needs; and 4.5 million children who require treatment for malnutrition. The alleviation of suffering – and at times survival – of millions of men, women, girls and boys will depend on the humanitarian community’s ability to mobilize in the year ahead.

I take this opportunity to salute the partners who have contributed to the significant collective progress of the humanitarian response in the DRC. Efforts are now required to build on this progress and adapt the response to meet urgent needs across the country. In 2018, US$1.68 billion is required to assist 10.5 million people. The importance of flexible funding in this volatile environment cannot be understated, and it is essential that contributions to the DRC Humanitarian Fund reach 15 per cent of the total HRP requirement. I would like to encourage donors to prioritize funding over several years in accordance with their commitments under the “Grand Bargain”.

Given the huge needs and limited resources, the humanitarian community that I represent are forced to make impossible choices every day. We count on your support so that are not forced to make these choices and can reach the most vulnerable and enable millions of people in the DRC to regain their dignity and humanity, in accordance with the humanitarian principles and standards that we are all committed to upholding",DR Congo: 2017-2019 Humanitarian Response Plan - 2018 Update,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-2017-2019-humanitarian-response-plan-2018-update

UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has met with successful refugee entrepreneurs living in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a landmark visit to the Great Lakes region.

Inside a hip and modern art gallery, Grandi spoke with men and women refugees who own clothing businesses, sell produce from farming, and work in innovation and technology. After hearing how they had triumphed over adversity, he praised their success stories and said they would serve to encourage others driven from their homes and forced to flee.

The refugees have benefitted from education, skills and business management training, supported by local partners and UNHCR. Emmanuel Hulem, fled war in the Central African Republic at 14, along with his family. As refugees in Congo, the family was extremely poor, with Emmanuel responsible for helping his younger siblings. Wanting to go to school to better his life, Emmanuel received help through the urban refugee program. Today he is an information technology specialist, who has won international awards for his innovations in the field.

Emmanuel said the support he received as a young refugee set the foundation for his future success.

“When I got my high school diploma I said to myself, I have made it,” he said. “I was motivated to continue on.”

The Democratic Republic of Congo hosts over 540,000 refugees while also having several million people internally displaced and over 700,000 Congolese living as refugees in neighbouring countries.

“This is a very hospitable country, with open borders, ready to take in people from neighboring countries that have been in trouble for decades” said Grandi. “But it is also a country that has it’s own problems, that has produced refugees, sometimes in the same countries from where refugees come here.”

The High Commissioner, who will be visiting Rwanda and Burundi on this trip, called the region “ a complex web of displacement.”",UNHCR chief meets urban refugees on Congo visit,https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/unhcr-chief-meets-urban-refugees-congo-visit

Multiple crises are spiraling out of control in Congo - in the central Kasai region and in the eastern Kivu and Ituri provinces - aggravated by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his elected mandate in 2016.

Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30 percent from a year ago, the United Nations said in a report earlier this month.

It has declared the crisis to be at Level 3, the world body’s highest-level emergency.

“We all believe that the humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day. It’s not business as usual,” said Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.

He spoke to Reuters during a trip to eastern Congo.

Concern over the deterioration of the situation in Congo, a country with a long history of war and humanitarian crises, has pushed the United Nations, the European Union and donor nations to organize a conference in Geneva next month.

They are seeking to raise $1.7 billion, nearly four times the amount secured last year, to support humanitarian activities in Congo.

But Congo this week disputed the U.N. assessment of the gravity of the crisis, which it said would discourage investment at a time when the government was attempting to stabilize the volatile economy.

“Activating the highest level of humanitarian emergency based on facts that are not real constitutes a hindrance to development,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

It added that, unless the humanitarian statistics were brought in line with the government’s own figures, it would not send representatives to the conference in Geneva.

Stylianides, who was touring Congo’s hard-hit North Kivu province on Sunday, was due to travel to the capital Kinshasa later in the day to attempt to convince the foreign and humanitarian affairs ministers to reverse the decision.

“We will try to persuade them that this is not good for DRC but above all for the vulnerable people in DRC,” he said.","Congo crisis worsening, EU says, as government shuns aid conference",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-eu/congo-crisis-worsening-eu-says-as-government-shuns-aid-conference-idUSKBN1H10PK

The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) has received a contribution of USD 9.3 million to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action (UN VTF) from the Government of Japan to undertake critical humanitarian mine action programming in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and South Sudan. Japan is one of the largest donors to the UN VTF providing over USD 132 million since 2010. In addition to its financial support, UNMAS benefits from the provision of Japanese in-kind personnel.

“The United Nations thanks the Government and People of Japan for their continued commitment to mine action,” stated Agnès Marcaillou, the Director of UNMAS. “Enduring conflicts, as we see in the Middle East and Africa where Japan is focusing its funding, have resulted in an unprecedented level of contamination by unexploded bombs, rockets and other ammunition. With Japanese support, UNMAS will continue to clear land and open roads allowing refugees and displaced people to return home and enable humanitarian actors to reach populations in need. This work will save lives and provide hope and opportunity for some of the poorest communities in the world.”

His Excellency Dr. Toshiya Hoshino, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations, said, “Humanitarian action cannot be undertaken without mine action. Nor can displaced people return home, or civilians live in safety and escape poverty. Mine action is, therefore, a prerequisite for sustainable development as well as for human security. Based on this idea, Japan has been placing assistance to mine action as one of its diplomatic priorities, and this year’s assistance is also in line with this firm commitment. As one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Mine Action, Japan expects this assistance will be used in an effective and coordinated manner. Japan will continue to play an active role in mine action in collaboration with the United Nations, the Member States, and civil society organizations to achieve our collective goal of creating a mine-free world.”

In these turbulent times, the needs of the humanitarian mine action sector are increasing as highlighted earlier this month when the United Nations launched the Portfolio for Mine Action Projects for 2018. The Portfolio shows the funding requirements increased by 29 per cent compared to 2017, to USD 661 million. With 27 per cent of the total secured, USD 483 million more is needed for clearance of explosive hazards, risk education, and support to victims and their communities.
