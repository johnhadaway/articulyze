0,russia,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.

Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation? Unsurprisingly, Russia isn’t saying.

But whatever Moscow’s intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival’s interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world’s calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.

“We’ve seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven’t seen since the ’80s,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn’t send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn’t be able to Skype his parents in the United States.

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.

The Russians “are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.

It’s not Moscow’s warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It’s Russia’s Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It’s a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America’s coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament’s publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment “designed for deep-sea tracking” and “connecting to top-secret communication cables.” The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, “collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network.” Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and “jam underwater sensors with a special system.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it’s stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn’t on.

Of the Yantar’s crew, he said: “I don’t think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they’re laying the groundwork for future operations.”

Members of Congress are wondering, too.

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, “The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.”

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow’s goal appears to be to “disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.”

The Yantar’s movements have previously raised eyebrows.

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It’s unknown what work it did while there.

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.

Undersea cables have been targets before.

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR’s submarine-launched nuclear capability.

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the “Sunni Triangle” northwest of Baghdad.

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.

“Say you’re operating a remote-controlled car and all of a sudden you can’t control it,” said Lujan, who was deputy commander of the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group at the base when the little-publicized outage lasted for two to three days. “That’s a big impact,” he said, describing how U.S. pilots had to fly the missions instead.",http://time.com/5223237/russia-targeting-undersea-internet-cables/

Russia expelled diplomats from 23 countries on Friday in retaliation against the West in a spy row, in the biggest wave of tit-for-tat expulsions in recent memory.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the heads of missions from 23 countries — almost all of them European Union member states — to tell them that some of their diplomats had to leave.

The diplomats from France, Canada, Germany, Australia and other countries were earlier seen arriving at the Russian Foreign Ministry in flagged official cars.

France, Germany, Canada and Poland each said that Russia was expelling four of their diplomats. Among the other countries that had similarly been told to pull their envoys were the Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland, Lithuania and Norway.

Thirteen Ukrainian diplomats should also leave Russia.

The moves came in retaliation for the coordinated expulsion of Russian diplomats by Britain and its allies over a nerve agent attack against former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Ms. Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.

“This is certainly not a surprise,” Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said through a spokeswoman, referring to Moscow’s expulsion of two of the country’s diplomats.

Mr. Blok called upon Russia to cooperate with the ongoing investigation into the attack by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also gave Britain a month to cut the number of diplomatic staff in Russia to the same number Russia has in Britain.

In Britain, the government called the latest developments “regrettable” but remained adamant that Russia was in the wrong.

“This doesn’t change the facts of the matter: the attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable,” a spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office said.

‘Diplomatic war’

Russia also said it reserved the right to respond to the recent expulsion of Russian diplomats by Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro.

In the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin presided over a meeting of the country’s Security Council which discussed the most recent retaliatory steps against Britain and its allies.

The Kremlin insisted it was not Russia that had started the diplomatic war with the West.

“Russia did not unleash any diplomatic war,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Russia never initiated any exchange of sanctions.”

On Thursday, Moscow had announced that it would expel 60 U.S. diplomats and close the U.S. consulate in Saint Petersburg after the expulsion of its own diplomats and the closure of one of its U.S. consulates.

In all, more than 150 Russian diplomats have been ordered out of the U.S., E.U. members, NATO countries and other nations which are accusing Russia of being involved in the Skripal poisoning.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow would respond with “tit-for-tat” measures, but they might “not only” be symmetrical.

In Washington, U.S. media showed footage of a Russian government plane on the tarmac at Dulles airport, apparently to begin ferrying the expelled Russians home.

But a State Department official told AFP that Russia has not been asked to cut the headcount at its mission and so it could apply to accredit new diplomats to its U.S. embassy to replace those leaving.

‘Get out of here’

On the streets in Saint Petersburg, passersby said they welcomed the decision to shut down the U.S. consulate general in the city.

“This is great news,” said Viktor Glushko, 60.

“It is about time. Relations will not get worse because they were never good and we will get by without them.”

Another man shouted, “Get out of here!” as he passed by the U.S. consulate where staff were seen loading plastic sacks into vehicles on Friday.

In Washington, the State Department said on Thursday there was no justification for the Russian move and that the United States “reserves the right to respond”.

“It’s clear from the list provided to us that the Russian Federation is not interested in a dialogue on issues that matter to our two countries,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said of the expelled diplomats.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Russia’s expulsion of U.S. diplomats marked a “further deterioration” in relations.

Yulia ‘improving rapidly’

The hospital where Mr. Skripal and his daughter are being treated said on Thursday that Yulia, 33, was “improving rapidly and is no longer in a critical condition”, while 66-year-old Mr. Skripal remained in a critical but stable condition.

Britain has said it is “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack using the Novichok nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union, but Russia has angrily denied any involvement.

Russia said 58 diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Moscow and two from the consulate in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg have to leave Russia by next Thursday.

The U.S. consulate general in Saint Petersburg will have to be vacated by Saturday.

Moscow warned that it could take further measures in response if Washington “continued hostile actions” against the Russian embassy and consulates.

After the poisoning, Britain reacted by announcing it would expel 23 Russian diplomats, suspend high-level diplomatic contact with Moscow and not send any members of the royal family to the 2018 football World Cup hosted by Russia.

Russia then responded by closing a British consulate in Saint Petersburg and the British Council educational and cultural organisation.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-expels-diplomats-from-23-countries-as-spy-crisis-escalates/article23397742.ece

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s new national security adviser John Bolton minces no words about whether he thinks his boss and Russian President Vladimir Putin can be friends.

In speeches, interviews and op-eds, Bolton has called Putin a liar who aligns himself with America’s enemies, and whose country is a long-term strategic threat to the United States.

Bolton said the Russian leader lied to Trump when they met last July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, and Putin denied interfering in the U.S. elections. Trump later said he believed Putin.

Here's how Bolton thinks the U.S. should deal with Putin's Russia:

Putin lied, taught Trump a useful lesson:

“Trump got to experience Putin looking him in the eyes and lying to him, denying Russian interference in the election,” Bolton wrote in an op-ed in The Telegraph last July, a few days after the G20 summit. “It should be a highly salutary lesson about the character of Russia’s leadership.”

“…And it should be a fire-bell-in-the-night warning about the value Moscow places on honesty, whether regarding election interference, nuclear proliferation, arms control or the Middle East: negotiate with today's Russia at your peril,” he added.

Russian meddling was an 'act of war':

“Attempting to undermine America’s constitution is far more than just a quotidian covert operation. It is in fact a casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate,” Bolton said.

Bolton spoke about Russian meddling again after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian citizens for setting up servers in the U.S. and facilities in St. Petersburg, Russia, to orchestrate an influence operation in the run-up to the election.

“This is a perfect time for President Trump to pivot to make it clear he’s not going to let Russia or any other country meddle in our elections,” Bolton said in a Feb. 21 speech at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security in Washington.

Bolton’s advice on how the U.S. respond was emblematic of his philosophy overall:

“We should respond in cyberspace and elsewhere. I don’t think the response should be proportionate. I think it should be very disproportionate. Because deterrence works when you tell your adversary that they will experience enormous cost when they impose costs on you. That’s causes them to say we’re not even going to think about it.”

On Trump’s desire to fight terrorism with Russia:

Last week, Trump defended his phone call congratulating Putin for his victory in an election that monitors said had been rigged. He said the U.S. and Russia should cooperate on terrorism, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

“The notion that the Russians can help us with terrorism I think is delusional,” Bolton said in his speech at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School.

Putin's air force provided decisive assistance to Syrian President Bashar Assad in his years-long civil war. In doing so, Russia entered into “an implicit alliance” with Assad's ally Iran, “the world’s most important financier of terrorism,” Bolton said.

U.S. policy in Syria should be more far-reaching than combatting Islamic State terrorist there, he said.

“The Middle East remains in grave trouble. It’s enormously complicated and America still doesn’t have a coherent strategy. We certainly don’t have a coherent post-(Islamic State) strategy for Russia, as well as Iran,” he said.

On Russia’s role in Ukraine, expanding NATO:

Bolton was an early proponent of arming Ukraine, so it could effectively counter Russia’s support for separatist militias that seized territory in the country’s east after Russia seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in early 2014.

“Washington should supply Kiev with weapons and other assistance, while also reviving President George W. Bush's 2008 plan to fast track Ukraine for NATO membership,"" Bolton wrote in August 2014 in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times.

The Obama administration maintained that arming Ukraine would provoke Russia to respond with more violence, because it fears Ukraine would eventually invite a NATO presence along the two countries' long shared border.

The Trump administration in December approved the sale of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, but Bolton signaled that Trump should go further. In his February speech, he said Russia was violating the system or rules created by the U.S. and Europe after the end of World War II to prevent countries from dominating others by force.

In Ukraine, “that’s what the Russians have accomplished, unanswered effectively so far,” Bolton said.

3,russia,"Russia has told Britain it must send home ""just over 50"" more of its diplomats in a worsening stand-off with the West over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.

Russia has already retaliated in kind against Britain and ejected 23 British diplomats over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. London says Moscow stood behind the attack, something Russia denies.

British Ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned again on Friday and told London had one month to cut its diplomatic contingent in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain.

On Saturday, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters that meant Britain would have to cut ""a little over 50"" of its diplomats in Russia.

""We asked for parity. The Brits have 50 diplomats more than the Russians,"" said Zakharova.

When asked if that meant London would have to bring home exactly 50 diplomats, she said: ""A little over 50.""

Ambassadors from more than 20 countries, including Australia's Peter Tesch, were called into the foreign ministry in Moscow to be told of the latest wave of retaliatory measures being imposed.

The move comes after the Russian embassy in London accused British authorities of ""another blatant provocation"", saying Border Force officers at Heathrow had searched an Aeroflot flight from Moscow.

An embassy official suggested that the jet, which had arrived on a scheduled return trip, had been searched in connection with the diplomatic crisis over the Salisbury spy poisoning.

Meanwhile, life is returning to normal in villages and settlements in Ghouta province. Displaced persons are returning to ""areas liberated from armed groups,"" General Rudskoy said, adding that ""some 40,000 people have returned to their homes.""

The returnees are receiving aid packages delivered by UN agencies and the Russian Reconciliation Center, he said, adding that the ""arrival of three UN aid convoys, carrying 445 tons of food, medicine and basic necessities, was ensured since the first humanitarian pause took effect in the enclave.""

Daily humanitarian pauses in eastern Ghouta began on February 27 as part of the Syrian military's and Russia's efforts to help civilians leave the combat zone. The Russian military has repeatedly said that the militants are using civilians as human shields, targeting those who are trying to flee the terrorist enclave.

5,russia,"By Patrick Williamson

When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it seemed clear that the bipolar world tolerated since 1945 was finally over. Looking back at such distant-seeming changes, it feels almost unbelievable that, over the past month, a new east-west rivalry has arisen. Even more surreal is that this rivalry involves not the US but the innocent-seeming United Kingdom. But we must be careful not to be hyperbolic. A new Cold War is not among us.

It isn’t difficult to be swept into the emerging anti-Russian hysteria. The threat, particularly to Russian exiles, certainly feels real. Two assassination attempts have been made on Russian exiles on British soil in the past month, both victims sharing sore histories with President Putin. One exile was strangled to death, another was poisoned by the nerve agent novichok, which disconnects the central nervous system from one’s vital organs.

The British government has pinned blame directly on the Russian state, Boris Johnson pointing fingers at Putin himself. A rather audacious remark, it could be said, but not one too far-fetched if one remembers the former-KGB spy’s lamentation of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the only state to have ever mastered the production of novichok (according to former Soviet scientists), as “the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century”.

Granted, both crime scenes do stink of Russian participation. Similar attacks in the past decade, from stabbings to the spiking of cups of tea with radioactive materials, have been suggested to have been plotted by the Kremlin.

No one seems safe from this new red peril. Traces of novichok have been found in locations as public as a Zizzi franchise. Fears of cyber-attacks have prompted round-the-clock threat assessments in financial firms. The threat is not just to Russians, but to the general public too. Not merely military, but also economic.

Frightening as this may be, though, impulsive finger-pointing is not only dangerous but insensible.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has correctly highlighted the British government’s less-than-perfect record of intelligence regarding chemical weapons. Though the Russian state seems like the obvious culprit, Corbyn’s noting of other “possibilities”, like Russian oligarchs or Mafia associations, is important in maintaining an open mind.

Diplomatic implications of blame-assignment must be seriously contemplated, too. The expulsion of 46 Russian and British diplomats and the closure of the British Council in Moscow have already weakened cultural and political bridges between Britain and Russia. The EU is right in its statement of taking any accusations against Russia “extremely seriously”. Britain must be careful to avoid false accusations and resultant embarrassment.

Such considerations have not stopped British and Russian statesmen from turning the attacks into bizarre moral debates, though.

Boris Johnson’s tactic has been to compare Russia’s upcoming World Cup to Hitler’s 1936 Olympics, citing both being used to “gloss over” despotic regimes. Though this comparison may evoke a cheap laugh, Britain should not pretend that their problem with Russia lies in is its corruption and authoritarianism. Britain’s participation in the 1936 Olympics, and their maintenance of cordial relations with other non-democracies like China and Saudi Arabia, gives ground to claims of hypocrisy.

Likewise, the behaviour of the Kremlin has publicised the Russian state not as imposing but immature. Warnings to Britain not to “threaten a nuclear power” seem more suited to a line from a Cold War thriller movie than an official statement from a supposed democracy. Not only this, but Russia forgets that Britain too, of course, possesses nuclear capacities.

Stories of foreign threats don’t just come from official government channels but mainstream media outlets, too. Claims such as one from the Sunday Express for example, that Russia is “behind bomb threats to UK schools”, should be taken with a generous pinch of salt.

Thankfully, a trip to practically any public place other than the location of the nerve agent attack demonstrates the public care little for exaggerated, symbolic debates. As they see rightly, the threat is real, but a new Cold War is far from materialising.

Russia singles out UK again

By Paul Adams, BBC News, Moscow

British diplomats left Moscow a week ago, but ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned back to the foreign ministry for additional punishment.

It's not immediately obvious what it means in practice, but it's clear that Russia sees Britain as the ringleader of an international conspiracy which resulted in the biggest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history.

Britain's ""provocative and unjustified actions"", the ministry said, had ""inspired the unfounded expulsion of Russian diplomats"".

It's a backhanded compliment to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has successfully corralled a wider international coalition than anyone would have thought possible a month ago.

Russia has railed against the British government over its efforts to internationalise what officials here call ""the so-called Skripal affair"". The solidarity expressed by so many countries has been dismissed as a result of financial and political pressure, orchestrated in tandem with the US.

Which other countries are involved?

Twenty-nine countries have expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato has also ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium.

The US expelled the largest single number - 60 diplomats - and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle.

Russia reciprocated on Thursday declaring 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". It also announced the closure of the US consulate in St Petersburg.

The US said it had been expecting the move and warned it may take further action.

On Friday, ambassadors from Albania, Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine were told to send home staff from their missions - corresponding to the same number of Russians their countries had expelled.

A statement by the Russian foreign ministry also said that Russia ""reserves the right to take retaliatory measures"" against Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro - countries that had joined the co-ordinated action against Russia ""at the last moment"".

What is Russia's argument?

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has blamed ""harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"".

He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen.

Russia, he said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"".

On Friday, in addition to the new Western expulsions, UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow was handed a protest note that said Britain's ""provocative actions"" had led to the decision by other governments to expel Russians.

It is not clear how many more British officials will have to leave. Before the expulsion of the 23 Russians, the UK's Foreign Office listed 60 Russian officials working in the UK.

Another four are posted at the Russian consulate general in Edinburgh.

UK National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill has said expulsions by Western countries are aimed at rooting out covert Russian intelligence networks.

What happened on the plane?

The Russian news agency Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying British ""police"" had boarded the jet once passengers had disembarked and had ""demanded"" the crew leave so that they could conduct a search.

The Russian embassy in London said later in a statement that British customs officers had boarded the plane and tried to search it ""without the crew being present"".

""After an Embassy officer arrived at the airport long negotiations were conducted that allowed to ensure the right of the captain to be take part in the search,"" it added.

Russia's foreign ministry called it ""the next provocation"" following the fallout from the Skripal affair.

There was no immediate official British comment on the Russian accusations but London's Metropolitan Police denied its officers had searched a plane arriving from Moscow.

The plane later left for Moscow, Interfax said.

What do we know about the nerve agent?

Britain says the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union known as Novichok.

OPCW has sent a team to the UK to investigate samples of the agent Britain says was used.

The results are expected to take a minimum of two weeks, the government says.

8,russia,"Moscow — Russia said on Wednesday it would respond in kind to the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats by the West over the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury.

What began as a row between London and Moscow after Britain accused Russia of using a nerve agent to poison Skripal and his daughter has now snowballed into an international chorus of rebukes for the Kremlin, with even some friendly governments ejecting Russian diplomats.

Adding to the list on Wednesday, Slovakia, Malta and Luxembourg each recalled their ambassador in Moscow for consultations, while Montenegro said it would expel a Russian diplomat. Slovakia and Montenegro, while both members of the US-led Nato alliance, are traditionally close to Russia.

The biggest demarche came from the US, which on Monday said it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats, denting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hopes of a friendly relationship with US President Donald Trump.

Valentina Matviyenko, a Kremlin loyalist and speaker of the upper house of parliament, said Russia would retaliate.

""Without a doubt, Russia, as is diplomatic practice, will respond symmetrically and observe parity when it comes to the number of diplomats [to be expelled],"" said Matviyenko.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said a Russian military aircraft had, for the first time since the Cold War, conducted a training flight via the North Pole to North America, RIA news agency reported. There was no indication the flight was linked to Russia’s stand-off with the West. The US navy is holding a training exercise in the Arctic Circle.

In total, more than 100 Russian diplomats are to be sent home from states ranging from Denmark to Australia, the biggest western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Moscow has denied being behind the poisoning of the Skripal pair and says its adversaries are merely using it to whip up a campaign of ""Russophobia"".

Skripal, 66, a double agent who was swapped in a spy exchange deal in 2010 and went to live in England, and Yulia Skripal, 33, were found unconscious on a public bench in a shopping centre in Salisbury on March 4. They remain critically ill in hospital from the attack in which, British authorities say, a Soviet-era nerve toxin called Novichok was used.

Russia has already expelled 23 British diplomats, a tit-for-tat response to Britain’s expulsion of the same number of staff at the Russian embassy in London.

Adding to a drum beat of tough rhetoric coming from Moscow and London, the Russian foreign ministry raised the prospect that British intelligence services had poisoned Skripal and his daughter.

""If convincing evidence to the contrary is not presented to the Russian side we will consider that we are dealing with an attempt on the lives of our citizens,"" the ministry said.

In Australia, whose government said on Tuesday it would expel two diplomats, Russian ambassador Grigory Loginov told reporters the world would enter into a ""Cold-War situation"" if the West persisted with its bias against Russia.

Two days after the US announced the expulsion of the Russian diplomats, there was still no sign of how exactly Russian planned to respond — an indication, perhaps, that the scale of the western diplomatic action had caught Moscow off guard.

The nuclear weapon called Sarmat will replace the current Soviet-era missile called Veovoda.

Russia's ministry of defense tweeted a video showing the ICBM taking off.

It's the second test of Sarmat. The first took place towards the end of last year.

The test was carried out at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, as spaceport in the west of Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled details of the missile in March. At the time, he said that the ICBM ""can reach any point in the world."" The ICBM was unveiled as part of a raft of defense measures during his annual State of the Union address earlier this month.

There are worries about the rising tension between some countries when it comes to nuclear weapons. North Korea has also been carrying out tests of its ICBM.

Russia's missile test comes at a time when it faces backlash from other major nations after Britain blamed the country for the poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal.

13,russia,"“I don’t remember such bad shape of our relations,” Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to Washington, told NBC’s “Today” show. “There is a great mistrust between the United States and Russia.”

Since his arrival last year in Washington, Mr. Antonov said he had invited American officials to his residence only to be repeatedly rebuffed. “If they are scared, I said, ‘Come on, we can meet in a restaurant and to discuss all outstanding issues,’” he said. “It was four or five months ago. And I got answer: silent.”

American officials said a shift in the administration’s approach has been building for weeks. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose last official day on the job is Saturday, had come to the conclusion before Mr. Trump fired him this month that a year of attempting to cooperate had not yielded much success, according to people familiar with his thinking. As a result, they said, Mr. Tillerson had begun mapping out a tougher policy toward Russia and found agreement in the White House.

The administration began taking a more robust approach, publicly blaming Russia for a devastating attack on computers in Ukraine and elsewhere, accusing Moscow of trying to break into the United States’ power grid and imposing sanctions in retaliation for Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States.

Mr. Tillerson’s feelings were hardened further by a conversation with Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary who described to him the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter living in Britain. Even in the hours before his dismissal by Mr. Trump, Mr. Tillerson spoke out in stronger terms than the president in condemning the poisoning.

While Mr. Tillerson is on the way out, his designated successor, Mike Pompeo, and the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, are both considered even more hawkish on Russia.

At the same time, some officials at the Pentagon have expressed caution about the escalating conflict with Russia, citing consequences in Syria, where the United States and Russia have both conducted military operations.

The Trump administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle this week as part of a wider international retaliation for the poisoning of Mr. Skripal. Russia responded Thursday by ordering out 60 Americans and closing the consulate in St. Petersburg. The scope of Russia’s retaliation grew clearer on Friday as the Kremlin summoned 23 ambassadors from other countries to evict some of their diplomats.

But Mr. Trump has remained publicly silent amid the dramatic rounds of diplomatic retaliation, leaving it to others to condemn Moscow. Frustrated by the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether his campaign cooperated with Russia in 2016, a scenario he dismissed as a “hoax,” Mr. Trump recently called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his victory in a re-election widely dismissed as a sham.

Mr. Trump made no mention of the poisoning of Mr. Skripal during the call but instead suggested that he wanted to schedule a summit meeting with the Russian president.

Both countries still have ambassadors in place, so high-level contact on potentially calamitous matters should continue, as it did at the height of the Cuban missile crisis. But the wheels of basic diplomacy, involving visas, consular services, cultural events and simply talking to people, are grinding ever more slowly and, in some cases, coming to a halt.

“The parties lose some of their eyes and ears, so the quality of the reporting goes down,” said Charles A. Kupchan, who was the Europe director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. “It’s not just intelligence but day-to-day political and economic reporting: What’s the buzz in the street, what do interlocutors say? And consular services do get hit.”

The expulsions left many diplomats wondering how the American Embassy in Moscow could operate. Much of the burden will fall on the ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who took over an embassy already struggling to function after an order by the Kremlin last summer that it dispense with 755 employees in response to sweeping American sanctions for Russia’s election meddling.



“The embassy is struggling to do basic operations. This latest round will hurt,” said Michael A. McFaul, who served as ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014. “Morale, of course, is also very low.”

Even before this week’s expulsions, the wait in Moscow to obtain a visitor’s visa to the United States was among the longest in the world. It now takes 250 days just to get an appointment with the visa section, compared with four in Beijing and 31 in New Delhi.

An American spokesman told Russian news media this week that the embassy had been placed under “significant constraints” by the Foreign Ministry and “could not accommodate all their many requests at all times, particularly for large groups.”

Simon Schuchat, a former diplomat at the embassy in the Moscow, recalled how haphazard and unnerving it was when Russia began the process of ousting alleged spies during a round of expulsions in 2001. Inevitably, Moscow ordered out diplomats unconnected to espionage.

“They tended to go for people with better language skills,” Mr. Schuchat said, adding that they “missed many spies and included many non-spies.”

This time around, intelligence officers working under “official cover” as diplomats were especially targeted, but some American officials played down the impact, saying the United States still came out ahead in the expulsions.

“That’s to our benefit,” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said at a seminar on Thursday in Austin, Tex. “There are a lot more Russians in America than Americans in Russia in the intelligence agencies.”

On Friday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused the agencies overseen by Mr. Coats of exploiting the situation by approaching Russian diplomats leaving the United States to offer “assistance” in exchange for “entering into covert relations” on behalf of the American government.

18,russia,"WHAT a difference six months makes!

At the beginning of October, Theresa May’s world seemed to be falling apart – quite literally in some ways as the set at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester collapsed around her.

Still reeling from her disastrous decision last year to go for a snap General Election, in which she lost her overall majority, she had just delivered what was widely described as the most calamitous conference speech in living memory, derailed by a prolonged coughing fit and a prankster handing her a P45.

Labour was performing strongly in the polls and there was talk amongst Conservatives of a palace coup to defenestrate Mrs May – much in the way as the party had ruthlessly dispatched our only previous female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in 1990.

Even as recently as the beginning of this year, an attempted reshuffle by the Prime Minister turned into a risible farce and Cabinet ministers before and since have been dropping like ninepins – Fallon, Patel, Greening and Green.

The consensus among the political pundits was that Mrs May was pretty much finished and the only question was who was going to take her place.

Well, it doesn’t look like that at all today. If not triumphant, Mrs May’s reputation is seriously enhanced after co-ordinating the strongest international action against Russian aggression since the Cold War ended.

The Prime Minister, and her Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have managed to stitch together an international coalition to deliver a strong rebuke to Russia in the wake of the nerve agent attack in Salisbury.

At the last count more than 140 Russian diplomats have been expelled and the UK has received resolute support from 24 countries across the world including the US, the EU, Nato and as far afield as Australia.

As the Prime Minister told the Cabinet, it constituted “an unprecedented series of expulsions that has demonstrated to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security”.

Some commentators suggested the UK would find itself isolated when we first expelled 23 Russian agents, but the opposite has in fact happened, and it is the Russians who have found themselves without support – except of course from among the ‘useful idiots’ of the extreme left, such as the leadership of the Labour Party.

Mrs May is not a natural campaigner, as was painfully demonstrated last year. She is stiff and formal with little in the way of natural warmth. She simply doesn’t do ‘touchy-feely’.

But it is in times of grave international crises like this that her qualities come to the fore – serious, resolute, in total command of her brief, spreading confidence with quiet efficiency.

Imagine for a moment that we had Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10 at the time of the Russian attack. Corbyn could hardly bring himself to utter a word of criticism about his ideological soul mates in the Kremlin, still less have the skill or inclination to rouse the international community to action.

Corbyn is too busy wallowing about in the filth of vile and racist Facebook groups to have much time for international diplomacy.

And on the other big issue of the moment – Brexit – Mrs May and her team of negotiators have made significant progress of securing the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU.

The EU side – probably prompted by increasing signs of concern from German industrialists – seem to have finally realised that if they succeed in wrecking a trade deal, it will hurt them far more than it will hurt us. The first signs of an outbreak of common sense in Brussels can only be welcomed.

So things are looking up for Mrs May, but it could all still go horribly wrong, particularly in the May local elections and the Brexit vote later this year, with kamikaze Tory Remoaners seemingly prepared to destroy their own government.

And there’s another factor. When former Premier Harold Macmillan was asked what Prime Ministers most feared, his reply was: “Events, dear boy, events.” After the Russian attack, who knows what is around the corner.

But all in all Mrs May is in a far better place than anyone could have imagined back in October – and that is a good thing for our country.",https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/bill-carmichael-theresa-may-s-leadership-qualities-to-the-fore-over-russia-crisis-1-9090146

""The shape of our relations are very bad. It seems to me that there is a lot of mistrust. Mistrust between our two countries.""

20,russia,"A crisis erupted this week as Russian diplomats were ejected from European countries and the U.S., and Western diplomats were ejected by Russia. The punitive measures were sparked by outrage in the West over alleged Russian involvement in the attempted murder in Britain of a Russian double agent and his daughter.

That’s led some analysts – in Russia and in the West – to describe current Russian relations with the West as a new manifestation of the old Cold War.

Since 2010, President Vladimir Putin’s increasing reliance on a strategy of meddling in the domestic politics of the United States and European Union member states has heightened tensions and stoked fears of a crisis.

But the Cold War metaphor does not apply to today’s international system. My own understanding of the nature and implications of this conflict is based on my work on the evolution of Russian state-society relations between 1990 and 2018.

The “Cold War” refers to the state of permanent crisis that marked the nuclear standoff between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union and its allies following World War II.

In contrast to that post-War period, relations between Russia and the West since 1991 are not shaped by ideology. They’re shaped by a clash in economic interests, security issues and Russia’s domestic political concerns.

Turning outward, then inward

In the 1990s, Russia’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, won popular legitimacy by engaging with the international community, especially the United States. In contrast, after 2000, his successor, Vladimir Putin, based his legitimacy on restoring domestic stability.

Yet, by 2011, large-scale protest following a fraudulent election demonstrated that the Kremlin needed a new strategy to maintain power. I argued then that President Putin, plagued by declining oil prices and the inability to modernize the economy, manufactured international enemies to win popular support and create a renewed sense of national pride.

Reuters

President Putin’s current international strategy reflects his domestic goals. The Kremlin creates new alliances with like-minded rulers who hold absolute power like Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey and Bashar Assad in Syria, using tactics such as social media control and the spread of propaganda to shape social support. It is a foreign policy based on aggressive disruption and disinformation.

Putin’s goal is to sow social conflict and political divisions within democratic countries. He aims to diminish democracy as a model for Russian opposition.

Meeting Putin’s challenge

In this context, the unified Western response to the nerve gas attack on the double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, is a sign that Western states now understand the costs of Russia’s foreign policy strategy.

The attack was not intended to start an international incident – it was meant for an internal audience. Since taking office, Putin has used arbitrary prosecution and assassination to intimidate potential adversaries. The most prominent illustration is Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Yeltsin-era oligarch, who was arrested and jailed for mixing economic success with political ambition.

In the world of espionage, there are many Sergei Skripals, members of the security services living abroad who could leak damaging information. To ensure that they do not, the Russians sent a strong message, signaled by the use of a Russian proprietary nerve agent, to show that it can silence anyone, anywhere. I believe this episode was meant to be a private missive, delivered in public to ensure receipt.

The bungled political assassination crossed a bright line in international politics. The chemical weapon not only gravely injured the spy but also his daughter, breaking the rules that usually govern Russian retribution.

More than 100 British citizens were exposed to the toxin, and one young policeman was severely injured. Theresa May refers to it as “the Salisbury incident,” highlighting the violation on British soil.

Until this point, President Putin, or perhaps more correctly, his proxies, had gotten away with intervention in the Brexit vote and French and U.S. elections. Sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea did not deter Russian intervention in Ukraine, either.

Aggression that went too far

The Skripal attack led the British government, working with allies, to confront the Russian narrative of Western aggression and conflict escalation that has stymied international reprisals to similar actions.

The expulsion of staff and the closing of the U.S. Consulate in Seattle imposes significant costs on the Kremlin. It demonstrates a willingness by Western states to absorb the costs of Russian retaliation. These actions constitute a measured and contained response to violations of international law.

Rather than focus on the risk of increasing Putin’s support at home, the coordinated response is focused on clarifying the rules of international engagement.

While the Western allies claim that diplomatic expulsions by 27 countries is the largest in history, it was not as large as it could have been. The Western response does not target the diplomatic core that could provide the basis for cooperation. It is carefully aimed at known intelligence officers.

Taken outside of formal channels such as the United Nations, the coordinated expulsion also pre-empts a second common Russian tactic: the manipulation of formal international agencies to render them ineffective in punishing Russia or its proxies.

While Russian officials continue to declare their outrage in the face of accusations and step up their own Cold War rhetoric, the regime’s response was also measured.

Russia opted to close the United States’ Consulate in St. Petersburg and the Russian branch of the British Council, which is the U.K.‘s cultural and educational organization that operates in countries around the world. The United States and United Kingdom quickly announced that they will not take retaliatory actions. French President Emmanuel Macron, who joined the coordinated action, announced that he will still visit Russia in May.

US approach in flux

It is unclear if this episode signals U.S. resolve to reestablish international norms and place limits on Russian intervention.

United States support for multilateral action came at a time when the State Department is in transition and the national security team is in flux. The timing of the action suggests that while it may reflect John Bolton’s advice to take a stronger line against Russia, this measured policy was designed by outgoing national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.

In the same period, Trump remained inconsistent on Russia. He announced the U.S. response to the Salisbury incident. But, he also defied his advisers and congratulated President Putin on his victory in an election that was likely fraudulent.

Yet, if this coordination is the beginning of a consistent strategic approach to Russian aggression, it marks an important step in decreasing global uncertainty about what moves Russia will take next.

Left unchecked, Putin will continue to create chaos to cement support at home. But faced with real costs in response to its actions, the risk-averse Russian leadership may be willing to change course again and re-engage with the West in order to focus on its economic and political challenges at home.

Coordinated response will not start a new Cold War between Russia and the West. It will restore guidelines and common expectations about future behavior in a more complex international system than existed during the Cold War.",http://theconversation.com/is-the-growing-russia-crisis-another-cold-war-conflict-nyet-94093
21,russia,"DAMASCUS (Sputnik) - Lawmakers from Russia along with their Syrian counterparts took part in a humanitarian action providing the residents of the crisis-torn Syrian area of Eastern Ghouta with food, a Sputnik correspondent reported.

The correspondent said Saturday that the action took place during the visit of the lawmakers to the displaced persons camp near Damascus.

The lawmakers gave food packages to the residents of the Harjal camp, sheltering people from the Kafr Batna and Duma towns located in Eastern Ghouta.

Syria has been in a state of civil war since 2011, with government forces fighting against numerous opposition groups and terrorist organizations.

The situation in Eastern Ghouta has been tense over the past weeks, resulting in ongoing shelling by local militants on Damascus and fire from the Syrian pro-government forces.

22,russia,"Moscow, Russia - On Sunday evening, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani arrived in Moscow for a short work visit. On Monday he is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the wars in Syria and Yemen and the situation in Palestine.

The work visit comes amid a massive evacuation of civilians and fighters from Eastern Ghouta near the Syrian capital Damascus after Russia negotiated with rebel groups to leave the area for opposition-controlled Idlib province.

According to Dmitriy Frolovsky, a Moscow-based analyst, Putin and Sheikh Tamim will discuss Russia's position on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Qatari support for the opposition, and the possible participation of Qatar in post-conflict reconstruction of Syria.

""There is going to be division of Syria and obviously the most powerful parties in Syria will be Russia and the United States. Qatar for various reasons will try to maintain stable contacts with both of the parties,"" Frolovsky said.

In late January, a Russian-sponsored peace conference in Sochi failed to bring together the Syrian regime and opposition for talks. Shortly after, forces loyal to Assad backed by Russian air support launched an operation against rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.

According to Frolovsky, after the regime takes full control of the Damascus suburbs another military operation against rebel-held Idlib province is likely.

Тhe Sheikh Tamim's visit was preceded by phone calls between Putin and Abu Dhabi Prince Mohammed bin Zayed in early March and Saudi King Salman in February. In October last year the Saudi king paid a three-day visit to Moscow.

""It's not only the [Gulf] crisis that boosted the relations [with Gulf countries] but also the general Russian presence in the region which has been augmenting since Putin took part in the Syrian crisis,"" Frolovsky said.

Russia has assumed a neutral stance on the Gulf crisis but it did offer to help Qatar with food shipments last year, he added.

A delegation of Qatari ministers of finance, foreign relations, energy, and culture, along with a number of other officials, accompanied Sheikh Tamim.

On the sidelines of official meetings, Qatar Petroleum and state-controlled Russian oil company Rosneft are expected to discuss possible contracts, and Qatar Airways will also sign a cooperation agreement with Rosaviatsia, Russia's federal air transport agency.

Five days before his visit to Moscow, Sheikh Tamim met Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Qatar where they discussed the possible export of Qatari liquified gas to Ukraine.

Since the fall out with Moscow over the annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbass region, Kiev has been trying to decrease its dependence on Russian oil and gas imports.

Sheikh Tamim's next foreign trip is expected to be in April to the United States where he will meet US President Donald Trump.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/qatari-emir-russia-discuss-syrian-crisis-180325195253621.html
23,russia,"Russia’s idea for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from a besieged Damascus suburb is “a joke,” the U.S. State Department’s spokeswoman said Thursday.

“What needs to happen instead is a nationwide cease-fire that was voted upon unanimously at the United Nations last Saturday,” Heather Nauert told reporters. “Fifteen countries supported it, let me remind you. So did Russia.”

The 30-day cease-fire in eastern Ghouta approved by the Security Council was “clearly not working,” Nauert said. “They are continuing to kill innocent civilians. We have seen more than 100 people die since Saturday alone.”

She said “Russia’s responsible for this in part because they continue to train and equip and work with the Syrian government,” adding “we’ve been watching that very carefully. It’s a tremendous concern of the U.S. government.”

Washington is calling on the Russians to pressure the Syrians to restrain themselves and de-escalate the fighting, not just in eastern Ghouta but everywhere.

Russia unilaterally announced Monday a daily five-hour pause in fighting in rebel-held eastern Ghouta so civilians can leave through a humanitarian corridor.

But no one has taken advantage of the daily lull so far, not trusting the Russians or the Syrians, and no aid has gone in.

Jan Egeland, the U.N. humanitarian aid chief for Syria, called the Russian plan “positive” but “insufficient.”

“I know of no humanitarian actor ... who thinks that five hours is enough for us to be able to deliver relief into eastern Ghouta and to organize orderly medical evacuations out,” he said.

UN ‘determined’

Also Thursday, U.N. envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said in Geneva that the United Nations “has not and will not” give up in demanding implementation of a 30-day cease-fire across Syria.

“We don’t have and we cannot afford to have the luxury of giving up, so any type of feeling that the U.N. is frustrated, forget it. We are not frustrated, we are determined,” he said.

Nearly 600 people have died and more than 1,000 have been wounded since the Syrian military launched an operation to retake eastern Ghouta from the rebels more than two weeks ago.

Rockets fired from the suburb into Damascus have reportedly killed 15 and injured more than 200.

Raed Saleh, head of the rescue group known as the Syrian White Helmets, said Thursday in Washington that many Syrians believe the world has “abandoned and failed” them.

He called U.N. Security Council resolutions worthless and said Russia was responsible for what was going on.

24,russia,"A military hotline still operates to avoid clashes between American and Russian forces in Syria, but as tensions rose last week, António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, suggested it was time to revive the Cold War channels of communication and control. “Those mechanisms have been dismantled,” he said. “I do believe that mechanisms of this sort are necessary again.”

Post-Communist Russia is not the obvious enemy the Soviet Union was. Throughout Russia’s slow slide into authoritarianism, there has lingered a hope that relations with Moscow can be reset, as Hillary Clinton sought to do and as President Trump seems eager to do. And while Mr. Putin’s drive to restore Russian influence and might — witness his proud unveiling of an intercontinental missile in March that “can reach any point in the world” — is an echo of Soviet behavior, Russia has also undergone a considerable transformation since 1991. Russians travel widely and have nearly unlimited access to information and technology, and the Soviet command economy has given way to far greater consumerism.

More significantly, there is no Western consensus on Russia of the sort that held against the Soviet Union. European politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary or Czech President Milos Zeman are open admirers of Mr. Putin, and President Trump’s relations with the Kremlin are a major question mark. Though the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle, Mr. Trump made no comment on the crisis, either when he called Mr. Putin last week to congratulate him on his re-election or since.

All that makes the current confrontation less predictable than the showdowns of the Soviet past. Both Britain and the United States have left open further actions against Russia, to which Moscow would inevitably respond, and the deterioration in relations could affect efforts to find common ground on Syria or Islamist terrorism.

That, however, is not an argument for looking the other way when Russia violates the most elemental norms of international behavior. Russia is not the old Soviet Union, which makes it all the more imperative for the West to send a clear message that the old wiles and subterfuges also belong in the dustbin of history.

The former K.G.B. agent in Mr. Putin may find it intolerable that a turncoat is living comfortably in Britain, but it must be made clear to him that the West will unite in fury — yes, including Mr. Trump’s America — when Russia’s most fearsome weapons are deployed in a peaceful English town.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/opinion/a-colder-war-with-russia.html

26,russia,"Col. Gen. Sergey Rudskoy, Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the Russian General Staff, commented on the situation in Raqqa, Syria and Eastern Ghouta.

The Situation in Raqqa

The native Arab population began an uprising against US-controlled units in the suburbs of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Chief of the General Staff Sergei Rudskoy said.

“The command of the Syrian Democratic Forces and local governments, appointed by the Americans, do not cope with the need to resolve humanitarian problems. The native Arab population is subjected to repression and punishment, forced mobilization is being carried out. This causes sharp discontent among local residents,” he said.

The infrastructure of Raqqa, Syria, where nearly 95 thousand people have returned, is completely destroyed, according Sergei Rudskoy.

“According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a disastrous humanitarian crisis has developed in Raqqa,” Rudskoy said.

He noted that because the water main isn’t working, there are serious problems with water supplies. Water is often taken directly from the Euphrates, which increases the threat of the spread of infections and epidemics.

Raqqa was taken over by the terrorist group Daesh* in 2013, which went on to declare it the capital of their self-proclaimed caliphate in 2014. In late 2016, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the support of the US-led coalition, started an operation aimed at freeing the city from the militants’ grasp. In October 2017, the SDF announced the full liberation of the city, which was later confirmed by the US-led coalition.

Situation in Eastern Ghouta

More than 44,000 people left the suburban Damascus region of Eastern Ghouta through the humanitarian corridors, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy said.

“Today one can say that the situation in Eastern Ghouta has radically changed. Right now you are witnessing a humanitarian operation on a unique scale. Today alone, 26,610 civilians have left [Eastern Ghouta] through the humanitarian corridor, while the total number of people, who’ve left Eastern Ghouta has reached 44,639,” Rudskoy said.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the United Nations confirmed the withdrawal of refugees from Eastern Ghouta, carried out in line with international law.

There have been no military actions in Syria’s Eastern Ghouta region in the past seven days; most of the region is controlled by Damascus, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy stated.

“The Russian Reconciliation Center and Syrian authorities are carrying out an unprecedentedly large-scale humanitarian operation in the suburban Damascus region of Eastern Ghouta,” the official added.

The situation in Eastern Ghouta has been tense over the past months, with militants in the region and Syrian pro-government forces exchanging constant fire. The Syrian government says it opens fire in response to shelling from Eastern Ghouta, but Western countries are accusing the Syrian government and Russia of being responsible for the intensification of tensions in the area.

On February 24, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2401 that urges all parties to the conflict in Syria to immediately stop fighting and adhere to a humanitarian pause for at least 30 days across the whole of Syria.

Militants in Syria Continue Provocations

Militants in Syria are further attempting to carry out provocations with the use of chemical weapons in order to blame Damascus for chemical attacks on civilians, Sergei Rudskoy said Saturday.

“I want to draw your attention to the ongoing attempts of the militants to carry out provocations with the use of poisoning substances to accuse government troops of using chemical weapons against the local population,” Rudskoy said.

He added that the US instructors had prepared several groups of militants at a camp near the city of al Tanf to carry out provocations with the use of chemical weapons. According to Rudskoy, the toxic agents have been delivered to southern Syria under the guise of a humanitarian aid convoy.

He added that 20 containers with chlorine were delivered to settlements located 25 kilometers (15 miles) to northwest of Idlib, with Nusra Front* terrorists preparing an attack in the area.

Rudskoy noted that the provocations were also aimed at creating a pretext for US strikes against the Syrian government.",https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/people-of-raqqa-start-uprising-against-us-backed-groups-russian-mod/
