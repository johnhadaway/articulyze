Miami Herald: Trump didn’t want to give Haiti $11 million for cholera. So Congress found another way

“Included in the $1.3 trillion spending package that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump on Friday is $10 million to help Haiti fight cholera. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who unsuccessfully tried to get the Trump administration last year to turn over $11 million in unspent Haiti peacekeeping money to the United Nations’ cholera plan, led the charge on getting the appropriation for small, locally based projects in communities severely impacted by the deadly waterborne epidemic. … Tim Rieser, Leahy’s foreign policy aide, said the funds are being drawn from the balance of unused emergency funds for the Ebola crisis, which has several hundred million dollars left over…” (Charles, 3/23).",U.S. FY18 Omnibus Spending Bill Includes $10M To Help Haiti Address Cholera,https://www.kff.org/news-summary/u-s-fy18-omnibus-spending-bill-includes-10m-to-help-haiti-address-cholera/

LIFE-CHANGING SUPPORT

The US-based not-for-profit organisation provides life-changing educational support to children in Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, which prompted a widespread humanitarian crisis due to huge losses of life and displacement among the country’s population.

Haiti’s plight was further drawn into focus following the impact of hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey last year, which battered parts of the US and Caribbean.

In response, Women in Travel Retail (WiTR) has committed to raising €15,000 ($18,480) to procure musical instruments for school children in the country.

The inaugural Travel Retail Awards takes place on Monday 7 May at the Singapore Conrad hotel during the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition and Conference.

The funding will also facilitate the introduction of Lycée Jean-Baptiste Pointe du Sable’s (LJBPS) first extra-curricular instrumental music programme in partnership with École de Musique Christian Nohel de Saint Marc.

Due to the collective efforts of the travel retail industry, the Lycée Jean-Baptiste Pointe du Sable opened in 2011 where it welcomed 152 children to Haiti’s first free, earthquake-resistant, sustainable school of excellence. As of September, 386 children were enrolled from Nursery to 6th grade.

A soon-to-be built secondary school will increase capacity to 720 children, but continued support is needed to raise funds for this vital cause.

Five minutes with… Sarah Branquinho, Chair, WiTR

Update TRBusiness on WiTR’s current activities to help educational dreams become reality for the schoolchildren of Haiti?

Hand in Hand for Haiti was the first charity that WiTR ever supported and in response to the terrible hurricanes that hit the Caribbean last year we all felt that we should support a charity in the region.

With HiHH we know that all the funds raised will go directly to the school and we agreed to fund this specific project – the purchase of musical instruments. The benefits of music education are astounding and studies have consistently exposed the tremendously positive effect music education has on a child’s academic performance, sense of community, self-expression and self-esteem.

But for nearly all children across Haiti, formal music education is unattainable. Music will give children the confidence to perform in school and in their local community and will help to build their self-confidence.

The two big fund-raising opportunities are the Travel Retail Awards dinner and TFWA World Exhibition, where WiTR traditionally raises funds for its annual charity.

As you know, WiTR is becoming a membership organisation with fantastic benefits to women across the industry who join. Any surplus income from the membership fees will also go to Hand in Hand for Haiti.

How is the Travel Retail Awards’ platform important in raising support for the Hand in Hand for Haiti cause?

The Travel Retail Awards dinner is the first major industry event since WiTR announced its chosen charity for 2018, so it’s the first time we will have had the opportunity to talk about the charity to such a wide international audience – and a captive one.

A donation from every table/seat booked goes towards Hand in Hand for Haiti, but how else can travel retail help?

At the dinner there will be a raffle to raise additional funds and any donations are welcome. Later in the year at TFWA World Exhibition in Cannes, WiTR will be running its hugely popular draw to raise further funds – we are always delighted to receive product for the draw prizes and the silent auction.

Haiti - USA : Trump approves a Congressional Law that includes $10M for Haiti





In the current political climate, Democrats and Republicans don't often agree on much, but in a rare act of bipartisanship, Congress has passed an omnibus package that rejected many of the White House's harsh budget cuts. The legislation, signed by President Donald Trump before lawmakers left Washington for a two-week recess, included $10 million to help Haiti combat cholera.



During the appropriations process, 36 House lawmakers, led by Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson (FL-24), sent letters to the chairs and ranking members of the State, Foreign Operations committees in both chambers, urging them to authorize $11.7 million in the FY 2018 omnibus funding bill for this purpose. Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and New York Congresswoman Nita Lowey (NY-17), ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, have long championed this issue.



""To allow Haiti, which has had to deal with more than its fair share of natural disasters, to continue to struggle under the weight of a human-made crisis is both inhumane and anathema to our American values. I am extremely pleased that Democrats and Republicans were able to join forces and do the right thing. It is my sincere hope that other nations will follow our example,"" said Congresswoman Wilson (FL-24).



""As a long-time friend of Haiti, I have been profoundly disappointed by the international community's failure to respond appropriately to the cholera epidemic, which was introduced into Haiti by United Nations peacekeepers. I strongly supported the inclusion of funds in the Omnibus Appropriations Act to stop the spread of this devastating disease in Haiti,"" said Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA-43), who co-chairs the Congressional Caribbean Caucus.



""The people of Haiti have faced enormous challenges over the past eight years that are not of their making, and we should do everything in our power to help them rebuild and recover,"" said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09). ""I'm pleased to see this Congress include funding to help Haitians recover from the cholera outbreak and stop the spread of this disease.""



""The United States should devote the resources necessary to end the cholera epidemic in Haiti and address the needless and preventable suffering. I'm pleased that Congress included funding to help Haitians recover from the cholera outbreak and stop the spread of this disease,"" said Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-22).



""It's critical that we continue to fund effective public health interventions to vigorously address the prevalence of cholera throughout Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean,"" said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""There are immediate and long-term solutions to control cholera, and we must mobilize and remain vigilant in our efforts to support economic development, universal access to clean drinking water, and proper sanitation throughout the region to curb the rising incidence of infection and death from this treatable disease.""



""I am proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to help fight cholera in Haiti. A cholera outbreak has killed 10,000 and infected hundreds of thousands of Haitians, and we cannot sit idly by. We stand in solidarity with our Haitian-American community in Philadelphia and their worldwide diaspora. We have a humanitarian duty to stand with them and support the multinational effort to eradicate cholera in Haiti because it is a matter of conscience,"" said Congressman Dwight Evans (PA-02).



""I have long championed the cause of the Haitian Diaspora and those who remain in Haiti as they face mounting challenges in creating a stable and productive democracy,"" said Congressman Alcee L. Hastings (FL-20). ""I was happy to join my colleagues in our effort to ensure that Haiti received much-needed funding in its fight against the cholera epidemic that has been devastating the country for nearly a decade. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of the Haitian Diaspora and assisting those in Haiti, as we all work to strengthen the country's democratic institutions and address the effects of the many natural disasters Haiti has had to confront over the years.""



""As a former member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, I have fought for years to help Haiti recover from the 2010 earthquake, countless devastating hurricane seasons, and multiple public health crises. I am very pleased that Congress was able to work in a bipartisan way to pass this critical funding to fight the ongoing cholera crisis. The U.S. contributions to this U.N. fund are essential to giving Haiti the aid necessary to rebuild and recover,"" said Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13).



""America cannot turn its back on those suffering through the humanitarian crisis and cholera epidemic that the Haitian people have had to confront. As an appropriator, I'm extremely proud that I was able to team with Congressional Democrats, especially Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Frederica Wilson, who fought to secure this vital funding over the refusal of the Trump Administration to address this public health threat,"" said Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23).

3,haiti,"Editor’s note: Gimme 5 is a five-question interview on a topic of local interest.

Who: Bonni Knight, Education director of the English in Mind Institute in Haiti.

Talks about: Celebrate Haiti Benefit Dinner.

When: 5:30 p.m. Thursday.

Where: Forage, 930 Galloway St., Building 13, Suite 212.

Cost: $30. Tickets are limited to 72.

Information: englishinmind.org.

Can you give us some background on the fundraiser?

I have been volunteering in Haiti at an adult English school for 5½ years. I go twice a year.

We help students find jobs afterwards using their English. The school is funded by various international donations to a group called Friends of English in Mind Institute.

I’m also doing six pop-up coffee shops that day: The Local Store at Volume One, SHIFT Cyclery and Coffee Bar, Starr’s Sister, Ambient Inks, The Plus and Forage will be selling Haitian coffee to benefit Haiti.

I heard Wyclef Jean was coming to Eau Claire, a famous Haitian musician. He’s doing a concert at the Metro that night.

It occurred to me that if we are going to have this famous Haitian musician in town, it would work out to tie in a couple other things around him.

Which nonprofit will the dinner benefit?

Friends of EIM, which funds the adult English school in Haiti.

Why choose this cause?

There are several reasons. The main one is that aid organizations of the world have failed Haiti.

They had a terrible earthquake, and a lot of well-meaning organizations threw a lot of money in the direction of Haiti that never actually made it to Haiti.

One of the most effective, efficient ways to reduce poverty is through adult education.

If you teach an adult a very employable skill like English in Haiti, then the adults can send their own children to school.

What do you hope people take away from the fundraiser?

Definitely a sense of having been part of something really valuable.

I believe with my whole heart that Haitians, they are not beggars. They just want a chance at life.

By doing this, people are really helping Haitians.

I also hope they have a really delicious dinner.

I brought back recipes I learned at the side of the Haitian cook at the compound where we stay (in Haiti).

Also, we’ll have a really great DJ at the dinner.

He’s going to play a lot of fun Caribbean tunes for us, so I think (attendees) will have fun.

What’s on the menu?

It’s a typical Haitian menu. The appetizer is a historic pumpkin soup with a great history. Haiti was the first slave nation in the world to revolt successfully against their slave owners. They used to be forced to make pumpkin soup for the masters, but couldn’t eat any themselves. It’s their liberation dish.

Then we’re having citrus-soaked chicken legs, which is really traditional, and a creole rice and beans, plus a spicy coleslaw called pikliz.

There aren’t a lot of dessert recipes in Haiti because not a lot of people have money for dessert, so we just borrowed from two of their historic crops: chocolate and coffee. We’re having an espresso cupcake with a mocha cream frosting.

4,haiti,"In 1974, West Germany played host to the memorable World Cup of Johan Cruyff and Franz Beckenbauer. However, there were other heroes that year; men from a small Caribbean nation who briefly stole the hearts of a watching world.

Haiti, a territory that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic to its east, became only the second country from their small corner of the globe to feature in football's summer festival.

""It was extraordinary"", Haitian defender Serge Racine, who was part of the squad which travelled to Munich in 1974, explained. ""There were people who didn't know Haiti existed; people were asking us where Haiti was.""

But those 22 men who made the almost 5,000-mile trip to Europe 44 years ago left a lasting impression on German soil and went some way towards putting their small island on the map.

Although Les Grenadiers did not claim a single point in the tournament, they left West Germany with pride and adoration, partly due to the day XI amateur footballers shocked Italy's Dino Zoff. The Azzurri goalkeeper had not conceded a goal in 12 international games heading into the opening tie of the competition and had also been part of a Juventus defence who went 903 minutes unchallenged. But all that was quickly about to change.

""The crowd helped us a lot because we were adopted by the German fans"", Racine reminisced. ""When we played against Italy, there were 70,000 there, and every time we touched the ball, there would be cheering.""

However, nobody watching on inside Munich's Olympiastadion could have foreseen what was to come, as 20 minutes in, Emmanuel Sanon, the only man in Haitian history to this day to score at a World Cup, rounded Zoff to give the 1973 CONCACAF Championship-winning side a shock lead.

Emmanuel Sanson is the only Haitian player to have scored at a World Cup during their one and only appearance at the tournament in 1974 #haiti #zoff pic.twitter.com/Zf8OOZuuBq — 𝕱𝖑𝖔𝖗𝖎𝖆𝖓 (@thecold_blooded) November 8, 2017

""Italy had Zoff who had that incredible record"", Philippe Vorbe, who provided the assist for the goal, said. ""Once I got the ball at my feet I looked up, and I saw Sanon, who was in space because there was only one defender. Sanon was one-on-one with Zoff, and we were all transfixed wondering what he would do. Would he shoot? Would he try to go around him?

""He dropped a shoulder, he took Zoff out of the game, and he scored. This was really the most beautiful joy of our careers, even of our lives; to score against Italy. It was so fantastic.""

Azzurri came back to win 3-1, but the amateurs from Haiti had provided a moment they or indeed the footballing world would never forget.

""The Footballers of Haiti, who came from the Caribbean for this World Cup knowing that at best they would be patronised, at worst dismissed as imposters, gave the competition one of its genuinely electric moments here tonight when they took the lead against Italy – by beating Dino Zoff, a goalkeeper who had not conceded a goal in an international match since September 1972"", The Guardian read that evening.

However, the overwhelming pride, spirit and sensation that had been instilled into Haiti following their performance against Italy quickly diminished when facing Poland during their second group match, with the Eastern Europeans steamrolling the Haitians 7-0.

""It was as different as day is tonight in comparison to the performance against Italy"", Vorbe, known today as his nation's most complete midfielder in its history, recalled. ""We were literally destroyed by Poland. We lost 7-0, and I think it could have been more.

""It was a sad thing to happen. It was a sad thing for the World Cup, with so much sympathy for Haiti.""

Despite losing their final group game to Argentina, which brought an end to the World Cup journey, the squad who had made the trans-Atlantic trip to West Germany to represent an unknown nation were happier, as again there was something to celebrate.

Sanon found possession 30 yards from goal before unleashing a thunderbolt through a crowd of Argentine players and finding the top right-hand corner of the net. The striker had restored levels of unrivalled joy, and had Cruyff or Beckenbauer not graced the tournament, it could have been held as one of the 1974 World Cup's most spectacular moments.

""It was a really beautiful goal"", Vorbe said. ""We ended up with two superb goals scored with honour.""

And despite going down 4-1 to Argentina, rounding off the tournament with three defeats from the same number of outings, it was Sanon's duo of sensational strikes that allowed Haiti to escape heading home bottom in the tournament's rankings.

""We managed not to finish last in that World Cup because we scored two goals"", Vorbe explained. ""Bulgaria and Zaire didn't manage to score, so in FIFA's classification Haiti came out as 14th out of the 16 teams. We were very happy with our World Cup.""

Today, the squad of '74 remain men of history in Haiti as their only national side to have ever qualified for a World Cup.

""We have a lot of respect for the team of 1974"", Haiti international and former Paris Saint-Germain forward Jean-Eudes Maurice said. ""They put Haitian football on the world map. Now we're desperate to carry on and go as far as possible, and hopefully, there will be another generation like that.""

5,haiti,"On a sunny Saturday afternoon in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood, tropical music fills the air as two friends sip from a freshly cut coconut outside the Caribbean Marketplace.

Nearby, two men are savoring grilled meat and Jamaican patties with rice and peas. Farther down the sidewalk, on the weekly market day, a group of girls and women in vibrant, traditional Creole dresses, practices dance moves.

Despite the festive atmosphere, Haitians worry about the impact of gentrification on the area. Some are hoping to see the market operate seven days a week, as an economic lifeline and way to bond culturally. Little Haiti, considered the “cultural heart of the Haitian diaspora” in the United States, was established by Haitian refugees - many of whom arrived on boats in the 1980s.

“Because of gentrification - it’s the only thing that we have so we’re trying to keep this going, said Hoppy Duroseau, a Little Haiti resident involved with marketing and promotions for the Caribbean Marketplace on social media. Born in St. Louis du Nord, Haiti, Duroseau immigrated to the United States at age four.

“We want to keep it busy all the time because if not - then we’ll lose this place and we’ll no longer have Little Haiti. Little Haiti is the only one in the world. So we need to keep this.”

Gentrification effort

The vibrant neighborhood full of art galleries, Haitian-owned businesses and restaurants has undergone a gentrification effort that sent rents climbing by as much as 50 percent in 2016. Many Haitian-owned businesses were forced to close.

Myrlande, a vendor selling Haitian food at the Caribbean Marketplace says she is among the Haitians directly affected by gentrification.

“It’s a dead zone; nothing is going on. Haitians have pretty much left the neighborhood,” she says. “I - myself had a business in the neighborhood and the rent went up so high that I was forced to leave. They didn’t evict me per se, but that’s the end result. That is why we’ve lost almost all the Haitian-owned businesses in the community. That’s why we are trying to have them open the Caribbean Marketplace every day so we can have a place to call home. But I don’t know.”

Gentrification is defined as “the process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to middle-class taste.” According to some real estate developers, the Little Haiti location is desirable because of its higher elevation, making it less vulnerable to flooding and rising sea levels.

David C. Brown, author of The History of Little Haiti: Featuring Its Pioneers, says the unique neighborhood is a testament to the resilience of the Haitians who moved there. “It was successful because of the values the Haitian has - like any other immigrant communities and just like any other nationality - and those values that I see so clearly that shone through in the Haitian spirit are the values of family, education and work ethic. Those are the three values that have helped to raise the bar of this immigrant community.”

Marketplace vendors

In the colorfully painted market, a stylish, bearded man wearing a blue hat with a matching T-shirt catches our eye. He stands in front of a stall with various graphic T-shirts and hoodies on display. The image on his shirt resembles the Superman logo - but the words in bright red say Haitian.

Roe Michel immigrated to the United States from Haiti at age two with his parents. He designs the T-shirts he sells and the one he’s wearing is very popular with customers, he tells VOA.

“This T-shirt is called the Super Haitian,” he says, flashing a bright smile. “You know Haitians have this tenacity to get through anything. Knowing our history, I always feel empowered.”

Michel’s brand is called Vintage 1804, a reference to the year Haitian slaves declared their independence from France and became the first free black nation in the Western Hemisphere.

Another bestseller, according to Michel, is his Haitian heroes shirt, which features the heroes of the war for independence - Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint Louverture, Alexandre Petion - to name a few. Michel tells us his customers are a mix of Haitians and Americans.

Across the room stands Jamaican-born Aura Bond, who now lives in Miami's Miramar suburb. The co-owner of the shop Bjou Bjou is wearing a stylish denim jacket and a beaded Masai statement necklace around her neck. She is surrounded by customers who are trying on earrings and African printed fabric head wraps, or looking at crocheted bathing suits, asking numerous questions.

“I fell in love with the whole Little Haiti entirety. I love it here,” she tells VOA, noting that the items she sells helps women in Haiti as well as Kenya and Ghana to sustain themselves economically.

“It is a virtual marketplace that provides underrepresented producers a global platform. So when I come here, I’m basically selling what’s left over from a week’s sales from online.”

Bond says she became involved with the Caribbean Marketplace through word of mouth and because of the low vendor fees which made selling her merchandise there even more appealing. There are fabric earrings, recycled tin earrings, vegan banana fiber earrings “Those are best sellers. They’re vegan of course,” she says.

Her crochet bathing suits are made in Haiti by teenage girls in an after school program.

By mid-afternoon, the Caribbean Marketplace buzzes with adults, children and teenagers from various cultural backgrounds partaking in the multiple activities occurring simultaneously. A DJ hosts a Little Haiti Trivia contest for the children - some of whom are getting help from their parents. Meanwhile, a group of young women demonstrates a traditional Creole dance. A few steps away, a clown on stilts tries to entice people to dance with her. Back in a corner, an artist applies paint to a canvas. And the wooden stage off to one side is busy with musicians and technicians, setting up for a show by the popular Haitian Compas music band Gabel.

"" I just relocated to Miami and so I’m just looking for cultural things to do,” says first-time visitor Melodie Davis-Bundrage. “I’m always looking to support black businesses. Honestly with the recent political issues that have gone on - with the comments that were said negatively about Haiti and the whole immigration issues that have been happening, I really wanted to support Little Haiti in particular. ""

Vendor Myrlande voiced optimism about the future as the evening came and crowds thinned.

“Business today was not bad at all, but I just wish we could have the same amount of people every Saturday,” she said. “Although I didn’t make a lot of money today, I’m satisfied, I’m happy.”",Fighting Gentrification By Making Little Haiti Great Again,https://www.voanews.com/a/making-miamis-little-haiti-market-great-again/4338726.html

September 2011: Six Oxfam members of staff in Haiti leave the charity after being found guilty of misconduct. Oxfam’s country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, resigns. Penny Lawrence, GB international director at Oxfam, says the action of those who have left ""is not representative of the strong commitment shown and the hard work carried out by Oxfam’s team in Haiti.""

October 2017: The Charity Commission contacts Oxfam after The Times newspaper alerted it to claims that former Oxfam country director for Nigeria, Lesley Agams, was sacked in 2010 after she made a complaint of sexual assault against a former colleague. Oxfam says no evidence could be found to substantiate the allegations.

December 2017: The Charity Commission tells Oxfam to review its culture, management and governance arrangements in the wake of the reports of the charity’s handling of sexual misconduct claims. Oxfam will report back to the regulator on the progress of its reviews before the end of March 2018.

9 February 2018: The Times reports that three Oxfam employees resigned and four were sacked for gross misconduct after the charity concluded an investigation into allegations of sexual exploitation, bullying and intimidation, and the downloading of pornography.

12 February 2018: Oxfam’s chair, Caroline Thompson, announces changes to the charity’s safeguarding policies, including a new whistleblowing helpline for staff. Penny Lawrence, who was programme director in Haiti in 2011, expresses her ""shame"" over the scandal and resigns as deputy chief executive.

12 February 2018: After holding crisis talks with senior Oxfam executives, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, says government funding to Oxfam is not guaranteed, adding that it must now demonstrate moral leadership to address the scandal and deliver progress on its assurances over safeguarding. The Charity Commission opens a statutory inquiry into Oxfam.

13 February 2018: Helen Evans, Oxfam’s former head of global safeguarding between 2012 and 2015, says that senior staff at the charity and the Charity Commission were both aware of concerns about Oxfam’s safeguarding policies and that she had repeatedly raised concerns about allegations of sexual abuse by Oxfam employees both abroad and at home.

14 February 2018: A poll commissioned for Third Sector finds that more than 60 per cent of people in the UK are less likely to donate to Oxfam as a result of the crisis. Labour questions the efficacy of the Charity Commission after concerns of safeguarding were raised by Evans in 2015.

16 February 2018: Oxfam’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, claims people are ""gunning"" for the charity and that the reaction to the scandal is ""out of proportion to the level of culpability"". The charity launches an action plan to improved its safeguarding and its response to allegations of sexual misconduct.

19 February 2018: Brendan Cox resigns as trustee of the charity he set up in memory of his murdered wife, the former MP Jo Cox, following allegations of sexual misconduct in his previous role as policy director at Save the Children.

20 February 2018: Goldring tells MPs on the International Development Select Committee that Oxfam has lost around 7,000 regular donors since the scandal broke and the corporate partners were ""reserving judgements"".

21 February 2018: Mordaunt tells MPs in the House of Commons that Oxfam was guilty of a ""complete betrayal of trust"" of its beneficiaries, volunteers, staff and the British public in its mishandling of the response to the claims of sexual misconduct and repeats that government funding is not guaranteed.

23 February 2018: Haiti’s government stops Oxfam GB from working in the country for two months while it investigates how the charity handled the sexual exploitation cases. Oxfam says it is ""committed to cooperate with their investigation"". Justin Forsyth resigns as deputy executive director of Unicef after allegations emerged that he sent inappropriate texts to junior staff when he was chief executive of Save the Children.

26 February 2018: Mordaunt warns that she will stop funding organisations that do not live up to expected standards in the wake of the scandal as 22 UK aid charities, including Oxfam, pledge to increase the amount of resources they spend on safeguarding.

5 March 2018: At a meeting with aid charities and the Charity Commission, Mordaunt says DfID will introduce new standards that all aid organisations would have to comply with in order to receive government funds. She describes the standards as ""world-leading, tough and exciting"".

6 March 2018: The DfID says that 80 new safeguarding incidents have been reported by 26 charities to the Charity Commission after it had called for assurances following the Oxfam scandal.

In light of the ""grave democratic crisis"" gripping Venezuela, Pinera said he was creating a so-called visa of ""democratic responsibility"" which Venezuelan citizens could obtain through the Chilean embassy in Caracas.

The move seeks to streamline the process of getting a visa for all Venezuelan nationals.

Before, they had visa-on-arrival access to Chile as tourists where those with a specific need could then apply for a student visa, a work permit or for permanent residency.

But under the new system, such visas will be available to all Venezuelans, regardless of their status — as long as they apply in Caracas, in a move aimed at significantly cutting red tape for those wanting to leave.

Announcing details of an in-depth reform of Chile's immigration laws, Pinera said that the moment had come ""to put our house in order.""

Over the past four years, Chile has become one of Latin America's top destinations for migrants, unveiling figures last week which pointed to more than a million foreigners in the country, almost double the previous estimates.

Around 300,000 of that number are thought to be living illegally in the copper-rich South American country, the ministry said.

Most of the migrants are believed to be from Venezuela and Haiti, with the new rules putting an end to the visa-on-arrival policy for citizens of both countries.

For Haitians, Chile is to impose a simple 30-day tourist visa which would only be available through the consulate in Port-au-Prince. Until now, such visas had been available on arrival.

It would also offer a 12-month ""humanitarian visa"" to Haitians with family in Chile.

The new rules also state that anyone entering the country as a tourist will no longer be able to change their status. — AFP",Chile to ease visa rules for Venezuelans fleeing Maduro,http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2018/04/10/chile-ease-visa-rules-venezuelans-fleeing-maduro
11,haiti,"When it comes to charity, Joanne Cottrill isn't the cut-a-cheque-and-walk-away type. This Pugwash, N.S., resident is a builder and walking away when people need help isn't her style.

Each month, the cook at Pugwash District High School fundraises $1,800 to keep a lunch program in Haiti in operation.

For seven years, Cottrill's sweat and her neighbours' generosity has kept the money flowing and food in the bellies of 180 children and about 20 teachers.

""In the summertime, I go door to door at all the cottage areas around here ... there is a lot,"" said Cottrill in an interview with CBC's Maritime Noon.

She collects bottles to redeem at the local recycling facility for cash.

""In the summertime, I would get approximately $100 a day from bottles,"" said Cottrill.

Some people in Pugwash even drop their bottles off at Cottrill's house to help out, while others attend Cottrill's fundraising dinners and bake sales or just give her cash.

All that community support goes to supplying a meal of rice and beans to school kids every school day. In many cases, it's the only meal many of the children will have that day, Cottrill said.

Many people in Haiti suffer from malnutrition as the country struggles to recover after the devastating earthquake in 2010 and the damaging hurricanes in the years that followed.

Cottrill saw that suffering firsthand when she went to the country in 2010 to help out. She worked at an orphanage, medical centre and malnutrition clinic for children.

""I saw many children who are severely malnourished, some of them did not survive and I saw these children and they're not even healthy enough to attend school a lot of times. When they go to school, they can't concentrate because they had nothing to eat that day,"" she said.

The food for the school lunches is cooked over an open fire. The heat is hard to maintain and causes a lot of smoke so Joanne Cook is working to get a propane stove installed. (Submitted by Joanne Cottrill)

Cottrill felt like she needed to do something to change that, so she started up a nutrition program at a school in Cazale, a village in a mountainous area of Haiti about 70 kilometres north of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

But when she returned in 2011, she noticed the children still weren't getting enough nutrition.

That setback didn't stop Cottrill. She redoubled her efforts and launched a school lunch program to get the children more food. That lasted for a year until that school shut down.

Cottrill didn't want to walk away, so she managed to take over the lunch program at the Repairer of the Breaches School, which is also in Cazale. She's been running the program ever since.

This is the space where the school meals are prepared. (Submitted by Joanne Cottrill)

The situation is far from perfect. The rice and beans the children eat are cooked over an open fire which is hard to maintain, so the school's cooks asked if it would be possible to get a propane burner or stove.

""They have to come very early in the morning to get their fires going good enough that they can get a huge pot of water boiling and it's very smoky at times. My daughter actually visited the school on Monday just past and she said, 'Oh, mom, it was so smoky there. Your eyes were stinging and everything.'""

And Cottrill has come up with a solution — she's working on raising even more money to buy a propane stove for the school.

Cottrill has contacted a company that makes propane stoves and installs them in schools and even offers a subsidy. The company is supposed to come and visit the school, but hasn't yet because the village is so remote it takes awhile to organize transportation.

If the school qualifies for a subsidy, the cost of the stove and propane tanks will be about $700 US (approximately $900 Cdn), with an additional charge each month for the cost of fuel. Cottrill hopes the company will be able to visit the school in the next few weeks.",Nova Scotia woman collects empties to keep bellies full in Haiti,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/haiti-fundraiser-nutrition-generosity-children-school-bottles-recycling-1.4608668
12,haiti,"Traditional emergency responses have focused on providing food and medical care to address hunger. But researchers say there may be an opportunity to do more.

Years have passed since the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, but the remnants of destruction remain. There are toppled homes, broken streets and contaminated waterways. One of the longest-lasting effects, though, will be the developmental damage to Haitian children who remain malnourished as a result of the disaster.

Before the earthquake, the malnutrition rate in Haiti was staggering – more than 29 percent of children under five years old were stunted, according to the World Bank. Following a massive humanitarian response that included a specific focus on child nutrition in the wake of the earthquake, that rate dropped to 22 percent. But it remains one of the highest rates among Latin American and Caribbean countries. Meanwhile, four years after the crisis, USAID was still warning that nearly a third of the population remained food insecure.

“The earthquake exacerbated the challenges of combating malnutrition in Haiti,” said Skyler Badenoch, the chief executive officer of Hope for Haiti. The community-based organization helped delivery emergency food rations for months after the earthquake. “Haiti suffered from extreme food insecurity and our attention for a long period following the earthquake was on the provision of immediate relief.”

Disaster relief may ease immediate hunger, but the threat of malnutrition lasts long after the aid tents are taken down. Flying in boxes of food may work in the short term, but it does not address the structures that were already contributing to malnutrition, and which might be further exacerbated by the emergency. Experts wonder if there was a missed opportunity, in the wake of Haiti’s earthquake, to address these issues. And if they had, whether malnutrition rates might not be much lower than they are now.

The situation in Haiti offers a window into an unfolding debate about whether – and how – to integrate long-term nutrition programming into a disaster response.

The Typical Response

“Regardless of in a developed or developing country context, if there are considerable pre-existing food insecurity or malnutrition [issues], they are most assuredly going to be exacerbated by a natural disaster,” said Regine Webster, vice president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy.

But the typical response, which the actors in Haiti largely followed, focuses on quickly trying to ease global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates by delivering food and responding to immediate health needs. GAM tracks the rate of moderate and severe acute malnutrition among children between 6 and 59 months old, using that as a proxy for the health of the larger community.

In the years after the earthquake, Haiti’s GAM rate actually began to climb, jumping from 5.1 percent in 2012 to 6.5 percent in 2013, according to the United Nations. It has since fallen, though individual communities have experienced spikes following recent droughts and hurricanes.

New research out of Tufts University indicates that the existence of persistent GAM in the aftermath of a crisis, like the Haiti earthquake, “indicates that food security may not be the main driver.” And their conclusions have the potential to recalibrate the traditional responses to malnutrition following an emergency.

The researchers behind the report, Dr. Helen Young and Anastasia Marshak, studied 25 countries with persistent GAM rates above 15 percent, including Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan. They wanted to find out why rates remained high despite both humanitarian and development responses.

According to Young and Marshak, the current model, which focuses on delivering food, improving care and fighting disease, overlooks more systemic problems, particularly in communities that were already experiencing malnutrition. They argue there are four “cross-cutting themes” that also need to be addressed in any response: gender; livelihood systems; the history of vulnerability and long-term trends driving acute malnutrition; and seasonal fluctuations in acute malnutrition.

The 1983 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the result of a civil war and the government withholding food supplies from rebel areas. Also, local gender norms played a role by narrowing land and employment opportunities for women. The traditional “food-first” model of relief – delivering food boxes to stop hunger – struggles to reverse the causes of these types of crises. It also doesn’t address the ways a more traditional emergency, like Haiti’s earthquake, might exacerbate existing food security issues, such as poverty, land degradation and social inequalities.

The traditional response, the researchers argue, is a silo-ed approach that focuses on treatment without factoring in long-term prevention. With a better understanding of what long-term interventions work, they could be used in tandem with immediate relief efforts to reverse malnutrition trends.

“We’re often very focused on short-term indicators of the severity of the problem,” said Dr. Daniel Maxwell, a professor of food security at Tufts. “We’re often more focused on the immediate outcomes,” such as food consumption rates. Now experts are eager to try something different.

The Challenges that Remain

That won’t be easy, though, in part because the current approach, with its focus on food, health and hygiene in the aftermath of a crisis, has been in place for a long time. But it also points to a broader difficulty in trying to coordinate across organizations with very different missions.

Convincing organizations to research causes of malnutrition and take a diverse approach to resolving it can be difficult, said Dr. Jessica Fanzo, associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. “When you start getting into measuring growth and micronutrients, you need expertise and funding so a lot of people decide not to do that. You need that evidence base to influence policymakers.”

Fanzo co-chaired the 2017 Global Nutrition Report, which advocates for further promotion of nutritious diets and increasing the building of food infrastructure during humanitarian assistance efforts. “Linking immediate humanitarian relief interventions with longer-term development approaches is important for this resiliency,” the report concludes.

There is also the issue of funding. Young and Marshak note short-term funding cycles, which is how most humanitarian responses are paid for, are unable to take on in-depth analysis of existing causes of malnutrition. And like the organizations fighting malnutrition, there is a problem of siloed information, in which it is difficult for researchers to compare various findings to look at information across time.

There are some changes happening, though, on a small scale. Maxwell pointed to “weather index-based insurance schemes” in Kenya that fight droughts and give farmers confidence to invest in technologies that could boost their production.

Much research and work remains, though, he said, beginning with a better understanding of what other factors contribute to persistent GAM. “There are still some puzzles out there with regard to what drives these high levels of malnutrition.”","After Haiti, Rethinking How to Address Malnutrition in an Emergency",https://www.newsdeeply.com/malnutrition/articles/2018/03/28/after-haiti-rethinking-how-to-address-malnutrition-in-an-emergency
13,haiti,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Alvin Phillips, executive director of Habitat for Humanity of the Mid-Ohio Valley, has returned from a Habitat summit in Haiti.

Phillips was a member of a U.S. Habitat for Humanity delegation to Habitat for Humanity’s Haiti conference from March 13-16.

“Habitat is doing amazing things in Haiti; they are focusing on access to housing and working to help improve health and safety in the neighborhoods where they’re working,” said Phillips.

Habitat’s work includes job training and installing solar-powered street lights that help with neighborhood security, Phillips said.

“They’ve also improved streets and walkways and provided equipment for improving the quality of the water supply. The staff of Habitat Haiti was very welcoming and were excited to share the work that they’ve been doing,” Phillips said.

Every Habitat for Humanity affiliate is expected to give 10 percent of unrestricted donations (called a tithe) to Habitat for Humanity International to use in building in other countries around the world.

Through the Tithe program, Habitat partners are not only eliminating poverty housing from their own communities, but also eliminating poverty housing in communities around the world, officials said.

Participating Tithe partners learned more about Habitat for Humanity Haiti’s programs through educational sit-downs with program directors and managers as well as on site visits to the field. Phillips and others got a chance to see the team’s work in action and to talk with program beneficiaries, community members and leaders.

Visits to the field included stops at Habitat for Humanity Haiti’s programs in Simon-Pele, Port-au-Prince (the capital) and Leogane, near the epicenter of the 2010 earthquake.

Exposure to the Haiti Property Law Working Group allowed Phillips and others to gain a greater understanding of the land issues in Haiti and how the efforts of the group are making headway in advocating for land rights.

Habitat for Humanity of the Mid-Ohio Valley is described as a leader in giving to the Tithe program. Since 2010, HFHMOV has designated a portion of its tithe to Haiti to help with recovery efforts from the earthquake that devastated so much of the housing in Port-au-Prince, Leogane and surrounding communities.

Since Habitat was formed in Wood and Washington counties, HFHMOV’s tithe funding has built 140 homes — in addition to the 100 homes that have been built locally.

In January 2010, an earthquake in Haiti destroyed 105,000 houses, damaged 85,000 more and left more than 1.5 million people homeless. It took about 30 seconds to reduce much of the country’s housing stock and infrastructure to piles of rubble, Habitat said.

Rebuilding has been complicated by many factors, Habitat officials said, including that Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the world. Even before the disaster, 3 out of 4 people lived on less than two U.S. dollars a day.

Without national building codes in place, much of the housing that existed was poorly built — often on precarious sites and without legal land title, Habitat said.

Recovery from the earthquake is expected to take several more years.

In October 2016, the southern parts of Haiti experienced a direct hit from category 5 hurricane Matthew, which impacted 2.1 million people, Habitat said. “Many families continue to live in makeshift housing while recovery efforts are still underway.”

“Since the 2010 earthquake our supporters through the Habitat Affiliate network around the world have demonstrated an incredible solidarity with the people of Haiti. This support allows Habitat to continue making progress alongside communities to address their housing a settlement needs. While much has been achieved, the work is far from over and Habitat is committed for the long term in Haiti,” said Jean Frenel Tham, national director, Habitat for Humanity Haiti.

Habitat for Humanity has been at work in Haiti for more than 30 years, providing families with pathways to permanent housing, including new home construction, home retrofits, training, capacity building and land tenure reform, officials said.

Under its 2010 earthquake recovery program and subsequent community development activities, Habitat Haiti helped more than 60,000 families affected by the disaster, officials said. Before the earthquake, Habitat built new homes in partnership with 2,000 families in Cabaret, Flammands and the Central Plateau, officials said.",Alvin Phillips attends Habitat for Humanity summit in Haiti,http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2018/04/alvin-phillips-attends-habitat-for-humanity-summit-in-haiti/

SECURITY COUNCIL

8220TH MEETING (AM)

With the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) fully operational, preparations have already begun for that follow-up peacekeeping operation to make way for a new United Nations presence by the end of 2019 that would focus on the Caribbean nation’s long-term sustainable development, the Organization’s top peacekeeping official told the Security Council today.

Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, introduced the Secretary-General’s latest report on the Mission ahead of its decision on renewing its current mandate, which expires on 15 April. Included in that document was a list of 11 benchmarks for an exit strategy for MINUJUSTH, which the Council established through resolution 2350 (2017) as a successor to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).

Briefing the Council, he reviewed the progress the Mission had made so far in fulfilling its mandate to assist the Government of Haiti to strengthen rule of law institutions, to support and develop the Haitian National Police, and to carry out human rights monitoring, reporting and analysis.

“While achieving results should remain our common priority, we have already started to prepare for a transition to a non-peacekeeping presence, based on lessons learned in Haiti and in other contexts,” he said, explaining that a transition strategy was being drawn up — in consultation with the Government — that would build on existing United Nations-wide instruments, such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework.

He said he was strongly encouraged by the willingness of and efforts by Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and his Government to create a climate for change. In that regard, he welcomed the President’s priorities on State reform and the maintenance of political and social stability, adding that the United Nations stood ready to support the Government in devising a clear road map for reforms, taking into account the Mission’s capacities on the ground.

“We have many reasons to be optimistic that this path to progress is irreversible, while we need to jointly — Haiti, the United Nations, international and regional partners — continue investing in the success of the country and United Nations engagement in it,” he said.

In the ensuing discussion, Haiti’s representative said his was a country of peace, with democracy being consolidated, institutions established under the Constitution functioning in a regular manner and human rights being respected and upheld. He reported progress in such areas as security, good governance and respect for the rule of law, and underscored a significant drop in violent crime. That said, he acknowledged that the Government was fully aware of progress yet to be made, having inherited the consequences of decades of neglect, structural handicaps and bottlenecks that would have to be tackled over the long term.

He said his Government had taken note of the Secretary-General’s withdrawal strategy for the Mission, but emphasized that nothing would be possible without scrupulous adherence to reciprocal obligations and a genuine spirit of solidarity, mutual respect and trust. He added that Haiti welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative on cholera, although the $7.7 million raised so far for the United Nations Haiti Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund was woefully insufficient, and called for goodwill and predictable funding to ensure just compensation to cholera victims, their loved ones and others.

Canada’s representative, speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Haiti, said structural reforms must address such challenges as prolonged pretrial detention and prison overcrowding, sexual and gender-based violence, greater women’s participation in decision-making, reforming and strengthening of the justice sector and enhancing social services. The Group welcomed steps taken by the Haitian Government towards greater security, stability and prosperity, and recommended that the Council extend the Mission’s mandate for another year with no changes to its level of resources.

The representative of the United States said Haitians themselves were taking the lead when it came to security and law enforcement. When peacekeeping worked well, countries could develop their own capacities to protect their citizens and put in place their own political processes. Welcoming the benchmarked exit strategy for MINUJUSTH, she said the United States was a long-standing friend and partner of Haiti — one that would continue to support its security priorities as well as its political and democratic development.

Chile’s representative was among several non-Council members from Latin America to take the floor, saying the international community should not lose sight of what had been achieved. The Mission could only consolidate progress made by closely cooperating with all national actors and through the active involvement of the international community, she said. Welcoming a significant reduction in cholera transmissions and fatalities, she applauded consultations with civil society, local leaders and cholera victims with a view towards addressing the scourge.

Also speaking this morning were representatives of Bolivia, Netherlands, Equatorial Guinea, Poland, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Kuwait, China, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Peru, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, as well as the European Union.

The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 12:25 p.m.

Briefing

JEAN-PIERRE LACROIX, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, presenting the Secretary-General’s report on the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) (document S/2018/241), noted that he visited Haiti on 14 and 15 March. The Mission was fully operational and actively implementing its mandate, with a light and non-intrusive footprint, while creating a channel of regular communication with the population throughout the country. Individual police officers had been co-located with the Haitian National Police in all 10 of Haiti’s administrative departments, with corrections personnel in 9 of the country’s 18 prisons, he said. The Mission was also working closely with the 19 United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in Haiti, as well as with the Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti. It was assisting the Haitian National Police to implement its 2017-2021 Strategic Development Plan and ensuring the application of caseload management procedures to help curb prolonged pretrial detention and prison overcrowding. Priority was also being assigned to strengthening national human rights institutions, he said.

He said he was strongly encouraged by the willingness and continuing efforts by the President of Haiti and his Government to create a climate for change. In that regard, he welcomed the President’s priorities on State reform and the maintenance of political and social stability. The 11 benchmarks set out in the Secretary-General’s report echoed that vision, providing a unique opportunity for the Government, MINUJUSTH, the country team and the international community to jointly implement common priorities indicated by Security Council resolution 2350 (2017) and Haiti’s 2030 Vision, in line with the Agenda for Sustainable Development. He added that the United Nations stood ready to support the Government in devising a clear road map for achieving its State reform agenda, taking into account the Mission’s capacities on the ground.

“While achieving results should remain our common priority, we have already started to prepare for a transition to a non-peacekeeping presence, based on lessons learned in Haiti and in other contexts,” he said, with a transition strategy being drawn up that would build on existing United Nations-wide instruments, such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. That strategy would also seek to anticipate and mitigate any gaps that might arise from the withdrawal of peacekeeping operations within the Council-stipulated timeframe. In that regard, the United Nations looked forward to close collaboration with the Government and others to ensure a successful transition.

Benchmarks for an exit strategy weaved together an ambitious but flexible framework based on conditions under which the current United Nations configuration in Haiti could confidently transform into a non-peacekeeping presence, he said. In the coming months, the Council would be provided with qualitative and quantitative assessments that would enable it to take well-informed decision on the Mission’s drawdown and withdrawal. A broadly consulted and owned, benchmarked-based exit was the right approach to preserve the stabilization and peacebuilding gains made over a decade in Haiti, he said, emphasizing that the United Nations was determined to ensure that the Mission would be the last peacekeeping operation deployed in that country. He added: “We have many reasons to be optimistic that this path to progress is irreversible, while we need to jointly — Haiti, the United Nations, international and regional partners — continue investing in the success of the country and United Nations engagement in it.”

Statements

AMY NOEL TACHCO (United States) said that Haitians themselves were taking the lead in providing their own security and law enforcement, stressing that, when peacekeeping worked well, countries were able to develop their own capacities to protect their citizens and put in place their own political processes. Long-term security and stability in Haiti were critical priorities, and in that regard, she was encouraged by the progress made in establishing the Haitian National Police. Formed police units, individual police officers, corrections officers and civilian experts contributed significantly to rule of law priorities that had been identified by the international community and Haitian authorities. The Haitian security, political and development agenda could only be shaped by Haitians themselves. Every effort must be made to consolidate the stability achieved over the last few years, and in that context, it was critical that Haiti strengthen its institutions, including by adopting a draft penal code and establishing an electoral council. At the end of the day, Haiti bore the primary responsibility for making that happen. Her delegation welcomed the benchmarked exit strategy for MINUJUSTH and stressed the critical importance of filling the Mission’s remaining vacant positions. The United States was a long-standing friend and partner of Haiti and would continue to support the country’s security priorities, as well as its political and democratic development.

PEDRO LUIS INCHAUSTE JORDÁN (Bolivia) said his delegation was encouraged by the progress made by MINUJUSTH and its partners, including in consolidating ties with the Government to ensure a convergence of views and priorities, as well as developing a road map for working together. He highlighted the progress made in implementing Haiti’s reform agenda to promote sustainable development and combat corruption. It was vital to ensure the rule of law and to lay the foundation for better political and social cohesion, while also tackling the country’s remaining socioeconomic challenges. He noted the decrease of crime and violence in Haiti and encouraged further progress in those areas. He supported and the work of the Mission in the areas of rule of law and human rights and encouraged it to continue in close cooperation with the Government. He applauded efforts aimed at combatting cholera through the Secretary-General’s renewed focus and called upon the international community to work together to fulfil its commitment and provide cooperation and assistance to Haiti to establish the necessary health-care system.

LISE GREGOIRE VAN HAAREN (Netherlands), associating herself with the statement to be delivered by the European Union, said Haiti, with United Nations support, had made considerable progress in recent year. However, it could not surmount outstanding challenges alone. Only through close cooperation could the Mission and the Haitian State build and strengthen national public institutions. A detailed strategy — including benchmarks – was essential to pave the way for a gradual peacekeeping withdrawal. The Netherlands encouraged Haiti to seize the opportunity and draw all benefits from its partnership with the Mission, she said, expressing the hope that elections in 18 months would mark the start of a new era in Haiti.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea) expressed congratulations to the Government of Haiti for its political determination and leadership which should in time lead to the United Nations country team fully assuming its development support role. The 10 benchmarks for an exit strategy were ambitious but attainable if the international community supported the Government, with due consideration given to limiting factors, including the cholera situation. Concluding, he expressed support for the Mission and invited all State institutions in Haiti to support the President’s reform agenda.

PAWEL RADOMSKI (Poland), associating himself with the European Union, said that, despite formidable obstacles, the progress made by Haitians was impressive. The caravan of change had a daily impact on the lives of Haitians in a number of areas. The Government had made measurable progress in establishing a criminal code to fight corruption in the civil service and to strengthen the justice sector. Those efforts should lead to political stabilization and further strengthen the rule of law, which was critical for sustainable development. Nevertheless, the Haitian institutions still needed the international community’s support, he said, underscoring that the vacancy rate within the Mission should be lowered and calling on the Secretariat to make efforts to fill any remaining vacant positions. Further efforts to increase the response capacity in the investigation of and response to sexual and gender-based harassment in Haiti were necessary, while prison overcrowding continued to raise human rights concerns. Haiti had the undeniable right to create and maintain its national forces, although given the budgetary limitations and lack of capabilities, the Government must take thoughtful steps forward in that regard.

MAHLET HAILU GUADEY (Ethiopia) welcomed the development of an exit strategy for MINUJUSTH, noting that it outlined clear benchmarks based on results achieved and the situation on the ground. The establishment of the Mission was important for consolidating peace through the strengthening of institutions for justice and the rule of law, she underlined, noting the challenges in the justice and corrections sectors and MINUJUSTH’s efforts to address those issues. Welcoming the continuous progress made by Haiti in consolidating democracy and stability, she noted the progress made in the overall security situation. Haiti continued to face enormous challenges and vulnerabilities, which highlighted the need for social and political cohesion and the reinforcement of State institutions to consolidate the gains made in recent years. The international community should seek ways to support sustainable development in Haiti in a way that respected the country’s sovereignty.

BERNARD TANOH-BOUTCHOUE (Cote d’Ivoire) said the presence of Mission was a genuine opportunity to support Government efforts to achieve stability and development with a view to the withdrawal of the peacekeeping operations. His delegation supported the decision to set up a monitoring mechanism for progress achieved in the exit strategy. Despite progress in professionalizing the Haitian National Police, the overall security situation remained vulnerable, he said, citing the need to address corruption, promote women’s rights and strengthen pretrial detention conditions. He expressed alarm over vulnerable living conditions, including limited access to safe drinking water, and commended progress in combating cholera, as well as the Secretary-General’s strategy to eradicate that epidemic.

BADER ABDULLAH N. M. ALMUNAYEKH (Kuwait) welcomed a marked improvement in security in Haiti, with crime rates trending downward, and called on the national authorities to maximize the benefit of United Nations experience in that regard. He expressed concern about reports of violations of human rights and hoped that the national authorities would prosecute the perpetrators, thus ensuring accountability and justice. He went on to welcome the United Nations approach to combating cholera, with transmission rates down by more than 99 per cent. Concluding, he said Kuwait a renewal of the Mission’s mandate with benchmarks paving the way to a non‑peacekeeping United Nations presence.

WU HAITAO (China) said that, currently, stability prevailed in Haiti and the security situation was steadily improving in the country. China was keen to see the international community continue to help improve the situation in Haiti through the provision of humanitarian and development assistance. China commended MINUJUSTH for its efforts for the smooth deployment and functioning of the Mission. Much had been achieved with regard to the United Nations efforts to combat cholera, he said, calling on the international community to positively respond to the Organization’s newest initiative for cholera response, with a view towards wiping out the epidemic once and for all.

KAREN PIERCE (United Kingdom) welcomed the continued progress in Haiti and was particularly interested in the Government’s development of a national police force and efforts to strengthen the rule of law. She applauded the new approach to combating cholera and said that her delegation was very interested in the way in which the Government was seeking to establish long-term political stability and development in Haiti. The Government must take ownership of the delivery of critical reforms that would have a lasting impact on security and development in Haiti. She looked to the United Nations to be a well-integrated organization in ensuring an effective transition through the implementation of the work plan, bolstered by strong collaboration with the Government. The exit strategy needed to demonstrate clear progress against the benchmarks that the Secretary-General had set out, particularly given the complex nature of the transition.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France), associating himself with the statements to be made by the European Union and the Group of Friends of Haiti, emphasized the importance of the Mission having the means to carry out its mandate. Going forward, France would focus on steps taken to adopt a criminal code and code of criminal procedure. He encouraged the Government to strengthen measures to combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law. France also called for attentive follow-up on human rights, always ensuring Haitian ownership of that issue. He went on to call for the renewal of the Mission’s mandate, adding that his country and the United Nations would continue to stand by the Haitian people, whose courage deserved great attention.

CARL SKAU (Sweden) associating himself with the European Union, commended Haiti’s progress in consolidating democracy, stability and peace. Progress was still needed to achieve Government priorities, including the rule of law, respect for human rights, improved socioeconomic development, infrastructures, resilience and security. MINUJUSTH’s mandate was aligned with these priorities. Donors must step up to ensure that United Nations agencies in the country had adequate resources and capacity to support peacebuilding in Haiti. The Mission had to increase women’s security and participation and ensure protection against sexual and gender-based violence. Sweden continued to contribute both police and correction personnel to the Mission. He welcomed the efforts to strengthen protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. All alleged cases of such abuse must be reported and investigated, and perpetrators must be held accountable. Sweden co-sponsored the General Assembly resolution in support of the Secretary-General’s new approach to eradicate cholera and build resilience in Haiti the year before. Sweden also supported the United Nations Haiti Cholera Response Multi‑Partner Trust Fund and encouraged others to contribute to it.

ALEXANDER A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said that, since the Mission started working, heartening changes had taken place, including efforts to establish stability and an effective system of governance. Cohesive, concerted joint efforts by the legislative, judicial and executive branches of Government would be important for sustained economic development. He noted Haiti’s efforts to be more involved with international and regional structures. At each juncture, it was important to take into account the views of the host State and to support the ideals of national ownership. Calibrated assistance was of great importance to the Government, which needed to focus on security, political stability, development and peacebuilding. He expressed grave concern about the persistent, dire humanitarian situation in the country, including following Hurricane Matthew, underscoring that 1 million people were still in need of humanitarian assistance. He hoped that further progress would strengthen the Haitian National Police, although he was gravely concerned about reports of crimes of a sexual nature committed by those working on behalf of foreign non-governmental organizations.

KAIRAT UMAROV (Kazakhstan) said that, while recognizing the progress made in Haiti, some key issues were yet to be addressed, including the establishment of an electoral council, prison overcrowding, prolonged pretrial detention and continued humanitarian challenges. Political engagement was especially important in light of the upcoming elections. Ensuring the independence of the judiciary was of great importance, as was ensuring that the Haitian National Police development plan was implemented efficiently and in a timely way, with the international community’s support. The benchmarked exit strategy must be implemented in a coordinated manner through an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders, particularly the Haitian Government. Haiti’s current chairmanship of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) presented an important opportunity to mobilize international partnerships to address the country’s most urgent problems.

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru), Council President for April, speaking in his national capacity and associating himself with Canada’s statement on behalf of the Group of Friends of Haiti, emphasized the need to continue supporting efforts to build institutions that could safeguard human rights and guarantee access to justice in Haiti. That was a key element of the Mission’s mandate, he said, underscoring also the need to strengthen the United Nations system presence in Haiti as the country strived to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. He stressed the importance of greater participation of Haitian women and children, as well as the need for more international support regarding cholera, and expressed his country’s support for a renewal of the Mission’s mandate for another year.

DENIS RÉGIS (Haiti) said Haiti today was a country of peace, with democracy being consolidated, institutions established under the Constitution functioning in a regular manner and human rights being respected and upheld. Progress was being made in such areas as security, good governance and respect for the rule of law. Violent crime was down 50 per cent, while measures were being taken to combat corruption. Structural reform efforts included the creation of a Sectorial Estates General to promote political dialogue, as well as the Caravan of Change strategy. Nevertheless, the Government was fully aware of progress yet to be made and it intended to persevere along the path of reform. Haiti’s problems were the consequences of decades of neglect, structural handicaps and bottlenecks that would require diligent and methodical action over the long term, he said.

He said his Government had taken note of the Secretary-General’s withdrawal strategy for the Mission, which in line with resolution 2350 (2017) essentially played a technical assistance role and national institutions shouldering primary responsibility for development and governance-related issues. Nothing would be possible without scrupulous respect for reciprocal obligations and a genuine spirit of solidarity, mutual respect and trust. Emphasizing that sustaining peace and sustainable development went hand in hand, he said his country welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative on cholera, adding, however, that the $7.7 million raised so far for the United Nations Haiti Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund was woefully insufficient. Haiti called for goodwill and predictable funding to ensure that cholera victims, their loved ones and others received just compensation and for sanitary and drinking water infrastructure to be rebuilt.

JOÃO PEDRO VALE DE ALMEIDA, Head of Delegation of the European Union, said that as a long‑standing supporter of the Haitian people, the European Union welcomed the emergence of normal constitutional operations in the country, despite the considerably difficulties encountered. However, that progress was not enough to guarantee democratic stability and sustainable development. To restore the Haitian people’s trust in democracy and political stability, access to impartial, fair and effective justice must be guaranteed. The efforts of all stakeholders to provide security and stability for all citizens would be necessary for building democracy. The European Union remained a steadfast and faithful partner for Haiti and would continue to support the country at the current difficult and sensitive stage, including by engaging in the necessary reforms. The European Union believed that the structural causes of insecurity in Haiti had yet to be fully addressed and the security situation there remained tenuous, which meant that there must be continued efforts to strengthen and professionalize the national police.

MARC-ANDRÉ BLANCHARD (Canada), speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Haiti, said structural reforms were needed to address multiple challenges in Haiti, such as prolonged pretrial detention and prison overcrowding, sexual and gender-based violence, the need for greater participation of women in decision‑making processes, reforming and strengthening of the justice sector and enhancing social services. The Group welcomed the important and necessary steps already taken by the Haitian Government towards greater security, stability and prosperity. He stressed the importance of the fight against corruption, putting an end to impunity and ensuring accountability in Haiti. The Group welcomed the United Nations commitment to support consolidation of previous gains and peacebuilding goals, which was creating space for promoting greater stability and sustainable development. The Group noted MINUJUSTH’s work in assisting helping the Government of Haiti to further develop the Haitian National Police, strengthening of rule of law institutions and engaging in human rights monitoring, reporting and analysis. To succeed, that work must continue in close coordination with the Government.

The Group recommended the Security Council support extension of the Mission’s mandate for another year with the same level of resources, notably for its police component and with the intention of reviewing, as necessary, whether the mandate should be extended further, he said. Noting the request in Council resolution 2350 (2017) for further refining the Mission’s benchmarked exit strategy, the Group wanted to hear more about the progress achieved in meeting the related benchmarks. Continued and close coordination and consultation with the national Government was important, as was the careful review of conditions on the ground to adjust the Mission’s presence accordingly. While the reduced number of cases of cholera transmission and cholera-related fatalities in Haiti was promising, all Member States should continue to support the United Nations efforts to combat cholera in Haiti.

ALEJANDRO GUILLERMO VERDIER (Argentina), associating himself with the Group of Friends of Haiti, welcomed the establishment of a benchmarked exit strategy and stressed the need to avoid a premature exit that could jeopardize the international community’s efforts over the last 14 years. The Mission should undertake the transition process with the close cooperation of Haiti, respecting the need for national ownership. Underscoring the efforts by the Haitian authorities to build lasting stability and a better future for the country, he called attention to the progress made in addressing the cholera epidemic. His delegation would continue to provide trained police personnel for the Mission and took interest in the development of a national police force in the country.

MARÍA DEL CARMEN DOMÍNGUEZ ÁLVAREZ (Chile), associating herself with the Group of Friends of Haiti, said MINUJUSTH played a fundamental role in promoting socioeconomic development, strengthening institutions and reaffirming human rights in the country. The international community should not lose sight of what had been achieved on the path towards security and development, bearing in mind the importance of the conditions of the ground and the priorities of the Haitian Government. The Mission could only consolidate the achievements made by closely cooperating with all national actors and through the active involvement of the international community. Her delegation welcomed the significant reduction of the transmission of and fatalities from cholera. In particular, she applauded the consultations with civil society, local leaders and victims of cholera with a view towards addressing the scourge.

MAURO VIEIRA (Brazil), associating himself with Canada’s statement on behalf of the Group of Friends of Haiti, noted with satisfaction that the transition between the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and MINUJUSTH had been carried out without a negative impact on the security situation. “MINUSTAH demonstrated the potential of innovative approaches that could serve as a model for future peacekeeping operations,” he said, citing coordination between civilian and military personnel on the ground, community outreach strategies to build confidence and the important role of women in the stabilization process. Brazil had led MINUSTAH for 13 years and contributed more than 30,000 troops. Despite a decrease in homicides in the last few years, the homicide rate in the previous three months had increased, a reminder that the security situation still must be viewed with caution. The quick impact and community-violence-reduction projects implemented by MINUSTAH had contributed to stability and should continue under MINUJUSTH’s mandate. The consultations with the Government of Haiti should continue during the implementation and review of the exit strategy. MINUJUSTH and the Government of Haiti should carry out ambitious reforms in the field of rule of law. The Mission’s mandate should be extended for another year and its budgetary and police components should be maintained. The references to Chapter VII in the mandate should be circumscribed to operational activities of MINUJUSTH’s police component. The Council should continuously assess the situation on the ground and revise its plans if necessary.

FRANCISCO GONZÁLEZ (Colombia), associating himself with the Group of Friends of Haiti, said there could be no true stability or sustainable development without a strengthening of democratic institutions. MINUJUSTH’s fundamental objective was to strengthen the rule of law, the judiciary, Haitian National Police and human rights, all of which would contribute to sustainable development. Colombia agreed with the Secretary-General that the entire judicial system, including the penal system, needed deep-seated reforms. He underscored the importance of incorporating gender components in a cross-cutting manner, as seen by the appointment of women court clerks and police officers, adding that a renewal of the Mission’s mandate for another year would set a clear path for further progress.

16,haiti,"Minnesota Golden Gophers redshirt senior goalie Sidney Peters was awarded the 2018 Hockey Humanitarian Award on Friday afternoon in conjunction with the Frozen Four in St. Paul. Peters is the first Gopher winner of the award that dates back to 1996.

The Hockey Humanitarian Award is awarded annually to college hockey’s finest citizen and seeks to recognize college hockey players, from all divisions, male or female, who give back to their community in the true humanitarian spirit. The award honors a student-athlete who makes significant contributions not only to his or her team, but also to the community-at-large through leadership in volunteerism. The award is given not to honr Hall of Fame athletes, but rather Hall of Fame human beings. The Humanitarian Award is meant to be seen as a true measure of a person’s worth, not just as an athlete, but as someone who embodies those values that merit our recognition.

”As we’ve gotten to know Sidney through the nomination process, we have been increasingly impressed with her core values of volunteerism and her passion to make a difference,” said Matt Patrick, Executive Director of the Hockey Humanitarian Award Foundation.

Peters has impressed on the ice, and with her volunteer efforts. During her Minnesota tenure, Peters has logged over 830 volunteer hours with various community outreach volunteer activities. Peters is a certified Emergency Medical Technician and has spent significant time with both the University of Minnesota EMS and the Rush-Copley Emergency Department in Aurora, Ill volunteering her time and efforts.

Peters traveled to Haiti during the summer of 2016 with Project Medishare, which is dedicated to improving the health and quality of life of all Haitians by empowering them to provide and receive access to comprehensive, quality health care. She spent eight days in Haiti volunteering at Hospital Bernard Mevs, the country’s only critical care and trauma hospital, as well as the only newborn and pediatric intensive care unit.

Peters has volunteered her time as the head goalie coach for Hockey Ministries International at the organization’s camp in Chicago for the past two years. Locally, Peters has jumped at volunteer opportunities with HopeKids, Special Olympics Minnesota, and University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, along with efforts at local elementary and middle schools and youth hockey associations.

”Receiving the Hockey Humanitarian Award is a huge honor,” Peters said. “It places me in a category with past nominees and award winners who are just phenomenal people who have made a huge difference in their communities; most importantly, inspiring people around them to think and serve differently. I’m really proud to be associated with this award and really thankful to be associated with the other finalists.

“I got into volunteering as a freshman with the University of Minnesota Maroon & Gold Impacting the Community (M.A.G.I.C.), which is a student-athlete development program. They give us many opportunities to get out in the community, to volunteer with local schools and hospitals. That was my first step into volunteering, and it gave me the opportunity to meet people and build a community. That’s when I fell in love with service and began pursuing other opportunities, mostly as an EMT because medicine is my passion.”

The Hockey Humanitarian Award Foundation also presented Peters with a check for $2,500 during the ceremony, which will be donated to her designated charity, Project Medishare.

Peters finished her hockey career with the Gophers this past spring. She was a four year letter winner and appeared in 82 games in net for the Gophers and completed her career with a record of 53-17-6. She has been the Gophers #1 goalie the past two seasons and she ranked 5th all time in Gopher history in wins, shutouts, goals against average, and total saves, and sixth in save percentage.

In the classroom Peters will graduate with a degree in Kinesiology with a minor in biology and has been accepted into medical school at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences where she will serve in the Air Force. She is a four-time WCHA Scholar-Athlete, WCHA All-Academic, and Academic All-Big Ten honoree.",Minnesota Women’s Hockey: Sidney Peters Wins 2018 Hockey Humanitarian Award,https://www.thedailygopher.com/2018/4/6/17208448/minnesota-womens-hockey-sidney-peters-wins-2018-hockey-humanitarian-award-gophers-frozen-four
17,haiti,"The sounds of cheering from 40 small children who had just been told they would now have clean drinking water, free of the pathogens that could make them sick, is forever embedded in Rachel Hunt’s mind.

The cheering occurred last year on Hunt’s first trip to Haiti with a student organization called Project Haiti from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The student club has been working with villages and schools in the Caribbean country constructing water purification systems in cholera-stricken communities and other communities with contaminated water since 2010. She says the trip has forever changed her life.

“When the children heard they were going to have clean water, it was like telling them they were going to Disney World,” Hunt said. “It changed my perspective on the importance of small things we normally take for granted. I really enjoyed the ability to use what I’ve been learning to help other people and make an actual change in the world.”

A mechanical engineering senior, Hunt hopes for a career providing engineering humanitarian aid to developing countries. This year, as president of Embry-Riddle’s Project Haiti, she’s turned her aspirations into action.

This will be the ninth year Embry-Riddle students from the Daytona Beach Campus have built clean drinking water filtration systems for Haitian communities.

In May, the team of 10 students will install a different type of solar-powered water purification system they designed and built themselves. It will be placed at a school and orphanage that serves 235 children in Gonaives, north of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Dr. Marc Compere, associate professor of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Geoffrey Kain, professor of Humanities and Communication and director of Embry-Riddle’s Honors Program, will be traveling with and advising the students.

“Many times our classroom design projects, like building a filtration system, are theoretical. This project is hands on. It challenges the students to become practical and resourceful while operating in a dynamic, unstructured and unpredictable environment,” said Dr. Compere.

Watching the students solve complex problems that arise in Haiti has been impressive, Dr. Kain said.

“In rural Haiti, there are no trips to the store to pick up suddenly needed supplies,” Dr. Kain said. “Obstacles have to be overcome sometimes by improvisation and ingenuity. It's inspiring.”

On previous trips to Haiti, the team has installed ultrafiltration systems, but they learned last year that this type of purification system was unable to remove all salt, sediment and viruses in villages using well water or river water. The Gonaives site has the same problems, said Hunt.

The team’s solution this year is to design a system that uses reverse osmosis — a high-pressure pump and ultrafine, semi-permeable membranes — to remove contaminants. The filters also will not need to be replaced as often so the community can better maintain the unit at less cost.

In addition to providing clean drinking water, a small business selling five-gallon bottles of clean water to the surrounding community will be launched. The venture will generate income for the orphanage and school, and provide job opportunities for the children after they turn 18.

The university students are involved in every aspect of the project, from welding the purifier frame, to designing and manufacturing the control panel. A solar panel array will be installed in Haiti to power the water purifier.

Since Embry-Riddle’s Project Haiti first began its humanitarian work, after a massive earthquake struck the country in January 2010, eight solar-powered clean-water filtration systems have been installed and four micro-businesses selling clean water have been established, supporting thousands of Haitians in communities throughout the country.

On the trip last year, team member Audrey Hallam, an aeronautical science major, was moved by the support from the Haitian community.

“I fell in love with the people,” Hallam said. “It was amazing to create something that would change their lives and keep them healthier.”

18,haiti,"GONAIVES, Haiti – As the sun starts to set on Haiti's most fertile valley, a silent group of women sweeps grains of newly harvested rice into large, yellow mounds, unfazed by the acrid smoke of nearby wood fires.

From there, the rice is placed in barrels, where it will be cleaned over those fires. Then, in a small back room on a winter afternoon, it will be packed in bags and shipped from this mill in west-central Haiti's Artibonite Valley, ending up in the kitchens of Haitian expatriates and other discriminating cooks across the United States.

This was once a common scene in Haiti. Now it's a rarity. A few decades ago, Haiti was self-sufficient in rice, a crop so important here that the U.N. estimates it makes up about a quarter of people's daily diet. It even grew enough to export. But production collapsed after the U.S. and international lenders forced the country to dramatically lower tariffs that protected local farmers, from 50 percent to 3 percent in the last three decades.

A quarter-century later, about 80 percent of Haiti's rice is imported, and the country is a major market for U.S. exporters. Faced with cheap imports, the country's dire poverty, natural disasters, lack of investment and collapsing infrastructure, production is still dropping in Haiti despite government efforts to halt the slide. Last year, the government reported a rise and a subsequent drop because of bad weather.

Some Haitian entrepreneurs say there is money to be made growing rice. Skeptics, however, say hopes to resurrect the rice industry are misplaced and, with too few resources and little international support, represent the challenges that many poor, underdeveloped countries face in turning their economies around.

Fabias Voltaire, 37, one Haitian trying to boost rice production, was able to reach an agreement to process his rice at a cooperative that is funded by the aid group Oxfam. He said there is a strong foreign demand for high-quality organic rice. It may cost more, but many regard it as healthier and better-tasting than American varieties. Plus, Haitian émigrés in the States love it, he says: ""Haitians are … very sentimental about eating rice from home.""

In 2015, Voltaire and two cousins launched Caribbean Grains LLC. Three years later, they are shipping to Florida, Alabama and other U.S. states.

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. About three-quarters of its 11 million people live on less than $2 a day and about half the population lives in rural settings. In 2010, following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated the country, former U.S. President Bill Clinton publicly apologized for forcing Haiti to drop its import tariffs and damaging the economy.

""It may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas, but it has not worked,"" said Clinton at the time, according to news reports . ""It was a mistake.""

Since then, hurricanes Sandy in 2012 and Matthew in 2016 cost Haiti hundreds of millions in agricultural losses, making it even harder to recover.

Jovenel Moise, who became Haiti's president in February 2017, has an agricultural background and pledged to relaunch the industry by fixing irrigation canals, financing infrastructure projects and other initiatives. By May 2017, the government had unveiled its program ""La Caravane du Changement"" – The Caravan of Change – to fund such infrastructure repairs. Although government estimates of the program's cost are difficult to obtain, Haitian news media reports say $55 million was spent in 2017 to repair the country's agriculture infrastructure.

Still, the challenges to boosting the country's rice industry are great. Production costs are high, and farmers have almost no access to loans or insurance to protect them from the ravages of insects and plant diseases.

The facts on the ground keep skepticism high that the initiatives will substantially boost rice production. Thousands of acres in the Artibonite Valley are waterlogged, making them prone to disease, especially around the time of harvests. Other parts of the valley aren't getting enough water.

Travis J. Lybbert, an economist and professor at the University of California-Davis who has done extensive research in the region, says the government's focus on better irrigation could make a big impact on rice production.

""It is relatively easy to make this happen,"" he says, adding that it would be much harder to provide access to inputs such as seed and fertilizer or create a better market for farm products.

The government can prioritize spending on agriculture without a lot of scrutiny, shortchanging other sectors of the economy in a country that is in desperate need of just about everything.

""These are very important and heavy costs that are easy to sweep under the rug as many other projects get delayed,"" Lybbert adds. ""That could be a real drag on development in other parts of the country.""

Looking out over a nearly dry river and irrigation canals that need to be cleaned and rebuilt, Agriculture Ministry representative Renaud Gene says Haiti has the political will to fix the problem, but not the means.

""There is a serious problem of water management, and it requires a lot of investments,"" he says.

The government has been fixing roads and canals but doesn't have the resources to make dramatic improvements. Instead of feeding Haitians in need with their own excess production, Gene says rich countries could assist Haiti more by helping develop its infrastructure, and then buying the rice from Haitian farmers to distribute.

In contrast with Voltaire, many in the region say a long history of failure leaves them pessimistic that anything will change. They regard the government initiative as at best populist and naïve. While not questioning the president's intentions, many simply aren't optimistic about the feasibility of breaking through the obstacles that exist.

""Jovenel is struggling like a poor devil but I am not sure where he's going,"" says Franklin Benjamin, an engineer and rice producer who has dedicated his career to finding ways to supply Haitians with locally produced rice.

For decades, attempts to develop the sector have failed, he says, because farmers never get the incentives and solid support system they need.

""Haiti doesn't interest Haitians. They are all looking to get a visa to go somewhere where they are despised,"" he adds. ""There is still a hope, but we will be disappointed like always.""

In the midst of such pessimism, Voltaire hopes that his success might inspire the next entrepreneur. And he has even bigger dreams.

""I want to create an agricultural bank for farmers,"" he says. ""The objective is to make Haiti the economic capital of the Caribbean.""

He splits his time between West Palm Beach, Florida, and Haiti and still plans to continue growing his business despite the challenges. He says he spent $10,000 to fix the irrigation canals he needed for his own production.

On his farm, Voltaire's workers take a pause to laugh and joke a bit around a broken-down tractor. The fact that the rice mill exists at all is a small miracle.",Efforts in Haiti to Boost Rice Production Face Many Obstacles,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-04-09/efforts-in-haiti-to-boost-rice-production-face-many-obstacles
19,haiti,"For the third straight year, Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril is spending part of his offseason in Haiti, his parents’ native country, where he and other NFL players have helped build a school.

The school, which is in La Chanm, a rural area in Haiti’s Central Plateau region, will be completed this year. Seeing the school completed two years after he, Marshawn Lynch and others were breaking ground with shovels will be a special moment for Avril.

“It has been awesome,” Avril said. “It has been great to be able to do something like this, to be able to go back to a country that I love so much as I’ve gotten to learn the history of the country and the people there, understanding who these people are and what they’re unfortunately going through. To be in a situation to be able to give back is the biggest thing for me. I have cousins who still live there, and I could easily be one of those kids. For me to be able to go back and see them and be able to give back, it’s an honor and a blessing. I’m just grateful to be able to have the platform to do so.”

This trip to Haiti will also be a special one for Avril because for the first time, he will visit his father’s hometown of Jacmel. Avril’s father, Jean Samuel, passed away in 2015, and Avril never made it back to Haiti with his dad, who moved to the United States in the 1980s. Cliff is taking his son, Xavier, as well as his mother, Marie, on the trip, where they’ll reconnect with Avril’s uncle and other relatives in Jacmel.

“I’ve never been to Jacmel,” Avril said. “I’ve heard it’s a beautiful part of the island. I never got to travel to Haiti with my dad growing up, so to be able to go back—I have an uncle there I’ve been communicating with, and he’s super excited about hosting us while we’re there.

“I think it’s going to be awesome for me personally. I never got to go back to Haiti with my dad, so to be going back with my son, and taking my mother with me, and showing him—because he always asks about grandad and all these different things—so to be able to show him where grandad grew up, where he’s from, and it being my first time there as well, I think it’s going to be an awesome experience and an awesome feeling to do that with my oldest.”

Finishing the school hardly means the end of Avril’s work in Haiti. Avril’s football future is still uncertain because of the neck injury that cut short his 2017 season, but regardless of what happens, he plans on finding new ways to help in Haiti. Avril mentioned the possibility of getting involved in the curriculum of the school he helped build, or even building another school. Or, after funding the construction of new houses following Hurricane Matthew, Avril and his wife, Tia, have talked about partnering with other Haitian-American NFL players to build more houses, or even an entire community in Haiti.

“Big picture, regardless of if I play ball or not, the goal is to continue to keep helping, continue to keep trying to make a difference over there,” said Avril, who is in the process of buying a house to make the Seattle-area his full-time home. “When you’re playing, you obviously have a bigger platform and are able to raise money and do different things, but regardless of what happens, the community here, they get behind us, they’ve helped me build this school, and I believe the opportunities will still be there as long as I continue to be a part of the community and do good things. So the goal is to continue to keep doing good things in Haiti, whether it’s building a community, maybe it’s another school project, I’m not sure. But I’m going to keep chopping away, that’s for sure, and hopefully the 12s continue to stick by my side and help with that process.”

One way 12s can help Avril continue his work in Haiti, as well as the work his Cliff Avril Family Foundation does with JDRF.org, is to attend his foundation’s Ping Pong Slam at SPiN Seattle on May 19.
