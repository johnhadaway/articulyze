Internal Trump administration documents obtained through a lawsuit show that, three weeks before a top federal immigration official wrote a memo recommending the end of so-called Temporary Relief Status for Haitians in America, he had been told by his own staff that the conditions that led to the TPS designation in the first place hadn’t changed.



On November 20, 2017, the Trump administration announced it would end TPS, which allows some 59,000 Haitians to live and work in the United States.



“Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” wrote USCIS Director Francis Cissna in a Nov. 3 memo for Department of Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

But in an October 17 memo, Cissna’s staff at USCIS directly contradicted this rosy picture. “Many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist,” the memo noted. (Both memos are embedded at the bottom of this post.)

The October report noted a list of issues still facing Haiti, including “food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.”

“Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have impeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew,” the report said, adding that this had “severely worsened the pre-existing humanitarian situation.”



“Due to the conditions outlined in this report, Haiti’s recovery from the 2010 earthquake could be characterized as falling into what one non-governmental organization recently described as ‘the country’s tragic pattern of one step forward, two steps back,’” the memo concluded—another direct contradiction of Cissna’s assertion that the country had “made significant progress.”

The documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit being litigated by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild and the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic.

“[Cissna] either completely disregarded his own agency’s report or he cherry-picked a few positive developments to justify his recommendation to terminate TPS for Haitians,” Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project, told Splinter.

Cissna’s memo is also riddled with oversimplifications of the state of affairs in Haiti.

In one section, he claimed that “Haiti successfully completed its presidential election in February 2017.”

But his agency’s October memo offered a more comprehensive view: “While Haiti succesfully completed its electoral process in February 2017 after two years of contested results and political crises, its new government faces various challenges to promote recovery and reconstruction.”

Cissna, the son of an immigrant who moved to the U.S. from Peru, recently changed USCIS’ mission statement to remove a passage that described the U.S. as “a nation of immigrants.”

He was nominated to lead USCIS by President Trump, who reportedly claimed that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS,” and that Haiti was a “shithole” country.

Attorneys in the case said the documents contain evidence that the White House did not perform a good-faith review of the conditions in Haiti.

The National Lawyers Guild, along with the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic, sued for the documents after the federal government failed to respond to their FOIA request. So far the Guild has received heavily redacted documents, but they believe the lawsuit will likely produce thousands of more pages of internal documents.

The National Lawyers Guild last month also filed a lawsuit that accused the Trump administration of violating federal procedures and the Fifth Amendment rights of Haitians.



Neither the White House nor USCIS responded to a request for comment. We’ll update this story if we hear from them.

Black lives struggle at the border

By Brian E. Muhammad -Staff Writer- | Last updated: May 9, 2018 - 7:46:58 AM

What's your opinion on this article?

A recent report, “Black Lives at the Border,” says migration across the U.S.-Mexican border has dramatically changed in the last decade. For the first time, non-Mexicans are most of the people crossing the border, and the total number of people crossing is the lowest since 1970.

The report, issued by the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, calls the problem a “human rights crises” where Black refugees and immigrants experience xenophobia, overt displays of White supremacy, violence and mistreatment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“What has been happening over the last 10, 15 years is like, there’s been a shift in who’s crossing the border,” said Benjamin N’dugga-Kabuye, Black Alliance for Just Immigration research and advocacy manager.

“Typically, we think of the U.S. southern border as crossed by predominately Mexican immigrants and usually that’s been the case for decades,” he said.

However, there are multiple reasons why there is a decline in Mexican immigrants and a spike in people from the Caribbean, Africa and other regions.

Mr. N’dugga-Kabuye told The Final Call the shifts have been attributed to demographic changes like lower birth rates in Mexico and a U.S. economic downturn that simultaneously happened with an economic upturn in Mexico. Along with the demographic change are hardships encountered with U.S. Border Patrol that helped decrease numbers, he added.

It’s an “extremely dangerous journey” and the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration system “violates a number of human rights,” Mr. N’dugga-Kabuye said.

The U.S.-Mexico border has been a hot button issue in American politics. Analysts note the debate intensified with the anti-immigrant policies of President Donald Trump who vowed to wall off the border to keep people out.

Rights activists say laws have become harsher over the 15 months of the Trump administration. They point to the Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements order, which aims to militarize the border, curb due process, increase detention and expand enforcement practices. U.S. laws that protect immigrants are aggressively being stripped away, nullifying protections for immigrants who fled disasters, civil strife and turmoil in their home countries, they said.

The Department of Homeland Security has terminated temporary protected status for immigrants from Haiti, Sudan, Liberia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Nepal. Honduras, Somalia and Yemen are due to be added, said experts.

“It is dumbfounding how this administration does not care to hide their bias and their fundamental problem of racism,” said Patrice Lawrence, national policy and advocacy director at Undocublack Network. The group wants Congress to speak out against measures that place people in dangerous positions.

“The list of instances of disregard for human rights and dignity just keeps getting longer,” Ms. Lawrence added.

Rights organizations are saying the ill treatment of immigrants from Black and Brown nations is nothing less than racist.

“I would say the immigration process is the same institutionalized racism that we see in all of the other institutions,” added Hugh Muhammad, the San Diego representative of the Nation of Islam.

San Diego was ground zero for activists fighting discriminatory practices of the U.S. government at the border. Mr. Muhammad was part of a delegation of leaders and organizers that heard first-hand accounts of the plight of Black immigrants.

“When we talk about immigration, we don’t deal too much with European nations who bring a lot of people in,” Mr. Muhammad said. He raised questions about a double standard when the U.S. considers who should be allowed in the country. Earlier this year President Trump asked why America keeps receiving immigrants from “shithole” African and Caribbean nations and suggested more immigrants be accepted from European countries.

Observers see U.S. anti-immigrant posture as hypocritical, saying the U.S. policy had a hand in creating some of the unlivable conditions immigrants flee.

“Many of these people are coming from countries where the U.S. has maintained and engaged in consistent intervention and destabilizing those countries,” said Mr. N’dugga-Kabuye. But, he said, when they get to the U.S. border they are faced with the U.S. military.

Haiti, parts of West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are examples where U.S. meddling helped cause unlivable conditions that pushed people to leave.

Organizations like the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, UndocuBlack Network, African Communities Together and concerned leaders are highlighting problems Black immigrants face and supporting the immigrants. Black migrants suffer everything from lack of adequate translation and legal services to poor healthcare and illegally receiving high bail when held in detention centers.

In 2016, when the alliance started hearing about the plight of Black migrants at the border, 19,000 African and Haitian migrants arrived in Mexico and upwards of 700 a day were arriving in Tapachula, Mexico. Border towns on the Mexican side reflect the changing face of migration, said the report. Getting to the U.S. side of the border is the culmination of a grueling and expensive journey.

Black migrants told Black Alliance for Just Immigration terrifying stories of exploitation, extreme danger and violence on the route to the border. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, migrants pay $5,000 to $10,000 each to smuggling networks for a journey across several nations. The agency estimates the smuggling business generates nearly $7 billion a year along Latin America’s routes to the U.S.

Aside from using smuggling networks, Black migrants walked or drove from as far away as Brazil through Central America and Mexico for entry into a U.S. that’s “quickly closing its doors to immigrants and Black people,” noted the report.

For Haitians, “some of them used to come by boat through the shores of Florida,” said Joseph Makhandal Champaign, an immigration attorney. “We know that there’s a lot of those who made these attempts, who perished in the sea.”

He blamed U.S. foreign policy that undermined the economy of Haiti and instigated political instability and interruption, causing Haitians to seek refuge in America. Advocates and organizers at the border estimate 4,000 Haitians were paroled into the U.S., 4,000 were detained or deported, and 3,000 were denied entry outright.

Attorney Champaign was part of a Black Alliance for Just Immigration-led delegation that traveled to San Diego and heard stories of Black migrants detained at the border.

Some Haitians migrated to neighboring Dominican Republic but were met with xenophobia and discrimination. Other Black migrants went to Brazil, which was receiving people from around the world seeking employment during the 2016 Summer Olympics there. When that boom ended there was an unemployment crisis. Black immigrants were victimized by racist treatment that targeted Black Brazilians.

The report told several stories of migrants navigating a difficult maze, escaping harrowing circumstances in their native lands, like Enzo, who hoped for political asylum.

Enzo is a teacher and activist from Guinea in West Africa. He left the country to escape persecution for anti-government activism. It became clear his life was in danger after fellow teachers began disappearing. He fled to Mali, where he flew to Brazil. Enzo traveled by foot through eight Latin American countries to Mexico.

Enzo faces problems many Haitians face, like being unable to find a lawyer to represent him and struggling as a French speaker in Spanish speaking countries.

In contrast to Washington’s militarization and anti-immigrant approach, report authors call for a “holistic strategy” to support Black immigrants, refugees, and advocates.

The Black Alliance for Just Immigration and its delegation identified steps to address the crisis. They called for funding Black immigrant and refugee organizations and advocacy initiatives as well as transitional support to Black migrants.

They also want ways to hold larger, more resourced, border organizations accountable for serving all migrants, including Black immigrants. Culturally competent attorneys and Creole and African-language interpreters are needed and Black leaders dealing with immigration and refugee advocacy must be part of organizations at the border, they said.

“What we’re seeing is only the beginning of this crisis … not only do we have an increased mass of Black people crossing the southern border, but they are also crossing with much less resources and support,” said Mr. N’dugga-Kabuye.",Black lives struggle at the border,https://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_105060.shtml

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL – On April 9th, the Brazilian government made the decision to grant priority treatment to Haitians who intend to live in Brazil. The government can now provide temporary visas and residence permits for humanitarian purposes up to two years.

The decree was published in the Official Gazette of the Federal Government and is authorized by the Itamaraty, the Ministries of Justice, Public Security, and Labor. The visa will be issued exclusively by the Brazilian embassy in Haiti’s capital city, Port-au-Prince.

While the visa can only be issued for two years, it can be transformed into an indefinite residence permit after the person has lived in Brazil for a period of two years. The government proclaims that the visa is determined on a humanitarian basis to provide shelter for those in need. The same regulations apply to stateless persons living in Haiti.

The decision was made to clarify details from the enforcement of the Migration Law, which came into effect last year. In a statement, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said that new regulations “can be published in the future to cover concrete situations”.

The Ministry also highlighted that the measure would tighten control of humanitarian policy for Haiti in the field of migration, and can prevent illegal and dangerous routes to Brazil. Since 2012, Brazil has granted over 60,000 visas in an effort to help Haiti rebuild itself after the 2010 earthquake that affected millions of Haitians and destroyed large parts of the country’s infrastructure.

As Brazil expects an increase in Haitian migrants, it will need to address the current lack of public policies, which have already come under criticism since the 2010 earthquake. Brazil is still pulling itself out of recession, and Haitian migrants living in Brazil have previously expressed concern about access to healthcare, education, and the labor market.",Brazilian Government Grants Haitians Humanitarian Visa,http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/brazilian-government-grants-haitians-humanitarian-visa/

The City of North Miami released a list of events to help locals celebrate. Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners Jean Monestime, always one to celebrate Haitian Heritage Month, attended the kick-off party that was held at the Perez Art Museum Miami on May 3.

The month of May holds a special place in Haitians’ hearts. In Haiti, Mother’s Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of May and the birth of Toussaint Louverture, the revolutionary general who won Haiti’s independence from France, is remembered on May 20.

Haitians make up a big part of the Magic City’s history, long before President Donald Trump referred to Haiti as a “shithole” country. Haiti’s red, white, and blue flag that was sewn by Catherine Flon can be found anywhere throughout Miami-Dade County.

Between 2011 and 2015, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area had the most concentration of Haitian immigrants in the country. According to Migration Policy Institute, in 2015, there were 676,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States. Brookings Institute says 18,600 Haitians live in Miami, making them the second largest immigrant group behind Cubans in the U.S.

Haitian Heritage Month, which was started in the 1930s by Dumarsais Estime, Haiti’s then minister of education, continues where Haitian Flag Day left.

Haiti - Petit-Goâve : Back in class at EFACAP, but the crisis persists





Friday, April 13, at the end of an extraordinary meeting, teachers strikers of the School of Fundamental School of Application and Teaching Support Center (EFACAP) of Petit-Goâve decided to resume the work suspended for almost 2 months http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-24083-haiti-petit-goave-students-of-efacap-deprived-of-classes-for-almost-2-months.html from Monday, April 16, while affirming ""[...] the crisis is far from being solved within this institution because of the complexity of the problems""



Striking teachers have not at all appreciated the criticisms of observers and parents who consider them as ""bad guys"" who wrongly penalize students at the risk of provoking school failure



They point out to detractor that it is the state that is responsible for the worsening of the situation, recalling that they had written correspondences and observed several truces following promises by the Minister of National Education who suggested that funding for the payment of arrears is already identified or available... Deploring that despite these affirmations and promises, nothing concrete has been done.



""Today, parents can not blame us for the situation [...] it is the Ministry that must be criticized, a Ministry that remains deaf and indifferent to our demands,"" argued the teachers in announcing their return to the classrooms on Monday, to show that they are animated in good faith...



""We will resume work. However, EFACAP of Petit-Goâve will still be blocked because this school faces other internal problems: as examples: the case of teacher Manasseh appointed but unpaid for more than 2 years; teacher transfer and drop-out issues that have not yet been addressed, and the case of some teachers who have a letter of appointment but are not yet receiving their salary or who are working but do not have letter of appointment... We doubt very much that the school can function normally,"" have nuanced strikers stressing that their presence in the classroom does not mean the end of the crisis.

Explosive new documents obtained through a FOIA request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reveal that the Trump Administration knew that deteriorating conditions within Haiti warranted an extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) but terminated the program anyway.

The Administration claimed that conditions in Haiti were improving to the point where families could return, even though their own secret report said the opposite. As the USCIS’ October 2017 TPS Considerations for Haiti report cites, ""Many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist, and the country remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal fragility. Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have impeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew—the latter of which struck Haiti in October 2016 and ‘severely worsened the pre-existing humanitarian situation’ in the country.""

First of all, a huge shout out to the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild for exposing this report. It’s now clear that the President and his officials blatantly lied to the American people about Haiti’s current conditions. Haiti is in no condition to accept the return of the nearly 60,000 Haitians with TPS. Haitian TPS holders should be allowed to remain in the U.S., and the program should be extended to new beneficiaries.

This report is further proof of the Administration’s ruthless pursuit of its ultimate goal: to kick out and keep out people of color – regardless of their connections to our shared country or of their desperate need. DHS Secretary Nielsen has a lot of explaining to do. Unfortunately, she seems so determined to kiss the ring of the Dear Leader in the White House, we won’t hold our breath.

Instead, Congress should step up and step in to make sure that common sense and common decency prevail.

8,haiti,"The reactionary, imperialist U.S. government is creating a new crisis for countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Part of it comes from Washington’s intention to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled civil war, state violence and natural disasters.

TPS status allowed them to stay in this country due to the dire conditions they would face if forced to return to their homelands. The average length of time they have lived in the U.S. is 22 years, meaning they have put down roots that would be terribly painful and disruptive to sever.

For instance, Hondurans living here under TPS have given birth to about 50,000 children, who automatically became citizens. Forcing their parents to leave would tear apart many families.

Immigration rights groups say that ending TPS will affect 57,000 Hondurans. Already, 200,000 Salvadorans have had their status revoked, as have tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and Haitians. Once a person’s status is revoked, the time by which they have to leave varies by their country of origin.

Actions by the U.S., including support for right-wing governments and military forces in the region, have made returning home terribly dangerous for many exiles.

This is nothing new. Washington and the Pentagon have for over a century promoted right-wing dictatorships in the region that take their cut of the huge profits U.S. corporations reap from oil, other minerals and crops like bananas.

Historically, Honduras has been under the heel of United Fruit Co., which morphed into United Brands and is now Chiquita Brands — all carrying out the same murderous exploitation of Honduran banana workers.

And in 1956, two years after the CIA overthrew the Jacobo Arbenz government in Guatemala, Juan José Arévalo, the previous president, wrote this to the people of the U.S.:

“From our southern lands, the river of millions began to flow northward, and every year it increased. The United States became great while progress in Latin America was brought to a halt. And when anything or anyone tried to interfere with the bankers or the companies, use was made of the Marines. Panama, 1903. Nicaragua, 1909. Mexico and Haiti, 1914. Santo Domingo, 1916.

“Along with the military apparatus, a new system of local ‘revolutions’ was manipulated — financed by the White House or by Wall Street, which were now the same. This procedure continued right up to the international scandal of the assault on Guatemala in 1954, an assault direct by Mr. Foster Dulles, with the okay of Mr. Eisenhower, who was your President at that time. …

“We do not want to continue down this slope that takes us straight to colonial status, however it may be disguised. … The North American example has been disastrous to us and has horrified us. We know that a government intimately linked to business and receiving favors from business loses its capacity to strive for the greatest possible happiness for the greatest number of its people. When businessmen become rulers, it is no longer possible to speak of social justice. …” (From Arévalo’s book, “The Shark and the Sardines.”)

How familiar this sounds! U.S. imperialism’s relations with most of Latin America have not changed since then.

Washington is still subsidizing counterrevolutionaries in Venezuela and Nicaragua. Vice President Pence is calling for the Organization of American States to suspend Venezuela, while sabotaging their economy and telling the country not to hold upcoming elections. Honduras is in the grips of a violent, U.S.-supported regime that rigged the recent election and has unleashed terror against progressives, workers and the Indigenous peoples.

Only Cuba has been able to decisively defeat both internal and external counterrevolution, thanks to its socialist revolution that completely smashed the Batista dictatorship and built organs of people’s power.

That coming from a man whose previous posts included Malawi, where he was Chief Executive Officer of the Malamulo Hospital in Makwasa, and a stint in Lusaka, Zambia, where he worked as executive director of Adventist Health International – Zambia. Even though those were challenging assignments, this one, in Haiti, he insists, remains the toughest.

But he relishes it.

It’s the challenges themselves that make the work so exciting, and the chances for doing good so rich and ever-present.

“The opportunities in Haiti are overwhelming,” Martin says. “But that’s why I’m here.”

Since 2014, Martin has been running the 54-bed facility that offers an emergency department, internal medicine, orthopedics, surgery, pediatrics, OB-GYN, urology, ophthalmology, oncology, neurology, rehabilitation and prosthetics. He has more than 20 fulltime physicians on staff. And, besides the patients in the hospital, its out-patient clinic serves about 40 people per day.

The mission statement is simple: “Building healthier communities through a developed workforce, connecting them to the Ultimate Physician, Jesus Christ.”

As the hospital administrator, Martin spends most of his time in meetings — meetings with staff, meetings with department heads, meetings with community leaders, meetings with bank officials. He thrives on his tasks, and is now working on new projects, including one in which the hospital reaches out to factories in the area so they can create a health plan for their employees.

He’s also working with Loma Linda University Health and Orlando-based Florida Hospital to develop a new out-patient clinic.

There’s also Operation Sunshine, a collaboration between Florida Hospital, My Neighbors Children and Haiti Adventist Hospital to provide free health care for all orphanages in Haiti that are affiliated with My Neighbors Children. Currently under this arrangement, the hospital is providing care to nearly 500 orphans.

In 2016, the hospital celebrated its 35th anniversary with the inauguration of a state-of-the-art surgical suite and a new private multi-med clinic. The event drew government officials who remember the hospital’s establishment in the early 1980s. For Martin, the new complex helped fulfill a life-long dream of doing the work of Christ, of healing and ministering, and doing it overseas as well.

Martin grew up in a town with a high concentration of fellow Adventists—Takoma Park, Maryland. His father worked for years as a security guard at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists world headquarters. As a child, his feet barely touching the floor, he remembers sitting in the Takoma Park Church one Saturday morning watching Mission Spotlight, stories about Adventist missionary work around the world.

“I thought to myself even way back then that I want to do this,” he recalls. “I wanted to spread the love of Christ overseas as a missionary.”

At Oakwood University in Huntsville, Alabama, where he studied biology, Martin became involved with missionary work. What first started out as feeding the homeless under nearby bridges grew bigger and bigger until it morphed into NAPS, National Association for the Prevention of Starvation—work that took him to Sudan, twice.

The missionary call inside him kept on growing.

After graduating from Oakwood, he worked at the university as the lab coordinator for the Department of Biological Sciences, which enabled him to take free classes. He completed health administration courses that had caught his interest.

Martin’s life changed soon after. One day, while reading the Bible in his office, he prayed: “God, I want to serve you overseas and in health care, but I’m not ready to go to medical school now.” Then his office phone rang. It was Donn Gaede, DrPH, from the Loma Linda University School of Public Health’s Health Administration Department. Martin’s name, Gaede said, had been sitting on his desk for months, and only at that moment did he feel impressed to call him. And he called to tell him that Loma Linda University was seeking to incorporate health administration with Adventist mission, and that the school wanted him to be a part of this work.

“I said to him, ‘You have no idea what you have just done,’” Martin recalls. Within a few months, Martin left for Loma Linda University, where he earned a master’s degree in health care administration from the School of Public Health. Before long he was overseas, fulling his dream of being a missionary and spreading the love of Christ, first with two different posts in Africa, and now, his toughest assignment to date—Haiti.

Yet, whatever the challenges, Martin is moving ahead in faith, believing he is doing God’s will in serving people there.

“This was once considered the best hospital in Haiti,” he says. “But over time, finances brought it to a crisis, and it lost a lot of its appeal to the community. We are trying to get it back. My great hope for Haiti Adventist Hospital is to see it become a self-sustaining institution that can provide curative and preventive treatment for the people on this island.”",Alumni Focus: The missionary administrator,https://news.llu.edu/wholeness/alumni-focus-missionary-administrator

2.1 million people affected by hurricane Matthew, with 546 fatalities

1 million people still need humanitarian assistance more than one year after hurricane Matthew 140 000 households still require shelter solutions.

4.4 million people acutely food insecure, of which 1.3 million people severely food insecure (October 2017, CNSA)

37 546 internally displaced people (IDPs) in 26 camps (IOM)

EU humanitarian funding: €388.35 million since 1994

Introduction

Due to its vulnerability to natural hazards and high levels of poverty, Haiti has limited capacity to cope with recurring emergencies caused by severe disasters, such as the 7.0 earthquake in 2010, recurrent hurricanes, and prolonged droughts worsened by the El Niño weather phenomenon.

Acute food insecurity and malnutrition, epidemics, and humanitarian needs generated by the ongoing migration crisis require sustained humanitarian assistance.

What are the needs?

Haiti is facing critical food and nutritional insecurity, with 4.4 million Haitians acutely food insecure and 131 000 malnourished children, a consequence of prolonged drought and the impacts of hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Irma (2017). More than a year after hurricane Matthew made landfall on the Haitian coasts, over 140 000 affected households still do not have access to minimum earthquake and seismic-resistant homes and shelters, thus remaining highly vulnerable to future shocks.

In 2017, 13 747 suspected cholera cases and 159 associated fatalities were registered, and 995 new suspected cases and 9 associated fatalities have been recorded during the first trimester of 2018.

Humanitarian needs still persist in remaining IDP camps set up after the 2010 earthquake. Roughly 37 500 Haitians are still sheltered in camps, where access to water and basic services remains very limited. Additionally, about 230 000 Dominicans of Haitian descent are at risk of becoming stateless and deported to Haiti. Since June 2015, over 260 000 individuals have crossed the border from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, including over 4 000 unaccompanied minors.",ECHO Factsheet – Haiti – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/echo-factsheet-haiti-april-2018

The Children’s Nutrition Program of Haiti will honor Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee with the Heart for Haiti Award at their 20 Years of Success celebration on Friday, May 18, 6:30 p.m., at Chattanooga’s Stratton Hall.

The benefit dinner will honor Senator Corker for his personal involvement with CNP’s humanitarian efforts, as well as his decades of public service locally, nationally, and internationally.

The May 18 celebration honors not only Senator Corker and CNP’s network of supporters, but also the accomplishments of CNP’s Haitian staff. The staff of health educators, called “monitrices,” are CNP’s boots on the ground. They walk for miles and miles each day to go to individual homes, organize community screening events, and offer life-saving intervention through song, stories, and hands-on nutrition and family planning training.

The empowerment of these 53 Haitian women, some of whom have suffered the effects of malnutrition themselves, has been the secret to CNP’s success. Their efforts, combined with specialized care facilities in Leogane and surrounding communities, resulted in the successful treatment of over 600 children for acute malnutrition in 2017 alone.

The CNP’s work depends on the generosity of hundreds of individuals, as well as corporate, nonprofit, and faith-based donating organizations. Proceeds from the 20 Years of Success fundraiser will go to Haiti, to support the work of CNP’s staff and supporting healthcare facilities.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR

Honduran Deana Quczada peels back her young daughter's black hair to reveal a deep scar on her forehead. She was beaten, Quczada says, six months ago as part of an apparent revenge attack on her family by gangs that Quczada's husband may have been mixed up with. When her daughter was released after spending a month in the hospital, Quczada immediately fled with her north in hopes of making it to the United States, where she could ask for political asylum.

I've heard that if you ask the U.S. for help, they will give it, she says in Spanish.

Quczada, 36, made it all the way to Tijuana before being turned away by U.S. customs authorities at the San Ysidro border crossing, the busiest port of entry on the U.S. border with Mexico. In recent days, customs officials have told her and dozens of other migrants that the facility was too overwhelmed to begin processing would-be asylum seekers. The Border Patrol has called it a temporary situation. But Quczada is starting to lose hope.

We had no other choice but to come here and we can't go back, Quczada says.

Her family has spent several chilly and drizzly nights sleeping out on the square next to the border crossing. They had an offer to stay with a family friend on the Mexican side, but it's more than two hours from here.

Quczada's is just one of many harrowing personal accounts you hear when you visit the encampment of asylum seekers, most from a highly-publicized recent caravan from Central America. Lately, the small tent city has been transformed into something more akin to a small refugee camp, with volunteers streaming in from both sides of the border to donate clothing, food and other supplies as people wait to hear if they can get into the U.S. to be processed.

Returning home is not an option

While the most recent caravan — there have been others like it in past years — is getting most of the attention from the Trump administration and the media, the fact is there were already many other migrants staying in Tijuana shelters for weeks, some much longer.

One of them is Haitian Jean Stevenson Dorvil, who has been waiting to get in for six months, working the odd job in Tijuana when he can. He spent six additional months just getting here from Venezuela, where he had been living. The journey overland through countries such as Colombia and Guatemala was dangerous at times, he says. Dorvil says he paid $1,000 just to get through Nicaragua.

""Right now it is very difficult to live in Venezuela,"" Dorvil says. Basic things are extremely expensive and jobs are scarce. The situation in Haiti is even more bleak. He says if he is granted permission to live and work in the U.S., his life will improve. There are jobs there, he says.

""I've got my family in Venezuela to help, my family in Haiti to help, every month I send them money,"" Dorvil says.

Like a lot of people here, Dorvil says returning home is not an option.

At last count, humanitarian aid workers here say at least a hundred migrants from the caravan are still waiting on the plaza, and then there are the estimated dozens more like Dorvil who were already here. Since Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials confirm that 28 asylum seekers from the caravan itself have been admitted into the U.S. for processing. Aid groups say some two dozen other migrants have been allowed into a more sheltered foyer at the border crossing so they don't have to camp outside in the cold. Their fate though, like those still outside, is far from certain.

Aid workers and migrants have been under pressure by the Mexican authorities to remove their encampment and go to shelters. Whether police will actually enforce that rule soon is uncertain. One aid worker told NPR that usually migrants are not allowed to camp outside on the streets, but that police weren't moving them due to the presence of all the TV cameras and news crews.

The Trump administration's messaging

Meanwhile, on Monday the Justice Department announced criminal charges against 11 suspected members of the Central American caravan for trying to cross the border illegally a few miles west of the San Ysidro port near the ocean. The arrests began last Friday, and included six migrants from Honduras, two from El Salvador, two from Guatemala and one from Mexico. A number of these migrants were apprehended in larger groups trying to cross the border illegally — groups that included migrants from India, Mexico and other countries. It is unclear whether or not these other migrants were criminally charged.

Immigration attorney Ginger Jacobs in San Diego said the criminal charges against the 11 migrants were ""highly unusual."" Most people apprehended for illegal entry are turned around and expeditiously removed from the U.S., she explained. These criminal charges are part of the Trump administration's messaging, she said. ""They are trying to dissuade future caravaners from attempting to come to the states"" to apply for asylum, Jacobs explained.

At the same time, she questioned whether these migrants were actually part of the caravan. Caravan participants were given extensive training in Mexico by human rights activists on how to apply for asylum, and were told repeatedly that if they tried to enter the U.S. illegally, they would be prosecuted.","In Tijuana, Migrants Seeking Asylum In The U.S. Tell Harrowing Stories Of Crisis",https://www.npr.org/2018/05/02/607726810/in-tijuana-migrants-seeking-asylum-in-the-u-s-tell-harrowing-stories-of-crisis
14,haiti,"A boy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, protests the decision by the Trump administration to end temporary protected status for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States. (Fernando Antonio/AP)

John D. Feeley was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2016 until March. James D. Nealon was U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 2014 to 2017.

Thanks to President Trump’s recent Twitter-trashing of Honduran asylum seekers in a caravan comprised of a few hundred desperate migrants, mainly women and young people, odds are that a good portion of Americans are at least aware of the hardship from which Hondurans immigrants have fled.

Less known, however, is that the Department of Homeland Security recently terminated the temporary protected status of 57,000 Hondurans living in the United States. Now these immigrants — all of whom have been in the United States since at least 1999, many much longer — must return to Honduras by Jan. 5, 2020.

These immigrants were legally permitted to stay in the United States under a status that four successive Republican and Democrat administrations chose to maintain over 14 periodic reviews, based on the conditions of underdevelopment, poverty and crime that still exist in Honduras.

By definition, these Hondurans are not criminals; felons are not eligible for TPS. Those with the status who commit serious crimes lose it and are placed in deportation proceedings — as any criminal migrant should be.

The Center for Migration Studies reports that 85 percent of the Honduran TPS beneficiaries work legally; much higher than the national average. No surprise there, since they came here to work. They are mainly construction workers, truck drivers, gardeners and child-care workers, hustling to make an average salary of $24,000 a year. The Center for American Progress and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimate that losing these working Hondurans would result in a productivity loss of $11 billion in gross domestic product over the next decade. And their lost Social Security contributions would be more than $1.3 billion over 10 years.

Yet even if one ignores these economic contributions to our nation, think of this fact: They have an estimated 53,000 American citizen children who now face losing their law-abiding parents to deportation. Talk about unfair.

As former American ambassadors with long experience in Central America and with the TPS program, we have to ask: Why does the administration think this makes sense as an “America First” policy? Why would they take people who legally work, pay taxes, own homes, run businesses, employ others and obey the law, and shove them into the shadows?

The justifications for termination are twofold: The administration reminds us that temporary protected status was always meant to be temporary. It also argues that the original conditions for which TPS was granted — the devastating Hurricane Mitch in 1998 that killed more than 7,000 people in Honduras alone — no longer exist.

We understand how such arguments would make sense under a strict constructionist view. But that needs to be weighed against the reality that the pathologies underlying the hurricane’s aftermath — extreme violence, lack of economic opportunity and poor governance — are the same factors that today drive irregular migration such as the caravan to the United States.

The Trump administration’s decision also undermines the fact that the United States and Honduras are working closely together to stem these “push factors” of migration. A bipartisan consensus in Congress has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance that has already had some major successes. Honduras’s murder rate, once the highest in the world at 86 per 100,000 (compared to five per 100,000 in the United States), has dropped to the low-40s per 100,000.

Through brave work by the Honduran attorney general, civil society and the international community, particularly the United States, Honduras is attempting to reduce corruption and impunity. And the economy is growing, though not nearly fast enough to provide work to those living in Honduras (never mind to those losing TPS status who will be forced to return).

Put yourself in their shoes. Would you voluntarily return to the still-troubled country you left two decades ago when you have been striving to live the American Dream? Neither would we. And, let’s face it. This isn’t who we are. We are a nation of immigrants, and it’s in our interest that we keep that dream alive for future generations.

Canceling TPS takes hard-working, legal immigrants and puts them in the shadows. It ensures that U.S. taxpayer assistance, designed to help Hondurans see their future in Honduras and not in the United States, works against itself. Trump’s U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, a daughter of Indian immigrants, recently visited Honduras and applauded the U.S. assistance programs designed to improve conditions there. When accused of “being a liberal,” she smiled and said, “I’m a conservative who understands that prevention saves us money in the long run.”

15,haiti,"Syracuse, N.Y. -- It didn't take long for Kielan Whitner to identify the source of the foul smell that engulfed his nostrils the first time he visited Haiti three years ago.

Trash was piled up around the roads. Some sections of litter were burning.

Before he began his volunteer work, or even stepped foot outside the car that he left in from the airport, Whitner had experienced a sample of what daily life was like for the people he'd be helping.

""It's a very eye-opening experience,"" Whitner said. ""The first time I went, I was just in such shock. You see third-world countries on TV and hear about all the struggle and poverty and tough situations there, but really (you need) to go to get a firsthand look at it, to take in everything from the sights to the smells -- constantly it just smells like gas and smoke.""

Whitner, a senior linebacker for Syracuse football, returned to Haiti for a week this winter with humanitarian group Eternal Hope In Haiti, assisting with construction on two orphanages and helping distribute free medical care to locals at clinics. The community service trips provided perspective for Whitner, whose father, Keith, has a longtime friend whose family runs Eternal Hope In Haiti.

""We see people in tough situations here,"" Whitner said, ""but even some of the people in tough situations in the United States have so much compared to the people in these countries.""

The Whitners, including Kielan's sister, Kayla, spent time volunteering in Cap-Haitien -- a community of about 190,000 people on the north coast of Haiti whose quality of living is harsh, Kielan Whitner said.

The main river that runs through the area is filled with garbage. Houses are in shoddy condition, some without a roof. Many locals walk around barefoot while children are often naked.

During the second trip, Whitner and his father installed solar panels and electric wiring at Eternal Hope In Haiti's orphanage in central Cap-Haitien, reserved for young children and teenage girls. They also built bunk beds for a newer orphanage set up for teenage boys on the outskirts of town.

At the medical clinics, Whitner interacted with locals who walked miles to receive free health care. Many were suffering from diseases or issues that were easily treatable in the United States.

Scabies, for instance, is a highly contagious skin disease that Americans usually can treat with a prescription. But without access to that medicine, children in Haiti suffer from an advanced version of the disease which damages their organs, Whitner said.

""One thing I really took away from the trip was just to appreciate the little things in life,"" Whitner said. ""I'm worried about football games, stuff like that, but these people are worried about where their next meal is coming from.""

Whitner keeps a personal keepsake on him at all times as a reminder of those who are struggling in Haiti. It's a bracelet that was given to him on his first trip, the summer before he enrolled at SU, by a Haitian boy named Rosny.

The two were the same age, but Rosny, who appeared to have been malnourished, looked years younger than Whitner, he said. However, Rosny expressed positivity and spirituality -- and that graciousness for life stuck with Whitner.

""I just felt like him being able to be so loving and kind and worry-free despite so much struggle was really inspiring,"" Whitner said.

The plight of the people of Haiti has become personal for Whitner, who believes the work of Eternal Hope In Haiti can help change lives. In addition to the housing and free medical care, the organization is paying for the education of every child who lives in one of the orphanages -- all the way through college if they stay enrolled.

Said Whitner: ""I would say that's so major there. If you're able to get an education, I would say that's a way you can get out of that situation.

""But if you're in that situation, don't have money -- and if you don't have money and you can't get an education -- I just don't see how that cycle ever ends. There's just so much corruption in that country, which makes it tough for people to get out of impoverished situations.""

16,haiti,"Democrat Senators Seek Answers After Termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians

By Space Coast Daily // May 9, 2018

WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) today led a group of a dozen U.S. senators in calling on the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to explain what they call a “deeply troubling and potentially politically motivated” decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the United States.

In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and USCIS Director Lee Francis Cissna, the senators point to an Oct. 2017 USCIS report that described current conditions in Haiti as “vulnerable to external shocks and internal fragility,” and further concluded that Haiti is “unable to adequately respond to a wide range of persistent humanitarian needs.”

Yet, despite its own assessment, one month later USCIS and Homeland Security rescinded TPS for 58,000 Haitians in the U.S and characterized the situation on the island as no longer needing the designation.

“The November 2017 decision to terminate Haiti’s TPS designation marked a stunning reversal of this assessment of the conditions in Haiti,” the senators wrote. “Moreover, in light of the president’s widely reported offensive comments about Haiti and African nations being ‘s***hole countries,’ these documents raise serious questions regarding whether the Administration’s decision to terminate Haiti’s TPS was based on the conditions in Haiti – as required by law – or whether the decision resulted from broader political concerns, including an animus towards the country and its nationals.”

The senators called for the immediate reconsideration of the administration’s decision to terminate Haiti’s TPS designation.

In addition to Nelson and Markey, the letter was signed by U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Tina Smith (D-MN) Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL).
