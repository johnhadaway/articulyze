MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now we want to spend a few minutes with Richard Stearns, president of World Vision USA, the Christian humanitarian organization.

Under Mr. Stearns' leadership, World Vision has become one of the world's largest charities with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Its focus is on children in 90 countries. Earlier this year, Mr. Stearns announced that he was stepping down after 20 years at the helm, so we thought this would be a good time to check in with him to hear his thoughts about his work and his mission. He was kind enough to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C.

Richard Stearns, thank you so much for being with us.

RICHARD STEARNS: Well, thanks, Michel. Great to be here.

MARTIN: Before your service at World Vision, you were CEO of the Lenox china company, which I think many people would know. So how did you go from Lenox china to heading up what has become one of the world's largest charities? What was the connection?

STEARNS: Well, it's kind of a crazy story. About the only commonality is that both organizations were involved in feeding the hungry. Lenox fed them on fine china, but World Vision obviously deals with hunger around the world. But the decision to come to World Vision really came out of my faith background.

I was a Christian, considered myself committed to my faith, and this was an opportunity not just to talk the talk but to walk the walk. And so my wife and I had been donors to World Vision for almost 15 years before the phone call came, and it was from an executive recruiter. Essentially, made the decision to quit my job, sell our house, move our family to Seattle, where the sun rarely shines. And 60 days later, I was in the jungles of Uganda in the middle of the AIDS pandemic.

MARTIN: What exactly does World Vision do? Just talk a little bit, if you would, about what World Vision does.

STEARNS: Well, we're often described as a relief and development organization. And so most people understand emergency relief. You know, it's the Syrian refugee crisis. It's the Haiti earthquake. It's the hurricanes in Houston. It's flooding in Bangladesh. And people are desperate. They're in the world's emergency room, and we're like the emergency room doctors that go in and try to stabilize and help traumatized people. Syrian refugee crisis would be a good example. We are in the five most affected countries in the Middle East. We're doing clean water for tent settlements of refugees. We're doing some health work. We're the World Food Program's largest implementing partner in terms of food vouchers and making sure that these refugees have sustenance. But maybe more important than even that is to try to provide hope for people who are, right now, in hopeless situations.

MARTIN: When you talk about providing hope, though, you know - and I'm sure you're aware of this - in recent years, some have become more critical of these organizations. The feeling is that sometimes relief workers are really there to save themselves. Their focus is really on their own kind of experience as opposed to providing actual service.

STEARNS: Well, I really reject that. Our staff on the frontlines in these places - in the South Sudan Civil War, in the middle of the Syrian refugee crisis - these are courageous people. There's rarely a year goes by that there isn't a World Vision worker killed in the line of duty. And so I don't believe it's that kind of motivation for most of them.

MARTIN: What is the motivation for most of them?

STEARNS: Well, for World Vision, it's our faith. You know, Matthew 25 - that famous passage - I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. Jesus said whatever you have done for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you've done it to me. Mother Teresa claimed that first. And she said when she worked among the poor in Calcutta, she said I saw the face of Jesus in his most distressing disguise.

MARTIN: Twenty years is a long time to lead an organization, so it's kind of hard to summarize, but what would you say was the high point of your tenure and what was the low point?

STEARNS: Well, you know, most of what we do is in the low points of the world and - because we only go where the most-hurting people are. So one of the things you have to deal with is just the constant exposure to human suffering. But I think our finest hours have been when we have become champions for major issues in our world. And I think I'd point first to the AIDS pandemic. In the early 2000s, there was a lot of ignorance around what AIDS was doing to Africa. Americans were largely unaware. And of course, AIDS was stigmatized.

And so we went on a 15-city tour of the United States, speaking to pastors, speaking to business leaders, speaking to the press, trying to raise awareness and support for AIDS in Africa. And it was a high point because we were instrumental in lobbying for the PEPFAR program, the President's Emergency Plan For Aids Relief, that came under President Bush. And it was the largest foreign-assistance program ever passed by Congress since the Marshall Plan back in the 1940s. And we helped to turn the tide for HIV and AIDS. And the PEPFAR initiative alone has probably saved 12 million lives and counting.

MARTIN: Asking again about low moments - in this country, one of the stories that some associate as a low moment under your tenure was in 2014 when you announced that World Vision would change its policies to hire LGBT Christians in same-sex marriages. But after a backlash from some of your prominent supporters - donors - you rescinded that and said that you would not change the policy. What do you think? I mean, did you do the right thing?

STEARNS: Yeah. Well, you know, there are so many things that can divide us as a faith community. So we're a faith-based organization. We're a community of people with faith values that we hold deeply. And we're a multi-denominational organization. We were trying to find a space of unity beyond the controversies of this issue, and we were unsuccessful in doing it. And we got out ahead of our constituencies, and it really distracted us from our core mission of joining hands to help the poor and to do it in the name of Christ. And so we did reverse the policy so that we could move on and really get back to focusing on what we think our core mission is in the world.

MARTIN: Before we let you go, I wanted to ask, do you have some sort of thoughts about how kind of faith has integrated in your own life?

STEARNS: Well, you know, for me, faith is the bedrock of my life. And you know, I became a Christian at age 24. I'd been an atheist. And through my wife and my relationship with her before we got married - she was a committed Christian - her testimony to me and through some friends and through a lot of reading of C.S. Lewis and John Stott and other theologians, I really came to the conclusion that the Christian story was, in fact, true and real.

And I remember the day that I knelt down in my dormitory room at the Wharton School of Business, of all places, and I made a commitment to Christ and said, I want to live my life for you. I want to become more like you. And I will go where you call and follow where you lead. And so that explains why, in 1998, when a recruiter called me and said, how would you like to leave your large salary and your corporate Jaguar and your beautiful home in the suburbs and come and serve the poorest people in the world? I mean, that answer had to be yes because it was almost like God was saying, are you going to make good on that commitment that you made when you were 24 years old? - because I've got a job that I want done, and I'm inviting you to do it.

MARTIN: That is Richard Stearns. He is concluding 20 years as president of the Christian charity World Vision USA. It's one of the world's largest. He was kind enough to join us in our studios here in Washington, D.C.

Richard Stearns, thank you so much for speaking with us.

STEARNS: Thanks, Michel.

Haiti - Petit-Goâve : Back in class at EFACAP, but the crisis persists





Friday, April 13, at the end of an extraordinary meeting, teachers strikers of the School of Fundamental School of Application and Teaching Support Center (EFACAP) of Petit-Goâve decided to resume the work suspended for almost 2 months http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-24083-haiti-petit-goave-students-of-efacap-deprived-of-classes-for-almost-2-months.html from Monday, April 16, while affirming ""[...] the crisis is far from being solved within this institution because of the complexity of the problems""



Striking teachers have not at all appreciated the criticisms of observers and parents who consider them as ""bad guys"" who wrongly penalize students at the risk of provoking school failure



They point out to detractor that it is the state that is responsible for the worsening of the situation, recalling that they had written correspondences and observed several truces following promises by the Minister of National Education who suggested that funding for the payment of arrears is already identified or available... Deploring that despite these affirmations and promises, nothing concrete has been done.



""Today, parents can not blame us for the situation [...] it is the Ministry that must be criticized, a Ministry that remains deaf and indifferent to our demands,"" argued the teachers in announcing their return to the classrooms on Monday, to show that they are animated in good faith...



""We will resume work. However, EFACAP of Petit-Goâve will still be blocked because this school faces other internal problems: as examples: the case of teacher Manasseh appointed but unpaid for more than 2 years; teacher transfer and drop-out issues that have not yet been addressed, and the case of some teachers who have a letter of appointment but are not yet receiving their salary or who are working but do not have letter of appointment... We doubt very much that the school can function normally,"" have nuanced strikers stressing that their presence in the classroom does not mean the end of the crisis.

4,haiti,"Washington (CNN) Newly released internal documents are raising questions about the Trump administration's decision to end protections for tens of thousands of Haitian immigrants -- and whether the argument that the protections were no longer merited was valid.

Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has been aggressive in ending a number of temporary protected status designations that have been on the books, in some cases, for decades.

Roughly 300,000 people who have lived in the US with legal permission, most of whom have been here for upward of 15-20 years, could have their status pulled in the coming months as the protections expire. In the case of Haiti, nearly 60,000 immigrants are set to see their status expire next year.

The justification from the administration for ending the protections has been that by law, when the conditions from the original disaster that triggered the protections have improved, they must expire. DHS has been clear that it does not believe it can look at the totality of conditions in the country to factor in its decision making.

But the documents released Tuesday as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit raise questions about whether DHS was accurately interpreting information in drawing those conclusions.

WEST MILFORD — Andrew Topp built schoolrooms for orphans in Haiti, transported at-risk shelter dogs from the South to a local rescue center, and brought water filtration devices to hurricane-wrecked portions of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean.

Friends and fellow humanitarians said Friday that the minister and contractor from North Haledon killed in a plane crash near Greenwood Lake Airport on Wednesday was probably the nicest person they had ever met.

“He was just fearless, and this guy never complained about anything,” said friend Victor Barton. “There was nothing he couldn’t do. He taught me how to weld in an hour.”

Topp crashed shortly after takeoff at about 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, authorities said.

His plane, a 1968 Piper PA-32-300, struck low-lying power lines about 1,000 feet south of the airport and clipped several trees before crashing in a piece of state parkland once home to the Warner Bros. Jungle Habitat theme park. The resulting fire bleached his yellow, purple, and white plane beyond recognition.

On Friday, Barton recalled meeting up with Topp in Les Cayes, Haiti. The two volunteered there several years ago, turning cargo containers and corrugated panels into a schoolroom for 25 young girls. All of the girls were orphans; many as a result of natural disasters, Barton said.

“It was just shocking. Here you have this completely white gentleman, you know, and he’s right out there in the middle of it … and it's 102 degrees,” Barton said. “That was his whole life, dedicating his life to helping people all over the Caribbean, especially Haiti.""

Barton, a business owner from North Plainfield, said he spoke with Topp, the 20-year reverend at First Reformed Church of Boonton, a few weeks ago. The two talked about their week in Haiti – “one of the best experiences I ever had,” Barton said. Barton credited that lifelong memory to Topp’s demeanor, experience and energy.

“He flew children here from Haiti for heart surgery. He was just amazing. It’s shocking that he’s no longer with us,” Barton said. “I really hope somebody takes the reigns of his foundation because it’s a great cause. He was doing a lot of good and a lot of people were depending on him.”

Topp’s foundation, the International Humanitarian Aid Foundation, released a statement on social media Wednesday stating that Topp’s “work and legacy will resonate with us all, and his mission to help those in need will continue for generations to come.”

“His can-do attitude and creativity for fixing, building, and restoration helped so many children,” the statement read. “These children now have bright futures thanks to the amazing resources Andy and his creation - IHAF- have provided.”

In addition to helping people, Topp would often stop on his way back from the Caribbean to help rescue dogs with the Home for Good rescue center in Summit.

Richard Errico, the co-founder of Home for Good, said he first met Topp through a national nonprofit that connects pilots and shelters. Soon after, Topp started flying exclusively for Home for Good, Errico said. Topp ultimately brought more than 300 dogs from high-kill shelters in the South to New Jersey.

“It went from just being a relationship as far as the dogs were concerned to actually being a friendship,” Errico said.

Home for Good typically relies on a van to transport 20 to 30 dogs at a time. The 12- to 14-hour trip can be stressful for the animals, he said. Topp could make the trip in four hours. Topp also attended shelter events, stayed overnight in Aiken, and made special trips to The Carolinas to transport upwards of two dozen rescue dogs. One was a day trip with Errico.

“He was always the initiator [and] he was never in a bad mood,” Errico said. “He was that type of person, who you could share your experiences with. He was a good listener. He was just one of the nicest people that I have ever met.”

The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

A preliminary report with some flight records is expected to be released next week. However, a full report identifying the probable cause of the accident could take 12 to 18 months to complete, said Terry Williams, a NTSB public affairs officer.

Topp's daughter, Erica Topp Fischer-Kaslander, said Thursday that her father stored his colorful plane at Greenwood Lake Airport. He was experienced with both the aircraft and the occasionally windy conditions above the hilly terrain near the New York State border, she said.

6,haiti,"Get in touch with Miami’s Haitian side by celebrating Haitian Heritage Month, 31 days filled with parties, art exhibits, and festivals.

The City of North Miami released a list of events to help locals celebrate. Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners Jean Monestime, always one to celebrate Haitian Heritage Month, attended the kick-off party that was held at the Perez Art Museum Miami on May 3.

The month of May holds a special place in Haitians’ hearts. In Haiti, Mother’s Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of May and the birth of Toussaint Louverture, the revolutionary general who won Haiti’s independence from France, is remembered on May 20.

Haitians make up a big part of the Magic City’s history, long before President Donald Trump referred to Haiti as a “shithole” country. Haiti’s red, white, and blue flag that was sewn by Catherine Flon can be found anywhere throughout Miami-Dade County.

Between 2011 and 2015, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area had the most concentration of Haitian immigrants in the country. According to Migration Policy Institute, in 2015, there were 676,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States. Brookings Institute says 18,600 Haitians live in Miami, making them the second largest immigrant group behind Cubans in the U.S.

Haitian Heritage Month, which was started in the 1930s by Dumarsais Estime, Haiti’s then minister of education, continues where Haitian Flag Day left.

Internal Trump administration documents obtained through a lawsuit show that, three weeks before a top federal immigration official wrote a memo recommending the end of so-called Temporary Relief Status for Haitians in America, he had been told by his own staff that the conditions that led to the TPS designation in the first place hadn’t changed.



On November 20, 2017, the Trump administration announced it would end TPS, which allows some 59,000 Haitians to live and work in the United States.



“Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” wrote USCIS Director Francis Cissna in a Nov. 3 memo for Department of Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

But in an October 17 memo, Cissna’s staff at USCIS directly contradicted this rosy picture. “Many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist,” the memo noted. (Both memos are embedded at the bottom of this post.)

The October report noted a list of issues still facing Haiti, including “food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.”

“Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have impeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew,” the report said, adding that this had “severely worsened the pre-existing humanitarian situation.”



“Due to the conditions outlined in this report, Haiti’s recovery from the 2010 earthquake could be characterized as falling into what one non-governmental organization recently described as ‘the country’s tragic pattern of one step forward, two steps back,’” the memo concluded—another direct contradiction of Cissna’s assertion that the country had “made significant progress.”

The documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit being litigated by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild and the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic.

Screenshot: USCIS memo

“[Cissna] either completely disregarded his own agency’s report or he cherry-picked a few positive developments to justify his recommendation to terminate TPS for Haitians,” Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project, told Splinter.

Cissna’s memo is also riddled with oversimplifications of the state of affairs in Haiti.

In one section, he claimed that “Haiti successfully completed its presidential election in February 2017.”

But his agency’s October memo offered a more comprehensive view: “While Haiti succesfully completed its electoral process in February 2017 after two years of contested results and political crises, its new government faces various challenges to promote recovery and reconstruction.”

Cissna, the son of an immigrant who moved to the U.S. from Peru, recently changed USCIS’ mission statement to remove a passage that described the U.S. as “a nation of immigrants.”

He was nominated to lead USCIS by President Trump, who reportedly claimed that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS,” and that Haiti was a “shithole” country.

Attorneys in the case said the documents contain evidence that the White House did not perform a good-faith review of the conditions in Haiti.

The National Lawyers Guild, along with the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic, sued for the documents after the federal government failed to respond to their FOIA request. So far the Guild has received heavily redacted documents, but they believe the lawsuit will likely produce thousands of more pages of internal documents.

The National Lawyers Guild last month also filed a lawsuit that accused the Trump administration of violating federal procedures and the Fifth Amendment rights of Haitians.



Neither the White House nor USCIS responded to a request for comment. We’ll update this story if we hear from them.

9,haiti,"This story originally appeared in Scope magazine.

Edward Martin is now working in what he says is the toughest assignment of his life.

Loma Linda University graduate (Master’s, Health Care Administration, 2005) Martin is the General Director/Chief Executive Officer at Hopital Adventiste d’Haiti (Haiti Adventist Hospital) in Port-au-Prince. The challenges are staggering in the Caribbean nation that CIA World Factbook says is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. The average life expectancy is less than 64 years.

“There are very limited resources here,” Martin says. “There are challenges with infrastructure, high unemployment—a very tough environment all the way around. Cash flow remains a constant struggle. I can say that this has been the most difficult post I have ever had.”

That coming from a man whose previous posts included Malawi, where he was Chief Executive Officer of the Malamulo Hospital in Makwasa, and a stint in Lusaka, Zambia, where he worked as executive director of Adventist Health International – Zambia. Even though those were challenging assignments, this one, in Haiti, he insists, remains the toughest.

But he relishes it.

It’s the challenges themselves that make the work so exciting, and the chances for doing good so rich and ever-present.

“The opportunities in Haiti are overwhelming,” Martin says. “But that’s why I’m here.”

Since 2014, Martin has been running the 54-bed facility that offers an emergency department, internal medicine, orthopedics, surgery, pediatrics, OB-GYN, urology, ophthalmology, oncology, neurology, rehabilitation and prosthetics. He has more than 20 fulltime physicians on staff. And, besides the patients in the hospital, its out-patient clinic serves about 40 people per day.

The mission statement is simple: “Building healthier communities through a developed workforce, connecting them to the Ultimate Physician, Jesus Christ.”

As the hospital administrator, Martin spends most of his time in meetings — meetings with staff, meetings with department heads, meetings with community leaders, meetings with bank officials. He thrives on his tasks, and is now working on new projects, including one in which the hospital reaches out to factories in the area so they can create a health plan for their employees.

He’s also working with Loma Linda University Health and Orlando-based Florida Hospital to develop a new out-patient clinic.

There’s also Operation Sunshine, a collaboration between Florida Hospital, My Neighbors Children and Haiti Adventist Hospital to provide free health care for all orphanages in Haiti that are affiliated with My Neighbors Children. Currently under this arrangement, the hospital is providing care to nearly 500 orphans.

In 2016, the hospital celebrated its 35th anniversary with the inauguration of a state-of-the-art surgical suite and a new private multi-med clinic. The event drew government officials who remember the hospital’s establishment in the early 1980s. For Martin, the new complex helped fulfill a life-long dream of doing the work of Christ, of healing and ministering, and doing it overseas as well.

Martin grew up in a town with a high concentration of fellow Adventists—Takoma Park, Maryland. His father worked for years as a security guard at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists world headquarters. As a child, his feet barely touching the floor, he remembers sitting in the Takoma Park Church one Saturday morning watching Mission Spotlight, stories about Adventist missionary work around the world.

“I thought to myself even way back then that I want to do this,” he recalls. “I wanted to spread the love of Christ overseas as a missionary.”

At Oakwood University in Huntsville, Alabama, where he studied biology, Martin became involved with missionary work. What first started out as feeding the homeless under nearby bridges grew bigger and bigger until it morphed into NAPS, National Association for the Prevention of Starvation—work that took him to Sudan, twice.

The missionary call inside him kept on growing.

After graduating from Oakwood, he worked at the university as the lab coordinator for the Department of Biological Sciences, which enabled him to take free classes. He completed health administration courses that had caught his interest.

Martin’s life changed soon after. One day, while reading the Bible in his office, he prayed: “God, I want to serve you overseas and in health care, but I’m not ready to go to medical school now.” Then his office phone rang. It was Donn Gaede, DrPH, from the Loma Linda University School of Public Health’s Health Administration Department. Martin’s name, Gaede said, had been sitting on his desk for months, and only at that moment did he feel impressed to call him. And he called to tell him that Loma Linda University was seeking to incorporate health administration with Adventist mission, and that the school wanted him to be a part of this work.

“I said to him, ‘You have no idea what you have just done,’” Martin recalls. Within a few months, Martin left for Loma Linda University, where he earned a master’s degree in health care administration from the School of Public Health. Before long he was overseas, fulling his dream of being a missionary and spreading the love of Christ, first with two different posts in Africa, and now, his toughest assignment to date—Haiti.

Yet, whatever the challenges, Martin is moving ahead in faith, believing he is doing God’s will in serving people there.

“This was once considered the best hospital in Haiti,” he says. “But over time, finances brought it to a crisis, and it lost a lot of its appeal to the community. We are trying to get it back. My great hope for Haiti Adventist Hospital is to see it become a self-sustaining institution that can provide curative and preventive treatment for the people on this island.”",Alumni Focus: The missionary administrator,https://news.llu.edu/wholeness/alumni-focus-missionary-administrator

(CNN) - Here's a look at cholera, an acute diarrheal illness which kills thousands of people worldwide each year.

Facts: Cholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae.

Dehydration from rapid loss of body fluids is the reason the disease can be so deadly within hours if the patient is not treated.

The disease's short incubation period of two hours to five days increases the likelihood of outbreaks.

Eighty percent of cholera cases can be treated and resolved with oral hydration salts.

There are three, two-dose oral cholera vaccines available, Dukoral, ShanChol and Euvicho, but it may take weeks for an individual to have full protection.

Cholera is rare in industrialized nations.

People who live in areas with poor or inadequate water treatment, sanitation and hygiene practices are more likely to get the disease.

The Children’s Nutrition Program of Haiti will honor Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee with the Heart for Haiti Award at their 20 Years of Success celebration on Friday, May 18, 6:30 p.m., at Chattanooga’s Stratton Hall.

The benefit dinner will honor Senator Corker for his personal involvement with CNP’s humanitarian efforts, as well as his decades of public service locally, nationally, and internationally.

The May 18 celebration honors not only Senator Corker and CNP’s network of supporters, but also the accomplishments of CNP’s Haitian staff. The staff of health educators, called “monitrices,” are CNP’s boots on the ground. They walk for miles and miles each day to go to individual homes, organize community screening events, and offer life-saving intervention through song, stories, and hands-on nutrition and family planning training.

The empowerment of these 53 Haitian women, some of whom have suffered the effects of malnutrition themselves, has been the secret to CNP’s success. Their efforts, combined with specialized care facilities in Leogane and surrounding communities, resulted in the successful treatment of over 600 children for acute malnutrition in 2017 alone.

The CNP’s work depends on the generosity of hundreds of individuals, as well as corporate, nonprofit, and faith-based donating organizations. Proceeds from the 20 Years of Success fundraiser will go to Haiti, to support the work of CNP’s staff and supporting healthcare facilities.

To attend the 20 Years of Success Event, or learn how to help save children’s lives, visit cnphaiti.org, call 495-1122 or email Patricia Cyr Watlington at pcyrwatlington@cnphaiti.org.

Honduran Deana Quczada peels back her young daughter's black hair to reveal a deep scar on her forehead. She was beaten, Quczada says, six months ago as part of an apparent revenge attack on her family by gangs that Quczada's husband may have been mixed up with. When her daughter was released after spending a month in the hospital, Quczada immediately fled with her north in hopes of making it to the United States, where she could ask for political asylum.

I've heard that if you ask the U.S. for help, they will give it, she says in Spanish.

Quczada, 36, made it all the way to Tijuana before being turned away by U.S. customs authorities at the San Ysidro border crossing, the busiest port of entry on the U.S. border with Mexico. In recent days, customs officials have told her and dozens of other migrants that the facility was too overwhelmed to begin processing would-be asylum seekers. The Border Patrol has called it a temporary situation. But Quczada is starting to lose hope.

We had no other choice but to come here and we can't go back, Quczada says.

Her family has spent several chilly and drizzly nights sleeping out on the square next to the border crossing. They had an offer to stay with a family friend on the Mexican side, but it's more than two hours from here.

Quczada's is just one of many harrowing personal accounts you hear when you visit the encampment of asylum seekers, most from a highly-publicized recent caravan from Central America. Lately, the small tent city has been transformed into something more akin to a small refugee camp, with volunteers streaming in from both sides of the border to donate clothing, food and other supplies as people wait to hear if they can get into the U.S. to be processed.

Returning home is not an option

While the most recent caravan — there have been others like it in past years — is getting most of the attention from the Trump administration and the media, the fact is there were already many other migrants staying in Tijuana shelters for weeks, some much longer.

One of them is Haitian Jean Stevenson Dorvil, who has been waiting to get in for six months, working the odd job in Tijuana when he can. He spent six additional months just getting here from Venezuela, where he had been living. The journey overland through countries such as Colombia and Guatemala was dangerous at times, he says. Dorvil says he paid $1,000 just to get through Nicaragua.

""Right now it is very difficult to live in Venezuela,"" Dorvil says. Basic things are extremely expensive and jobs are scarce. The situation in Haiti is even more bleak. He says if he is granted permission to live and work in the U.S., his life will improve. There are jobs there, he says.

""I've got my family in Venezuela to help, my family in Haiti to help, every month I send them money,"" Dorvil says.

Like a lot of people here, Dorvil says returning home is not an option.

At last count, humanitarian aid workers here say at least a hundred migrants from the caravan are still waiting on the plaza, and then there are the estimated dozens more like Dorvil who were already here. Since Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials confirm that 28 asylum seekers from the caravan itself have been admitted into the U.S. for processing. Aid groups say some two dozen other migrants have been allowed into a more sheltered foyer at the border crossing so they don't have to camp outside in the cold. Their fate though, like those still outside, is far from certain.

Aid workers and migrants have been under pressure by the Mexican authorities to remove their encampment and go to shelters. Whether police will actually enforce that rule soon is uncertain. One aid worker told NPR that usually migrants are not allowed to camp outside on the streets, but that police weren't moving them due to the presence of all the TV cameras and news crews.

The Trump administration's messaging

Meanwhile, on Monday the Justice Department announced criminal charges against 11 suspected members of the Central American caravan for trying to cross the border illegally a few miles west of the San Ysidro port near the ocean. The arrests began last Friday, and included six migrants from Honduras, two from El Salvador, two from Guatemala and one from Mexico. A number of these migrants were apprehended in larger groups trying to cross the border illegally — groups that included migrants from India, Mexico and other countries. It is unclear whether or not these other migrants were criminally charged.

Immigration attorney Ginger Jacobs in San Diego said the criminal charges against the 11 migrants were ""highly unusual."" Most people apprehended for illegal entry are turned around and expeditiously removed from the U.S., she explained. These criminal charges are part of the Trump administration's messaging, she said. ""They are trying to dissuade future caravaners from attempting to come to the states"" to apply for asylum, Jacobs explained.

At the same time, she questioned whether these migrants were actually part of the caravan. Caravan participants were given extensive training in Mexico by human rights activists on how to apply for asylum, and were told repeatedly that if they tried to enter the U.S. illegally, they would be prosecuted.","In Tijuana, Migrants Seeking Asylum In The U.S. Tell Harrowing Stories Of Crisis",https://www.npr.org/2018/05/02/607726810/in-tijuana-migrants-seeking-asylum-in-the-u-s-tell-harrowing-stories-of-crisis

2.1 million people affected by hurricane Matthew, with 546 fatalities

1 million people still need humanitarian assistance more than one year after hurricane Matthew 140 000 households still require shelter solutions.

4.4 million people acutely food insecure, of which 1.3 million people severely food insecure (October 2017, CNSA)

37 546 internally displaced people (IDPs) in 26 camps (IOM)

EU humanitarian funding: €388.35 million since 1994

Introduction

Due to its vulnerability to natural hazards and high levels of poverty, Haiti has limited capacity to cope with recurring emergencies caused by severe disasters, such as the 7.0 earthquake in 2010, recurrent hurricanes, and prolonged droughts worsened by the El Niño weather phenomenon.

Acute food insecurity and malnutrition, epidemics, and humanitarian needs generated by the ongoing migration crisis require sustained humanitarian assistance.

What are the needs?

Haiti is facing critical food and nutritional insecurity, with 4.4 million Haitians acutely food insecure and 131 000 malnourished children, a consequence of prolonged drought and the impacts of hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Irma (2017). More than a year after hurricane Matthew made landfall on the Haitian coasts, over 140 000 affected households still do not have access to minimum earthquake and seismic-resistant homes and shelters, thus remaining highly vulnerable to future shocks.

In 2017, 13 747 suspected cholera cases and 159 associated fatalities were registered, and 995 new suspected cases and 9 associated fatalities have been recorded during the first trimester of 2018.

Humanitarian needs still persist in remaining IDP camps set up after the 2010 earthquake. Roughly 37 500 Haitians are still sheltered in camps, where access to water and basic services remains very limited. Additionally, about 230 000 Dominicans of Haitian descent are at risk of becoming stateless and deported to Haiti. Since June 2015, over 260 000 individuals have crossed the border from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, including over 4 000 unaccompanied minors.",ECHO Factsheet – Haiti – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/echo-factsheet-haiti-april-2018

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL – On April 9th, the Brazilian government made the decision to grant priority treatment to Haitians who intend to live in Brazil. The government can now provide temporary visas and residence permits for humanitarian purposes up to two years.

The decree was published in the Official Gazette of the Federal Government and is authorized by the Itamaraty, the Ministries of Justice, Public Security, and Labor. The visa will be issued exclusively by the Brazilian embassy in Haiti’s capital city, Port-au-Prince.

While the visa can only be issued for two years, it can be transformed into an indefinite residence permit after the person has lived in Brazil for a period of two years. The government proclaims that the visa is determined on a humanitarian basis to provide shelter for those in need. The same regulations apply to stateless persons living in Haiti.

The decision was made to clarify details from the enforcement of the Migration Law, which came into effect last year. In a statement, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said that new regulations “can be published in the future to cover concrete situations”.

The Ministry also highlighted that the measure would tighten control of humanitarian policy for Haiti in the field of migration, and can prevent illegal and dangerous routes to Brazil. Since 2012, Brazil has granted over 60,000 visas in an effort to help Haiti rebuild itself after the 2010 earthquake that affected millions of Haitians and destroyed large parts of the country’s infrastructure.

As Brazil expects an increase in Haitian migrants, it will need to address the current lack of public policies, which have already come under criticism since the 2010 earthquake. Brazil is still pulling itself out of recession, and Haitian migrants living in Brazil have previously expressed concern about access to healthcare, education, and the labor market.",Brazilian Government Grants Haitians Humanitarian Visa,http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/brazilian-government-grants-haitians-humanitarian-visa/
15,haiti,"(WASHINGTON) — Documents released Tuesday appear to show a contradiction between an internal agency report and the assessment by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) about the end a humanitarian program, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), for Haiti.

USCIS Director Francis Cissna based his assessment and recommendation on the report, according to a letter.

The internal USCIS report said that “many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist, and the country remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal fragility.”

The memo went on to conclude that “due to the conditions outlined in this report, Haiti’s recovery from the 2010 earthquake could be characterized as falling into what one non-governmental organization recently described as ‘the country’s tragic pattern of one step forward, two steps back.'”

Cissna wrote to then-acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke — who was responsible for making the final decision on the program — that while lingering effects of the 2010 earthquake remain, “Haiti has made significant progress in addressing issues specific to the earthquake.”

“In summary, Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” he wrote.

His final recommendation to Duke is redacted.

According to USCIS, the TPS memo addressed conditions related to the earthquake, including displaced people and a prior housing shortage.

The documents were released after the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, along with the NYU School of Law, filed a lawsuit seeking records pertaining to the termination of TPS for Haiti.

In November, Duke announced her decision to terminate the program for Haiti, with a delayed effective date “to allow for an orderly transition before the designation terminates on July 22, 2019.”

In her announcement, she wrote that the “extraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist.”

Approximately 59,000 Haitians have been impacted by the decision, and will have to leave the United States or face living in the country illegally — pending any legislative response or ongoing litigation.

Last Friday was Duke’s last day at the department, and she could not be reached for comment.

“I think it raises questions about whether they were making policy decisions about how they were approaching TPS, instead of case-by-case review that they have historically done,” Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, said to ABC News.

“Their own internal report documents and confirms that many of the conditions persist and that the country remains vulnerable,” said Zota.

The termination of TPS for Haiti comes amid the end to numerous similar programs, like those for Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, which immigration advocates say “creates instability and problems not just for these families, but for their communities.”

A decision on whether to extend TPS for Nepal is due next week.

This is the first batch of documents, but thousands more are expected over the coming months.

In response to the released documents, USCIS said that “the decision to terminate TPS for Haiti was made after an interagency review process that considered country conditions and the ability of the country to receive returning citizens, according to the agency.”

“DHS undertook an extensive outreach campaign to U.S. state and federal government officials, Haitian officials, and third-party partners who offered their input as to the conditions on the ground in Haiti. Based on all available information, acting Secretary Elaine Duke determined that the extraordinary and temporary conditions that formed the basis of Haiti’s TPS designation as a result of the 2010 earthquake no longer exist, and thus, pursuant to statute, DHS concluded the current TPS designation for Haiti should not be extended,” said Cissna in a statement.

The Lawyers Guild has also filed a separate lawsuit challenging the end to the program. The government is expected to provide a response to that lawsuit by May 24.
