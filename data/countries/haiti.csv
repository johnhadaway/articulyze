0,haiti,"SANTIAGO – Starting April 16, Haitians seeking to get into Chile will now need to request a visa from the Chilean consulate in Port-au-Prince, the South American country’s government has announced.

President Sebastian Piñera Monday announced a bill to regulate migratory flows, through the application of visas, saying “We want these people to enter Chile in accordance with our laws, integrate into our society, be a contribution to our country and realize their dreams of a better life […]”.

Among the measures proposed in the decree, Piñera decided to require for Haitians a simple tourist consular visa, with the right to enter and stay in Chile for a maximum period of 30 days. Holders of this visa will not be able to work or earn money in Chile.

Haitians, who already have a family member in Chile having a regular immigration status, will be able to access the 12-month family reunification visa. This visa must be requested from the Consulate of Chile in Haiti and will be subject to a maximum annual quota.

Other new measures accompany the decision of the Chilean Government among others: the entry ban for persons with criminal records, the creation of a national migration service, mandatory application outside Chile for a temporary residence visa that will not be interchangeable with a tourist visa and a simplified eviction mechanism for offenders.

All these measures will come into effect, according to the Chilean press, as of April 23, 2018.

Hoy hemos propuesto una #NuevaLeydeMigración que abre nuestras puertas a quienes ingresen a Chile en forma legal y vengan a aportar a nuestro desarrollo. Y cierra nuestras puertas a los que pretenden ingresar ilegalmente, cometer delitos o causar daño a los chilenos. pic.twitter.com/gscyLfsUWW — Sebastian Piñera (@sebastianpinera) April 9, 2018

The tightened immigration rule is part of a series of immigration measures introduced by the new head of the state, who also introduced new visa requirements for Venezuelans seeking to migrate.

Under the so-called Democratic Responsibility Visa, Venezuelans seeking to flee their country’s worsening political crisis will be able to apply for temporary residence in Chile for a year. But instead of making the request in Chile, Venezuelans will have to do so at home. As to whether it will make it easier or harder for them to emigrate, it all depends on how restrictive the Chilean consulate is.

Piñera has also introduced a bill that reformulates the current immigration law, which has been in force since 1975 and leaves the migration officer the power to say who can enter Chile. Currently the legislation allows any foreigner who enters Chile with a “tourist visa” to be able to apply for a temporary or permanent residence once on the national territory.

“Our country needs a new migration law, adapted to our time and guaranteeing a safe, orderly and regular migration, which opens the doors to those who do good in Chile and closes the doors to those who harm us,” said President Piñera.

The new regulations will be submitted to Congress with a simple emergency request, which means that it will have to be evaluated within 30 days, said Interior Minister Andrés Chadwick.

In addition, Monday’s decree specifies that foreigners who want to come to work in Chile will be able to do so as long as they ask in their own country a “Visa Temporaria de Oportunidades” or a “Visa Temporaria de Orientación Internacional”.

Three types of temporary visas may be requested from 1 August 2018.

The “Visa Temporaria de Oportunidades” concerns migrants from all countries who wish to come to Chile to undertake and work for a period of 12 months, renewable with the possibility of applying for permanent residency.

The “Visa Temporaria de Orientación Internacional” is aimed at foreigners holding a postgraduate degree in the top 200 universities in the world according to the QS World University Rankings and who wish to undertake and work in Chile. It allows to work for 12 months with the possibility of access to permanent residence.

The “Visa Temporaria de Orientación Nacional” the only one that can be obtained in Chile concerns foreigners wishing to obtain advanced degrees in Chilean accredited universities and desire to undertake and work in Chile later.

Announcing details of an in-depth reform of Chile’s immigration laws, Pinera said that the moment had come “to put our house in order.”

Over the past four years, Chile has become one of Latin America’s top destinations for migrants, unveiling figures last week which pointed to more than a million foreigners in the country, almost double the previous estimates.

Around 300,000 of that number are thought to be living illegally in the copper-rich South American country, the ministry said.

Most of the migrants are believed to be from Venezuela and Haiti, with the new rules putting an end to the visa-on-arrival policy for citizens of both countries.

Haiti - USA : Trump approves a Congressional Law that includes $10M for Haiti





In the current political climate, Democrats and Republicans don't often agree on much, but in a rare act of bipartisanship, Congress has passed an omnibus package that rejected many of the White House's harsh budget cuts. The legislation, signed by President Donald Trump before lawmakers left Washington for a two-week recess, included $10 million to help Haiti combat cholera.



During the appropriations process, 36 House lawmakers, led by Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson (FL-24), sent letters to the chairs and ranking members of the State, Foreign Operations committees in both chambers, urging them to authorize $11.7 million in the FY 2018 omnibus funding bill for this purpose. Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and New York Congresswoman Nita Lowey (NY-17), ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, have long championed this issue.



""To allow Haiti, which has had to deal with more than its fair share of natural disasters, to continue to struggle under the weight of a human-made crisis is both inhumane and anathema to our American values. I am extremely pleased that Democrats and Republicans were able to join forces and do the right thing. It is my sincere hope that other nations will follow our example,"" said Congresswoman Wilson (FL-24).



""As a long-time friend of Haiti, I have been profoundly disappointed by the international community's failure to respond appropriately to the cholera epidemic, which was introduced into Haiti by United Nations peacekeepers. I strongly supported the inclusion of funds in the Omnibus Appropriations Act to stop the spread of this devastating disease in Haiti,"" said Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA-43), who co-chairs the Congressional Caribbean Caucus.



""The people of Haiti have faced enormous challenges over the past eight years that are not of their making, and we should do everything in our power to help them rebuild and recover,"" said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09). ""I'm pleased to see this Congress include funding to help Haitians recover from the cholera outbreak and stop the spread of this disease.""



""The United States should devote the resources necessary to end the cholera epidemic in Haiti and address the needless and preventable suffering. I'm pleased that Congress included funding to help Haitians recover from the cholera outbreak and stop the spread of this disease,"" said Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-22).



""It's critical that we continue to fund effective public health interventions to vigorously address the prevalence of cholera throughout Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean,"" said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""There are immediate and long-term solutions to control cholera, and we must mobilize and remain vigilant in our efforts to support economic development, universal access to clean drinking water, and proper sanitation throughout the region to curb the rising incidence of infection and death from this treatable disease.""



""I am proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to help fight cholera in Haiti. A cholera outbreak has killed 10,000 and infected hundreds of thousands of Haitians, and we cannot sit idly by. We stand in solidarity with our Haitian-American community in Philadelphia and their worldwide diaspora. We have a humanitarian duty to stand with them and support the multinational effort to eradicate cholera in Haiti because it is a matter of conscience,"" said Congressman Dwight Evans (PA-02).



""I have long championed the cause of the Haitian Diaspora and those who remain in Haiti as they face mounting challenges in creating a stable and productive democracy,"" said Congressman Alcee L. Hastings (FL-20). ""I was happy to join my colleagues in our effort to ensure that Haiti received much-needed funding in its fight against the cholera epidemic that has been devastating the country for nearly a decade. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of the Haitian Diaspora and assisting those in Haiti, as we all work to strengthen the country's democratic institutions and address the effects of the many natural disasters Haiti has had to confront over the years.""



""As a former member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, I have fought for years to help Haiti recover from the 2010 earthquake, countless devastating hurricane seasons, and multiple public health crises. I am very pleased that Congress was able to work in a bipartisan way to pass this critical funding to fight the ongoing cholera crisis. The U.S. contributions to this U.N. fund are essential to giving Haiti the aid necessary to rebuild and recover,"" said Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13).



""America cannot turn its back on those suffering through the humanitarian crisis and cholera epidemic that the Haitian people have had to confront. As an appropriator, I'm extremely proud that I was able to team with Congressional Democrats, especially Sen. Patrick Leahy and Rep. Frederica Wilson, who fought to secure this vital funding over the refusal of the Trump Administration to address this public health threat,"" said Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23).

LIFE-CHANGING SUPPORT

The US-based not-for-profit organisation provides life-changing educational support to children in Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, which prompted a widespread humanitarian crisis due to huge losses of life and displacement among the country’s population.

Haiti’s plight was further drawn into focus following the impact of hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey last year, which battered parts of the US and Caribbean.

In response, Women in Travel Retail (WiTR) has committed to raising €15,000 ($18,480) to procure musical instruments for school children in the country.

The inaugural Travel Retail Awards takes place on Monday 7 May at the Singapore Conrad hotel during the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition and Conference.

The funding will also facilitate the introduction of Lycée Jean-Baptiste Pointe du Sable’s (LJBPS) first extra-curricular instrumental music programme in partnership with École de Musique Christian Nohel de Saint Marc.

Due to the collective efforts of the travel retail industry, the Lycée Jean-Baptiste Pointe du Sable opened in 2011 where it welcomed 152 children to Haiti’s first free, earthquake-resistant, sustainable school of excellence. As of September, 386 children were enrolled from Nursery to 6th grade.

A soon-to-be built secondary school will increase capacity to 720 children, but continued support is needed to raise funds for this vital cause.

Five minutes with… Sarah Branquinho, Chair, WiTR

Update TRBusiness on WiTR’s current activities to help educational dreams become reality for the schoolchildren of Haiti?

Hand in Hand for Haiti was the first charity that WiTR ever supported and in response to the terrible hurricanes that hit the Caribbean last year we all felt that we should support a charity in the region.

With HiHH we know that all the funds raised will go directly to the school and we agreed to fund this specific project – the purchase of musical instruments. The benefits of music education are astounding and studies have consistently exposed the tremendously positive effect music education has on a child’s academic performance, sense of community, self-expression and self-esteem.

But for nearly all children across Haiti, formal music education is unattainable. Music will give children the confidence to perform in school and in their local community and will help to build their self-confidence.

The two big fund-raising opportunities are the Travel Retail Awards dinner and TFWA World Exhibition, where WiTR traditionally raises funds for its annual charity.

As you know, WiTR is becoming a membership organisation with fantastic benefits to women across the industry who join. Any surplus income from the membership fees will also go to Hand in Hand for Haiti.

How is the Travel Retail Awards’ platform important in raising support for the Hand in Hand for Haiti cause?

The Travel Retail Awards dinner is the first major industry event since WiTR announced its chosen charity for 2018, so it’s the first time we will have had the opportunity to talk about the charity to such a wide international audience – and a captive one.

A donation from every table/seat booked goes towards Hand in Hand for Haiti, but how else can travel retail help?

At the dinner there will be a raffle to raise additional funds and any donations are welcome. Later in the year at TFWA World Exhibition in Cannes, WiTR will be running its hugely popular draw to raise further funds – we are always delighted to receive product for the draw prizes and the silent auction.

5,haiti,"For the third straight year, Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril is spending part of his offseason in Haiti, his parents’ native country, where he and other NFL players have helped build a school.

The school, which is in La Chanm, a rural area in Haiti’s Central Plateau region, will be completed this year. Seeing the school completed two years after he, Marshawn Lynch and others were breaking ground with shovels will be a special moment for Avril.

“It has been awesome,” Avril said. “It has been great to be able to do something like this, to be able to go back to a country that I love so much as I’ve gotten to learn the history of the country and the people there, understanding who these people are and what they’re unfortunately going through. To be in a situation to be able to give back is the biggest thing for me. I have cousins who still live there, and I could easily be one of those kids. For me to be able to go back and see them and be able to give back, it’s an honor and a blessing. I’m just grateful to be able to have the platform to do so.”

This trip to Haiti will also be a special one for Avril because for the first time, he will visit his father’s hometown of Jacmel. Avril’s father, Jean Samuel, passed away in 2015, and Avril never made it back to Haiti with his dad, who moved to the United States in the 1980s. Cliff is taking his son, Xavier, as well as his mother, Marie, on the trip, where they’ll reconnect with Avril’s uncle and other relatives in Jacmel.

“I’ve never been to Jacmel,” Avril said. “I’ve heard it’s a beautiful part of the island. I never got to travel to Haiti with my dad growing up, so to be able to go back—I have an uncle there I’ve been communicating with, and he’s super excited about hosting us while we’re there.

“I think it’s going to be awesome for me personally. I never got to go back to Haiti with my dad, so to be going back with my son, and taking my mother with me, and showing him—because he always asks about grandad and all these different things—so to be able to show him where grandad grew up, where he’s from, and it being my first time there as well, I think it’s going to be an awesome experience and an awesome feeling to do that with my oldest.”

Finishing the school hardly means the end of Avril’s work in Haiti. Avril’s football future is still uncertain because of the neck injury that cut short his 2017 season, but regardless of what happens, he plans on finding new ways to help in Haiti. Avril mentioned the possibility of getting involved in the curriculum of the school he helped build, or even building another school. Or, after funding the construction of new houses following Hurricane Matthew, Avril and his wife, Tia, have talked about partnering with other Haitian-American NFL players to build more houses, or even an entire community in Haiti.

“Big picture, regardless of if I play ball or not, the goal is to continue to keep helping, continue to keep trying to make a difference over there,” said Avril, who is in the process of buying a house to make the Seattle-area his full-time home. “When you’re playing, you obviously have a bigger platform and are able to raise money and do different things, but regardless of what happens, the community here, they get behind us, they’ve helped me build this school, and I believe the opportunities will still be there as long as I continue to be a part of the community and do good things. So the goal is to continue to keep doing good things in Haiti, whether it’s building a community, maybe it’s another school project, I’m not sure. But I’m going to keep chopping away, that’s for sure, and hopefully the 12s continue to stick by my side and help with that process.”

One way 12s can help Avril continue his work in Haiti, as well as the work his Cliff Avril Family Foundation does with JDRF.org, is to attend his foundation’s Ping Pong Slam at SPiN Seattle on May 19.

7,haiti,"I write in response to the letter from Neville Lai (“Oxfam Haiti sex scandal arose from arrogance, but cuts to funding are not the answer”, April 4).

It reasserts the importance of examining what we are doing right, and what we can do better by learning vital lessons from past mistakes.

I joined Oxfam because I passionately shared its rights-based approach to tackle poverty and its mission to fight against gender, and other, injustices. It was painful to learn that some women were abused by some of our staff, even though these staff were a few black sheep.

Oxfam has a zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse. We recognise the Haiti sex abuse scandal of Oxfam Great Britain as a crisis, and also as an opportunity to make a strong and unequivocal commitment to improving our internal culture and the way we operate in the world.

There is an urgent need to address existing power imbalances within the Oxfam confederation, and to commit to a process of genuine transformation, in order to rebuild trust internally and externally, and to ensure our credibility and impact through our work.

An Independent Commission co-chaired by Zainab Bangura, a former undersecretary general of the United Nations, and Katherine Sierra, a former vice-president of the World Bank, has been set up to review Oxfam’s past sexual misconduct cases, and recommend better initiatives in accountability and culture change. We are also implementing other measures to stamp out abuse such as strengthening our whistle-blowing processes.

We have been working for decades to empower women in fighting against discrimination; most crucially, Oxfam always works for policies that work for women and other marginalised people.

We won’t stop until we see a world without poverty and injustices where all people can live in a decent and sustainable environment.

We are actively listening to our staff, partners, supporters and the communities that we work with.

Transparency is key to facilitate public scrutiny. I am confident that the discussions in past months on saying “no” to sexual abuse against women, and the need to be ever more vigilant against violations in humanitarian relief crisis situations, have moved us all forward.

At long last, we are seeing meaningful cultural change, which I find gratifying.

9,haiti,"I had finally gotten a call for the in-person interview. After passing the phone interview and beating the applicant tracking system, I was finally going to have my chance to break into humanitarian development. In fact, if I landed the job, I would be the senior policy advisor for the humanitarian response in Haiti at Oxfam America. It was June 2010.

After the earthquake in Jan. 2010, I volunteered to go to Haiti with a religious group to help in any way that I could. After all, I felt that as a person born in the Caribbean, I had more than just a passing connection to the people and to the island. It was not only that I felt I belonged in Haiti, but I was also vested in the advances that could be made. My graduate school advisor had tried to force me to write my dissertation on the Rwandan genocide, but instead, I wrote about a part of the world that resonated with me: identity politics and “colorism” in Haitian elections.

As I prepared for the interview with Oxfam, I thought about the fact that I was bringing all the required qualifications: for starters, the education (I hold three master’s degrees); my personal and deeply rooted understanding of the country context (my dissertation was still warm from my defense); and a mindset that was essential in this work — I believe that people in poor countries know what is best for them and that the mere fact that they are recipients of aid does not take away their humanity.

“But wait until they see your black face,” said my inner voice.

I wondered what the interview panel would look like. Would it be a panel of white women who had spent a total of three months in Haiti collectively and were now “experts”?

Or a panel of white men who had never stepped foot on the island of Haiti, but perhaps had attended an elite school and had been able to accept an unpaid internship in Geneva or New York?

Either way, I was certain that it would be a panel of people who would get to decide if I “fit,” which I already knew was often a euphemism for hiring people who look like and act and share the same background as them.

“But wait until they see your black face,” said my inner voice.

I worried whether I could be my best self in the interview. Will I be too distracted? Will I focus on how I talk? Try not to sound too black, not too Caribbean, not too expressive, not too loud? Because we know that black women who are loud [insert cliché] might not be a good “fit.”

As I walked into the interview room expecting a sea of white faces, there was a ray of light. A black woman sat at the table. I had an indescribable feeling of glee. I relaxed. I allowed myself the luxury of this one thought: This must be how white people feel all the time; they can just be.

And for only the second time in my professional life, I was the outstanding candidate — not the black candidate who happened to be outstanding.

I landed that job at Oxfam America and spent almost three years working on advocacy for post-earthquake Haiti. It was my defining entry-level moment. I had broken into the sector. I have absolutely no doubt that on that particular day, because of the presence of another black sister, I showed up with my best self.

I would go on to learn the aid sector pecking order at that organization: that expatriates and local/national staff are not all treated equally; that expatriates received the leadership positions in the country offices; that the white savior complex was real; and that the aid sector preached diversity, but these ideals were not reflected in our practice, at least not internally. For my entire tenure at Oxfam America, the executive leadership team was comprised of white males with the exception of one white woman.

While aid organizations are finally coming to terms with the lack of women in leadership positions and seeking to remedy the situation, this will not translate automatically into more black women in leadership. Black women generally have no internal champions to shepherd them through the politics of getting to the executive suite, nor are they groomed through the organizational pipeline for leadership roles. In a recently released impact study on gender and racial diversity in the aid sector, Quantum Impact reported that of the 162 organizations analyzed, four out of five organizations (80 percent) had leadership teams that did not have a representative number of people of color. Half of all organizations (51 percent) had no leaders of color.

According to Quantum Impact, the barriers for women to get into leadership positions appear to be related to promotion, since women are generally well represented at entry levels. For people of color, there are critical barriers in the sector starting at the entry level and continuing through leadership levels. A rising tide for women in leadership in global development will not lift all boats.

Black women in the aid sector face a double whammy. The evidence points to it, as does my experience. Recent scandals reveal — more than ever — that this sector needs many more of us at the helm.

10,haiti,"GONAIVES, Haiti – As the sun starts to set on Haiti's most fertile valley, a silent group of women sweeps grains of newly harvested rice into large, yellow mounds, unfazed by the acrid smoke of nearby wood fires.

From there, the rice is placed in barrels, where it will be cleaned over those fires. Then, in a small back room on a winter afternoon, it will be packed in bags and shipped from this mill in west-central Haiti's Artibonite Valley, ending up in the kitchens of Haitian expatriates and other discriminating cooks across the United States.

This was once a common scene in Haiti. Now it's a rarity. A few decades ago, Haiti was self-sufficient in rice, a crop so important here that the U.N. estimates it makes up about a quarter of people's daily diet. It even grew enough to export. But production collapsed after the U.S. and international lenders forced the country to dramatically lower tariffs that protected local farmers, from 50 percent to 3 percent in the last three decades.

A quarter-century later, about 80 percent of Haiti's rice is imported, and the country is a major market for U.S. exporters. Faced with cheap imports, the country's dire poverty, natural disasters, lack of investment and collapsing infrastructure, production is still dropping in Haiti despite government efforts to halt the slide. Last year, the government reported a rise and a subsequent drop because of bad weather.

Some Haitian entrepreneurs say there is money to be made growing rice. Skeptics, however, say hopes to resurrect the rice industry are misplaced and, with too few resources and little international support, represent the challenges that many poor, underdeveloped countries face in turning their economies around.

Fabias Voltaire, 37, one Haitian trying to boost rice production, was able to reach an agreement to process his rice at a cooperative that is funded by the aid group Oxfam. He said there is a strong foreign demand for high-quality organic rice. It may cost more, but many regard it as healthier and better-tasting than American varieties. Plus, Haitian émigrés in the States love it, he says: ""Haitians are … very sentimental about eating rice from home.""

In 2015, Voltaire and two cousins launched Caribbean Grains LLC. Three years later, they are shipping to Florida, Alabama and other U.S. states.

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. About three-quarters of its 11 million people live on less than $2 a day and about half the population lives in rural settings. In 2010, following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated the country, former U.S. President Bill Clinton publicly apologized for forcing Haiti to drop its import tariffs and damaging the economy.

""It may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas, but it has not worked,"" said Clinton at the time, according to news reports . ""It was a mistake.""

Since then, hurricanes Sandy in 2012 and Matthew in 2016 cost Haiti hundreds of millions in agricultural losses, making it even harder to recover.

Jovenel Moise, who became Haiti's president in February 2017, has an agricultural background and pledged to relaunch the industry by fixing irrigation canals, financing infrastructure projects and other initiatives. By May 2017, the government had unveiled its program ""La Caravane du Changement"" – The Caravan of Change – to fund such infrastructure repairs. Although government estimates of the program's cost are difficult to obtain, Haitian news media reports say $55 million was spent in 2017 to repair the country's agriculture infrastructure.

Still, the challenges to boosting the country's rice industry are great. Production costs are high, and farmers have almost no access to loans or insurance to protect them from the ravages of insects and plant diseases.

The facts on the ground keep skepticism high that the initiatives will substantially boost rice production. Thousands of acres in the Artibonite Valley are waterlogged, making them prone to disease, especially around the time of harvests. Other parts of the valley aren't getting enough water.

Travis J. Lybbert, an economist and professor at the University of California-Davis who has done extensive research in the region, says the government's focus on better irrigation could make a big impact on rice production.

""It is relatively easy to make this happen,"" he says, adding that it would be much harder to provide access to inputs such as seed and fertilizer or create a better market for farm products.

The government can prioritize spending on agriculture without a lot of scrutiny, shortchanging other sectors of the economy in a country that is in desperate need of just about everything.

""These are very important and heavy costs that are easy to sweep under the rug as many other projects get delayed,"" Lybbert adds. ""That could be a real drag on development in other parts of the country.""

Looking out over a nearly dry river and irrigation canals that need to be cleaned and rebuilt, Agriculture Ministry representative Renaud Gene says Haiti has the political will to fix the problem, but not the means.

""There is a serious problem of water management, and it requires a lot of investments,"" he says.

The government has been fixing roads and canals but doesn't have the resources to make dramatic improvements. Instead of feeding Haitians in need with their own excess production, Gene says rich countries could assist Haiti more by helping develop its infrastructure, and then buying the rice from Haitian farmers to distribute.

In contrast with Voltaire, many in the region say a long history of failure leaves them pessimistic that anything will change. They regard the government initiative as at best populist and naïve. While not questioning the president's intentions, many simply aren't optimistic about the feasibility of breaking through the obstacles that exist.

""Jovenel is struggling like a poor devil but I am not sure where he's going,"" says Franklin Benjamin, an engineer and rice producer who has dedicated his career to finding ways to supply Haitians with locally produced rice.

For decades, attempts to develop the sector have failed, he says, because farmers never get the incentives and solid support system they need.

""Haiti doesn't interest Haitians. They are all looking to get a visa to go somewhere where they are despised,"" he adds. ""There is still a hope, but we will be disappointed like always.""

In the midst of such pessimism, Voltaire hopes that his success might inspire the next entrepreneur. And he has even bigger dreams.

""I want to create an agricultural bank for farmers,"" he says. ""The objective is to make Haiti the economic capital of the Caribbean.""

He splits his time between West Palm Beach, Florida, and Haiti and still plans to continue growing his business despite the challenges. He says he spent $10,000 to fix the irrigation canals he needed for his own production.

On his farm, Voltaire's workers take a pause to laugh and joke a bit around a broken-down tractor.

11,haiti,"Seattle Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril will head to Haiti again this offseason to finish building a school he started three years ago, along with the help of other NFL players.

The school is called La Chanm and will be completed just two years after he broke ground on the project. Avril’s parents are from Haiti, and he treasures getting to help out a country in need – especially one that means so much to him.

#Seahawks DE @cliffavril is headed back to Haiti this week to continue the good work he has been doing there the past three years: https://t.co/KJLX3pOoVB — John Boyle (@johnpboyle) April 10, 2018

“It has been awesome,” Avril said, via the team website. “It has been great to be able to do something like this, to be able to go back to a country that I love so much as I’ve gotten to learn the history of the country and the people there, understanding who these people are and what they’re unfortunately going through. To be in a situation to be able to give back is the biggest thing for me.”

Avril’s football career is in jeopardy after suffering a neck injury that cut short his 2017 season and could impact his ability to see the field in 2018. The Seahawks have been busy stocking up on defensive linemen in case Avril is unable to go this year.

Regardless of how much longer he plays, Avril will continue to help his native Haiti as long as he can.

“So the goal is to continue to keep doing good things in Haiti, whether it’s building a community, maybe it’s another school project, I’m not sure,” Avril explained. “But I’m going to keep chopping away, that’s for sure, and hopefully the 12s continue to stick by my side and help with that process.’

If you want to help support Avril’s work in Haiti, you can attend the Cliff Avril Family Foundation’s Ping Pong Slam at SPiN Seattle on May 19.

13,haiti,"On a sunny Saturday afternoon in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood, tropical music fills the air as two friends sip from a freshly cut coconut outside the Caribbean Marketplace.

Nearby, two men are savoring grilled meat and Jamaican patties with rice and peas. Farther down the sidewalk, on the weekly market day, a group of girls and women in vibrant, traditional Creole dresses, practices dance moves.

Despite the festive atmosphere, Haitians worry about the impact of gentrification on the area. Some are hoping to see the market operate seven days a week, as an economic lifeline and way to bond culturally. Little Haiti, considered the “cultural heart of the Haitian diaspora” in the United States, was established by Haitian refugees - many of whom arrived on boats in the 1980s.

“Because of gentrification - it’s the only thing that we have so we’re trying to keep this going, said Hoppy Duroseau, a Little Haiti resident involved with marketing and promotions for the Caribbean Marketplace on social media. Born in St. Louis du Nord, Haiti, Duroseau immigrated to the United States at age four.

“We want to keep it busy all the time because if not - then we’ll lose this place and we’ll no longer have Little Haiti. Little Haiti is the only one in the world. So we need to keep this.”

Gentrification effort

The vibrant neighborhood full of art galleries, Haitian-owned businesses and restaurants has undergone a gentrification effort that sent rents climbing by as much as 50 percent in 2016. Many Haitian-owned businesses were forced to close.

Myrlande, a vendor selling Haitian food at the Caribbean Marketplace says she is among the Haitians directly affected by gentrification.

“It’s a dead zone; nothing is going on. Haitians have pretty much left the neighborhood,” she says. “I - myself had a business in the neighborhood and the rent went up so high that I was forced to leave. They didn’t evict me per se, but that’s the end result. That is why we’ve lost almost all the Haitian-owned businesses in the community. That’s why we are trying to have them open the Caribbean Marketplace every day so we can have a place to call home. But I don’t know.”

Gentrification is defined as “the process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to middle-class taste.” According to some real estate developers, the Little Haiti location is desirable because of its higher elevation, making it less vulnerable to flooding and rising sea levels.

David C. Brown, author of The History of Little Haiti: Featuring Its Pioneers, says the unique neighborhood is a testament to the resilience of the Haitians who moved there. “It was successful because of the values the Haitian has - like any other immigrant communities and just like any other nationality - and those values that I see so clearly that shone through in the Haitian spirit are the values of family, education and work ethic. Those are the three values that have helped to raise the bar of this immigrant community.”

Marketplace vendors

In the colorfully painted market, a stylish, bearded man wearing a blue hat with a matching T-shirt catches our eye. He stands in front of a stall with various graphic T-shirts and hoodies on display. The image on his shirt resembles the Superman logo - but the words in bright red say Haitian.

Roe Michel immigrated to the United States from Haiti at age two with his parents. He designs the T-shirts he sells and the one he’s wearing is very popular with customers, he tells VOA.

“This T-shirt is called the Super Haitian,” he says, flashing a bright smile. “You know Haitians have this tenacity to get through anything. Knowing our history, I always feel empowered.”

Michel’s brand is called Vintage 1804, a reference to the year Haitian slaves declared their independence from France and became the first free black nation in the Western Hemisphere.

Another bestseller, according to Michel, is his Haitian heroes shirt, which features the heroes of the war for independence - Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint Louverture, Alexandre Petion - to name a few. Michel tells us his customers are a mix of Haitians and Americans.

Across the room stands Jamaican-born Aura Bond, who now lives in Miami's Miramar suburb. The co-owner of the shop Bjou Bjou is wearing a stylish denim jacket and a beaded Masai statement necklace around her neck. She is surrounded by customers who are trying on earrings and African printed fabric head wraps, or looking at crocheted bathing suits, asking numerous questions.

“I fell in love with the whole Little Haiti entirety. I love it here,” she tells VOA, noting that the items she sells helps women in Haiti as well as Kenya and Ghana to sustain themselves economically.

“It is a virtual marketplace that provides underrepresented producers a global platform. So when I come here, I’m basically selling what’s left over from a week’s sales from online.”

Bond says she became involved with the Caribbean Marketplace through word of mouth and because of the low vendor fees which made selling her merchandise there even more appealing. There are fabric earrings, recycled tin earrings, vegan banana fiber earrings “Those are best sellers. They’re vegan of course,” she says.

Her crochet bathing suits are made in Haiti by teenage girls in an after school program.

By mid-afternoon, the Caribbean Marketplace buzzes with adults, children and teenagers from various cultural backgrounds partaking in the multiple activities occurring simultaneously. A DJ hosts a Little Haiti Trivia contest for the children - some of whom are getting help from their parents. Meanwhile, a group of young women demonstrates a traditional Creole dance. A few steps away, a clown on stilts tries to entice people to dance with her. Back in a corner, an artist applies paint to a canvas. And the wooden stage off to one side is busy with musicians and technicians, setting up for a show by the popular Haitian Compas music band Gabel.

"" I just relocated to Miami and so I’m just looking for cultural things to do,” says first-time visitor Melodie Davis-Bundrage. “I’m always looking to support black businesses. Honestly with the recent political issues that have gone on - with the comments that were said negatively about Haiti and the whole immigration issues that have been happening, I really wanted to support Little Haiti in particular. ""

Vendor Myrlande voiced optimism about the future as the evening came and crowds thinned.

“Business today was not bad at all, but I just wish we could have the same amount of people every Saturday,” she said. “Although I didn’t make a lot of money today, I’m satisfied, I’m happy.”",Fighting Gentrification By Making Little Haiti Great Again,https://www.voanews.com/a/making-miamis-little-haiti-market-great-again/4338726.html
14,haiti,"The sounds of cheering from 40 small children who had just been told they would now have clean drinking water, free of the pathogens that could make them sick, is forever embedded in Rachel Hunt’s mind.

The cheering occurred last year on Hunt’s first trip to Haiti with a student organization called Project Haiti from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The student club has been working with villages and schools in the Caribbean country constructing water purification systems in cholera-stricken communities and other communities with contaminated water since 2010. She says the trip has forever changed her life.

“When the children heard they were going to have clean water, it was like telling them they were going to Disney World,” Hunt said. “It changed my perspective on the importance of small things we normally take for granted. I really enjoyed the ability to use what I’ve been learning to help other people and make an actual change in the world.”

A mechanical engineering senior, Hunt hopes for a career providing engineering humanitarian aid to developing countries. This year, as president of Embry-Riddle’s Project Haiti, she’s turned her aspirations into action.

This will be the ninth year Embry-Riddle students from the Daytona Beach Campus have built clean drinking water filtration systems for Haitian communities.

In May, the team of 10 students will install a different type of solar-powered water purification system they designed and built themselves. It will be placed at a school and orphanage that serves 235 children in Gonaives, north of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Dr. Marc Compere, associate professor of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Geoffrey Kain, professor of Humanities and Communication and director of Embry-Riddle’s Honors Program, will be traveling with and advising the students.

“Many times our classroom design projects, like building a filtration system, are theoretical. This project is hands on. It challenges the students to become practical and resourceful while operating in a dynamic, unstructured and unpredictable environment,” said Dr. Compere.

Watching the students solve complex problems that arise in Haiti has been impressive, Dr. Kain said.

“In rural Haiti, there are no trips to the store to pick up suddenly needed supplies,” Dr. Kain said. “Obstacles have to be overcome sometimes by improvisation and ingenuity. It's inspiring.”

On previous trips to Haiti, the team has installed ultrafiltration systems, but they learned last year that this type of purification system was unable to remove all salt, sediment and viruses in villages using well water or river water. The Gonaives site has the same problems, said Hunt.

The team’s solution this year is to design a system that uses reverse osmosis — a high-pressure pump and ultrafine, semi-permeable membranes — to remove contaminants. The filters also will not need to be replaced as often so the community can better maintain the unit at less cost.

In addition to providing clean drinking water, a small business selling five-gallon bottles of clean water to the surrounding community will be launched. The venture will generate income for the orphanage and school, and provide job opportunities for the children after they turn 18.

The university students are involved in every aspect of the project, from welding the purifier frame, to designing and manufacturing the control panel. A solar panel array will be installed in Haiti to power the water purifier.

Since Embry-Riddle’s Project Haiti first began its humanitarian work, after a massive earthquake struck the country in January 2010, eight solar-powered clean-water filtration systems have been installed and four micro-businesses selling clean water have been established, supporting thousands of Haitians in communities throughout the country.

On the trip last year, team member Audrey Hallam, an aeronautical science major, was moved by the support from the Haitian community.

“I fell in love with the people,” Hallam said. “It was amazing to create something that would change their lives and keep them healthier.”

15,haiti,"Mariana Branco reports from Agência Brasil

The Brazilian government decided to give special treatment to Haitians intending to live in Brazil. In a regulation published Monday (Apr. 9), the government stipulates the “concession of a temporary visa and the authorization of a residence permit by way of humanitarian shelter.”

The visa will be issued exclusively by the Brazilian Embassy in Port-au-Prince, capital of Haiti, and is to allow nationals from that country to live in Brazil for two years, which can be turned into an indefinite living permit after that period. The same rules apply for stateless individuals from the country.

As defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), stateless people are those with no nationality recognized by any country, which can happen as a result of discrimination against minorities enforced by national legislation, failure to recognize all citizens of a country as nationals when the nation attains independence, or conflicting law among countries.

The decision was made in a bid to work out the details on the enforcement of the Migration Law, brought into effect last year. Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said the new rules “could be opportunely published in the future to address concrete situations.”

The authorities also highlighted that the measure will make it possible for Brazil’s humanitarian policy in Haiti to be maintained, which includes over 60 thousand visas granted since 2012, in a bid to further help the country rebuild itself.

How Stewart Greenleaf got woke - and what his retirement means for smart-on-crime reforms Apr 5

Samantha Melamed writes about anything and everything Philadelphia from the features desk.

It’s trash day in North Philadelphia, and garbage bags are heaped along the curb. It’s not the best look for this rowhouse block.

But, surveying the scene, Ogbonna Hagins is gleeful.

“This,” he says, “is money.”

He pulls over his minivan for a closer look. Here are two pairs of sneakers, almost new-looking. There’s a suitcase, whose telescoping handle works perfectly and wheels glide easily into a spin. Sheathed in black plastic, there’s a three-foot-tall Superman doll; Hagins will later find similar ones listed for between $25 and $60 on eBay.

It all goes in the van, joining a ramshackle abundance of trash bags bulging with assorted shoes, bicycle parts, pie pans, radios, record players and antiques of questionable provenance. (Fortunately, a half-dozen pine-tree air fresheners also sway from the rear-view mirror.)

Scrapping is a time-honored, if marginal, Philadelphia tradition. But Hagins, 51 — a Grays Ferry resident, one-time state House candidate (he did not survive a petition challenge), podcaster, and tireless networker with a self-styled, superhero-like moniker, Philly Green Man — is on a mission to elevate the trade, which he sees as both art and science. Pretty much anything you’ve tossed out on trash day, he says, has some value waiting to be unlocked.

And Philadelphia’s discards, rescued by Hagins’ discerning hand, have a surprising afterlife.

Some things he can fix and sell at a flea market, at auction or eBay. The very best clothes can be sold to Buffalo Exchange. Gold and silver — he regularly finds jewelry in the trash — goes to a buyer on Jewelers Row.

But other things have worth, too. The broken lamp you threw away (if it was indeed broken) is worth 50 cents a pound. The cracked flat screen TV has a motherboard, worth $1 a pound. A DVD player is even better: The hard drive could fetch $15 or $20.

Still other finds travel much farther, to sustain families in places like Haiti and Sierra Leone.

When President Trump’s “s–hole countries” remark made headlines this year, Hagins was particularly agitated. For the past decade, he has been helping immigrants who’ve settled in Philadelphia send shoes to their families in these long-impoverished, and lately defamed, regions.

Hagins says he finds 50 to 60 pairs of shoes per day. He was selling them at a flea market when a West African man offered to purchase his entire inventory for $1 a pair. If his family back home in Sierra Leone could sell the shoes, instead of just sending money home he could help them build a business of their own.

It turned out lots of other immigrants had the same idea — and Hagins wants to supply shoes to all of them.

Jean Duret, 39, of Overbrook, sends about 100 pairs to his mother and brother in Haiti every two or three months. Duret, who works in human resources, has his own family to support here. But he also feels a responsibility to his relatives in Port-au-Prince. They can take Hagins’ trash-picked shoes to the market, and sell them for $3 to $5 a pair.

“There are not really jobs available. That’s why we have to intervene,” he said. “It gives them the opportunity to survive.”

Marcelline Mayaku, 62, who lives in North Philadelphia, said it’s a life-or-death matter.

Mayaku, a former organizer who fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo during a war in 1997, pays $2 to $4 for shoes that she distributes in villages around the country through her nonprofit, Congolese Association of Diabetics Bringing Hope. She aims to gather 10,000 pairs for her next trip back, in June.

She resolved to take on the issue after meeting a diabetic man who had stepped on a nail, leading to a life-threatening case of gangrene. “It hurts to see people having that kind of life,” she said.

The challenge in efforts like this is obtaining a container. Mayaku pays $7,800 per shipment. Hagins said he’s trying to figure out how to get copy machines and printers — items he finds in abundance — to a group of young men in the Gambia. If they could start a copy shop, they’ve told him, they might escape the fate of many of their friends, economic refugees who became caught up in the Libyan slave trade.

In contrast, poverty here in the U.S. doesn’t quite make sense to Hagins.

“Most of the areas I go to are supposedly impoverished areas, but to see all the things that are thrown away, I can see why. We’re marketed to like crazy and we get sucked into, ‘You have to have the latest thing.”

While not quite a “freegan,” Hagins has decorated his home, clothed his family and, frequently, set his dinner table with rescued finds. In past lives, he was a schoolteacher and later a taxi driver. He likes scrapping better.

“I’m free,” he said. He can pick up his 8-year-old son from elementary school, or go see his two sons who are in college when they have music recitals.

By opting out of consumer culture, he said, “I capitalize on the consumerism in America, and the waste.”

The trend of Buy Nothing groups on Facebook and charity drop boxes around the city have not made a dent in his inventory. He regularly fields phone calls from church groups that have more donations than they can manage, or individuals asking for clean-outs.

The job requires a thorough knowledge of garbage routes, and of garbage.

“I’m a trashologist,” Hagins said. “The average person looks at a vacuum cleaner that’s broken, and they see a broken vacuum cleaner. I see the motor and the copper wire.”

There’s clean trash and there’s dirty trash; knowing the difference has kept Hagins mercifully bedbug free. He’s also learned to look for for-sale signs and clusters of contractor bags that indicate someone has moved. He’ll frisk them like they’re covered in braille and shake them like they’re Christmas presents.

The work has other hazards. Residents sometimes yell at him. One man pulled a gun. Police have stopped him, asking questions, demanding ID.

He’s not fazed. By Hagins’ estimation, there’s $1,000 in value on every 15 blocks’ worth of garbage. His problem is space: He lost the building he was using and hasn’t identified a new warehouse. So, for now, his inventory is limited.

Hagins would like to grow his business, hire help or even create a recyclers union to make swapping finds simpler. He pays other scrappers 50 cents for each pair of shoes. Other scrappers have their own specialties. One man he knows pays $2 to $4 a bag for plastic bottles, then takes them to New York in bulk to turn profit off the refunds, a modest scam.

This, he figures, could be the perfect employment opportunity for people getting back on their feet after incarceration.

He stops to refuel the minivan and meets a young man who’s pumping gas for money. He’s dropped out of high school, he says, because he stained his uniform shirt and can’t afford a new one. Hagins tears up listening to the kid’s story, and offers to find him work. He gives the teen his number, but predicts he’ll never call. They rarely do.

Then, Hagins gets back in the van, eager to get ahead of the garbage trucks, excited to uncover what’s next.

“It’s an amazing amount of waste.”

17,haiti,"Traditional emergency responses have focused on providing food and medical care to address hunger. But researchers say there may be an opportunity to do more.

Years have passed since the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, but the remnants of destruction remain. There are toppled homes, broken streets and contaminated waterways. One of the longest-lasting effects, though, will be the developmental damage to Haitian children who remain malnourished as a result of the disaster.

Before the earthquake, the malnutrition rate in Haiti was staggering – more than 29 percent of children under five years old were stunted, according to the World Bank. Following a massive humanitarian response that included a specific focus on child nutrition in the wake of the earthquake, that rate dropped to 22 percent. But it remains one of the highest rates among Latin American and Caribbean countries. Meanwhile, four years after the crisis, USAID was still warning that nearly a third of the population remained food insecure.

“The earthquake exacerbated the challenges of combating malnutrition in Haiti,” said Skyler Badenoch, the chief executive officer of Hope for Haiti. The community-based organization helped delivery emergency food rations for months after the earthquake. “Haiti suffered from extreme food insecurity and our attention for a long period following the earthquake was on the provision of immediate relief.”

Disaster relief may ease immediate hunger, but the threat of malnutrition lasts long after the aid tents are taken down. Flying in boxes of food may work in the short term, but it does not address the structures that were already contributing to malnutrition, and which might be further exacerbated by the emergency. Experts wonder if there was a missed opportunity, in the wake of Haiti’s earthquake, to address these issues. And if they had, whether malnutrition rates might not be much lower than they are now.

The situation in Haiti offers a window into an unfolding debate about whether – and how – to integrate long-term nutrition programming into a disaster response.

The Typical Response

“Regardless of in a developed or developing country context, if there are considerable pre-existing food insecurity or malnutrition [issues], they are most assuredly going to be exacerbated by a natural disaster,” said Regine Webster, vice president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy.

But the typical response, which the actors in Haiti largely followed, focuses on quickly trying to ease global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates by delivering food and responding to immediate health needs. GAM tracks the rate of moderate and severe acute malnutrition among children between 6 and 59 months old, using that as a proxy for the health of the larger community.

In the years after the earthquake, Haiti’s GAM rate actually began to climb, jumping from 5.1 percent in 2012 to 6.5 percent in 2013, according to the United Nations. It has since fallen, though individual communities have experienced spikes following recent droughts and hurricanes.

New research out of Tufts University indicates that the existence of persistent GAM in the aftermath of a crisis, like the Haiti earthquake, “indicates that food security may not be the main driver.” And their conclusions have the potential to recalibrate the traditional responses to malnutrition following an emergency.

The researchers behind the report, Dr. Helen Young and Anastasia Marshak, studied 25 countries with persistent GAM rates above 15 percent, including Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan. They wanted to find out why rates remained high despite both humanitarian and development responses.

According to Young and Marshak, the current model, which focuses on delivering food, improving care and fighting disease, overlooks more systemic problems, particularly in communities that were already experiencing malnutrition. They argue there are four “cross-cutting themes” that also need to be addressed in any response: gender; livelihood systems; the history of vulnerability and long-term trends driving acute malnutrition; and seasonal fluctuations in acute malnutrition.

The 1983 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the result of a civil war and the government withholding food supplies from rebel areas. Also, local gender norms played a role by narrowing land and employment opportunities for women. The traditional “food-first” model of relief – delivering food boxes to stop hunger – struggles to reverse the causes of these types of crises. It also doesn’t address the ways a more traditional emergency, like Haiti’s earthquake, might exacerbate existing food security issues, such as poverty, land degradation and social inequalities.

The traditional response, the researchers argue, is a silo-ed approach that focuses on treatment without factoring in long-term prevention. With a better understanding of what long-term interventions work, they could be used in tandem with immediate relief efforts to reverse malnutrition trends.

“We’re often very focused on short-term indicators of the severity of the problem,” said Dr. Daniel Maxwell, a professor of food security at Tufts. “We’re often more focused on the immediate outcomes,” such as food consumption rates. Now experts are eager to try something different.

The Challenges that Remain

That won’t be easy, though, in part because the current approach, with its focus on food, health and hygiene in the aftermath of a crisis, has been in place for a long time. But it also points to a broader difficulty in trying to coordinate across organizations with very different missions.

Convincing organizations to research causes of malnutrition and take a diverse approach to resolving it can be difficult, said Dr. Jessica Fanzo, associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. “When you start getting into measuring growth and micronutrients, you need expertise and funding so a lot of people decide not to do that. You need that evidence base to influence policymakers.”

Fanzo co-chaired the 2017 Global Nutrition Report, which advocates for further promotion of nutritious diets and increasing the building of food infrastructure during humanitarian assistance efforts. “Linking immediate humanitarian relief interventions with longer-term development approaches is important for this resiliency,” the report concludes.

There is also the issue of funding. Young and Marshak note short-term funding cycles, which is how most humanitarian responses are paid for, are unable to take on in-depth analysis of existing causes of malnutrition. And like the organizations fighting malnutrition, there is a problem of siloed information, in which it is difficult for researchers to compare various findings to look at information across time.

There are some changes happening, though, on a small scale. Maxwell pointed to “weather index-based insurance schemes” in Kenya that fight droughts and give farmers confidence to invest in technologies that could boost their production.

Much research and work remains, though, he said, beginning with a better understanding of what other factors contribute to persistent GAM. “There are still some puzzles out there with regard to what drives these high levels of malnutrition.”","After Haiti, Rethinking How to Address Malnutrition in an Emergency",https://www.newsdeeply.com/malnutrition/articles/2018/03/28/after-haiti-rethinking-how-to-address-malnutrition-in-an-emergency

Energy Assistance AREA — Connecticut's Community Action Agencies (CAAs) are accepting energy assistance applications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding. At this time, the program has been funded at 90% of its overall allocation of LIHEAP funds. For Connecticut, that amounts to a little over $67 million. The Connecticut Department of Social Services oversees the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) and it is administered by the CT CAAs. Connecticut residents struggling to pay their utility bills this winter can apply for home heating assistance through their local CAA (see attached list). Connecticut's Community Action Agencies are the only nonprofit agencies administering this critical home heating assistance program to Connecticut's most vulnerable residents. Each CAA has application intake sites throughout their service regions and may include town halls, so those interested should check with their local CAA for a complete site listing. CAAs are certifying assistance for those who heat with oil, propane, and deliverable fuels. May 1, 2018, is the last day households can apply for benefits unless the household is utility heated and has a shut off notice for its primary source of heat. May 15, 2018 is the last day a utility heated household with a shut off notice for its primary source of heat can apply for benefits. There are other potential benefits to customers who come in for energy assistance: weatherization services; matching payment program with utilities; and, heating system repair and replacement. Additionally, the CAA staff works with customers around accessing other benefits for which they may be eligible including SNAP, child care, financial counseling, and other programs and services the agency may offer. Connecticut's poorest families struggle each and every year to heat their homes in this a state with one of the highest utility rates in the country. Often times, customers are forced to choose between heating and eating or heating and paying for their medicines. CEAP allows them to not only cover high home energy costs and keep warm during the cold winter months, but gives limited income families the opportunity to address other critical, basic needs, rather than having to choose between them. Any resident who needs help paying their heating bill this winter should contact their Community Action Agency immediately. For more information on Connecticut's Energy Assistance Program, how to find your local CAA to apply, or to make a donation, visit www.cafca.org or contact the Connecticut Association for Community Action (CAFCA), 144 Clinton Street, New Britain, CT, 06053, 860-832-9438.

19,haiti,"Editor’s note: Gimme 5 is a five-question interview on a topic of local interest.

Who: Bonni Knight, Education director of the English in Mind Institute in Haiti.

Talks about: Celebrate Haiti Benefit Dinner.

When: 5:30 p.m. Thursday.

Where: Forage, 930 Galloway St., Building 13, Suite 212.

Cost: $30. Tickets are limited to 72.

Information: englishinmind.org.

Can you give us some background on the fundraiser?

I have been volunteering in Haiti at an adult English school for 5½ years. I go twice a year.

We help students find jobs afterwards using their English. The school is funded by various international donations to a group called Friends of English in Mind Institute.

I’m also doing six pop-up coffee shops that day: The Local Store at Volume One, SHIFT Cyclery and Coffee Bar, Starr’s Sister, Ambient Inks, The Plus and Forage will be selling Haitian coffee to benefit Haiti.

I heard Wyclef Jean was coming to Eau Claire, a famous Haitian musician. He’s doing a concert at the Metro that night.

It occurred to me that if we are going to have this famous Haitian musician in town, it would work out to tie in a couple other things around him.

Which nonprofit will the dinner benefit?

Friends of EIM, which funds the adult English school in Haiti.

Why choose this cause?

There are several reasons. The main one is that aid organizations of the world have failed Haiti.

They had a terrible earthquake, and a lot of well-meaning organizations threw a lot of money in the direction of Haiti that never actually made it to Haiti.

One of the most effective, efficient ways to reduce poverty is through adult education.

If you teach an adult a very employable skill like English in Haiti, then the adults can send their own children to school.

What do you hope people take away from the fundraiser?

Definitely a sense of having been part of something really valuable.

I believe with my whole heart that Haitians, they are not beggars. They just want a chance at life.

By doing this, people are really helping Haitians.

I also hope they have a really delicious dinner.

I brought back recipes I learned at the side of the Haitian cook at the compound where we stay (in Haiti).

Also, we’ll have a really great DJ at the dinner.

He’s going to play a lot of fun Caribbean tunes for us, so I think (attendees) will have fun.

What’s on the menu?

It’s a typical Haitian menu. The appetizer is a historic pumpkin soup with a great history. Haiti was the first slave nation in the world to revolt successfully against their slave owners. They used to be forced to make pumpkin soup for the masters, but couldn’t eat any themselves. It’s their liberation dish.

Then we’re having citrus-soaked chicken legs, which is really traditional, and a creole rice and beans, plus a spicy coleslaw called pikliz.

There aren’t a lot of dessert recipes in Haiti because not a lot of people have money for dessert, so we just borrowed from two of their historic crops: chocolate and coffee. We’re having an espresso cupcake with a mocha cream frosting.

20,haiti,"SANTIAGO: Chile is to ease visa regulations for Venezuelans fleeing the political crisis back home while tightening the rules for Haitians as it grapples with an influx of migrants, President Sebastian Pinera said Monday.

In light of the ""grave democratic crisis"" gripping Venezuela, Pinera said he was creating a so-called visa of ""democratic responsibility"" which Venezuelan citizens could obtain through the Chilean embassy in Caracas.

The move seeks to streamline the process of getting a visa for all Venezuelan nationals.

Before, they had visa-on-arrival access to Chile as tourists where those with a specific need could then apply for a student visa, a work permit or for permanent residency.

But under the new system, such visas will be available to all Venezuelans, regardless of their status — as long as they apply in Caracas, in a move aimed at significantly cutting red tape for those wanting to leave.

Announcing details of an in-depth reform of Chile's immigration laws, Pinera said that the moment had come ""to put our house in order.""

Over the past four years, Chile has become one of Latin America's top destinations for migrants, unveiling figures last week which pointed to more than a million foreigners in the country, almost double the previous estimates.

Around 300,000 of that number are thought to be living illegally in the copper-rich South American country, the ministry said.

Most of the migrants are believed to be from Venezuela and Haiti, with the new rules putting an end to the visa-on-arrival policy for citizens of both countries.

For Haitians, Chile is to impose a simple 30-day tourist visa which would only be available through the consulate in Port-au-Prince. Until now, such visas had been available on arrival.

It would also offer a 12-month ""humanitarian visa"" to Haitians with family in Chile.

The new rules also state that anyone entering the country as a tourist will no longer be able to change their status. — AFP",Chile to ease visa rules for Venezuelans fleeing Maduro,http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2018/04/10/chile-ease-visa-rules-venezuelans-fleeing-maduro

September 2011: Six Oxfam members of staff in Haiti leave the charity after being found guilty of misconduct. Oxfam’s country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, resigns. Penny Lawrence, GB international director at Oxfam, says the action of those who have left ""is not representative of the strong commitment shown and the hard work carried out by Oxfam’s team in Haiti.""

October 2017: The Charity Commission contacts Oxfam after The Times newspaper alerted it to claims that former Oxfam country director for Nigeria, Lesley Agams, was sacked in 2010 after she made a complaint of sexual assault against a former colleague. Oxfam says no evidence could be found to substantiate the allegations.

December 2017: The Charity Commission tells Oxfam to review its culture, management and governance arrangements in the wake of the reports of the charity’s handling of sexual misconduct claims. Oxfam will report back to the regulator on the progress of its reviews before the end of March 2018.

9 February 2018: The Times reports that three Oxfam employees resigned and four were sacked for gross misconduct after the charity concluded an investigation into allegations of sexual exploitation, bullying and intimidation, and the downloading of pornography. The charity confirms that one of those who resigned was van Hauwermeiren.

Public confidence ""It is clear that more can and must be done, not only to revive the reputations of those charities in the news, but also to maintain public confidence in the sector as a whole"" - Peter Kellner, chair of NCVO

12 February 2018: Oxfam’s chair, Caroline Thompson, announces changes to the charity’s safeguarding policies, including a new whistleblowing helpline for staff. Penny Lawrence, who was programme director in Haiti in 2011, expresses her ""shame"" over the scandal and resigns as deputy chief executive.

12 February 2018: After holding crisis talks with senior Oxfam executives, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, says government funding to Oxfam is not guaranteed, adding that it must now demonstrate moral leadership to address the scandal and deliver progress on its assurances over safeguarding. The Charity Commission opens a statutory inquiry into Oxfam.

13 February 2018: Helen Evans, Oxfam’s former head of global safeguarding between 2012 and 2015, says that senior staff at the charity and the Charity Commission were both aware of concerns about Oxfam’s safeguarding policies and that she had repeatedly raised concerns about allegations of sexual abuse by Oxfam employees both abroad and at home.

14 February 2018: A poll commissioned for Third Sector finds that more than 60 per cent of people in the UK are less likely to donate to Oxfam as a result of the crisis. Labour questions the efficacy of the Charity Commission after concerns of safeguarding were raised by Evans in 2015.

16 February 2018: Oxfam’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, claims people are ""gunning"" for the charity and that the reaction to the scandal is ""out of proportion to the level of culpability"". The charity launches an action plan to improved its safeguarding and its response to allegations of sexual misconduct.

19 February 2018: Brendan Cox resigns as trustee of the charity he set up in memory of his murdered wife, the former MP Jo Cox, following allegations of sexual misconduct in his previous role as policy director at Save the Children.

Time bomb ""I think generally the commission has been caught on the hop on safeguarding, and it’s clear it has not given safeguarding the sort of priority it should have had... I always felt that safeguarding was a potential time bomb"" - Sir Stephen Bubb, former chief executive of Acevo

20 February 2018: Goldring tells MPs on the International Development Select Committee that Oxfam has lost around 7,000 regular donors since the scandal broke and the corporate partners were ""reserving judgements"".

21 February 2018: Mordaunt tells MPs in the House of Commons that Oxfam was guilty of a ""complete betrayal of trust"" of its beneficiaries, volunteers, staff and the British public in its mishandling of the response to the claims of sexual misconduct and repeats that government funding is not guaranteed.

23 February 2018: Haiti’s government stops Oxfam GB from working in the country for two months while it investigates how the charity handled the sexual exploitation cases. Oxfam says it is ""committed to cooperate with their investigation"". Justin Forsyth resigns as deputy executive director of Unicef after allegations emerged that he sent inappropriate texts to junior staff when he was chief executive of Save the Children.

26 February 2018: Mordaunt warns that she will stop funding organisations that do not live up to expected standards in the wake of the scandal as 22 UK aid charities, including Oxfam, pledge to increase the amount of resources they spend on safeguarding.

5 March 2018: At a meeting with aid charities and the Charity Commission, Mordaunt says DfID will introduce new standards that all aid organisations would have to comply with in order to receive government funds. She describes the standards as ""world-leading, tough and exciting"".

6 March 2018: The DfID says that 80 new safeguarding incidents have been reported by 26 charities to the Charity Commission after it had called for assurances following the Oxfam scandal.

9 March 2018: The bad publicity about Oxfam and other aid agencies has barely dented public trust in charities, according to research from the Charities Aid Foundation.",Oxfam Timeline: How the Haiti scandal unfolded,https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/oxfam-timeline-haiti-scandal-unfolded/governance/article/1459242
