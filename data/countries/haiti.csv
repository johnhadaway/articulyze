Explosive new documents obtained through a FOIA request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reveal that the Trump Administration knew that deteriorating conditions within Haiti warranted an extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) but terminated the program anyway.

The Administration claimed that conditions in Haiti were improving to the point where families could return, even though their own secret report said the opposite. As the USCIS’ October 2017 TPS Considerations for Haiti report cites, ""Many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist, and the country remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal fragility. Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have impeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew—the latter of which struck Haiti in October 2016 and ‘severely worsened the pre-existing humanitarian situation’ in the country.""

First of all, a huge shout out to the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild for exposing this report. It’s now clear that the President and his officials blatantly lied to the American people about Haiti’s current conditions. Haiti is in no condition to accept the return of the nearly 60,000 Haitians with TPS. Haitian TPS holders should be allowed to remain in the U.S., and the program should be extended to new beneficiaries.

This report is further proof of the Administration’s ruthless pursuit of its ultimate goal: to kick out and keep out people of color – regardless of their connections to our shared country or of their desperate need. DHS Secretary Nielsen has a lot of explaining to do. Unfortunately, she seems so determined to kiss the ring of the Dear Leader in the White House, we won’t hold our breath.

Instead, Congress should step up and step in to make sure that common sense and common decency prevail.

1,haiti,"Submitted photo courtesy of Erica Fischer-Kaslander - The Rev. Andrew Topp is seen with his single-engine Piper PA-32 plane. He was killed when the plane crashed Wednesday in West Milford.

Posted: May. 4, 2018 12:01 am

A pilot killed when his plane went down in West Milford was remembered Thursday as a minister, husband, father of six and humanitarian.

The Rev. Andrew Topp, 59, who was a pastor for more than 20 years at the First Reformed Church of Boonton, had hopped into his single-engine Piper PA-32 to take it for a test run to the Oranges in preparation for a May 13 trip to Haiti to do missionary work, according to Topp's daughter, Erica Fischer-Kaslander, who lives in Haledon.

Topp, who always had a passion for flying and had spoken about it since his father was in the Air Force, obtained his pilot's license about 15 to 18 years ago, Fischer-Kaslander said. His desire to get the license was motivated by the humanitarian work he did with his non-profit, International Humanitarian Aid Foundation Inc., which he founded in 2007.

His missionary work brought him to almost every country in the world, his daughter said, and he found that having a small plane to deliver supplies quicker was a benefit.

""He was able to reach these remote areas with his plane that larger non-profits couldn't,"" she said.

Although he had owned different planes over the years, the plane he was flying was the only one he owned currently. On the National Transportation Safety Board aircraft identification system, the tail number on Topp's plane, which is shown in a photo his daughter shared with the New Jersey Herald, was registered to his non-profit.

Nick Stefano, of Wantage, was friends with Topp when the two were teenagers living across the street from one another in North Haledon.

""He was part of my childhood. It's so hard to think he's not there anymore that I can't talk to him,"" Stefano said.

The two eventually graduated from high school and went their separate ways, but they always stayed in touch.

""We were talking just a couple weeks ago, and he told me to stop by his church (in Boonton),"" Stefano said, adding that Topp shoveled Stefano's mother's driveway in North Haledon a little while back.

Stefano was planning on taking Topp up on his offer and wanted to get into missionary work and animal rescue with him.

Topp was a self-proclaimed animal lover, according to Stefano, and often worked to help rescue animals from high-kill shelters and from natural disasters.

Topp worked closely with Home for Good Dog Rescue, a non-profit in Berkeley Heights, and helped fly supplies to Texas and returned with dozens of dogs after the state was slammed by Hurricane Harvey.

""If your dog arrived in New Jersey by rescue flight, chances are he or she was flown by Andy, as he had spent two years flying more than 300 Home for Good dogs safely home,"" the group said in a Facebook post Thursday.

Upset that he wasn't able to see his friend one last time, Stefano only had positive memories to share of his childhood friend.

""He was a great man. It's devastating,"" Stefano said, adding that the world has ""certainly lost a great person.""

Officials said that Topp's plane went down around 2:38 p.m. Wednesday in a wooded area near the former Jungle Habitat property, which is administered by Ringwood State Park.

The Federal Aviation Administration indicated the airplane crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 24 at the Greenwood Lake Airport.

The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

Just a few years ago, tragedy struck the Topp family when Topp's brother, Bob, died in a motorcycle accident in Kentucky at the age of 60.

Topp, who stored his plane at Greenwood Lake Airport, also organized trips to help aid victims of natural disasters, built orphanages, was a member of Gift of Life and Rotary International District 7490.

""We organized a trip for him to fly to the U.S. Virgin Islands to help assist during Hurricane Maria (in 2017),"" Fischer-Kaslander said, adding that she recalls he had to wait out the storm in Florida and ended up flying around the hurricane to reach his destination.

She never flew with him, but would often help him on the ground with organizing supplies.

""We were a great team. I served as his right hand, and my experience working with him actually led me into a career in social work,"" Fischer-Kaslander admitted.

""My passion, I owe it all to my father,"" she said. ""He was an inspiration.""

Although the reality of the crash and the loss of her father was still very raw on Thursday, Fischer-Kaslander said that she intends to carry on her father's legacy and continue with his work.

2,haiti,"After benefiting from a one-week camp courtesy of the united efforts of the Bob Marley Foundation, Alacran Foundation and the Jamaica Football Federation, Jamaica's senior Reggae Girlz will be on the bubble as they hop across to Haiti today ahead of the first phase of the CONCACAF Caribbean Women's World Cup Qualifiers.

The team, which jetted to Orlando for the week-long camp to spruce up preparations for the tournament, will bow into action on Wednesday against Guadeloupe, before tackling Martinique and host Haiti on Friday and Sunday, respectively.

The qualifiers in May constitute five groups with only the winners of each group set to advance to the final stage of the Caribbean round scheduled to take place from July 21–29.

The top three finishers of the final round will qualify for the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship, where they will vie for a spot in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup to be staged in France.

The 20-member squad will be under the direction of Head Coach Hue Menzies and assistant coaches Lorne Donaldson and Andrew Price. The latter directed Jamaica's team in the recent Caribbean Football Union (CFU) Women's Challenge series.

Both games in the Challenge Series provided an avenue for the local players to fine-tune preparations, but the week-long camp would have added significant improvements for both local and overseas-based players heading into the qualifiers.

Meanwhile, the camp, which was made possible by Jamaica's women's football programme ambassador, Cedella Marley, who invited Alacran Foundation, a UK-registered charity, to come on board to support the initiative.

The vision of the Foundation is “we want all children to have the opportunity to realise their potential in music and sport”.

Alacran Foundation was launched by the owner of the Alacran Group, Alessandra Lo Savio.

“Whenever I am in Jamaica I am struck by the amazing talent of the children as they play and sing. However, I know how few of them will ever get the chance to follow these passions and I wanted to find a way to help give some of them the opportunity to realise their dreams.

“The foundation is starting plans to build specialist music and sport-focused schools in Jamaica, as well as funding existing charitable projects focused on young people,” Lo Savio stated.

Cedella Marley, CEO of the Marley Group of Companies, came on board as global ambassador for the Jamaica Women's Football programme in March 2014.

Since then, her continued efforts to raise awareness of “every girl's right to play football” helps to bring the programme much-needed funding.

In addition to that, she has also assisted in getting the attention of international media during the 2014 FIFA Women's World Cup Qualifiers, including ESPN and FOX Sports.

Delegation — Marline Brown - head of delegation; Hue Menzies - head coach; Lorne Donaldson - assistant coach; Andre Price - assistant coach; Jean Nelson - team manager; Dr Lori-ann Miller - team doctor; Saundria Codling - physiotherapist; Jason Henry - physical trainer; William Hitzelberger - fitness coach; Omar Folkes - equipment manager; Hubert Busby - goalkeeper coach.

4,haiti,"It's a cliché, but it's true: Adults are always complaining about the next generation. Chloe and Halle Bailey have something to say about that.

The 18- and 19-year-old sisters known as been singing together since they were little. In 2013, they caught Queen Bey's attention after they uploaded their YouTube cover of Beyoncé's ""Best Thing I Never Had."" Now the sisters are signed to Beyoncé's label, Parkwood Entertainment.

As Chloe x Halle, they released their debut album The Kids Are Alright in March. They also star in the Freeform show Grown-ish — for which they wrote the theme song, ""Grown"" — as college-aged sisters Jazlyn and Skyler, and were approached by Ava DuVernay to contribute ""Warrior"" for the A Wrinkle in Time soundtrack.

On top of the world before they even complete two decades around the sun, Chloe and Halle spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about growing up singing and being role models for young black women.



Interview Highlights

On writing The Kids Are Alright's title track

Halle Bailey: We were in our living room. My sister started playing these amazing chords and we sat with those melodies for a few days until the lyrics came to us. It was basically the message that we wanted to portray to the kids of today, to remind us all that no matter what is happening right now in the world, we're gonna be alright. Because for the youth, especially, it feels like there's the weight of the world on our shoulders right now; are we going to be okay with the future and what's to come?

On singing together for the first time as kids

Chloe Bailey: I was 7 and my sister was 5. We were singing ""Summertime"" at our talent show at Spelman College summer camp, and we actually won the talent show! When we saw our names under first place, I still remember seeing it in my mind. I remember being like, ""Wow, people actually like us singing together. We could really do this.""

On singing YouTube covers and being discovered by Beyoncé

Halle: We always sang around Atlanta and did these shows and club appearances — these little girls in these sundresses [laughs]. And some people would tell us, ""Oh, maybe you [should] also do YouTube covers?"" We never took that too seriously because we heard of the rare stories where people would get discovered off of YouTube, and we were like, ""Oh yeah, sure, OK""; we never thought that one day it would actually be us. And when we first posted our cover to ""Best Thing I Never Had"" by Beyoncé, we were just singing for fun.

Chloe: I remember we taped it and we asked mom and dad if we could post it. Next thing you know, all of these views came in and we were like, ""Wow, what's going on? How is this happening?"" And we just kind of kept that going. And then the Queen Bey came knocking.

On starring in Grown-ish and speaking up for young black women

Chloe: We have a laser focus on our dreams right now, and so we're not really worried about the validation from men or young boys. I think that's something that is really special, when you can love yourself. I was just grateful that we were given these roles, Jazlyn and Skyler, to portray what a lot of young black women go through all over the world. Sometimes it even expands from dating: with career jobs, and sometimes based on how your name is pronounced or the way your hair looks and what's acceptable in today's society.

Halle: It always amazes us when young black girls and all of these people come up to us and say, ""That episode of Grown-ish really spoke to me. I felt like I was you guys. I've been through that when I'm in college and I don't see the majority who looks like me and I'm really not getting hit on or talked to and I see all of my friends getting all of this play."" It is really inspiring when we hear that because that's so cool that we could be portraying this and doing our jobs and realizing that, hey, as long as I'm confident, I'm going to be great, no matter what.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now we want to spend a few minutes with Richard Stearns, president of World Vision USA, the Christian humanitarian organization.

Under Mr. Stearns' leadership, World Vision has become one of the world's largest charities with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Its focus is on children in 90 countries. Earlier this year, Mr. Stearns announced that he was stepping down after 20 years at the helm, so we thought this would be a good time to check in with him to hear his thoughts about his work and his mission. He was kind enough to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C.

Richard Stearns, thank you so much for being with us.

RICHARD STEARNS: Well, thanks, Michel. Great to be here.

MARTIN: Before your service at World Vision, you were CEO of the Lenox china company, which I think many people would know. So how did you go from Lenox china to heading up what has become one of the world's largest charities? What was the connection?

STEARNS: Well, it's kind of a crazy story. About the only commonality is that both organizations were involved in feeding the hungry. Lenox fed them on fine china, but World Vision obviously deals with hunger around the world. But the decision to come to World Vision really came out of my faith background.

I was a Christian, considered myself committed to my faith, and this was an opportunity not just to talk the talk but to walk the walk. And so my wife and I had been donors to World Vision for almost 15 years before the phone call came, and it was from an executive recruiter. Essentially, made the decision to quit my job, sell our house, move our family to Seattle, where the sun rarely shines. And 60 days later, I was in the jungles of Uganda in the middle of the AIDS pandemic.

MARTIN: What exactly does World Vision do? Just talk a little bit, if you would, about what World Vision does.

STEARNS: Well, we're often described as a relief and development organization. And so most people understand emergency relief. You know, it's the Syrian refugee crisis. It's the Haiti earthquake. It's the hurricanes in Houston. It's flooding in Bangladesh. And people are desperate. They're in the world's emergency room, and we're like the emergency room doctors that go in and try to stabilize and help traumatized people. Syrian refugee crisis would be a good example. We are in the five most affected countries in the Middle East. We're doing clean water for tent settlements of refugees. We're doing some health work. We're the World Food Program's largest implementing partner in terms of food vouchers and making sure that these refugees have sustenance. But maybe more important than even that is to try to provide hope for people who are, right now, in hopeless situations.

MARTIN: When you talk about providing hope, though, you know - and I'm sure you're aware of this - in recent years, some have become more critical of these organizations. The feeling is that sometimes relief workers are really there to save themselves. Their focus is really on their own kind of experience as opposed to providing actual service.

STEARNS: Well, I really reject that. Our staff on the frontlines in these places - in the South Sudan Civil War, in the middle of the Syrian refugee crisis - these are courageous people. There's rarely a year goes by that there isn't a World Vision worker killed in the line of duty. And so I don't believe it's that kind of motivation for most of them.

MARTIN: What is the motivation for most of them?

STEARNS: Well, for World Vision, it's our faith. You know, Matthew 25 - that famous passage - I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. Jesus said whatever you have done for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you've done it to me. Mother Teresa claimed that first. And she said when she worked among the poor in Calcutta, she said I saw the face of Jesus in his most distressing disguise.

MARTIN: Twenty years is a long time to lead an organization, so it's kind of hard to summarize, but what would you say was the high point of your tenure and what was the low point?

STEARNS: Well, you know, most of what we do is in the low points of the world and - because we only go where the most-hurting people are. So one of the things you have to deal with is just the constant exposure to human suffering. But I think our finest hours have been when we have become champions for major issues in our world. And I think I'd point first to the AIDS pandemic. In the early 2000s, there was a lot of ignorance around what AIDS was doing to Africa. Americans were largely unaware. And of course, AIDS was stigmatized.

And so we went on a 15-city tour of the United States, speaking to pastors, speaking to business leaders, speaking to the press, trying to raise awareness and support for AIDS in Africa. And it was a high point because we were instrumental in lobbying for the PEPFAR program, the President's Emergency Plan For Aids Relief, that came under President Bush. And it was the largest foreign-assistance program ever passed by Congress since the Marshall Plan back in the 1940s. And we helped to turn the tide for HIV and AIDS. And the PEPFAR initiative alone has probably saved 12 million lives and counting.

MARTIN: Asking again about low moments - in this country, one of the stories that some associate as a low moment under your tenure was in 2014 when you announced that World Vision would change its policies to hire LGBT Christians in same-sex marriages. But after a backlash from some of your prominent supporters - donors - you rescinded that and said that you would not change the policy. What do you think? I mean, did you do the right thing?

STEARNS: Yeah. Well, you know, there are so many things that can divide us as a faith community. So we're a faith-based organization. We're a community of people with faith values that we hold deeply. And we're a multi-denominational organization. We were trying to find a space of unity beyond the controversies of this issue, and we were unsuccessful in doing it. And we got out ahead of our constituencies, and it really distracted us from our core mission of joining hands to help the poor and to do it in the name of Christ. And so we did reverse the policy so that we could move on and really get back to focusing on what we think our core mission is in the world.

MARTIN: Before we let you go, I wanted to ask, do you have some sort of thoughts about how kind of faith has integrated in your own life?

STEARNS: Well, you know, for me, faith is the bedrock of my life. And you know, I became a Christian at age 24. I'd been an atheist. And through my wife and my relationship with her before we got married - she was a committed Christian - her testimony to me and through some friends and through a lot of reading of C.S. Lewis and John Stott and other theologians, I really came to the conclusion that the Christian story was, in fact, true and real.

And I remember the day that I knelt down in my dormitory room at the Wharton School of Business, of all places, and I made a commitment to Christ and said, I want to live my life for you. I want to become more like you. And I will go where you call and follow where you lead. And so that explains why, in 1998, when a recruiter called me and said, how would you like to leave your large salary and your corporate Jaguar and your beautiful home in the suburbs and come and serve the poorest people in the world? I mean, that answer had to be yes because it was almost like God was saying, are you going to make good on that commitment that you made when you were 24 years old? - because I've got a job that I want done, and I'm inviting you to do it.

MARTIN: That is Richard Stearns. He is concluding 20 years as president of the Christian charity World Vision USA. It's one of the world's largest. He was kind enough to join us in our studios here in Washington, D.C.

Richard Stearns, thank you so much for speaking with us.

2.1 million people affected by hurricane Matthew, with 546 fatalities

1 million people still need humanitarian assistance more than one year after hurricane Matthew 140 000 households still require shelter solutions.

4.4 million people acutely food insecure, of which 1.3 million people severely food insecure (October 2017, CNSA)

37 546 internally displaced people (IDPs) in 26 camps (IOM)

EU humanitarian funding: €388.35 million since 1994

Introduction

Due to its vulnerability to natural hazards and high levels of poverty, Haiti has limited capacity to cope with recurring emergencies caused by severe disasters, such as the 7.0 earthquake in 2010, recurrent hurricanes, and prolonged droughts worsened by the El Niño weather phenomenon.

Acute food insecurity and malnutrition, epidemics, and humanitarian needs generated by the ongoing migration crisis require sustained humanitarian assistance.

What are the needs?

Haiti is facing critical food and nutritional insecurity, with 4.4 million Haitians acutely food insecure and 131 000 malnourished children, a consequence of prolonged drought and the impacts of hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Irma (2017). More than a year after hurricane Matthew made landfall on the Haitian coasts, over 140 000 affected households still do not have access to minimum earthquake and seismic-resistant homes and shelters, thus remaining highly vulnerable to future shocks.

In 2017, 13 747 suspected cholera cases and 159 associated fatalities were registered, and 995 new suspected cases and 9 associated fatalities have been recorded during the first trimester of 2018.

Humanitarian needs still persist in remaining IDP camps set up after the 2010 earthquake. Roughly 37 500 Haitians are still sheltered in camps, where access to water and basic services remains very limited. Additionally, about 230 000 Dominicans of Haitian descent are at risk of becoming stateless and deported to Haiti. Since June 2015, over 260 000 individuals have crossed the border from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, including over 4 000 unaccompanied minors.",ECHO Factsheet – Haiti – April 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/echo-factsheet-haiti-april-2018

The Children’s Nutrition Program of Haiti will honor Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee with the Heart for Haiti Award at their 20 Years of Success celebration on Friday, May 18, 6:30 p.m., at Chattanooga’s Stratton Hall.

The benefit dinner will honor Senator Corker for his personal involvement with CNP’s humanitarian efforts, as well as his decades of public service locally, nationally, and internationally.

The May 18 celebration honors not only Senator Corker and CNP’s network of supporters, but also the accomplishments of CNP’s Haitian staff. The staff of health educators, called “monitrices,” are CNP’s boots on the ground. They walk for miles and miles each day to go to individual homes, organize community screening events, and offer life-saving intervention through song, stories, and hands-on nutrition and family planning training.

The empowerment of these 53 Haitian women, some of whom have suffered the effects of malnutrition themselves, has been the secret to CNP’s success. Their efforts, combined with specialized care facilities in Leogane and surrounding communities, resulted in the successful treatment of over 600 children for acute malnutrition in 2017 alone.

The CNP’s work depends on the generosity of hundreds of individuals, as well as corporate, nonprofit, and faith-based donating organizations. Proceeds from the 20 Years of Success fundraiser will go to Haiti, to support the work of CNP’s staff and supporting healthcare facilities.

The City of North Miami released a list of events to help locals celebrate. Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners Jean Monestime, always one to celebrate Haitian Heritage Month, attended the kick-off party that was held at the Perez Art Museum Miami on May 3.

The month of May holds a special place in Haitians’ hearts. In Haiti, Mother’s Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of May and the birth of Toussaint Louverture, the revolutionary general who won Haiti’s independence from France, is remembered on May 20.

Haitians make up a big part of the Magic City’s history, long before President Donald Trump referred to Haiti as a “shithole” country. Haiti’s red, white, and blue flag that was sewn by Catherine Flon can be found anywhere throughout Miami-Dade County.

Between 2011 and 2015, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area had the most concentration of Haitian immigrants in the country. According to Migration Policy Institute, in 2015, there were 676,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States. Brookings Institute says 18,600 Haitians live in Miami, making them the second largest immigrant group behind Cubans in the U.S.

Haitian Heritage Month, which was started in the 1930s by Dumarsais Estime, Haiti’s then minister of education, continues where Haitian Flag Day left.

Some 35 years ago, Jim Greene was doing construction in Haiti, helping to build a sugar mill for then-President Jean-Claude Duvalier. Today, the 77-year-old High Point man is helping build something much more important in the Caribbean island country — people's lives.

""I get such pleasure and happiness and joy from helping these people,"" says Greene, whose ministry — Children's Redeemed International, or CRI — has unofficially adopted Rang, a remote mountain village in Haiti. ""They have very little, but these people are smart and they're productive — if you just show them what to do, they can do it.""

Greene, the longtime owner of the Coins & Stuff pawn shop on E. Lexington Avenue, had been praying about a new ministry opportunity when he says God laid it on his heart to create a children's outreach ministry. So in 2015, he founded CRI and began partnering with two churches — Cathedral of Faith Christian Center in Summerfield and First Wesleyan Church in High Point — to host family-friendly festivals with food, music, bounce houses, games and other activities, all aimed at sharing the message of Christianity with area children.

The following year, however, Greene added a new dimension to his ministry after meeting John Pierre, a High Point pastor who is originally from Haiti and has a ministry of his own there.

""When I found out where he was from, it touched my heart,"" Greene recalls. ""He's from this little village called Rang, and he wanted to build an orphanage there.""

The orphanage hasn't been built yet, but in the meantime CRI has undertaken a number of other projects to help change lives in the village. The first, and one of the most important, was the provision of clean drinking water.

""For generations, they've never had clean water in their village — they always had to walk a mile and a half away to get water from a spring in the mountains,"" Greene explains.

In December 2016, the ministry sent PVC pipe and fittings to be installed, which would allow clean water to be piped directly to Rang. With proper direction, the villagers installed the pipe themselves, and within three months they had clean water.

""On March 24, 2016, water began to flow through the pipe, and the whole village came out with their containers to catch the clean drinking water to carry back to their homes,"" Greene wrote in a report about CRI's accomplishments. ""Praise God. Can you imagine the joy and thankfulness of the people who received this gift God provided for them?""

Greene's ministry also has purchased a block-making machine and shipped it to the village. This equipment allows the people of the community to make their own concrete blocks, which they can sell for money and/or use to build a church, a school and an orphanage. Construction of the 60-by-100-foot church began this past week, according to Greene.

CRI has also provided the village with a 22-foot box truck with a lift, a cement mixer, a pressure washer to keep the equipment clean, a generator, wheelbarrows, tools and building supplies. The ministry has also provided sewing machines and is helping convert an old church into a factory for making clothing, and plans are in the works to send down several leather-sewing machines — and more than a ton of donated leather — which will be used to make sandals for children in the village. A class has been started to teach adults to read, with books and supplies furnished by CRI.

The ministry has even bought several motorcycles for the village, which Greene says is the easiest way to travel in the rough Haitian terrain.

According to Greene, all of the provisions CRI has given to the village have resulted in providing something else to the people there — jobs.

""We've been there 18 months, and right now we've got 120 people employed,"" he says. ""None of them had a job, and now they do.""

Greene, whose ministry is funded entirely through donations, says the work of CRI has blessed him beyond measure.

""Jesus said if you do it to one of the least of these, you've done it unto me,"" he says. ""The Lord laid it on my heart that these people need help, so that's what I'm doing, and it's such a joy. I'm doing what the Scriptures say to do, and it brings me so much joy and peace.""",North Carolina man's ministry aids small village in Haiti :: WRAL.com,https://www.wral.com/north-carolina-man-s-ministry-aids-small-village-in-haiti/17530965/

Haiti - Petit-Goâve : Back in class at EFACAP, but the crisis persists





Friday, April 13, at the end of an extraordinary meeting, teachers strikers of the School of Fundamental School of Application and Teaching Support Center (EFACAP) of Petit-Goâve decided to resume the work suspended for almost 2 months http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-24083-haiti-petit-goave-students-of-efacap-deprived-of-classes-for-almost-2-months.html from Monday, April 16, while affirming ""[...] the crisis is far from being solved within this institution because of the complexity of the problems""



Striking teachers have not at all appreciated the criticisms of observers and parents who consider them as ""bad guys"" who wrongly penalize students at the risk of provoking school failure



They point out to detractor that it is the state that is responsible for the worsening of the situation, recalling that they had written correspondences and observed several truces following promises by the Minister of National Education who suggested that funding for the payment of arrears is already identified or available... Deploring that despite these affirmations and promises, nothing concrete has been done.



""Today, parents can not blame us for the situation [...] it is the Ministry that must be criticized, a Ministry that remains deaf and indifferent to our demands,"" argued the teachers in announcing their return to the classrooms on Monday, to show that they are animated in good faith...



""We will resume work. However, EFACAP of Petit-Goâve will still be blocked because this school faces other internal problems: as examples: the case of teacher Manasseh appointed but unpaid for more than 2 years; teacher transfer and drop-out issues that have not yet been addressed, and the case of some teachers who have a letter of appointment but are not yet receiving their salary or who are working but do not have letter of appointment... We doubt very much that the school can function normally,"" have nuanced strikers stressing that their presence in the classroom does not mean the end of the crisis.

WEST MILFORD — Andrew Topp built schoolrooms for orphans in Haiti, transported at-risk shelter dogs from the South to a local rescue center, and brought water filtration devices to hurricane-wrecked portions of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean.

Friends and fellow humanitarians said Friday that the minister and contractor from North Haledon killed in a plane crash near Greenwood Lake Airport on Wednesday was probably the nicest person they had ever met.

“He was just fearless, and this guy never complained about anything,” said friend Victor Barton. “There was nothing he couldn’t do. He taught me how to weld in an hour.”

Topp crashed shortly after takeoff at about 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, authorities said.

His plane, a 1968 Piper PA-32-300, struck low-lying power lines about 1,000 feet south of the airport and clipped several trees before crashing in a piece of state parkland once home to the Warner Bros. Jungle Habitat theme park. The resulting fire bleached his yellow, purple, and white plane beyond recognition.

On Friday, Barton recalled meeting up with Topp in Les Cayes, Haiti. The two volunteered there several years ago, turning cargo containers and corrugated panels into a schoolroom for 25 young girls. All of the girls were orphans; many as a result of natural disasters, Barton said.

“It was just shocking. Here you have this completely white gentleman, you know, and he’s right out there in the middle of it … and it's 102 degrees,” Barton said. “That was his whole life, dedicating his life to helping people all over the Caribbean, especially Haiti.""

Barton, a business owner from North Plainfield, said he spoke with Topp, the 20-year reverend at First Reformed Church of Boonton, a few weeks ago. The two talked about their week in Haiti – “one of the best experiences I ever had,” Barton said. Barton credited that lifelong memory to Topp’s demeanor, experience and energy.

“He flew children here from Haiti for heart surgery. He was just amazing. It’s shocking that he’s no longer with us,” Barton said. “I really hope somebody takes the reigns of his foundation because it’s a great cause. He was doing a lot of good and a lot of people were depending on him.”

Topp’s foundation, the International Humanitarian Aid Foundation, released a statement on social media Wednesday stating that Topp’s “work and legacy will resonate with us all, and his mission to help those in need will continue for generations to come.”

“His can-do attitude and creativity for fixing, building, and restoration helped so many children,” the statement read. “These children now have bright futures thanks to the amazing resources Andy and his creation - IHAF- have provided.”

In addition to helping people, Topp would often stop on his way back from the Caribbean to help rescue dogs with the Home for Good rescue center in Summit.

Richard Errico, the co-founder of Home for Good, said he first met Topp through a national nonprofit that connects pilots and shelters. Soon after, Topp started flying exclusively for Home for Good, Errico said. Topp ultimately brought more than 300 dogs from high-kill shelters in the South to New Jersey.

“It went from just being a relationship as far as the dogs were concerned to actually being a friendship,” Errico said.

Home for Good typically relies on a van to transport 20 to 30 dogs at a time. The 12- to 14-hour trip can be stressful for the animals, he said. Topp could make the trip in four hours. Topp also attended shelter events, stayed overnight in Aiken, and made special trips to The Carolinas to transport upwards of two dozen rescue dogs. One was a day trip with Errico.

“He was always the initiator [and] he was never in a bad mood,” Errico said. “He was that type of person, who you could share your experiences with. He was a good listener. He was just one of the nicest people that I have ever met.”

The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

A preliminary report with some flight records is expected to be released next week. However, a full report identifying the probable cause of the accident could take 12 to 18 months to complete, said Terry Williams, a NTSB public affairs officer.

Topp's daughter, Erica Topp Fischer-Kaslander, said Thursday that her father stored his colorful plane at Greenwood Lake Airport. He was experienced with both the aircraft and the occasionally windy conditions above the hilly terrain near the New York State border, she said.

Internal Trump administration documents obtained through a lawsuit show that, three weeks before a top federal immigration official wrote a memo recommending the end of so-called Temporary Relief Status for Haitians in America, he had been told by his own staff that the conditions that led to the TPS designation in the first place hadn’t changed.



On November 20, 2017, the Trump administration announced it would end TPS, which allows some 59,000 Haitians to live and work in the United States.



“Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” wrote USCIS Director Francis Cissna in a Nov. 3 memo for Department of Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

But in an October 17 memo, Cissna’s staff at USCIS directly contradicted this rosy picture. “Many of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist,” the memo noted. (Both memos are embedded at the bottom of this post.)

The October report noted a list of issues still facing Haiti, including “food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.”

“Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have impeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew,” the report said, adding that this had “severely worsened the pre-existing humanitarian situation.”



“Due to the conditions outlined in this report, Haiti’s recovery from the 2010 earthquake could be characterized as falling into what one non-governmental organization recently described as ‘the country’s tragic pattern of one step forward, two steps back,’” the memo concluded—another direct contradiction of Cissna’s assertion that the country had “made significant progress.”

The documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit being litigated by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild and the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic.

Screenshot: USCIS memo

“[Cissna] either completely disregarded his own agency’s report or he cherry-picked a few positive developments to justify his recommendation to terminate TPS for Haitians,” Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project, told Splinter.

Cissna’s memo is also riddled with oversimplifications of the state of affairs in Haiti.

In one section, he claimed that “Haiti successfully completed its presidential election in February 2017.”

But his agency’s October memo offered a more comprehensive view: “While Haiti succesfully completed its electoral process in February 2017 after two years of contested results and political crises, its new government faces various challenges to promote recovery and reconstruction.”

Cissna, the son of an immigrant who moved to the U.S. from Peru, recently changed USCIS’ mission statement to remove a passage that described the U.S. as “a nation of immigrants.”

He was nominated to lead USCIS by President Trump, who reportedly claimed that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS,” and that Haiti was a “shithole” country.

Attorneys in the case said the documents contain evidence that the White House did not perform a good-faith review of the conditions in Haiti.

The National Lawyers Guild, along with the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic, sued for the documents after the federal government failed to respond to their FOIA request. So far the Guild has received heavily redacted documents, but they believe the lawsuit will likely produce thousands of more pages of internal documents.

The National Lawyers Guild last month also filed a lawsuit that accused the Trump administration of violating federal procedures and the Fifth Amendment rights of Haitians.



Neither the White House nor USCIS responded to a request for comment. We’ll update this story if we hear from them.

13,haiti,"One of the most exposed countries in the world to natural disasters, Haiti, an independent island state in the Caribbean with a population of close to 11 million, has been hit by hurricanes, floods and earthquakes with increasing ferocity and frequency. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew wiped out agricultural farms in South Haiti, which prior that year brought 74% of the country’s new jobs.

Although sharing the island with neighboring Dominican Republic where everyone has access to electricity, Haiti has limited access to electricity - where only 38% of Haitians in 2016 have a connection to the electrical grid, a small improvement from 28% of Haitians in 1990. Even those with access to the grid today still experience frequent blackouts and unreliable power quality.

Despite dealing with natural disasters and energy poverty, Haiti has optimistically made hard commitments to create a renewable energy economy.

10Power

In September 2017, the Haitian Parliament eliminated import tariffs and duties on solar equipment (the US, moving in the opposite direction, imposed a 30% import tariff on Chinese solar panels only a few months later in January 2018). Economy and Finance Minister Jude Alix Patrick Salomon stated in an interview with Haiti newspaper Le Nouvelliste, ""we wanted to encourage, as part of this budget, the acquisition of equipment from alternative sources of energy.""

Haiti is also positioned well for solar. A study by Worldwatch calculated that Haiti receives a comparable amount of average annual sunlight (calculated in global horizontal radiance) to sunny Phoenix, Arizona, making Haiti ideal for solar power. With the high cost of imported diesel, solar is cost competitive and with financing is immediately cost advantageous in Haiti.

How will large-scale solar be implemented in Haiti?

Leading the charge, millennial female social entrepreneur, Sandra Kwak, and founder of social venture 10Power, is pioneering the way in Haiti by fostering the collaborative support of the public and private sectors. Working in frontier markets, 10Power partners with local installers, providing and financing project developments for commercial-scale solar and energy storage solutions. In turn, this builds market ecosystems. “Our goal is to provide affordable, reliable renewable energy that will save businesses money and create jobs,” says Kwak.

10Power estimates the addressable market for commercial-scale solar in Haiti is currently over $500 million . The company has a current sales pipeline of over $100 million. “Haiti has the potential to quickly become a renewable energy powerhouse,” says Kwak. “The steps that are being taken in this direction are encouraging.”

10Power

Launched in 2016, the company has financed and installed solar power for two water purification centers, providing clean drinking water to surrounding schools and communities and supporting over 600 micro-enterprises, majority women-led. 10Power is continuing its work with plans to implement a large-scale solar energy project with an undisclosed international NGO in the coming months.

Kwak’s efforts to date have been recognized, from being awarded an Echoing Green Fellowship (Disclaimer: I work for Echoing Green) to most recently receiving investments from LIFT Economy Force for Good Fund and SheEO.

10Power's enthusiasm for solar in Haiti is shared and supported by the local government. The Haitian Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications (MTPTC) is working with the World Bank to develop a framework to deploy sustainable mini-grids. “It is exciting to see private sector and international development partnerships taking off,” says Nicolas Allien, Senior Energy Specialist and SREP-CTF Projects Coordinator at MTPTC. “We are implementing well-targeted financial instruments and policy measures in order to attract private sector investments in both on-grid and off-grid renewable energy solutions.”

10Power

Haitian President, Jovenel Moïse has set a goal of 24-hour electricity, which he announced in June 2017. His government has formed a National Regulatory Authority for the Energy Sector (ANARSE) led by Evenson Calixte, who is tasked with “facilitating the transition [of the energy sector] from a quasi-monopoly to unprecedented openness to the participation of other state actors…from the private sector.""

So what?

Haiti, despite dealing with natural disasters and energy poverty, is committed and positioned to achieve a renewable energy future. Emerging nations, such as Haiti, should not be underestimated in their potential to shift rapidly to a green future, leapfrogging the fossil fuels industry , with long-term investment and support from the public and private sectors. “Distributed renewable energy has the potential to increase resiliency, prosperity and power sustainable development,” says Kwak, and to achieve this at scale social ventures, such as 10Power, are critical.",Solar Startup Brings Renewable Energy To Haitian Businesses,https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilyeoh/2018/04/30/solar-startup-brings-renewable-energy-to-haitian-households/

It was a connection made out of the rubble of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake, and Chris Roegge still can't quite explain why he and Stevenson Jean Baptiste were drawn to each other.

Maybe it was Jean Baptiste's persistence and willingness to help, so much so that he latched on with a group of Americans who were in his hometown of Jacmel building houses for just over a week in 2011. Maybe it was his friendly but quiet personality. Or maybe it was his compassion, which drove him to visit the hospital multiple times a week to pray with sick and injured people at their bedsides in the years after the earthquake.

""He has always seemed so mature for his age,"" Roegge said.

It was Roegge's first trip out of the country to a place Jean Baptiste had never left. And seven years later, they're like father and son.

Technically, Jean Baptiste wasn't supposed to intertwine himself with Roegge's group.

Roegge and the missionaries from Trinity Lutheran Church in Urbana, working with Lutheran Church Charities, were accompanied by members of a local Haitian church, with whom they've developed a close relationship in the intervening years. The locals told the Americans not to engage with the kids who came by their worksite in Jacmel, the cultural hub of the country, because they couldn't offer them any pay.

One 17-year-old, though, stood out from the crowd. And although he was quiet, he was more mature and persistent than the rest.

Jean Baptiste, who lived at a nearby tent city at the time, was determined to help. It's that motive that had always driven him in his life and has since.

""I did not even expect money, I just wanted to help,"" said Jean Baptiste, who was on a holiday break from school at the time. ""I overcame that situation and I just started working with them. I introduced myself to the whole group, and I came back the next day.""

During the two weeks Roegge's group was there, he kept showing up, day after day, and he worked his way into the crew. Eventually, he learned enough to begin giving instructions to the workers, although his English was only ""minimally conversational,"" according to Roegge.

""I remember them asking me, 'Is that right?'"" Jean Baptiste said as he sat in Roegge's living room while he and Roegge laughed. ""I knew, 'Oh that's not right, and I fixed it.' It was fun though.""

Seven years later, Jean Baptiste lives with Roegge and his wife, Judy, and is a student at Parkland College, with the Roegges paying for his tuition.

It's a relationship that Roegge struggles to explain.

""I almost hesitate to say this, because it's going to sound trite and I don't mean it to be,"" Roegge said, ""but I've always felt that God put he and I together for a reason. There's a reason that he attached himself to our group, and there's a reason we became so close. I've never really been able to explain it very well. It's just there. It's always been there.""

♦ ♦ ♦

A year before Roegge's first visit, Stevenson lay on his bed after coming home sick from school when he noticed the television in his room shaking. Then, he noticed his bed convulsing.

When the shaking stopped, he bolted out of the house. Dust filled the air as buildings crumbled.

Soon, he was off to a tent city where he lived with his mother. Community was strong in the makeshift town, at least early on.

""We had different kinds of people, people from all over, people who lost their family and things like that,"" Jean Baptiste said.

Life was forever changed.

""In the days after, months after, even the years after, life was miserable,"" he said. ""No food, no water, no power, nothing. Phone didn't work, things like that. Thousands of people were killed. ... Even right now, there are some people, nobody knows where they are: If they were killed, if they disappeared.""

♦ ♦ ♦

Shortly after the earthquake, the pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church told his congregation he'd be organizing trips to Haiti. Roegge didn't plan on making the trip until his daughter, Megan, expressed her desire to go.

So Roegge left the country for the first time ever. Upon landing, they were met with the chaos of Port au Prince: The debris from the earthquake, the streets bustling with motorcycles and bicycles, the constant smell of garbage stinging the nose. They then wove south through the mountains for two hours before arriving in Jacmel, which is known for its French colonial architecture.

""It was so different from anything we'd experienced before,"" Roegge said.

They were taken in and housed by a local church. Haitian workers were in charge of the project, in which 20 simple houses and duplexes were built.

After Jean Baptiste attached himself to the group, Roegge found out about a program in which he could sponsor local students. He and his wife, Judy, decided to pay for Jean Baptiste's schooling for $300 a year, something others on the trip did for students as well. In Haiti, advancing to the next grade level depends on the ability to pay the required fee.

Roegge went back yearly, usually with some combination of his two daughters and his wife. Much of the work needed in Haiti became too complicated for the Roegges, but their relationships in the country, including with Jean Baptiste, grew from year to year. He finished his schooling while living with Sam Felix, a Haitian-American pastor who took in six men around Jean Baptiste's age with support from his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., church.

While amenities are in short supply in the country, cellphone service is highly accessible, so Jean Baptiste communicated with the Roegges through WhatsApp.

A few years ago, Roegge asked Stevenson if he'd consider coming to the United States for schooling, and after he received his high school diploma, they began the process of securing his admission to Parkland College and a passport to enter the U.S., a complicated ordeal but one they finished in March of last year.

Last summer, he embarked on his first international flight with Felix by his side.

The difference in every facet of life was massive. Everything from the cooler weather to the buildings to the peace and quiet made it seem like a world away. Sometimes, it was the little things that surprised him the most, like the automatic garage doors.

""For the first few weeks, I said, 'Everything is automatic,'"" he said with a laugh. ""People don't use their hands.""

♦ ♦ ♦

As he sits in the library at Parkland College, a classmate from the Congo approaches Jean Baptiste and asks him for help on the homework due that day. He gladly obliges, pulling out his meticulously completed worksheets on English verb tenses.

Stevenson's life in the United States revolves almost completely around school, although the Roegges are trying to break the quiet 25-year-old out of his shell. He takes the city bus to Parkland in the morning every day and rides it back to the Roegges' house in Urbana in the late afternoon. Then, he holes himself up in his bedroom and studies.

When he was younger, Jean Baptiste wanted to become a doctor because he witnessed a doctor mistreat his patient. He dreamed of running a hospital or even the nation's health system. It was simply his way of wanting to help people.

His goals have shifted. Now, he sees himself as a future businessman who can benefit families back home by providing jobs.

He does find himself at Illinois football tailgates with his new American family and watching Illinois basketball, a game he's grown to love.

And after going from one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the wealthiest, Jean Baptiste's desire to serve still burns. Over his winter and spring breaks, he volunteered at the Salt & Light Ministries Food Pantry where he worked accepting donations.

""Even though I didn't have a chance to receive homeless or poor people and to serve them, I had a chance to receive the donations from other people and it was great to thank them for their donations,"" he said. ""I enjoy it. It's because it's a Christian activity, it's a Christian company.""

Jean Baptiste will have to attend Parkland for an extra year, a curveball that he and the Roegges didn't know they'd have to deal with, because as a non-native English speaker, he's required to take English as a Second Language class for a year before partaking in business studies.

His English isn't perfect — every once in a while he stumbles over a word or tense — but it's vastly improved from the time he arrived.

When he finishes studying business in the United States, Jean Baptiste plans on returning to Haiti. He's already sketching business ideas in a journal with the goal of helping people by employing them. He'll go back for the summer in June when he can begin laying the foundation for his future plans.

""I think that it'll be good for him to see what his thoughts are and how they can materialize into something and talk to people down there and keep that in mind when he comes back and really starts his business classes,"" Roegge said.

The Roegges don't visit Haiti regularly anymore. Instead, they've decided that investing in Stevenson Jean Baptiste is the way they can benefit people in Haiti.

If and when he turns his intentions into actions, their investment will pay off.

""My heart,"" he said, ""is for people.""",Leap of faith: From a chance meeting in Haiti to a home in Urbana,http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2018-05-06/leap-faith-chance-meeting-haiti-home-urbana.html

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR

Honduran Deana Quczada peels back her young daughter's black hair to reveal a deep scar on her forehead. She was beaten, Quczada says, six months ago as part of an apparent revenge attack on her family by gangs that Quczada's husband may have been mixed up with. When her daughter was released after spending a month in the hospital, Quczada immediately fled with her north in hopes of making it to the United States, where she could ask for political asylum.

I've heard that if you ask the U.S. for help, they will give it, she says in Spanish.

Quczada, 36, made it all the way to Tijuana before being turned away by U.S. customs authorities at the San Ysidro border crossing, the busiest port of entry on the U.S. border with Mexico. In recent days, customs officials have told her and dozens of other migrants that the facility was too overwhelmed to begin processing would-be asylum seekers. The Border Patrol has called it a temporary situation. But Quczada is starting to lose hope.

We had no other choice but to come here and we can't go back, Quczada says.

Her family has spent several chilly and drizzly nights sleeping out on the square next to the border crossing. They had an offer to stay with a family friend on the Mexican side, but it's more than two hours from here.

Quczada's is just one of many harrowing personal accounts you hear when you visit the encampment of asylum seekers, most from a highly-publicized recent caravan from Central America. Lately, the small tent city has been transformed into something more akin to a small refugee camp, with volunteers streaming in from both sides of the border to donate clothing, food and other supplies as people wait to hear if they can get into the U.S. to be processed.

Returning home is not an option

While the most recent caravan — there have been others like it in past years — is getting most of the attention from the Trump administration and the media, the fact is there were already many other migrants staying in Tijuana shelters for weeks, some much longer.

One of them is Haitian Jean Stevenson Dorvil, who has been waiting to get in for six months, working the odd job in Tijuana when he can. He spent six additional months just getting here from Venezuela, where he had been living. The journey overland through countries such as Colombia and Guatemala was dangerous at times, he says. Dorvil says he paid $1,000 just to get through Nicaragua.

""Right now it is very difficult to live in Venezuela,"" Dorvil says. Basic things are extremely expensive and jobs are scarce. The situation in Haiti is even more bleak. He says if he is granted permission to live and work in the U.S., his life will improve. There are jobs there, he says.

""I've got my family in Venezuela to help, my family in Haiti to help, every month I send them money,"" Dorvil says.

Like a lot of people here, Dorvil says returning home is not an option.

At last count, humanitarian aid workers here say at least a hundred migrants from the caravan are still waiting on the plaza, and then there are the estimated dozens more like Dorvil who were already here. Since Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials confirm that 28 asylum seekers from the caravan itself have been admitted into the U.S. for processing. Aid groups say some two dozen other migrants have been allowed into a more sheltered foyer at the border crossing so they don't have to camp outside in the cold. Their fate though, like those still outside, is far from certain.

Aid workers and migrants have been under pressure by the Mexican authorities to remove their encampment and go to shelters. Whether police will actually enforce that rule soon is uncertain. One aid worker told NPR that usually migrants are not allowed to camp outside on the streets, but that police weren't moving them due to the presence of all the TV cameras and news crews.

The Trump administration's messaging

Meanwhile, on Monday the Justice Department announced criminal charges against 11 suspected members of the Central American caravan for trying to cross the border illegally a few miles west of the San Ysidro port near the ocean. The arrests began last Friday, and included six migrants from Honduras, two from El Salvador, two from Guatemala and one from Mexico. A number of these migrants were apprehended in larger groups trying to cross the border illegally — groups that included migrants from India, Mexico and other countries. It is unclear whether or not these other migrants were criminally charged.

Immigration attorney Ginger Jacobs in San Diego said the criminal charges against the 11 migrants were ""highly unusual."" Most people apprehended for illegal entry are turned around and expeditiously removed from the U.S., she explained. These criminal charges are part of the Trump administration's messaging, she said. ""They are trying to dissuade future caravaners from attempting to come to the states"" to apply for asylum, Jacobs explained.

At the same time, she questioned whether these migrants were actually part of the caravan. Caravan participants were given extensive training in Mexico by human rights activists on how to apply for asylum, and were told repeatedly that if they tried to enter the U.S. illegally, they would be prosecuted.","In Tijuana, Migrants Seeking Asylum In The U.S. Tell Harrowing Stories Of Crisis",https://www.npr.org/2018/05/02/607726810/in-tijuana-migrants-seeking-asylum-in-the-u-s-tell-harrowing-stories-of-crisis

Haiti is known for many things; its art, its food, its music. But one group of social entrepreneurs are looking to add another category – tech.

Over 500 people came together at the Royal Decameron Indigo Beach Resort & Spa for a two-day technology summit with the hopes of adding another chapter to Haiti’s narrative.

Founded by Christine Souffrant Ntim, the Haiti Tech Summit featured nearly 100 speakers from Facebook, Google, Uber and Airbnb. The reps discussed topics like launching a startup, branding and marketing tips, and more. High-profile attendees included former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, Vicky Jeudy from Orange is the New Black, and Haiti President Jovenel Moise.

“The goal of the summit is to transform the narrative around Haiti’s brand as a nation,” Ntim said. “Over the next 13 years, I want to catapult Haiti forward through innovation, tech and entrepreneurship.

“We know Haiti can actually transform itself, be a new global case study for what happens when you actually get the right influences in the room to transform a nation.”

Although Ntim was met with skepticism about the inaugural event and her ability to pull speakers from the tech space, she did not let that deter her. In the end she prevailed and her proved to her detractors that Haiti was indeed “open for disruption” and her team of millenials is leading the way.",Summit Leads Haiti Disruption in Tech Industry,https://haitiantimes.com/2017/06/30/summit-leads-haiti-disruption-in-tech-industry/

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL – On April 9th, the Brazilian government made the decision to grant priority treatment to Haitians who intend to live in Brazil. The government can now provide temporary visas and residence permits for humanitarian purposes up to two years.

The decree was published in the Official Gazette of the Federal Government and is authorized by the Itamaraty, the Ministries of Justice, Public Security, and Labor. The visa will be issued exclusively by the Brazilian embassy in Haiti’s capital city, Port-au-Prince.

While the visa can only be issued for two years, it can be transformed into an indefinite residence permit after the person has lived in Brazil for a period of two years. The government proclaims that the visa is determined on a humanitarian basis to provide shelter for those in need. The same regulations apply to stateless persons living in Haiti.

The decision was made to clarify details from the enforcement of the Migration Law, which came into effect last year. In a statement, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said that new regulations “can be published in the future to cover concrete situations”.

The Ministry also highlighted that the measure would tighten control of humanitarian policy for Haiti in the field of migration, and can prevent illegal and dangerous routes to Brazil. Since 2012, Brazil has granted over 60,000 visas in an effort to help Haiti rebuild itself after the 2010 earthquake that affected millions of Haitians and destroyed large parts of the country’s infrastructure.

As Brazil expects an increase in Haitian migrants, it will need to address the current lack of public policies, which have already come under criticism since the 2010 earthquake. Brazil is still pulling itself out of recession, and Haitian migrants living in Brazil have previously expressed concern about access to healthcare, education, and the labor market.",Brazilian Government Grants Haitians Humanitarian Visa,http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/brazilian-government-grants-haitians-humanitarian-visa/

(CNN) - Here's a look at cholera, an acute diarrheal illness which kills thousands of people worldwide each year.

Facts: Cholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae.

Dehydration from rapid loss of body fluids is the reason the disease can be so deadly within hours if the patient is not treated.

The disease's short incubation period of two hours to five days increases the likelihood of outbreaks.

Eighty percent of cholera cases can be treated and resolved with oral hydration salts.

There are three, two-dose oral cholera vaccines available, Dukoral, ShanChol and Euvicho, but it may take weeks for an individual to have full protection.

Cholera is rare in industrialized nations.

People who live in areas with poor or inadequate water treatment, sanitation and hygiene practices are more likely to get the disease.

North Jersey residents answered the call to help victims of the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Doctors, nurses, emergency personnel and community activists spent days— and weeks— volunteering to help the injured, homeless and traumatized survivors of the disaster. The following is a sampling of some residents The Record has profiled.

A medical team from Hackensack University Medical Center spent a week in the country, visiting tent hospitals at the airport near Port-au-Prince and in Léogâne, a coastal city about 18 miles west of the capital. Dr. Myrvine Bernadotte, an emergency physician, was joined by registered nurses Jane Burke of Fair Lawn, Maggie Lominy of Haledon and Eamon Daul of Ramsey.

Dr. David Butler, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, is back in North Jersey after spending 10 days treating patients at the Hôpital Sacré Coeur in Milot, Haiti. Butler is also vice president of the non-profit Center for the Rural Development of Milot (Crudem), which built the hospital 20 years ago.

Dr. Timothy Finley of Rochelle Park and Dr. Alan Gwertzman, anesthesiologists at Holy Name, also volunteered for several days at the 73-bed hospital in Milot, about 70 miles north of Port-au-Prince. They administered anesthesia during 30 to 40 operations a day.

To donate to the hospital's relief effort, go to crudem.org

The Rev. Andrew J. Topp of Midland Park, a member of the Gift of Life and Rotary International District 7490, spent an exhausting 16 days after the earthquake in Les Cayes, Haiti, before finally heading home. Topp had been to the city— about 85 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince -- to help build an orphanage for girls when the quake struck. Topp was initially stranded with fellow Rotarian and architect Jeffrey F. Wells of Oradell, who spent five days in the region after the earthquake. Wells and the group helped United Nations workers build a tent city. He was eventually evacuated on a C-17 from Port-au-Prince to McGuire Air Force Base.

Peter Kikot of Oakland, president of the Ridgewood A.M. Rotary Club, flew to Les Cayes two weeks later, delivering goods donated from St. Joseph's Healthcare System in Paterson. Kikot, who volunteered at the orphanage and local hospital and helped to coordinate relief efforts, traveled back to North Jersey and returned to Les Cayes this week. Dr. Karola K. Korallus-Prinz of Ridgewood and Dr. Kee Park of Wayne also spent time with the group in Les Cayes. Between them, they saw about 100 patients a day at the Institut Brenda Strafford, a local hospital.

The Rotary group is now purchasing steel shipping containers to be used as permanent homes for earthquake victims. For information about the efforts of the International Humanitarian Aid Foundation, log onto http://ihaf.us/ and look for Homes for Haiti. The group is based in Midland Park.

The Haitian Civic Organization of Paterson, whose four members had ventured to earthquake-ravaged Haiti to deliver aid donated by North Jerseyans, returned safely after a difficult and emotional journey. But snares in paperwork from the shipping company and red tape in the Dominican Republic, caused a delay in the container's delivery to Haiti.

Cathi Goldfischer and Arlene Keys, emergency room nurses at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, spent an emotionally intense 17 days treating hundreds of wounded victims. The nurses were deployed as part of the NJ-1 Disaster Medical Assistance Team, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For more than two weeks, they slept side by side in sleeping bags among hundreds of medical workers on an open tennis court in Petionville, less than 40 miles outside of Port-au-Prince.

Adryanna Tavares and Nicole Kalinowski, both emergency room nurses at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, along with Dr. Nedal Shami, a Valley emergency physician, worked 16-hour days at a hospital tent at the Port-au-Prince airport, treating dozens of patients for illnesses as well as broken bones and infections that required amputations. Meanwhile, Dr. Edward Kugler and Dr. Khashayar Vosough, both obstetrician gynecologists at Valley, delivered several babies and tended to children in need. The entire group made it safely back to North Jersey.

Dr. Silvio Podda, a plastic surgeon from St. Joseph's Children's Hospital in Paterson, performed about 15 surgeries in Jimani— a town on the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti— for revisions of amputations. He also cared for open fractures and open wounds. After a few days, he met some nuns and traveled to a convent in Les Cayes to care for 25 children who had not been seen by doctors. He returned Sunday night and plans to return to Haiti in May.

Dr. Joshua Hyman, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Children's Hospital, went to Haiti with Project Medishare to help set up a hospital under a series of tents on a field outside Port-au-Prince. Hyman, of Englewood, spent a week performing as many as 50 surgeries a day in the makeshift facility.

Dr. Jennifer Ashton, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, traveled with dozens of medical personnel to treat patients in Port-au-Prince. During her week in the country, Ashton, an Englewood resident who grew up in Tenafly, also reported the conditions as a medical correspondent with CBS News and spent time aboard a U.S. Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, anchored off the coast of Haiti.

Babette Ammerman of River Vale, a registered nurse at Westchester Medical Center, also traveled with the same group as Ashton and spent a week at the hospital at the Port-au-Prince airport. Ammerman and the other emergency personnel slept in tents and worked tireless hours tending to patients, even participating in procedures such as amputations.

Dr. Mark Wade, a pediatrician from Saddle River and founder of Arise and Walk Ministries Foundation, made the long trek from the Dominican Republic to Haiti to deliver medical supplies and establish connections for future trips. During the five-day trip, Wade and members of the Bethel Gospel Assembly in Harlem traveled to Grace Village in Carrefour, a city outside Port-au-Prince, to donate hundreds of pounds of medical and health supplies, including antibiotics, baby wipes and wheelchairs. The group also included Shahar Azran, a photographer from Tenafly; Michael Clark, a videographer from Englewood; and Annalisa Chery, a Haitian-born nurse who once worked at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. Wade is planning more missions to the country.

Emergency Medical Technicians Ryan Flaherty of Upper Saddle River, Matthew Elling of Saddle River and Michael Migliaccio of Ramsey traveled to Haiti with Our Chance International and NOVA Hope for Haiti. The trio treated patients at field clinics and helped with logistics during their two-week stay in the country.

Dr. Manuel Alvarez, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Hackensack University Medical Center, spent five days working with government officials to assess medical needs of Dominican hospitals on the Haitian border and providing medical direction. He plans to return to the country.

Jonathan Cotton of Kinnelon, an emergency room nurse from Chilton Memorial Hospital, traveled to Haiti through the Dominican Republic with a one-way ticket unsure of when he would return. Cotton loaded food onto trucks in the Dominican Republic bound for Haiti for the Children's Hunger Fund and brought medical supplies. He planned to travel to the Baptist Haiti Mission, which operates a hospital in the mountains outside Port-au-Prince.

A group of 14 doctors and nurses from around New Jersey, including Rose Cabot, a nurse from Norwood, spent eight days delivering babies, performing surgeries and administering triage care. The group, which calls itself Love for Haiti, plans to return March 3, Cabot said. ""There was no time to cry,"" she said. ""The people were walking around with empty looks on their faces as if they knew life wasn't going to get any better. It was rough. We were hanging IVs from tree branches."" On their return trip, they will bring an engineer and an architect to assess the needs for rebuilding the community.

22,haiti,"There are so many Mounties needed to process illegal border crossings in rural Quebec that the federal government is now spending $250,000 to build an unofficial police station on the U.S. border. In Toronto last week, Mayor John Tory announced that the number of refugee claimants in the city’s shelter system has quadrupled from 459 per night in 2016 to an average of 2,351 in 2018. And at least one Quebec politician is calling for a border fence with the U.S.

These are just some of the repercussions of the more than 20,000 illegal border crossings into Canada since early 2017, all of them made by foreign nationals seeking asylum. With the influx expected to grow even bigger this summer, here are the details of Canada’s ongoing migrant crisis.

Illegal border crossers are outpacing conventional refugees for the first time

In the first three months of 2018, 5,052 asylum seekers were intercepted by the RCMP after illegally crossing the Canadian border, compared to 4,475 people who filed refugee claims through conventional channels such as airports and official border stations. In other words, for the first time there are more people illegally seeking asylum in Canada than making legal refugee claims — and that trend is set to continue throughout 2018.

In 2017, the Immigration and Refugee Board received at least 18,149 claims from what they call “irregular border crossers” — those who claimed asylum after first entering Canada illegally. This was compared to 29,276 people who applied for refugee status through legal channels. But with the rate of illegal crossings already double what it was in 2017, the “illegal” category is poised to blow past the “legal” category.

The RCMP intercepted 1,890 illegal border crossers in the first three months of 2017. In the same period in 2018, that number soared to 5,052. Over the Easter Weekend alone, more than 600 crossed into Quebec, and provincial officials are expecting more than 400 per day as the weather gets warmer. Much of this activity is in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Que., where it’s particularly easy to cross over from Champlain, New York.

These are “illegal” border crossings, but Canadian law does not view the border crossers as criminals

When the migrant crisis has been discussed in the House of Commons, it has often been accompanied by robust argument over the use of the term “illegal migrant.” The Conservatives use the term, while the Liberals and the NDP prefer the term “irregular migrants” (and accuse the Tories of fear-mongering). It is illegal to cross into Canada without first passing through a port of entry. Indeed, any border-crosser at Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle will pass by a bilingual sign saying “it is illegal to cross the border here” — and they will also be told as much by the area’s substantial police presence. However, while someone can be charged for entering Canada without authorization, those charges are waived once someone makes an asylum claim.

By any measure, the backlog is out of control

Well before the first day of summer, the number of asylum seekers who entered Canada illegally will surpass the 25,000 Syrian refugees accepted into the country in 2016. These border crossings — coupled with rising rates of refugee claims across the board — are putting an unsustainable strain on the country’s refugee system. At the beginning of 2017, the Immigration and Refugee Board counted a total queue of 18,644 refugee claimants. As of March 31, this has more than doubled to 48,974.

Even if refugee claims stopped tomorrow, this would be a daunting number, given that the Immigration and Refugee Board can only process about 1000 to 2,000 cases per month. And the claims keep coming. In March, the board was able to finalize a then-record 2,587 claims, but this was dwarfed by the 4,078 new refugee claims that piled up in the same month.

The backlog is complicated even further by the fact that illegal border crossers are already in the country when they file refugee claims. If Canada rejects an overseas immigrant, the decision is final. For a refugee claimant on Canadian soil, meanwhile, rejections are subject to a lengthy process of appeals, removal orders and, in extreme cases, Canada-wide arrest warrants.

The Conservatives claim that a single Trudeau tweet started this (and they might have a point)

In January last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, “to those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.” It was a direct response to U.S. president Donald Trump’s so-called “travel ban,” an executive order banning all travel from seven countries with large Muslim populations. Trudeau’s post has received 412,000 retweets to date, making it one of the most circulated tweets of 2017. In a recent House of Commons speech, Conservative public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus called the tweet “the root of” illegal border crossings. And the data seems to back him up. The month before the Tweet, the RCMP intercepted 315 illegal border-crossers. The next month that doubled to 678 — and kept climbing until it reached a peak of 5,712 by August, 2017.

Emails obtained by the National Post also revealed that the tweet caused widespread confusion among Canadian diplomatic officials as they were deluged with inquiries. “We are receiving an increasing number of enquiries from the public about requesting refugee status in Canada, and a number clearly having links with our Prime Minister’s tweet this weekend,” wrote one diplomat stationed at Canada’s Mexican embassy.

Much of this is arguably happening due to an easily patched legal loophole

Canada faced its last major wave of migrants from the United States in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. This prompted the government of Jean Chretien to draw up the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States. This agreement holds that any non-American seeking refugee protection at the U.S./Canada border must have first filed a refugee claim with the Americans. Thus, it effectively allows guards at Canadian land borders to turn away most asylum seekers on the grounds that they are already in a safe country. There’s just one problem: The agreement only refers to refugee claims made at a “port of entry.” Thus, if someone slips past a port of entry and enters Canada illegally in order to make an inland asylum claim, the agreement doesn’t apply.

As Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel has pointed out, however, the agreement gives Canada’s Minister of Immigration a wide berth to decide what constitutes a “port of entry.” Were Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen to declare the entire Canadian border a port of entry, officials could turn away many over-land asylum claimants from the United States without passing their claims on to the Immigrant and Refugee Board.

It’s unlikely illegal crossings will stop on their own

When the wave of border-crossing began in early 2017, the migrants were reported to be mostly Haitians fearing deportation from the U.S. after Trump announced the end of temporary amnesty enacted in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Recently, the demographics have changed and border-crossers are now predominantly Nigerian. What’s more, most appear to be entering the United States on recently acquired tourist visas for the sole purpose of slipping into Canada. “They land in the United States, where they stay for a very short period of time, and then make their way to Canada,” Hursh Jaswal, communications director for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, told the Canadian Press.

Once an asylum seeker is deemed to be a refugee claimant, they are able to obtain work permits, as well as access to Canadian healthcare, public schools and even social assistance. It’s unknown how many border-crossers will be deemed true refugees, but considering the millions of Mexicans who have crossed the Rio Grande for far less, it’s easy to see to why economic factors might keep thousands of people streaming through southern Quebec. Illegally crossing the border is also quicker than legal refugee channels. Currently, even a sponsored refugee from Ethiopia faces a wait time of at least five years. For Indians, it’s seven years.

If the backlog keeps up, border-crossers could conceivably be facing “de facto amnesty”

From a technical standpoint, many of the folks crossing at Champlain, N.Y., are not particularly strong candidates for refugee status. According to the federal government, the refugee system is meant to protect people who face death, “danger of torture” or cruel and unusual punishment if they return to their home country. Some claimants from Haiti and Nigeria will fit that description, such as gay men or those from places threatened by Boko Haram. But unlike Syria or Afghanistan, neither country fits the criteria for a war zone. Of the 2,552 claims from illegal border crossers that were finalized in 2017, only 53 per cent were accepted as refugees. The federal government even dispatched Haitian-born MP Emmanuel Dubourg to Miami to tell Haitians directly that most of them will be deported if they try to cross into Canada. But as the backlog piles up, it is taking longer and longer to process refugee claims. In October the wait time was 16 months. In February, it was 20 months. According to an internal report from the Immigrant and Refugee Board, if current rates of border crossing continue, the wait could be as long as 11 years by 2021. A 19-year-old crossing the border could be 30 with three kids by the time he ever has to make his case for staying in Canada. “Realistically, if it’s going to take 10 years to get a refugee hearing … you’ve almost got de facto amnesty,” said Raj Sharma, a Calgary-based immigration lawyer and former refugee protection officer.
